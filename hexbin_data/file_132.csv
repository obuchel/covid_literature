277,Willingness of Hong Kong healthcare workers to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination at different WHO alert levels: two questionnaire surveys,2009-08-25,"Objective To assess the acceptability of pre-pandemic influenza vaccination among healthcare workers in public hospitals in Hong Kong and the effect of escalation in the World Health Organization’s alert level for an influenza pandemic. Design Repeated cross sectional studies using self administered, anonymous questionnaires Setting Surveys at 31 hospital departments of internal medicine, paediatrics, and emergency medicine under the Hong Kong Hospital Authority from January to March 2009 and in May 2009 Participants 2255 healthcare workers completed the questionnaires in the two studies. They were doctors, nurses, or allied health professionals working in the public hospital system. Main outcome measures Stated willingness to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination (influenza A subtypes H5N1 or H1N1) and its associating factors. Results The overall willingness to accept pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine was only 28.4% in the first survey, conducted at WHO influenza pandemic alert phase 3. No significant changes in the level of willingness to accept pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine were observed despite the escalation to alert phase 5. The willingness to accept pre-pandemic H1N1 vaccine was 47.9% among healthcare workers when the WHO alert level was at phase 5. The most common reasons for an intention to accept were “wish to be protected” and “following health authority’s advice.” The major barriers identified were fear of side effects and doubts about efficacy. More than half of the respondents thought nurses should be the first priority group to receive the vaccines. The strongest positive associating factors were history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived risk of contracting the infection. Conclusions The willingness to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination was low, and no significant effect was observed with the change in WHO alert level. Further studies are required to elucidate the root cause of the low intention to accept pre-pandemic vaccination.","Chor, Josette S Y; Ngai, Karry LK; Goggins, William B; Wong, Martin C S; Wong, Samuel Y S; Lee, Nelson; Leung, Ting-fan; Rainer, Timothy H; Griffiths, Sian; Chan, Paul K S",BMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2731837/,132
5139,“Disease-Breeders” Among Us: Deconstructing Race and Ethnicity as Risk Factors of Immigrant Ill Health,2009-07-11,"BACKGROUND: Aldosterone induces inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney, while nuclear factor κB (NFκB) plays key roles in inflammation mediated by various cytokines. Here, we determined the roles of NFκB activation in aldosterone-induced kidney injury. METHODS: We used unilaterally nephrectomized rats with or without continuous aldosterone infusion and 0.9% saline as drinking water for 3 weeks. IMD-1041, an IKKβ inhibitor, and spironolactone were orally administered to inhibit NFκB and mineralocorticoid receptor, respectively. RESULTS: The aldosterone-infused rats exhibited severe kidney injury, hypertension, and increased expression of pro-inflammatory and fibrotic proteins, osteopontin, fibrinogen, collagen type I, and PAI-1. Western blotting confirmed NFκB activation by aldosterone by the increased amount of p65 in the nuclear fraction of the kidney, and oral IMD-1041 prevented the kidney injury and lessened the increase in pro-inflammatory and fibrotic proteins without significant changes in blood pressures. In addition, changes in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been found to act as a protective factor in various kidney injury models, were examined. Immunofluorescence studies revealed the presence of ACE2 in the brush-border membrane of the proximal convoluted tubules and markedly blunted ACE2 staining in aldosterone-infused rats. The decrease in amount of ACE2 protein was confirmed by Western blotting, and IMD-1041 also prevented the decrease in ACE2. The administration of spironolactone also abolished the effects of aldosterone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that aldosterone induces kidney injury via activation of NFκB and mineralocorticoid receptor, and that decreased ACE2 expression may play an important role in aldosterone-induced kidney injury.","Fukuda, Seiichi; Horimai, Chihiro; Harada, Kaori; Wakamatsu, Toshifumi; Fukasawa, Hiroshi; Muto, Susumu; Itai, Akiko; Hayashi, Matsuhiko",Clin Exp Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087855/,132

11414,2019 HRS/EHRA/APHRS/LAHRS expert consensus statement on catheter ablation of ventricular arrhythmias,2020-01-27,"Most vaccines are so effective that they could lead to the control/elimination of the diseases they target and directly impact on intensive care admissions or complications. This is best illustrated by the use of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, zoster, yellow fever, Ebola virus, influenza or measles—but also by third party strategies such as maternal, toddler and care-giver immunization. However, each of these vaccine-induced protection is threatened by insufficient vaccine uptake. Here, we briefly discuss how vaccine hesitancy has led to the resurgence of diseases that were considered as controlled and explore the effect of vaccine-hesitant healthcare workers on nosocomial infections. As intensive care physicians are in charge of polymorbid patients, we briefly summarize the current recommendations for vaccinations in high-risk patients. We finally give some perspective on ongoing research, and discuss how institutional policies and intensive care physicians could play a role in increasing the impact of vaccination, overall and in intensive care units.","Pittet, Laure F.; Abbas, Mohamed; Siegrist, Claire-Anne; Pittet, Didier",Intensive Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223872/,132
12086,Protective role of neuronal and lymphoid cannabinoid CB(2) receptors in neuropathic pain,2020-07-20,"BACKGROUND: Lysin motif (LysM)-containing proteins are involved in the recognition of fungal and bacterial pathogens. However, few studies have reported on their roles in the defense responses of woody plants against pathogens. A previous study reported that the apple MdCERK1 gene was induced by chitin and Rhizoctonia solani, and its protein can bind to chitin. However, its effect on defense responses has not been investigated. RESULTS: In this study, a new apple CERK gene, designated as MdCERK1–2, was identified. It encodes a protein that shares high sequence identity with the previously reported MdCERK1 and AtCERK1. Its chitin binding ability and subcellular location are similar to MdCERK1 and AtCERK1, suggesting that MdCERK1–2 may play a role in apple immune defense responses as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR). MdCERK1–2 expression in apple was induced by 2 fungal pathogens, Botryosphaeria dothidea and Glomerella cingulate, but not by the bacterial pathogen, Erwinia amylovora, indicating that MdCERK1–2 is involved in apple anti-fungal defense responses. Further functional analysis by heterologous overexpression (OE) in Nicotiana benthamiana (Nb) demonstrated that MdCERK1–2 OE improved Nb resistance to the pathogenic fungus, Alternaria alternata. H(2)O(2) accumulation and callose deposition increased after A. alternata infection in MdCERK1–2 OE plants compared to wild type (WT) and empty vector (EV)-transformed plants. The induced expression of NbPAL4 by A. alternata significantly (p < 0.01, n = 4) increased in MdCERK1–2 OE plants. Other tested genes, including NbNPR1, NbPR1a, NbERF1, and NbLOX1, did not exhibit significant changes after A. alternata infection in OE plants compared to EV or WT plants. OE plants also accumulated more polyphenols after A. alternata infection. CONCLUSIONS: Heterologous MdCERK1–2 OE affects multiple defense responses in Nb plants and increased their resistance to fungal pathogens. This result also suggests that MdCERK1–2 is involved in apple defense responses against pathogenic fungi.","Chen, Qiming; Dong, Chaohua; Sun, Xiaohong; Zhang, Yugang; Dai, Hongyi; Bai, Suhua",BMC Plant Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7386173/,132
12168,Decreasing the Duration of Discharge Antibiotic Treatment Following Inpatient Skin and Soft Tissue Abscess Drainage,2020-02-15,"Acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) are characterized by an inflammatory response, alveolar edema, and hypoxemia. ARDS occurs most often in the settings of pneumonia, sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, or severe trauma. The prevalence of ARDS is approximately 10% in patients of intensive care. There is no effective remedy with mortality high at 30–40%. Most functional proteins are dynamic and stringently governed by ubiquitin proteasomal degradation. Protein ubiquitination is reversible, the covalently attached monoubiquitin or polyubiquitin moieties within the targeted protein can be removed by a group of enzymes called deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Deubiquitination plays an important role in the pathobiology of ALI/ARDS as it regulates proteins critical in engagement of the alveolo-capillary barrier and in the inflammatory response. In this review, we provide an overview of how DUBs emerge in pathogen-induced pulmonary inflammation and related aspects in ALI/ARDS. Better understanding of deubiquitination-relatedsignaling may lead to novel therapeutic approaches by targeting specific elements of the deubiquitination pathways.","Li, Tiao; Zou, Chunbin",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7402294/,132

15762,POINT: Tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19. Should we do it before 14 days? Yes.,2021-02-27,"BACKGROUND: Although periods of HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) discontinuation have deleterious health effects, ART is not always sustained. Yet, little is known about factors that contribute to such ART non-persistence among long-term HIV survivors. The present study applied a convergent parallel mixed-methods design to explore the phenomena of stopping/starting and sustaining ART, focusing on low-socioeconomic status African American or Black and Latino persons living with HIV (PLWH) who face the greatest challenges. METHODS: Participants (N = 512) had poor engagement in HIV care and detectable HIV viral load. All received structured assessments and N = 48 were randomly selected for in-depth interviews. Quantitative analysis using negative binomial regression uncovered associations among multi-level factors and the number of times ART was stopped/started and the longest duration of sustained ART. Qualitative data were analyzed using a directed content analysis approach and results were integrated. RESULTS: Participants were diagnosed 18.2 years ago on average (SD = 8.6), started ART a median five times (Q1 = 3, Q3 = 10), and the median longest duration of sustained ART was 18 months (Q1 = 6, Q3 = 36). Factors associated with higher rates of stops/starts were male sex, transgender identity, cannabis use at moderate-to-high-risk levels, and ART- and care-related stigma. Factors associated with lower rates of stops/starts were older age, more years since diagnosis, motivation for care, and lifetime injection drug use (IDU). Factors associated with longer durations of sustained ART were Latino/Hispanic ethnicity, motivation for ART and care, and recent IDU. Factors associated with a shorter duration were African American/Black race, alcohol use at moderate-to-high-risk levels, and social support. Qualitative results uncovered a convergence of intersecting risk factors for stopping/starting ART and challenges inherent in managing HIV over decades in the context of poverty. These included unstable housing, which contributed to social isolation, mental health distress, and substance use concerns, the latter prompting selling (“diverting”) ART. Primarily complementary quantitative and qualitative findings described mechanisms by which risk/protective factors operated and ways PLWH successfully restart and/or sustain ART. CONCLUSIONS: The field focuses substantially on ART adherence, but greater attention to reducing the frequency of ART non-persistence is needed, along with creating social/structural conditions favorable for sustained ART.

Due to their flexibility and the wide variety of materials that can be used as a source, these devices show promise for applications in many fields including energy, environment and sensing. Microbial electrochemical systems rely on the integration of microbial cells, bioelectrochemistry, material science and electrochemical technologies to achieve effective conversion of the chemical energy stored in organic materials into electrical power. Therefore, the interaction between microorganisms and electrodes and their operation at physiological important potentials are critical for their development. This article provides an overview of the principles and applications of microbial electrochemical systems, their development status and potential for implementation in the biosensing field. It also provides a discussion of the recent developments in the selection of electrode materials to improve electron transfer using nanomaterials along with challenges for achieving practical implementation, and examples of applications in the biosensing field.","Hassan, Rabeay Y.A.; Febbraio, Ferdinando; Andreescu, Silvana",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7916843/,132
16532,"Seasonal and daytime variation in multiple immune parameters in humans: Evidence from 329,261 participants of the UK Biobank cohort",2021-03-01,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a systemic disease that is implicated in multiple extrahepatic organ dysfunction contributing to its protean manifestations. HCV is associated with diverse extrahepatic disorders including atherosclerosis, glucose and lipid metabolic disturbances, alterations in the iron metabolic pathways, and lymphoproliferative diseases over and above the traditional liver manifestations of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The orchestration between HCV major proteins and the liver-muscle-adipose axis, poses a major burden on the global health of human body organs, if not adequately addressed. The close and inseparable associations between chronic HCV infection, metabolic disease, and cardiovascular disorders are specifically important considering the increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic syndrome, and their economic burden to patients, the healthcare systems, and society. Cellular and molecular mechanisms governing the interplay of these organs and tissues in health and disease are therefore of significant interest. The coexistence of metabolic disorders and chronic hepatitis C infection also enhances the progression to liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The presence of metabolic disorders is believed to influence the chronicity and virulence of HCV leading to liver disease progression. This comprehensive review highlights current knowledge on the metabolic manifestations of hepatitis C and the potential pathways in which these metabolic changes can influence the natural history of the disease.","Chaudhari, Rahul; Fouda, Sherouk; Sainu, Ashik; Pappachan, Joseph M",World J Gastroenterol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8015302/,132

18615,The Prevalence of Overweight and Obesity Among Women in Jordan: A Risk Factor for Developing Chronic Diseases,2021-06-22,"Background: Previous UK Biobank studies showed that symptoms and physical measurements had excellent prediction on long-term clinical outcomes in general population. Symptoms and signs could intuitively and non-invasively predict and monitor disease progression, especially for telemedicine, but related research is limited in diabetes and renal medicine. Methods: This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the predictive power of a symptom-based stratification framework and individual symptoms for diabetes. Three hundred two adult diabetic patients were consecutively sampled from outpatient clinics in Hong Kong for prospective symptom assessment. Demographics and longitudinal measures of biochemical parameters were retrospectively extracted from linked medical records. The association between estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (independent variable) and biochemistry, epidemiological factors, and individual symptoms was assessed by mixed regression analyses. A symptom-based stratification framework of diabetes using symptom clusters was formulated by Delphi consensus method. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were compared between statistical models with different combinations of biochemical, epidemiological, and symptom variables. Results: In the 4.2-year follow-up period, baseline presentation of edema (−1.8 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: −2.5 to −1.2, p < 0.001), epigastric bloating (−0.8 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: −1.4 to −0.2, p = 0.014) and alternating dry and loose stool (−1.1 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: −1.9 to −0.4, p = 0.004) were independently associated with faster annual GFR decline. Eleven symptom clusters were identified from literature, stratifying diabetes predominantly by gastrointestinal phenotypes. Using symptom clusters synchronized by Delphi consensus as the independent variable in statistical models reduced complexity and improved explanatory power when compared to using individual symptoms. Symptom-biologic-epidemiologic combined model had the lowest AIC (4,478 vs. 5,824 vs. 4,966 vs. 7,926) and BIC (4,597 vs. 5,870 vs. 5,065 vs. 8,026) compared to the symptom, symptom-epidemiologic and biologic-epidemiologic models, respectively. Patients co-presenting with a constellation of fatigue, malaise, dry mouth, and dry throat were independently associated with faster annual GFR decline (−1.1 ml/min/1.73m(2), 95%CI: −1.9 to −0.2, p = 0.011). Conclusions: Add-on symptom-based diagnosis improves the predictive power on renal function decline among diabetic patients based on key biochemical and epidemiological factors. Dynamic change of symptoms should be considered in clinical practice and research design.","Chan, Kam Wa; Chow, Tak Yee; Yu, Kam Yan; Xu, Yulong; Zhang, Nevin Lianwen; Wong, Vivian Taam; Li, Saimei; Tang, Sydney Chi Wai",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8236588/,132
22083,The Application Value of MRI in the Training and Physical Rehabilitation of Gastrocnemius with Acute Sports Injury,2021-09-28,"BACKGROUND: Characterization of populations at risk of acquiring HIV is required to inform the public health response to HIV. To identify potential changing needs in HIV prevention and care cascade, we aim to describe how the demographic profiles and exposure categories of newly diagnosed HIV positive individuals attending a large sexual health clinic in Montréal (Canada) evolved since the beginning of the antiretroviral therapy era in the mid-1990s. METHODS: Using diagnosis data from participants of the Clinique médicale l’Actuel cohort of HIV-positive patients, we examined the distribution of exposure categories (sexual orientation, sexual behaviours, injection drug use, being born in an HIV-endemic country) by gender and year of diagnosis. Time trends in mean age and in the proportion of patients with late (CD4 <350 cells/μL) or advanced stage (CD4 <200 cells/μL) of HIV infection at diagnosis were assessed through meta-regressions. RESULTS: A total of 2,612 patients diagnosed with HIV between January 1(st), 1995 and December 31(st), 2019 were included. Overall, mean age was 35 years (standard deviation: 10 years) and remained stable over time. The proportion of patients with advanced stage of HIV infection decreased from 16% in 1995 to 4% in 2019. Although men who have sex with men (MSM) consistently accounted for the highest proportion of new diagnoses (77%, 2,022/2,612 overall), their proportion decreased since 2013. There was also a concomitant decrease in the proportion of people who inject drugs, with none of the newly diagnosed participants reporting injection drug use since 2017, and an important increase in the proportion of patients born in an HIV-endemic country (24%, 7/29 in 2019), especially among women. Compared to patients from non-endemic countries, those from HIV-endemic countries were characterized by higher proportions of heterosexuals (88% vs 17%) and of women (52% vs 7%), and were twice likely to get diagnosed at an advanced stage of HIV infection (32% vs 15%). CONCLUSIONS: In absolute numbers, MSM continue to account for the largest exposure category. However, patients from HIV-endemic countries, who tend to be diagnosed at later stages of HIV infection, constitute an increasing proportion of newly diagnosed individuals. These persons could face distinct barriers to rapid diagnosis. Tailoring HIV testing strategies and other prevention interventions to the specific unmet prevention needs of these individuals is warranted.","Giguère, Katia; Vaziri, Maliheh; Olivier, Clément; Charest, Louise; Szabo, Jason; Thomas, Réjean; Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496787/,132

In this study, we propose two algorithms for wellbeing-prediction from such time series, and we compare their performance on the users of a pilot study on diabetic patients - with time series length varying between 8 and 87 recordings. Our first approach learns a model from the few users, on which many recordings are available, and applies this model to predict the 2nd, 3rd, and so forth recording of users newly joining the mHealth platform. Our second approach rather exploits the similarity among the first few recordings of newly arriving users. Our results for the first approach indicate that the target variable for users who use the app for long are not predictive for users who use the app only for a short time. Our results for the second approach indicate that few initial recordings suffice to inform the predictive model and improve performance considerably.","Unnikrishnan, Vishnu; Shah, Yash; Schleicher, Miro; Strandzheva, Mirela; Dimitrov, Plamen; Velikova, Doroteya; Pryss, Ruediger; Schobel, Johannes; Schlee, Winfried; Spiliopoulou, Myra",Discovery Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7556387/,132

43603,Advanced Glycation End Products (AGE) and Soluble Forms of AGE Receptor: Emerging Role as Mortality Risk Factors in CKD,2020-12-21,"INTRODUCTION: Port State Control (PSC) is a vital element of sustainable maritime transportation. Inspections of PSC regimes have been ensuring the continuity of the global supply chain as they enforce shipping to implement the maritime regulations to be safe, secure, and environmentally friendly. OBJECTIVE: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the number of onboard ship inspections has decreased inherently for protecting PSC officersand seafarers, while PSC regimes have developed a policy to focus on a high-risk ship based on historical inspection records. In this context, planning for a “new normal” in maritime transportation, it is essential to realize the change in ship inspection numbers and the trend of deficiency - detention factors for the maritime sector to provide current standards. This study aims to present the difference in ship inspection trends between 2017-2020 by focusing on COVID-19 pandemic outbreak data. METHODS: Comparative analysis with Paris MOU ship inspection & detention figures and entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis has been used as a methodology to reveal the change in inspection trends after COVID-19. RESULTS: After the pandemic outbreak caused by COVID-19, the number of ship inspections under Paris MOU fell dramatically, however, inspection and detention rate remained the same, also entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis indicates that detention remarks have also changed compared to last year deficiencies. Detention caused by nautical publication and cleanliness in the engine room has an increasing trend on detentions. CONCLUSION: Inspection statistics indicate consistent figures even during the pandemic outbreak, which indicates the current sample group for Paris MOU inspection is healthy. At the same time, entropy-based Grey Relevance Analysis presents a broader insight that the inspection trend on detention deficiencies has varied. Familiarization with the changing trends in inspections will cause fewer detentions of the ships.

44976,"Lactate dehydrogenase, COVID-19 and mortality",2021-01-10,"Although there is ample evidence from cross-sectional studies indicating cognitive deficits in high schizotypal individuals that resemble the cognitive profile of schizophrenia-spectrum patients, there is still lack of evidence by longitudinal/follow-up studies. The present study included assessments of schizotypal traits and a wide range of cognitive functions at two time points (baseline and 4-years assessments) in order to examine (a) their stability over time, (b) the predictive value of baseline schizotypy on cognition at follow-up and (c) differences in cognition between the two time points in high negative schizotypal and control individuals. Only high negative schizotypal individuals were compared with controls due to the limited number of participants falling in the other schizotypal groups at follow-up. Seventy participants (mean age: 36.17; 70% females) were assessed at baseline and follow-up. Schizotypal traits were evaluated with the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire. We found that schizotypal traits decreased over time, except in a sub-group of participants (“schizotypy congruent”) that includes individuals who consistently meet normative criteria of inclusion in either a schizotypal or control group. In these individuals, negative schizotypy and aspects of cognitive-perceptual and disorganized schizotypy remained stable. The stability of cognitive functioning also varied over time: response inhibition, aspects of cued attention switching, set-shifting and phonemic/semantic verbal fluency improved at follow-up. High negative schizotypy at baseline predicted poorer response inhibition and semantic switching at follow-up while high disorganized schizotypy predicted poorer semantic processing and complex processing speed/set-shifting. The between-group analyses revealed that response inhibition, set-shifting and complex processing speed/set-shifting were poorer in negative schizotypals compared with controls at both time points, while maintaining set and semantic switching were poorer only at follow-up. Taken together, the findings show differential stability of the schizotypal traits over time and indicate that different aspects of schizotypy predict a different pattern of neuropsychological task performance during a 4-years time window. These results are of significant use in the formulation of targeted early-intervention strategies for high-risk populations.","Karamaouna, Penny; Zouraraki, Chrysoula; Giakoumaki, Stella G.",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7820122/,132
45034,Predicting mortality rate and associated risks in COVID-19 patients,2021-01-26,"BACKGROUND: Gut ischemia and hypoxia post severe burn leads to breakdown of intestinal epithelial barrier and enteric bacterial translocation (EBT), resulting in serious complications, such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome, sepsis and multiple organ failure. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is known to be downregulated by hypoxia and modulate junctional complexes, which are crucial structures maintaining the intestinal barrier. This study aimed to investigate whether CFTR plays a role in both regulating the intestinal barrier and mediating EBT post severe burn, as well as the signaling pathways involved in these processes. METHODS: An in vitro Caco-2 cell model subjected to hypoxic injury and an in vivo mouse model with a 30% total body surface area full-thickness dermal burn were established. DF 508 mice (mice with F508del CFTR gene mutation) were used as an in vivo model to further demonstrate the role of CFTR in maintaining normal intestinal barrier function. QRT-PCR, western blot, ELISA, TER assay and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect the expression and localization of CFTR and tight junction proteins, as well as the function of tight junctions. RESULTS: Our data indicated that, in Caco-2 cells, the hypoxia condition significantly reduced CFTR expression; activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and nuclear factor-κB signaling; elevated secretion of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-8); downregulated zonula occludens-1, occludin and E-cadherin expression; decreased transepithelial electrical resistance values; and led to a cellular mislocation of ZO-1. More importantly, knockdown of CFTR caused similar alterations. The upregulation of inflammatory factors and downregulation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin) induced by knockdown of CFTR could be reversed by specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase or nuclear factor-κB inhibition. In support of the in vitro data, exuberant secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and EBT was observed in the intestine of severely burnt mice in vivo. EBT occurred in DF508 mice (mice with the F508del CFTR gene mutation), accompanied by augmented tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β and interleukin-8 levels in the ileum compared to wildtype mice. In addition, vitamin D3 was shown to protect the intestinal epithelial barrier from hypoxic injury. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the present study illustrated that CFTR and downstream signaling were critical in modulating the intestinal epithelial junction and EBT post severe burn.","Liu, Xinzhu; Chen, Yu; You, Bo; Peng, Yuan; Chen, Yajie; Yang, Zichen; Zhang, Yixin; Chen, Jing",Burns Trauma,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7809362/,132
45274,Analysis and design of emergency field isolation hospital building using innovative rapidly construction prefabricated units to treat patients infected with COVID-19,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND: Small for gestational age (SGA) infants have an increased risk for neonatal mortality and morbidities. However, few studies have examined the risk of large for gestational age (LGA) on these factors. We compared the risk of mortality and morbidities in LGA premature infants with those of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. METHODS: Premature infants who were born between 2003 and 2012 at <26 weeks of gestational age were included. Relative risks of mortality and morbidities were evaluated between LGA and AGA infants. RESULTS: From 6898 extremely premature infants, 357 (5.2%), 5530 (80.2%), and 1011 (14.7%) were LGA, AGA, and SGA, respectively. A total of 5887 infants (5530 AGA and 357 LGA) were examined after excluding infants with congenital anomalies, unknown sex, and deficient data. The risk of mortality in LGA and AGA infants did not differ (relative risk (95% confidence interval) 1.04 (0.83–1.32)). Compared to AGA infants, LGA infants did not increase the risk of morbidities, including intraventricular hemorrhage, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, treated retinopathy of prematurity, necrotizing enterocolitis, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that being born LGA does not correlate with an increased risk of mortality and morbidities in extremely premature infants. IMPACT: It is currently unknown if being large for gestational age is a risk for neonatal morbidity. A total of 6898 preterm infants born <26 weeks gestational age were included in the study. It was found that being large for gestational age was not related to increased risk of mortality and morbidities.","Ozawa, Junichi; Tanaka, Kosuke; Kabe, Kazuhiko; Namba, Fumihiko",Pediatr Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838861/,132

Despite the significant number of developed methods for the determination and study of viral particles, their practical use is difficult due to the complexity and a small number of existing measuring instruments. In addition, in a number of devices, there is a high proportion of manual operations that require highly qualified staff. Therefore, the problem of the development of new rapid methods for diagnosing viruses that allow getting accurate results in a short time in automatic mode is urgent. Instrumentation implementation of these methods should ensure high accuracy of measurements. One of the most sought-after areas is the development of fast and sensitive methods for determining viruses based on methods of electrophysical analysis. These methods can significantly reduce the analysis time and simplify the preparation of the investigated materials. The chapter provides a brief overview of modern biosensor methods for the virus’s detection.","Guliy, Olga I.; Zaitsev, Boris D.; Borodina, Irina A.","Macro, Micro, and Nano-Biosensors",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7979073/,132
50848,A11 RISK PERCEPTION AND KNOWLEDGE OF COVID-19 IN PATIENTS WITH CELIAC DISEASE,2021-03-04,"BACKGROUND: Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common condition with considerable morbidity and mortality; it is more often diagnosed post-mortem by pathologists than in vivo by clinicians. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is difficult because PE may be clinically silent, the symptoms are vague and nonspecific, and in addition, there is no definitive, non-invasive diagnostic test to establish its diagnosis. The aim of this study is to assess the reliability of detection of acute central and peripheral pulmonary embolism (PE) on non-contrast CT especially when no possible alternative is available as in allergic cases or emergency, patients with history of renal disease, or in cases where PE is not the leading diagnosis. CT pulmonary angiography study served as our gold standard. RESULTS: Eighty adult patients were included in our study; 44 were females and 36 males most of which were complaining of dyspnea and chest pain. Acute central pulmonary embolism was confirmed by CTPA. They all underwent a pre-contrast study just prior to the CTPA. Presence of high attenuation emboli in any of the main pulmonary vessels was our key for diagnosis of acute embolism. Non-contrast CT chest diagnosed 26 of the 47 cases confirmed by CTPA. The hyperdense lumen sign had an overall sensitivity of 55.3%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 100%, and negative predictive value of 61.1%. The accuracy of non-contrast CT chest study was evaluated using CTPA as our gold standard. CONCLUSION: Non-contrast CT chest is a good indicator in predicting central and peripheral pulmonary embolism, particularly in cases of emergency, those unable to take intravenous contrast for angiography, or in cases where pulmonary embolism is not the leading diagnosis.","Hassan, Hend Galal Eldeen Mohamed Ali; Khater, Nivan Hany; Elia, Remon Zaher",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993068/,132

It is unclear however whether this is associated with limited health literacy of patients. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to explore the health literacy of patients with nonurgent conditions in an ED, compare it with the health literacy of the general population and identify relationships between health literacy and patients’ views on emergency care. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 448 patients with nonurgent conditions participated in a cross-sectional survey in the ED of a German university hospital. RESULTS: The study shows that health literacy of nonurgent emergency patients is significantly lower than the health literacy of the German population. Patients with lower levels of health literacy perceive higher treatment urgency, are significantly less informed about treatment options other than the ED and are more likely to visit the ED or the outpatient walk-in practice for a second opinion after having seen their general practitioner. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a need for action to improve health literacy in Germany. In particular, current structural changes in emergency care in Germany have to be considered.","Wehler, Markus; Kalch, Anja; Bilandzic, Helena; Händl, Thomas",Notf Rett Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7993414/,132

However, the biological function and clinical significance of redox-related genes (RRGs) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) are unclear. In our current study, we downloaded transcriptome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database of ccRCC patients and identified the differential expression of RRGs in tumor and normal kidney tissues. Then, we identified a total of 344 differentially expressed RRGs, including 234 upregulated and 110 downregulated RRGs. Fourteen prognosis-related RRGs (ADAM8, CGN, EIF4EBP1, FOXM1, G6PC, HAMP, HTR2C, ITIH4, LTB4R, MMP3, PLG, PRKCG, SAA1, and VWF) were selected out, and a prognosis-related signature was constructed based on these RRGs. Survival analysis showed that overall survival was lower in the high-risk group than in the low-risk group. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the risk score signature was 0.728 at three years and 0.759 at five years in the TCGA cohort and 0.804 at three years and 0.829 at five years in the E-MTAB-1980 cohort, showing good predictive performance. In addition, we explored the regulatory relationships of these RRGs with upstream miRNA, their biological functions and molecular mechanisms, and their relationship with immune cell infiltration. We also established a nomogram based on these prognostic RRGs and performed internal and external validation in the TCGA and E-MTAB-1980 cohorts, respectively, showing an accurate prediction of ccRCC prognosis. Moreover, a stratified analysis showed a significant correlation between the prognostic signature and ccRCC progression.","Wu, Yue; Wei, Xian; Feng, Huan; Hu, Bintao; Liu, Bo; Luan, Yang; Ruan, Yajun; Liu, Xiaming; Liu, Zhuo; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Tao",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8084660/,132

53304,952 In-Patient Trauma Surgery in COVID-19 Positive Patients Carries A Significantly Higher Mortality Risk When Compared to In-Patient Covid-19 Negative Patients and Day Case Trauma Patients,2021-05-04,"Introduction: Data on the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on glycemic control and psychological well-being in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) showed mixed results. Some studies showed improvement in glycemic control attributed to more time for self-care and a more regular lifestyle schedule during the lockdown. However, most published data reflects a short duration of 3–5 months. The impact of long-term social isolation and transition to telemedicine on the health of T1DM patients remains unknown. Our study analyzes patient perception surrounding the impact of an 11-month lockdown on glycemic control, well-being, and self-reported depression symptoms. Methods: PHQ-9 was integrated into a 55-question survey created using RedCap, a secure portal for managing surveys. The survey was sent to 160 T1DM patients over the age of 18 to gauge their current diabetes management and overall well-being prior to, and during the pandemic. The survey also inquired about patients’ perceived effectiveness of telemedicine visits. PHQ9 scores were collected and analyzed along with survey responses. Results: Data collection is still ongoing. From the 47 responders, the PHQ9 screening showed 51% were in the minimal depression score, 34% in the range of mild depression, 11% in moderate depression, and 4% scored in moderate to severe depression. No patients scored within severe depression. In a regular week during the pandemic, 40% of patients experienced difficulty with their motivation and diabetes management and 60% reported no concern, as compared to 36% and 64% respectively before the pandemic. Among the 47 of patient respondents, 30 reported both A1c levels prior and during the pandemic of which 46% showed an improved A1c amid the pandemic, 10% had no change, and 44% reported a worsened A1c level. For the telehealth part of the survey, 90% of patients reported feeling “comfortable with the level of care” they receive via telemedicine, whereas the other 10% were not. Whilst 54% of patients preferred in-person visits and 46% indicated a preference for telehealth visits. Conclusion: T1DM management is challenging. The pandemic adds to the complexity and burden to both self-management and healthcare delivery. Staying locked down for a prolonged period of time imposes economical, psychological, and medical constraints to diabetes care, as nearly half of the patients reported worsening of glycemic control. Our comprehensive survey reports the longest duration reported up to date of how the COVID-19 lockdown impacts patient’s perceived changes in their mental health and diabetes management. It helps clinicians understand the connection between mental and physical health during the pandemic and improve time-restricted telehealth visits by understanding patient concerns. Additional larger scale studies are imperative to expand the knowledge in this field.","Calma, Jamie; Sangha, Sabrina; Basina, Marina",J Endocr Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135520/,132

A UK Biobank analysis,2021-09-16,"The COVID‐19 pandemic outbreak remains one of the most influential events in the global economy over the recent years. While being primarily public health related, it has a tremendous impact on many other aspects, including business management. Many businesses were forced to introduce rapid changes to their business models in order to survive. The aim of this paper is to show the complexity and interrelations of changes triggered by COVID‐19 outbreak. Understanding of this complexity is crucial for developing business resilience to similar events in the future. The paper uses systems thinking approach to analyze influence of COVID‐19 pandemic on business operations and to show the importance of the proper government response to the COVID‐19 crisis. A causal loop diagram is used to show the complicated mechanisms behind the impact of pandemic on several aspects of business operation and management. Perceptions of some variables play more important roles than actual variables, and it often requires more than one actor to solve a particular problem. Adaptive business management may prove to be a particular challenge for small business owners. The paper provides useful insights into the complex nature of contemporary business operation and management in the wake of a major epidemiological crisis. It may contribute to a better understanding of important factors that often tend to be disregarded and not paid enough attention to. It offers food for thought not only for academics, but also to business owners/managers, aware of the complexity of contemporary world and to government‐level decision‐makers.","Zięba, Krzysztof",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441870/,132

To date, researchers endeavor to explain the structure-property relationship of ceramics with multitude of approaches and design a new formula or strategy to obtain excellent microwave dielectric properties. There are variety of factors that impact the permittivity, dielectric loss, and temperature stability of dielectric materials, covering intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Many of these factors are often intertwined, which can complicate new dielectric material discovery and the mechanism investigation. Because of the various ceramics systems, pseudo phase diagram was used to classify the dielectric materials based on the composition. In this review, the ceramics were firstly divided into ternary systems, and then brief description of the experimental probes and complementary theoretical methods that have been used to discern the intrinsic polarization mechanisms and the origin of intrinsic loss was mentioned. Finally, some perspectives on the future outlook for high-temperature MWDCs were offered based on the synthesis method, characterization techniques, and significant theory developments.","Yang, Hongcheng; Zhang, Shuren; Yang, Hongyu; Wen, Qingyu; Yang, Qiu; Gui, Ling; Zhao, Qian; Li, Enzhu",J Adv Ceram,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502792/,132

It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities. Nowadays, we are in COVID-19 pandemic. From practice after COVID-19 illness resolves, some of the recovering patients return back smoothly to their pre-illness life. Others experience different mood changes. Anxiety and depression are the most common. Those patients with improving general health, radiology, and oxygenation have different somatic complaints such as sensation of dyspnoea. Psychological support and psychiatric evaluation can help them to overcome this situation and get rid of dyspnoea sensation. This work aimed to evaluate the relation between COVID-19 survivors and depression and to how extent this could affect functional status of the study participants. RESULTS: This work recruited 102 adult patients as a sample of Egyptians who were positive PCR for SARS-COV2, turned negative and free of symptoms for 1 month or more which include physicians, nurses, employees, and literate health care workers of Ain Shams University hospitals attending chest outpatient clinic for follow-up. The majority were 47.1% in age group (35–55 years), sixty two (60.8%) participants were females, 74.5% had high education, and 24.5% were smokers. The most frequent symptom reported by study participants as the most annoying COVID-19 symptom was fever (32.4%). Beck depression inventory score showed that 59 (57.8%) participants had no depression, 24 (23.5%) had mild depression, 16 (15.7%) had moderate depression, and only 3 (2.9%) participants had severe depression. Logistic regression analysis was done to measure effect of steroid use and grade of dyspnoea on development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression and showed that higher grades of dyspnoea were associated with higher probability of development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression (p value < 0.05). CONCLUSION: As predicted, COVID-19 survivors presented a high prevalence of psychiatric sequelae. Age, sex, and education level were important association factors. Higher educational level was associated with higher score of depression due to increased awareness of the current pandemic issue. Steroids’ use was proposed as a cause of depression since the majority of moderate or severe depression group were on steroids. Higher grades of dyspnoea were associated with higher probability of development of moderate or severe post-COVID depression. It is suggested that COVID-19 survivors should be assessed, to properly diagnose and treat any psychiatric conditions, to reduce the disease burden.","Ezzelregal, Hieba Gamal; Hassan, Azza Mohammed; Mohamed, Rehab Serag; Ahmed, Noha Othman",Egypt J Bronchol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8503708/,132

A microgrid system to be installed in hospitals, if well planned, may offer a continuous and low electricity cost solution for health-care. By constructing an Energy Management System (EMS) specific to the hospitals, this study aims to present the significance of using an energy storage system and an optimum schedule for power utilization to prevent the lethal consequences arising from cut-offs and power quality issues. EMS is a linear (LP) scheduling model including PV panels and re-purposed EV batteries, and its target is to meet the electricity demand of the hospital with the lowest cost for every hour. The proposed scheduling model was run for a 150-bed hospital in Istanbul, Turkey under 5 different scenarios for every hour based on the data of 2016. According to scenario results, it is possible to achieve a 9.4% and 13.4% reduction in electricity bills and the grid electricity usage, respectively.","Guven, Denizhan; Kayalica, M.

59152,Malaria among adult Sudanese COVID patients between the 4th of April 2020 to the 15th of January 2021,2021-10-08,"AIM: Current study aimed to determine the stressors experienced by healthcare workers during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. SUBJECT AND MSETHODS: A cross-sectional design was utilized, and an online survey was conducted in early April 2020 among 2506 healthcare workers, using snowball sampling. A questionnaire highlighting the elements pertinent to the COVID-19 outbreak and General Health Questionnaire were used to collect data. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to assess the impact of the early stages of the outbreak on the mental health condition of healthcare workers. RESULTS: The mean of the General Health Questionnaire-12 was 6.03 (min = .00, max = 12.00). Participants reported high frequency of some variables, such as favorable relationships with their teammates (90.7%, n = 2274), striving to create a more hygienic home (84.6%, n = 2121), anger and hopelessness due to the community's neglect of precautions (84.2%, n = 2109) and fear of exposure to violence against healthcare workers (72.8%, n = 1825). The final regression model contained seven variables (gender, individual preparedness, perceived level of training related to COVID-19, meeting basic needs during the pandemic, fear of being infected, fear of infecting loved ones, and family relationships). CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that the management of the COVID-19 pandemic has to be planned and sustained by relevant measures maintaining the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers. Psychological support should be provided for individuals and the teams; healthcare workers’ families should also be involved in and benefit from sustained and intermittent psychological support.","Ünal, Yeşim; Çakır, Ekin; Tekeli-Yesil, Sidika",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8505011/,132

59183,"Analysis of delayed admission to hospital in acute stroke patients before and during the pandemic COVID-19 in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan",2021-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Recent outbreak of deadly Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) urges the scientist to identify the potential vaccine or drug to control the disease. SARS-CoV-2 with its single stranded RNA genome (length ~ 30 kb) is enveloped with active spike proteins. The genome is non-segmental with 5’-cap and 3’-poly tail and acts as a mRNA for the synthesis of replicase polyproteins. The replicase gene lying downstream to 5’-end encodes for non-structural protein, which in turn pose multiple functions ranging from envelope to nucleocapsid development. This study aims to identify the highly stable, effective and less toxic single strand RNA-based aptamers against non-structural protein 10 (NSP10). NSP10 is the significant activator of methyltransferase enzymes (NSP14 and NSP16) in SARS-CoV-2. Inhibiting the activation of methyltransferase leads to partial viral RNA capping or lack of capping, which makes the virus particles susceptible to host defence system. RESULTS: In this study, we focused on designing RNA aptamers through computational approach, docking of protein-aptamer followed by molecular dynamics simulation to perceive the binding stability of complex. Docking study reveals the high binding affinity of three aptamers namely RNA-053, 001, 010 to NSP10 with the HADDOCK score of − 88.5 ± 7.0, − 87.7 ± 11.5, − 86.1 ± 12 respectively. Molecular Dynamics suggests high conformational stability between the aptamer and the protein. Among the screened aptamers two aptamers maintained at least 3-4 intermolecular H-bonds throughout the simulation period. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies the potential aptamer candidate against less investigated but significant antiviral target i.e., NSP10/NSP16 interface complex.

PT(2) 1.0 can be found online at: https://pt2.nrem.iastate.edu/. With the PT(2) (1.0) users locate farm fields of interest in an online aerial photograph and mapping geographic information system (GIS). Users explore areas they are considering for prairie or tree cover by examining different data layers: soil maps, 2-foot contour topography maps, LiDAR hillshade maps, and a map of current land values based on estimated land rent. Users then utilize scaled dimensional drawing tools to measure and delineate areas of interest for planting trees and or prairie. Once an area is delineated, users select from drop-down menus prairie seed mixes or woody species that are suitable for the soils present, and users can select basic long-term management options. PT(2) (1.0) estimates total annualized costs for tree or prairie establishment, long-term management, and opportunity costs (based on area weighted expected soil rent), and factors in the potential benefit of utilizing government cost-share programming, e.g., Environmental Quality Incentive Program or the Conservation Reserve Program.

59195,Atypical cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19,2021-10-08,"This paper addresses the question of how the Covid-19 pandemic has affected the labour market integration support (LMIS) organised for refugees in Austria and Sweden, and the potential consequences of the changes unfolding. LMIS for refugees is a complex phenomenon involving actors at different interwoven levels—the macro-national level, the meso-organisational level and the micro-individual level. However, the complexities and consequences of such processes for the labour market integration of refugees have so far received limited attention. The current Covid-19 pandemic actualises the need to gain a better understanding of how integration support is organised across the different levels and how the pandemic itself impacts such support. Thus, the article seeks to understand how the pandemic affects the LMIS organised for refugees in Austria and Sweden, two countries with a large refugee population and diverging responses to the pandemic. Based on 29 semi-structured interviews and three focus group workshops, the results highlight in particular three developments: (a) a further entrenching of broader, macro-national level developments related to integration support already underway prior to the pandemic; (b) further mainstreaming of activities; and (c) increased volatility of work. Overall, the pandemic has brought to the fore the interrelation of different levels in the organising of LMIS for refugees and has contributed to a stabilisation of already ongoing activities.","Bešić, Almina; Diedrich, Andreas; Aigner, Petra",Comp Migr Stud,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8507501/,132

An internet-based questionnaire that included the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Zung Self Rating Anxiety Score (SAS) was used to assess the impact of the pandemic on the wellbeing of mental health nurses in an Irish mental health service. Among the nurses surveyed (n = 161), 12% of the participants had an overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was a clinical concern, while 38% had an overall IES-R score >32 indicating that PTSD was a probable diagnosis. The mean SAS score that had been converted to anxiety index scores was 40.78 (SD = 9.25). The results showed that 30% of mental health nurses experienced anxiety levels from moderate to extreme. Overall findings confirm that mental health nurses are experiencing psychological distress as a result of working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses who were <30 years of age or who were in their current roles for less than a year or were ward-based and worked full-time, were most likely to be affected. Working during COVID-19 has not been routine work practice and for a cohort of workers who are already under pressure, the sacrifice in terms of general well-being has been immense. The offer of individualized psychological support for mental health nurses working during the pandemic should be both practical in nature and flexible enough to meet individual needs.","King, Marie; Farrington, Aoife; Donohue, Gráinne; McCann, Edward",Issues in mental health nursing,https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2021.1978598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34644213/,132

Many ways to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 virus are sought to prevent the spread of this virus. Azithromycin and clarithromycin are considered for the treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which has a high similarity to previous colonic diseases. AIM We aimed to determine whether azithromycin and clarithromycin, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein inhibitor used in the treatment of COVID-19, is effective against SARS Cov-2 in silico. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION The 503 analogues of azithromycin and clarithromycin were studied to target SARS-CoV-2 the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein inhibition. Maestro program was used to compare the inhibition activities of these analogues. A detailed comparison was made using the numerical value of many parameters obtained. ADME / T properties were then examined to determine the effects and reactions of analogues on human metabolism. In this study, the SARS-CoV2 virus is 6NUR and 6NUS, which is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein. Among these proteins, the best inhibitor among the 503 analogues according to the docking score parameter was 9851445 with a great difference. This analogue was an analogue of azithromycin (Tab. 3, Fig. 6, Ref. 58).","Gedikli, M A; Tuzun, B; Aktas, A; Sayin, K; Ataseven, H",Bratislavske lekarske listy,https://doi.org/10.4149/bll_2021_015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33502877/,132

The intubated, ventilated patient's inspired and expired fractions of O2 and CO2 (FiO2, FeO2, FiCO2 and FeCO2) are monitored in the operating room and can be used to calculate RER. OBJECTIVE To investigating the ability of the RER to predict postoperative complications. DESIGN An observational, prospective study. SETTING Two French university hospitals between March 2017 and September 2018. PATIENTS A total of 110 patients undergoing noncardiac high-risk surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The RER was calculated as (FeCO2 - FiCO2)/(FiO2 - FeO2) at five time points during the operation. The primary endpoint was at the end of the surgery. The secondary endpoints were systemic oxygenation indices (pCO2 gap, pCO2 gap/arteriovenous difference in O2 ratio, central venous oxygen saturation) and the arterial lactate level at the end of the surgery. Complications were classified according to the European Peri-operative Clinical Outcome definitions. RESULTS Postoperative complications occurred in 35 patients (34%). The median [interquartile range] RER at the end of surgery was significantly greater in the subgroup with complications, 1.06 [0.84 to 1.35] than in the subgroup without complications, 0.81 [0.75 to 0.91], and correlated significantly with the arterial lactate (r = 0.31, P < 0.001) and VO2 (r = -0.23, P = 0.001). Analysis of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the predictive value of RER for postoperative complications revealed a value of 0.77 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.88, P = 0.001]. The best cut-off for the RER was 0.94, with a sensitivity of 71% (95% CI 54 to 85) and a specificity of 79% (95% CI 68 to 88). CONCLUSION As a putative noninvasive marker of tissue hypoperfusion and anaerobic metabolism, the RER can be used to predict complications following high-risk surgery.

This novel coronavirus has been shown to have cardiovascular manifestations in the form of arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, myocarditis, stress cardiomyopathy, myocardial injury and myocardial ischemia or infarction from increased microvascular and/or macrovascular coagulopathy. However, in addition to these direct effects, we are now starting to recognize indirect cardiovascular effects of COVID-19 in the form of increased incidence of Takutsobo cardiomyopathy in patients without any evidence of coronavirus infection presumably due to the increased psychological stress of social isolation and societal turbulence. In this case series, we present two post-menopausal women, presenting with chest pain and acute coronary syndrome, who are finally diagnosed with stress cardiomyopathy, triggered by increased emotional stress-related to the pandemic. There is data from a retrospective cohort analysis showing a fourfold increase in the incidence of acute coronary syndrome resulting from stress cardiomyopathy during the pandemic period compared to similar times periods before the pandemic. Hence, health care providers need to be cognizant of the emotional ramifications of the ongoing pandemic in the form of increased risk of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Moreover, urgent measures need to be taken to help the at-risk population cope with the ongoing stressors to help decrease the incidence of this cardiomyopathy.","Kir, Devika; Beer, Nusen; De Marchena, Eduardo J",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336409/,132

The sequences detected are distinct from adenoviruses previously identified in bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) and harbor porpoises (Phocoena phocoena), forming two distinct clades in the cetacean hosts. The clinical impact is unclear, since no histopathologic evidence of adenovirus-associated disease was found.

Currently, different pharmacological and surgical options are used to treat localised and metastatic GISTs, although this research field is broad and the body of evidence is scattered and expanding. Our objectives are to identify, describe and organise the current available evidence for GIST through an evidence mapping approach. METHODS We followed the methodology of Global Evidence Mapping (GEM). We searched Pubmed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Epistemonikos in order to identify systematic reviews (SRs) with or without meta-analyses published between 1990 and March 2016. Two authors assessed eligibility and extracted data. Methodological quality of the included systematic reviews was assessed using AMSTAR. We organised the results according to identified PICO questions and presented the evidence map in tables and a bubble plot. RESULTS A total of 17 SRs met eligibility criteria. These reviews included 66 individual studies, of which three quarters were either observational or uncontrolled clinical trials. Overall, the quality of the included SRs was moderate or high. In total, we extracted 14 PICO questions from them and the corresponding results mostly favoured the intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS The most common type of study used to evaluate therapeutic interventions in GIST sarcomas has been non-experimental studies. However, the majority of the interventions are reported as beneficial or probably beneficial by the respective authors of SRs. The evidence mapping is a useful and reliable methodology to identify and present the existing evidence about therapeutic interventions.","Ballesteros, Mónica; Montero, Nadia; López-Pousa, Antonio; Urrútia, Gerard; Solà, Ivan; Rada, Gabriel; Pardo-Hernandez, Hector; Bonfill, Xavier",BMC medical research methodology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-017-0402-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28882125/,132

We describe outcomes in children with severe COVID-19 treated with remdesivir. METHODS Seventy-seven hospitalized patients <18 years old with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection received remdesivir through a compassionate-use program between March 21 and April 22, 2020. The intended remdesivir treatment course was 10 days (200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg daily subsequently for children ≥40 kg and 5 mg/kg on day 1 and 2.5 mg/kg daily subsequently for children <40 kg, given intravenously). Clinical data through 28 days of follow-up were collected. RESULTS Median age was 14 years (interquartile range 7-16, range <2 months to 17 years). Seventy-nine percent of patients had ≥1 comorbid condition. At baseline, 90% of children required supplemental oxygen and 51% required invasive ventilation. By day 28 of follow-up, 88% of patients had a decreased oxygen-support requirement, 83% recovered, and 73% were discharged. Among children requiring invasive ventilation at baseline, 90% were extubated, 80% recovered, and 67% were discharged. There were 4 deaths, of which 3 were attributed to COVID-19. Remdesivir was well tolerated, with a low incidence of serious adverse events (16%). Most adverse events were related to COVID-19 or comorbid conditions.

METHODS Adult male Wistar rats (120 ± 10 g) were classified as control received the vehicle, C. aronia (200 mg/kg), and C. aronia (2,000 mg/kg)-treated rats. After treatments for consecutive 7 days, hematological and molecular experiments were conducted to detect alterations in platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (THXB2) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) content; protein levels of P2Y12, p-Akt, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphorylated vasodilator-stimulated-phosphoprotein (p-VASP), nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), P-selectin, and etc. in platelets were determined by Western blot; mRNA expressions of P2Y12 and some inflammatory markers were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS At a concentration of 200 mg/kg, C. aronia inhibited platelet aggregation through multiple interconnected mechanisms including downregulation P2Y12 synthesis and expression, stimulating intracellular cAMP levels and protein levels of p-VASP, inhibiting platelets THXB2 release and protein levels of P-selectin. Also, it inhibited platelets level of ROS and of NF-κB, a major signaling pathway that stimulates the expression of P2Y12 and THXA2 synthesis. Opposite findings were seen in platelets of rats received C. aronia at a concentration of 2,000 mg/kg. Interestingly, co-administration of N-acetylcysteine prevented all hematological and molecular alterations exerted by the high dose of the extract and inhibited platelet aggregation. CONCLUSION Oral administration of C. aronia at low dose inhibits platelet aggregation by reducing THXB2 release, expression of P-selectin and activating cAMP and Akt signaling through two major mechanisms including downregulation of P2Y12 and inhibition of ROS-induced activation of NF-κB, an effect that is observed to be in the opposite direction with its high dose.","Shatoor, Abdullah S; Shati, Ali; Humayed, S Al; Al-Qahtani, Sultan; Alkhateeb, Mahmoud",Chinese journal of integrative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11655-020-3187-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418179/,132
64898,Management of Patients with Multiple Sclerosis During the COVID-19 Pandemics: A Portuguese Single-Centre Experience.,2021-01-06,"ConspectusPyrazinacenes are a class of nitrogen-containing heteroacene molecules composed of linearly fused pyrazine units, which might also include dihydropyrazine groups leading to different reduced states of the compounds. While they are structurally similar to hydrocarbon acenes (e.g., pentacene) the presence of increasing numbers of N-heteroatoms introduces several different additional features of the compounds so that they can be considered for investigations beyond those suggested for acenes (i.e., organic field-effect transistors, solar cell components). Pyrazinacenes are in several ways complementary to C-H-only acenes based on the increasing stability of reduced states of the compounds with increasing numbers of fused pyrazine rings, although an acene-like electronic structure persists in the compounds so far studied. However, the introduction of multiple N atoms leads to properties that depart from C-H-only acenes. In particular, the compounds exhibit a delocalization of NH protons in extended reduced compounds and oxidation state switchability in solution and at interfaces. The presence of NH groups also allows an easy introduction of solubilizing groups at the pyrazinacene chromophore. In this Account, we will describe the preparation of extended pyrazinacenes from dipyrazino[2,3-b:2',3'-e]pyrazine (1,4,5,8,9,10-hexaazaanthracene; N6) derivatives up to 1,4,5,6,7,8,9,12,13,14,15,16,17,18-tetradecaazaheptacene (N14) and also assess structures of the relevant compounds based on X-ray crystallographic studies. Emergent properties of the molecules include highly unusual linear tautomeric processes based on a delocalization of protons (and the corresponding formation of orbitals based on multiple adjacent N lone electron pair interactions), which suggest special transport properties based on molecular protonics. Molecules such as decazapentacene (N10) exhibit multistability of oxidation state, and this is predicted to promote the redox catalytic properties of the compounds. The oxidation-state switching of on-surface processes is also described and has been investigated using scanning tunneling microscopy. The longest known pyrazinacene chromophore (N14) exhibits amphiprotism with its state of protonation being strongly coupled to its fluorescence emission properties in the near-infrared region indicating possible uses in pH-coupled bioimaging applications. The synthesis of the pyrazinacenes is flexible and allows the preparation of symmetrically or unsymmetrically substituted derivatives for the development of more complex molecules and for control of the electronic structure of the acene unit. Overall, the pyrazinacenes represent an emerging class of highly nitrogenous heteroacenes with unique properties and excellent potential for development in different applications based on their special supramolecular properties including guest binding or interactions in biological systems.","Richards, Gary J; Hill, Jonathan P",Accounts of chemical research,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.accounts.1c00315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34323462/,132

Three types of evidence evaluation were used in this review: systematic reviews, scoping reviews, and evidence updates. Per agreement with the evidence evaluation recommendations of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation, only systematic reviews could result in a new or revised treatment recommendation. Systematic reviews performed for this 2020 CoSTR for pediatric life support included the topics of sequencing of airway-breaths-compressions versus compressions-airway-breaths in the delivery of pediatric basic life support, the initial timing and dose intervals for epinephrine administration during resuscitation, and the targets for oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in pediatric patients after return of spontaneous circulation. The most controversial topics included the initial timing and dose intervals of epinephrine administration (new treatment recommendations were made) and the administration of fluid for infants and children with septic shock (this latter topic was evaluated by evidence update).

We aimed at investigating the serotype distribution for IPD-causing S. pneumoniae and vaccine coverage among Chinese children and adults. This was a multicenter, observational study to collect S. pneumoniae isolates from normal sterile sites and IPD-related clinical information among children and adults. Serotyping was performed by a Capsule-Quellung reaction test using type-specific antisera. The study collected a total of 300 eligible isolates (pediatric = 148, adult = 152) were serotyped in a central laboratory. The most prevalent serotypes were 19A (20.9%) and 23 F (20.3%) in the pediatric group; 3 (21.7%) and 19 F (11.8%) in the adult group. PCV10 had low-to-moderate serotype coverage rates for children (60.8%) and adults (34.2%). PCV13 and PPV23 had high coverage rates for children (89.9%, 93.2%) and adults (70.4%, 82.9%), respectively, Investigational PCVs including PCV15 and PCV20 had high estimated coverage rates in children (89.9%, 93.9%). The study identified 269 subjects with IPD reported as the primary diagnosis in the medical records. Sepsis (48/136, 35.3%) and pneumonia (48/133, 36.1%) had the highest occurrence in the pediatric and adult groups, respectively.

While IPV victims may attend emergency departments (EDs) seeking medical care, not all of them will make an allegation against their abusers. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence and the characteristics of the victims, who had made an allegation about the violent incident and had been examined by a forensic pathologist for judicial purposes, and had attended EDs seeking medical care, before the forensic examination. METHODS We reviewed the archives of clinical examinations that were conducted at the Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens during a 5-year period (2012-16). RESULTS Six hundred sixty-four clinical examinations were conducted at our Department for IPV allegations. According to our findings, women were more likely to seek medical care than men. Victims who have attended EDs were more likely to have sustained injuries located at least on the head or on the lower limbs. CONCLUSION The majority of IPV victims in the broader region of Attica (Greece) were women, usually married, and aged between 30 and 49 years old. Despite the fact that the majority of IPV incidents are not reported to police, every person who is engaged in the process of dealing with IPV victims has to be educated and adequately informed about this phenomenon, its implications and the possible ways to deal with it. Furthermore, victims need to be educated and informed adequately in waiting rooms of EDs.","Katsos, Konstantinos; Sakelliadis, Emmanouil I; Zorba, Eleni; Tsitsika, Artemis; Papadodima, Stavroula; Spiliopoulou, Chara",Family practice,https://doi.org/10.1093/fampra/cmaa052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32417883/,132

69130,Cardiometabolic Risk Factor Control During Times of Crises and Beyond.,2020-06-11,"BACKGROUND Recently, studies on COVID-19 have focused on the epidemiology of the disease and clinical characteristics of patients, as well as on the risk factors associated with mortality during hospitalization in critical COVID-19 cases. However, few research has been performed on the prediction of disease progression in particular group of patients in the early stages of COVID-19. METHODS The study included 338 patients with COVID-19 treated at two hospitals in Wuhan, China, from December, 2019 to March, 2020. Predictors of the progression of COVID-19 from mild to severe stages were selected by the logistic regression analysis. RESULTS COVID-19 progression to severe and critical stages was confirmed in 78(23.1%) patients. The average value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was higher in patients in the disease progression group than in the improvement group. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated NLR, LDH, and IL-10, were independent predictors of disease progression. The optimal cut-off value of NLR was 3.75. The values of the area under the curve, reflecting the accuracy of predicting COVID-19 progression by NLR was 0.739(95%CI: 0.605-0.804). The risk model based on NLR, LDH and IL-10 had the highest area under the ROC curve. CONCLUSIONS The performed analysis demonstrates that high level of NLR, LDH, and IL-10 were independent risk factors for predicting disease progression in patients at the early stage of COVID-19. The risk model combined with NLR, LDH and IL-10 improved the accuracy of the prediction of disease progression in patients in the early stages of COVID-19.","Xu, Jianjun; Gao, Yang; Hu, Shaobo; Li, Suzhen; Wang, Weimin; Wu, Yuzhe; Su, Zhe; Zhou, Xing; Cheng, Xiang; Zheng, Qichang",Annals of clinical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00045632211011194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33827266/,132

To adapt to scale changes, a new feature reuse method named bridge connection was developed. With the help of bridge connections, the accuracy of baseline networks was improved at little additional computation cost. The proposed BridgeNet-19 achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.47%), followed by the pre-trained VGG-19 (95.01%) and VGG-19 with bridge connections (94.73%). The use of bridge connections also strengthens the flexibility of sensors for image acquisition.

This situation may poorly impact our capacity to care for critically injured patients. We need to devise a strategy to provide rational and essential care to hand trauma victims whilst the access to theatres and anaesthetic support is limited. Our center is a level 1 trauma center, where the pandemic preparedness required reorganization of the trauma services. We aim to summarise the clinical profile and management of these patients and highlight, how we modified our practice to optimize their care. Methods: This is a single-centre retrospective observational study of all patients with hand injuries visiting the Department of Plastic Surgery from 22nd March to 31st May 2020. Patient characteristics, management details, and outcomes were analysed. Results: A total of 102 hand injuries were encountered. Five patients were COVID-19 positive. The mean age was 28.9 ± 14.8 years and eighty-two (80.4%) were males. Thirty-one injuries involved fractures/dislocations, of which 23 (74.2%) were managed non-operatively. Seventy-five (73.5%) patients underwent wound wash or procedure under local anaesthetic and were discharged as soon as they were comfortable. Seventeen cases performed under brachial-plexus block, were discharged within 24 hours except four cases of finger replantation/ revascularisation and one flap cover which were discharged after monitoring for four days. At mean follow-up of 54.4 ± 21.8 days, the rates of early complication and loss to follow-up were 6.9% and 12.7% respectively. Conclusions: Essential trauma care needs to continue keeping in mind, rational use of resources while ensuring safety of the patients and health-care professionals. We need to be flexible and dynamic in our approach, by utilising teleconsultation, non-operative management, and regional anaesthesia wherever feasible.","Saha, Shivangi; Dash, Suvashis; Ansari, Mohammed Tahir; Bichupuriya, Ashish Dhanraj; Gupta, Amit Kumar; Singhal, Maneesh",The journal of hand surgery Asian-Pacific volume,https://doi.org/10.1142/s2424835521500132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33559584/,132

The results indicated the following: the greater the ability to discriminate between false information and true information, the greater the levels of psychological well-being perceived by the participant. The ability to discriminate predicts up to 32% of psychological well-being only for subjects living in rural municipalities.

This study endeavors to examine the occurrences of these complications at our cleft-craniofacial center, in an effort to identify causative factors and management strategies. A case series of patients with postoperative nasal complications after primary cleft lip nasal surgery is presented. METHODS A retrospective chart review of primary cleft lip nasal repairs was conducted at our cleft-craniofacial center between January 2003 and December 2007. Consecutive cases of 3 staff surgeons were evaluated. Specific data points included number and type of complications, subsequent required interventions, and relevant history, with particular attention paid to the details of the primary nasoplasty. RESULTS Eighty-six primary cleft lip nasoplasties were completed between the years 2003 and 2007. Six complications (6.9%) related to the primary cleft lip nasoplasty were identified. Four patients (4.6%) experienced nasal tip infections; all 4 required surgical drainage. Twenty-four patients (27.9%) undergoing primary cleft lip and nose repair had postoperative nostril conformers placed, and 2 (8.3%) of them experienced complications deemed conformer related. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative nasal complications of primary cheiloplasty occur and are likely underreported. In this series, complications resulted from infection, often occurring late, and secondary to the use of nostril conformers. Surgeon awareness and caregiver education, to identify the early signs of postoperative nasal complications, are critical to the successful treatment of these occurrences. Although this study did not intend on examining antibiotic use, the significance of nasal tip infections might support the regular use of antibiotics in this population, and the use of postoperative nostril conformers must be followed closely.","Alef, Matthew; Irwin, Chetan; Smith, Darren; Afifi, Ahmed; Jiang, Shao; Vecchione, Lisa; Ford, Matthew; Decesare, Gary E; Deleyiannis, Frederic W-B; Losee, Joseph E",The Journal of craniofacial surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/scs.0b013e3181ae4115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19816250/,132

74168,[Cardiovascular Pathology in Patients With COVID-19].,2020-09-17,"Adoption of strict social distancing and sanitary measures were inevitable in the attempt to thwart the spread of the Covid-19 virus. These measures, however, came at a cost for older adults who faced major mental health issues because of social isolation. The impact of social isolation remains well documented in the wake of the pandemic. This paper explored the lived experiences of older adults living in the community during the Covid-19 sanitary lockdown in the small-island state of Mauritius. As a small-island state with family structures that still skew towards extended or modified extended families, it was interesting to explore whether older adults would be reporting feelings of social isolation as was being reported elsewhere. This study utilized a qualitative approach using a lifeworld hermeneutical approach with 15 older adult participants, recruited through convenience and snowball sampling, in the community. Data were collected using a narrative approach supplemented by an interview guide. Thematic analysis was used to identify themes from transcribed and translated data. Six themes were discovered: Fears of the virus and fear of deprivation; Reliving and recreating bonds; Active contribution to family life; Being and feeling valued within the family; Rediscovering family time and family moments; and Fear of going back to 'normal'. The study revealed positive experiences of the lockdown period characterised by an increase bonding in the family, deepening of familial bond, and increased value despite an initial apprehension of the lockdown. A renewed sense of purpose as well as deepening of bonds was reported by older adults. Some limitations in relation to data trustworthiness and respondents bias, however, could not be avoided since the study was carried out during sanitary lockdown period. The feelings of social isolation and depression reported by older adults who lived alone were not seen in this study, suggesting that the family structure may have a role to play in mitigating these effects. There would also be a need to explore similar small-island states or similar cultures where the effects of sanitary lockdowns may be different from current literature.","Chemen, Sambaladevi; Gopalla, Youven Naiken",Journal of aging studies,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2021.100932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34083001/,132

Recent studies revealed increased ACE and decreased ACE2 expression in kidneys of patients with diabetic nephropathy. However, these changes may not be specific for diabetic nephropathy. We studied ACE and ACE2 expression in patients with IgA nephropathy. METHODS Renal ACE and ACE2 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization in 30 patients with IgA nephropathy and 21 healthy controls. Correlation between ACE and ACE2 expression and levels of various biochemical parameters was also assessed. Gene expression was also assessed in minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) and membranous nephropathy (MN) as disease controls. RESULTS Reduced ACE2 expression (p < 0.01) and increased ACE expression in glomeruli (p < 0.001), and reduced ACE2 expression in tubulointerstitium (p < 0.001) were observed in patients with IgA nephropathy compared to healthy controls, although the changes in ACE2 mRNA were not statistically significant. Reduced renal ACE2 expression was also found in MN but not in MCNS. Correlation between renal ACE and ACE2 expression and proteinuria was not observed in IgA nephropathy. CONCLUSION IgA nephropathy is associated with increased ACE and decreased ACE2 expression in kidneys, as in diabetic nephropathy.","Mizuiri, Sonoo; Hemmi, Hiromichi; Arita, Michitsune; Aoki, Toshiyuki; Ohashi, Yasushi; Miyagi, Moriatsu; Sakai, Ken; Shibuya, Kazutoshi; Hase, Hiroki; Aikawa, Atsushi",Nephron.

Winter outbreaks in Chile result in 5% of infected children hospitalized, with 0.01% mortality. Increased evidence indicates that viral and host factors modulate the severity of infection. Using DNA microarrays, we characterized the genome-wide transcriptional response of lung mucoepidermoid cells (NCI-H292) at 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours post-infection (hpi) with a single dose of RSV/A. During the whole studied period, a bi-phasic gene expression profile was observed by a total of 330 differentially expressed genes. About 60% of them were up-regulated between 24-72 hpi and then turned-off at 96 hpi. This transient, early gene expression pattern was significantly enriched in biological processes like interferon signaling, antigen processing and presentation, double-stranded RNA binding and chemokine activity. We detected 27 common genes up-regulated between 24-72 hpi, from which IFIT1, IFI44, MX1, CXCL11 and OAS1 had the highest expression. The second pattern comprised over 120 genes, which remained silenced until 72 hpi, but were steeply up-regulated by 96 hpi. Biological processes of this late-response profile included cell cycle division and microtubule cytoskeleton organization. Conversely, the genes belonging to virus response pathway showed a decreased expression at 96 hpi. We conclude that RSV induces an early innate immune activation profile response until 72 hpi. Thereafter, the viral response is inhibited, leading to host cell recovery. The presented cellular model allows to study the specific pathways involved in elimination of infection at prolonged time intervals and their subsequent analysis in severe RSV disease of infants and/or older adults.","Ampuero, S; Andaur, R; Milano, M; Moreno, M; Lizama, L; Larrañaga, C; Urzúa, U",Acta virologica,https://doi.org/10.4149/av_2018_225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30160147/,132

METHODS The iATTEND (improving ATTENDance to cardiac rehabilitation) trial is currently enrolling subjects and randomizing patients to S-CR versus hybrid-CR. This substudy involves the first 47 subjects who completed ≥18 CR sessions. Patients in S-CR completed all visits in a typical phase II clinic-based setting and patients in hybrid-CR completed up to 17 of their sessions remotely using telehealth (TH). Exercise training intensity in both CR settings is based on heart rate (HR) data from each CR session, expressed as percent HR reserve. RESULTS Among patients in both study groups, there were no serious adverse events or falls that required hospitalization during or within 3 hr after completing a CR session. Expressed as a percentage of HR reserve, the overall mean exercise training intensities during both the S-CR sessions and the TH-CR sessions from hybrid-CR were not significantly different at 63 ± 12% and 65 ± 10%, respectively (P = .29). CONCLUSION This study showed that hybrid-CR delivered using remote TH results in exercise training intensities that are not significantly different from S-CR.","Keteyian, Steven J; Grimshaw, Crystal; Brawner, Clinton A; Kerrigan, Dennis J; Reasons, Lisa; Berry, Robert; Peterson, Edward L; Ehrman, Jonathon K",Journal of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1097/hcr.0000000000000569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351540/,132

METHODS Under an IRB-approved protocol, patients undergoing laparoscopic re-exploration after prior intraperitoneal mesh placement were prospectively graded intraoperatively for adhesion tenacity (0-4), adhesion surface area (0 = 0%, 10 = 100%), and ratio of adhesiolysis time to mesh surface area (min/cm(2)). Adhesiolysis-related complications were also recorded. Data are given as mean ± SD. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined using the t test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS From March 2006 to March 2009, 69 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery after prior intraperitoneal mesh placement for ventral hernia repair. Previous meshes were absorbable-barrier-coated mesh (n = 18), permanent-barrier composite mesh [Composix® (n = 17)], permanent-barrier noncomposite mesh [DualMesh® (n = 14)], uncoated polypropylene mesh (n = 12), and biologic mesh (n = 8). Indications for laparoscopic re-exploration were recurrent ventral hernia (n = 58), chronic pain (n = 3), cholecystectomy (n = 3), parastomal hernia (n = 2), small bowel obstruction (n = 1), nephrectomy (n = 1), and Nissen fundoplication (n = 1). Adhesions to DualMesh were less tenacious (P < 0.05) compared to all other meshes. Surface area of adhesions to DualMesh were less (P < 0.05) than to Composix and to uncoated polypropylene mesh, but not to absorbable-barrier-coated and biologic meshes. Adhesiolysis time:mesh surface area was less (P < 0.05) for DualMesh compared to Composix, uncoated polypropylene, and biologic mesh, but not to absorbable-barrier-coated mesh. Adhesiolysis-related complications occurred in two (16.7%) (P = ns) patients with uncoated polypropylene mesh, one cystotomy and one enterotomy; both were repaired laparoscopically. There were two (16.7%) (P = ns) conversions to an open procedure: one converted patient had Composix (6.7%) and one had absorbable-barrier-coated mesh (5.9%). There were no adhesiolysis-related complications with these meshes. There were no adhesiolysis-related complications or conversions to open in the DualMesh or biologic mesh groups. CONCLUSIONS Adhesion characteristics of mesh placed intraperitoneally and adhesiolysis-related complications during laparoscopic re-exploration after ventral hernia repair are associated with unique properties of the mesh and/or barrier.","Jenkins, Eric D; Yom, Victoria; Melman, Lora; Brunt, L Michael; Eagon, J Christopher; Frisella, Margaret M; Matthews, Brent D",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1076-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20445995/,132

The purpose of this study was to evaluate perioperative and short-term outcomes of our procedure of intracorporeal gastrojejunostomy using linear staplers after LTG. METHODS Of 98 consecutive patients who underwent LTG for gastric cancer in our department between August 2002 and December 2010, 94 patients underwent esophagojejunostomy with a linear stapling device. After October 2007, we modified the esophagojejunostomy; ie, the most recent 57 patients underwent transection of the esophagus in the ventrodorsal direction and insertion of a linear stapler from the anterior wall of the Roux limb to the posterior wall so as to make an inverted T-shaped anastomosis. We evaluated the results in these 57 patients (recent group) and compared them with the results in the earlier 37 patients (early group). RESULTS The mean operative time in the recent group was 368 to 94.6 min, and the mean estimated blood loss was 57 to 33 g; both were comparable with those in the early group. Neither open conversion nor intraoperative complications were encountered. Two patients experienced anastomotic leakage in the earlier group, but anastomotic leakage did not occur in the recent group. No mortality was encountered. CONCLUSION We herein report our procedure of intracorporeal gastrojejunostomy using linear staplers after LTG. Our procedure of esophagojejunostomy using linear staplers is safe and feasible and has acceptable morbidity.","Nagai, Eishi; Ohuchida, Kenoki; Nakata, Kohei; Miyasaka, Yoshihiro; Maeyama, Ryo; Toma, Hiroki; Shimizu, Shuji; Tanaka, Masao",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2012.10.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23305598/,132
82488,Investigating the Spectrum of Dermatologic Manifestations in COVID-19 Infection in Severely Ill Patients - A Series of Four Cases.,2020-09-08,"PURPOSE The prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains dismal. New cytotoxic agents such as nab-paclitaxel and liposomal irinotecan (nal-Iri) have extended the armamentarium of therapeutic options in the last years. Nowadays, sequential therapeutic strategies with moderately toxic chemotherapeutic protocols can be administered to the patients. However, prognostic and predictive biomarkers are still missing to identify those patients, which profit most from a ""continuum of care"" concept rather than receiving intensive first-line protocols such as FOLFIRINOX. To this end, we retrospectively evaluated the impact of the systemic inflammation as one essential hallmark of cancer in patients with advanced PDAC treated with sequential systemic. METHODS A cohort of 193 PDAC patients treated at our center from January 2005 to August 2011 were retrospectively evaluated for the following systemic inflammatory response (SIR) markers: neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) C-reactive protein (CRP), and the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS). SIR markers were correlated with clinico-pathological findings, response to chemotherapy and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional models. RESULTS All evaluated SIR markers were significantly associated with OS in patients with metastatic disease but not in patients with locally advanced PDAC. Interestingly, all SIR markers were only prognostic in patients not receiving antibiotics as surrogate marker for systemic bacterial infections. Based on the evaluated SIR markers, we propose a new Systemic Inflammation Score (SIS), which significantly correlated with reduced OS (HR: 3.418 (1.802-6.488, p < 0.001)) and the likelihood of receiving further-line systemic therapies (p = 0.028). CONCLUSION Routinely assessed SIR biomarkers have potential to support therapeutic decision making in patients with metastatic PDAC.","Markus, M; Abendroth, A; Noureddine, R; Paul, A; Breitenbuecher, S; Virchow, I; Schmid, K W; Markus, P; Schumacher, B; Wiesweg, M; Wendling, J; Mende, B; Siveke, J T; Schuler, M; Kasper, S",Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-020-03361-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839836/,132

The aim was to determine the maximum daily number of COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care from 11 April through 30 June 2020. METHODS We assumed three non-exponential scenarios for the development of the cumulative case numbers up to 30 June 2020 (linear, slow quadratic, and fast quadratic). We assumed that 3-10% of of patients would require intensive care, that 8 days would elapse from a positive test to the need for intensive care, and that intensive care would be necessary for 14 or 20 days. RESULTS Extrapolation of the maximum registered daily COVID-19 cases reveals a range of 4133 to 12 233 cases. Assuming that 3-10% of newly detected COVID-19 cases become intensive care patients and the average length of ICU stay is between 14 and 20 days, we arrive at a maximum daily number of ICU cases between 1989 (linear extrapolation, 3% ICU, 14 days in ICU) and 20 966 (fast quadratic extrapolation, 10% ICU, 20 days in ICU). CONCLUSION Our results give no rise for concern that triage of COVID-19 patients may become necessary in Germany. However, the occupancy of ICU beds should be managed centrally to ensure optimal use of bed capacity. If, contrary to expectations, an exponential increase in case numbers should occur after all, our results will become invalid.","Stang, Andreas; Stang, Maximilian; Jöckel, Karl-Heinz",Deutsches Arzteblatt international,https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.2020.0329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527378/,132

We report one-year mortality outcome in the Stress Ulcer Prophylaxis in the Intensive Care Unit (SUP-ICU) trial. METHODS In the SUP-ICU trial, acutely admitted adult ICU patients at risk of gastrointestinal bleeding were randomised to intravenous pantoprazole 40 mg vs. placebo (saline) once daily during their ICU stay. We assessed mortality at one year and did sensitivity analyses according to the trial protocol and statistical analysis plan. RESULTS A total of 3261 of the 3291 patients with available data (99.1%) were followed up at one year after randomisation; 1635 were allocated to pantoprazole and 1626 to placebo. At one year after randomisation, 610 of 1635 patients (37.3%) had died in the pantoprazole group as compared with 601 of 1626 (37.0%) in the placebo group (relative risk, 1.01; 95% confidence interval 0.92-1.10). The results were consistent in the sensitivity analysis adjusted for baseline risk factors and in those of the per-protocol population. We did not observe heterogeneity in the effect of pantoprazole versus placebo on one-year mortality in the predefined subgroups, i.e. patients with and without shock, mechanical ventilation, liver disease, coagulopathy, high disease severity (SAPS II > 53) or in medical vs. surgical ICU patients. CONCLUSION We did not observe a difference in one-year mortality among acutely admitted adult ICU patients with risk factors for gastrointestinal bleeding allocated to stress ulcer prophylaxis with pantoprazole or placebo during the ICU stay.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine this difference. Designs and methods We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar for observational and experimental studies that compared the energy expenditure of standing versus sitting. We calculated mean differences and 95% confidence intervals using a random effects model. We conducted different predefined subgroup analyses based on characteristics of participants and study design. Results We identified 658 studies and included 46 studies with 1184 participants for the final analysis. The mean difference in energy expenditure between sitting and standing was 0.15 kcal/min (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12-0.17). The difference among women was 0.1 kcal/min (95% CI 0.0-0.21), and was 0.19 kcal/min (95% CI 0.05-0.33) in men. Observational studies had a lower difference in energy expenditure (0.11 kcal/min, 95% CI 0.08-0.14) compared to randomised trials (0.2 kcal/min, 95% CI 0.12-0.28). By substituting sitting with standing for 6 hours/day, a 65 kg person will expend an additional 54 kcal/day. Assuming no increase in energy intake, this difference in energy expenditure would be translated into the energy content of about 2.5 kg of body fat mass in 1 year. Conclusions The substitution of sitting with standing could be a potential solution for a sedentary lifestyle to prevent weight gain in the long term. Future studies should aim to assess the effectiveness and feasibility of this strategy.","Saeidifard, Farzane; Medina-Inojosa, Jose R; Supervia, Marta; Olson, Thomas P; Somers, Virend K; Erwin, Patricia J; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco",European journal of preventive cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487317752186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385357/,132

SUMMARY ANSWER Our data suggest that soy formula feeding during infancy is associated with several indicators of severe menstrual pain in reproductive-age women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A prior study observed greater severity of menstrual pain in young women who as infants participated in feeding studies and were assigned to soy-based formula feeding. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION We used data from the Study of Environment, Lifestyle & Fibroids (SELF), a cohort of 1696 African-American women ages 23-35 years at enrollment. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS Data on infant soy formula feeding was ascertained by self-administered questionnaire for 1553 participants, with 89% of participants receiving assistance from their mothers. Information on menstrual pain indicators was collected by web- and telephone-interview. We estimated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using log-binomial regression, or log-multinomial regression, adjusting for participant age and maternal education. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Women ever fed soy formula as infants were more likely than unexposed women to report ever use of hormonal contraception for menstrual pain (RR 1.4, CI: 1.1-1.9) and moderate/severe menstrual discomfort/pain with 'most periods', but not 'every period', during early adulthood (ages 18-22 when not using hormonal contraception) (RR 1.5, CI: 1.1-2.0). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION We relied on retrospective recall to ascertain infant exposure to soy formula feeding and data on menstrual pain indicators. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Our observations add to the growing body of literature from animal and human studies on the reproductive health consequences of early-life exposure to soy formula.

OBJECTIVE To assess whether a fixed ratio of insulin degludec/liraglutide was noninferior to continued titration of insulin glargine in patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes treated with insulin glargine and metformin. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, 26-week, randomized, open-label, 2-group, treat-to-target trial conducted at 75 centers in 10 countries from September 2013 to November 2014 among 557 patients with uncontrolled diabetes treated with glargine (20-50 U) and metformin (≥1500 mg/d) with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels of 7% to 10% and a body mass index of 40 or lower. INTERVENTIONS 1:1 randomization to degludec/liraglutide (n = 278; maximum dose, 50 U of degludec/1.8 mg of liraglutide) or glargine (n = 279; no maximum dose), with twice-weekly titration to a glucose target of 72 to 90 mg/dL. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome measure was change in HbA1c level after 26 weeks, with a noninferiority margin of 0.3% (upper bound of 95% CI, <0.3%). If noninferiority of degludec/liraglutide was achieved, secondary end points were tested for statistical superiority and included change in HbA1c level, change in body weight, and rate of confirmed hypoglycemic episodes. RESULTS Among 557 randomized patients (mean: age, 58.8 years; women, 49.7%), 92.5% of patients completed the trial and provided data at 26 weeks. Baseline HbA1c level was 8.4% for the degludec/liraglutide group and 8.2% for the glargine group. HbA1c level reduction was greater with degludec/liraglutide vs glargine (-1.81% for the degludec/liraglutide group vs -1.13% for the glargine group; estimated treatment difference [ETD], -0.59% [95% CI, -0.74% to -0.45%]), meeting criteria for noninferiority (P < .001), and also meeting criteria for statistical superiority (P < .001). Treatment with degludec/liraglutide was also associated with weight loss compared with weight gain with glargine (-1.4 kg for degludec/liraglutide vs 1.8 kg for glargine; ETD, -3.20 kg [95% CI, -3.77 to -2.64],P < .001) and fewer confirmed hypoglycemic episodes (episodes/patient-year exposure, 2.23 for degludec/liraglutide vs 5.05 for glargine; estimated rate ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, 0.30 to 0.61],P < .001). Overall and serious adverse event rates were similar in the 2 groups, except for more nonserious gastrointestinal adverse events reported with degludec/liraglutide (adverse events, 79 for degludec/liraglutide vs 18 for glargine). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes taking glargine and metformin, treatment with degludec/liraglutide compared with up-titration of glargine resulted in noninferior HbA1c levels, with secondary analyses indicating greater HbA1c level reduction after 26 weeks of treatment. Further studies are needed to assess longer-term efficacy and safety.

91799,Practical considerations in the anaesthetic management of patients during a COVID-19 epidemic.,2020-03-27,"BACKGROUND Acute mesenteric ischemia is a common surgical emergency. Restoration of blood flow is a critical objective of treating this pathology. However, many patients suffer from ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injuries at the time of revascularization, requiring prolonged hospitalizations. B-1a cells are a subtype of B lymphocytes with roles in regulating inflammation and tissue injury by spontaneous release of natural IgM and IL-10. We hypothesized that treatment with B-1a cells protects mice from intestinal I/R. METHODS Mesenteric ischemia was induced in mice by placing a vascular clip on the superior mesenteric artery for 60 minutes. At the time of reperfusion, B-1a cells or PBS control were instilled into the peritoneal cavity (PerC) of mice. PerC lavage, blood, intestine, and lungs were collected 4 h after reperfusion. Serum organ injury and inflammatory markers such as ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, IL-6, as well as lung and gut histology and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were assessed. RESULTS In intestinal I/R, B-1a cell frequency and number in the PerC were significantly decreased compared to sham-operated mice. There was an increase in the serum levels of ALT, AST, LDH, lactate, and IL-6 when comparing the vehicle group with the sham group. These increases were significantly reduced in the B-1a cell treated group. B-1a cell treatment significantly decreased the intestine and lung injury scores as well as MPO content, compared to vehicle treated mice. B-1a cell treatment resulted in a reduction of apoptotic cells in these tissues. Serum IgM levels were decreased in intestinal I/R, while treatment with B-1a cells significantly increased their levels towards normal levels. CONCLUSIONS B-1a cell treatment at the time of mesenteric reperfusion ameliorates end organ damage and reduces systemic inflammation through the improvement of serum IgM levels. Preserving B-1a cells pool could serve as a novel therapeutic avenue in intestinal I/R injury.","Royster, William; Ochani, Mahendar; Aziz, Monowar; Wang, Ping",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2021.06.070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399355/,132

Storage of medical data in the cloud is expanding, and ventilation can be monitored remotely. The aim of this bench study was to determine whether tidal volume (VT) can be affected by the location of supplemental oxygen placement. METHODS We tested 4 home ventilators in a bench test using a dual-chamber test lung to test the addition of supplemental oxygen placement via a connector in the circuit (ie, front intake port) versus via the manufacturer's rear intake port, with different oxygen supply flows of 2, 4, 6, and 8 L/min. We compared the effectively delivered VT as measured with a pneumotachograph (ie, measured VT) versus the VT reported by each home ventilator (ie, monitored VT). RESULTS For all of the home ventilators, the monitored VT and measured VT were comparable when the rear oxygen intake was used, regardless of oxygen flow. However, when the front oxygen intake was used, the monitored VT as measured by the ventilators was significantly lower than the measured VT, with the greatest difference reaching 29% for the highest oxygen flow tested (8 L/min). CONCLUSIONS The monitored VT may be inaccurate if oxygen is added with a connector in the circuit, which may have consequences on both the individual level and collective level (ie, big data analysis). Physicians who analyze data from home ventilators should be aware of the site of oxygen supplementation and promote use of only the rear oxygen intake.","d'Aranda, Erwan; Cungi, Pierre-Julien; Mathais, Quentin; Cardinal, Mickaël; Esnault, Pierre; Nguyen, Cédric; Bordes, Julien; Meaudre, Eric; Goutorbe, Philippe",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.06829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31992671/,132

Identifying these sources of nutrients is essential to the protection and management of marine ecological environments. This study aims to evaluate the magnitudes of SGD and the associated nitrate in the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GHM Greater Bay Area), China, and identify the sources of SGD-driven nitrate in this region using radioactive radium (Ra) isotopes (223Ra, 224Ra, and 228Ra) and stable nitrogen (N) and oxygen (O) isotope composition of nitrate (δ15N-NO3- and δ18O-NO3-). The results of the Ra mixing model show that the estimated SGD and the associated nitrate fluxes into the Greater Bay Area are (9.15 ± 1.26) × 108 m3/d and (3.77 ± 0.52) × 107 mol/d, respectively, both of which are comparable to the contributions from the Pearl River. Combing NO3- dual isotopic signatures of sampled coastal groundwater and five kinds of potential nitrate sources, we found that ammonium (NH4+) fertilizer and natural soil N are the two main sources of nitrate in discharged submarine groundwater and rivers. No anthropogenic inputs from manure or sewage waste were identified. This study provides significant insights into the establishment of effective management strategies for controlling SGD-nutrients into the bay and protecting the marine ecological environment.","Wang, Xuejing; Zhang, Yan; Luo, Manhua; Xiao, Kai; Wang, Qianqian; Tian, Yong; Qiu, Wenhui; Xiong, Ying; Zheng, Chunmiao; Li, Hailong",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144616; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385844/,132

Using an animal model, we have developed a method to assess trocar site fascial dehiscence and the strength of different methods of fascial closure. MATERIALS AND METHODS Pigs (n = 9; 17 ± 2.5 lbs) underwent placement of 12 mm Hasson trocars with pneumoperitoneum maintained for 1 h. Three closure techniques (Figure-of-eight; simple interrupted; pulley) were compared with no fascial closure and to native fascia at five randomly allocated abdominal wall midline locations. Necropsy was performed on the fourth postoperative d. Statistical comparisons of tensile strength and breaking strength based on closure type and trocar location were made using ANOVA with Tukey's tests. RESULTS The mean (SD) force (Newtons) required for fascial disruption varied significantly with closure type [Native Fascia 170 (39), Figure-of-eight 169 (31), Pulley 167 (59), Simple Interrupted 151 (27), No Closure 108 (28)]; P = 0.007. The mean force required for fascial disruption was significantly increased for Native Fascia, Figure-of-eight, and Pulley relative to No Closure (P = 0.013, P = 0.015, P = 0.023, respectively). The mean (SD) force (in Newtons) required for fascial disruption also varied significantly with location of trocar [subxiphoid 181 (43), supraumbilical 151 (23), Umbilical 146 (23), infraumbilical 168 (62), suprapubic 120 (38)]; P = 0.03. The mean force for subxiphoid location was significantly increased relative to the suprapubic location (P = 0.021). CONCLUSIONS We have developed a novel assessment model that reliably detects differences in fascial integrity after laparoscopic trocar placement and closure. This model will allow for further testing of various trocars and closure techniques, and facilitate hernia prevention strategies.","Van Sickle, Kent R; Nanda Kumar, Hanuma Reddy; Parikh, Amit; Ayon, Arturo A; Cohn, Stephen M",The Journal of surgical research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2013.05.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23764309/,132
93959,Covid-19: risk factors for severe disease and death.,2020-03-26,"Fixed dose combination (FDC) of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and lamivudine (3TC) is one of the most preferred FDC for the treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. To the best of authors' knowledge there are no reported methods for chiral purity estimation of both drugs simultaneously from a FDC. The current study was focused on the development of a single chiral method uisng supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) for separation of stereoisomers of TDF and 3TC combination employing design of experiment (DoE) approach. Method development was planned in three steps by using different experimental designs for each step. I-optimal, Taguchi orthogonal array and face-centred central composite designs (CCD) were employed for primary parameter selection, secondary parameter screening and final method optimization, respectively. All six stereoisomers were separated in a 10 minute run on Chiralpak IA column with carbon di-oxide /methanol (containing 0.5 % v/v n-butylamine) as mobile phase at 1.5 mL/min in gradient mode. The optimized method was verified for performance through establishing specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, limit of quantification, and solution stability. Resolution between each isomeric pair was more than 1.5. The method was found to be linear from 1.5 µg/mL to 7.5 µg/mL for 3TC and 7.5 µg/mL to 37.5 µg/mL for TDF stereoisomers. The R2 values for all the linearity curves for undesired isomers were greater than 0.995. The method proved to be rapid, reproducible and efficient to quantify stereoisomers of both drugs in a single run.","Kurmi, Moolchand; Jayaraman, Karthik; Natarajan, Saravanan; Kumar, Gandhi Santosh; Bhutani, Hemant; Bajpai, Lakshmikant",Journal of chromatography.

93989,Dermatologic manifestations of COVID-19: a comprehensive systematic review.,2020-11-03,"BACKGROUND Vitiligo is characterized by the destruction of functional melanocytes in the skin. This destruction could target melanocytes anywhere in the body, which could affect function of organs where they reside. Melanocytes in the skin, uveal tract and ear are similar in their physiology and morphology and share a common embryologic origin. OBJECTIVES The present work aimed to study the association of vitiligo with ocular and auditory abnormalities. METHODS This case-control study was carried out on forty vitiligo patients and twenty normal healthy controls. All patients and controls were subjected to auditory examination (Otoscopic examination and immittancemetry, pure tone audiometery to assess peripheral hearing sensitivity and transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE) to assess central hearing ability) and standard ocular examination including: visual acuity test, slit lamp biomicroscopy , and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS There was significant higher prevalence of hearing loss in vitiligo patients than controls. Ocular abnormalities were found to be significant higher in vitiligo patients but no significant difference regarding visual acuity. CONCLUSION Vitiligo is a systemic disease and could be associated with impairment of melanocytes function in other organs including the eyes and ears. Auditory melanocytes function is related to hearing process and thus their destruction could lead to hearing impairment yet ocular melanocytes don't play direct role in detection or transfer of visual information. Vitiligo could be associated with ocular abnormalities and hearing loss.","Elereny, A; Assal, S; Gomaa, A; Almakkawy, B; Genedy, R",Clinical and experimental dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ced.14649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763919/,132
94139,Hip Fracture Surgery vs Elective Total Hip Replacement.,2016,"Background. Exposure to infectious droplets confers a high risk for infection transmission by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Aerosolizing procedures pose particular concern for increasing healthcare workers' (HCWs) risks of infection. Multiple creative personal protective equipment solutions have been utilized to minimize exposure to infectious particles; however, the overall benefit of many of these devices is limited by a number of factors. Methods. We designed an intubation tent consisting of a metal frame and a clear plastic sheet. The flexible walls of our tent offer increased maneuverability & access, although the efficacy in reducing risk of transmission to HCWs remained unclear. Using an atomizer, particle generator, and matchstick smoke, we simulated the generation of infectious respiratory droplets and aerosols and tested whether our device effectively decreased the concentration of these particles to which a provider might be exposed. Finally, we tested whether the addition of a vacuum fan fit with a high efficiency particulate air filter designed to evacuate contaminated air would influence particle concentrations inside and outside the tent. Results. Droplet dispersion tests with the tent in place showed that the simulated droplet distribution was limited to surfaces within the tent. Aerosol testing under a variety of circumstances consistently showed only a minor rise in particle concentration in the air outside the tent despite an initial peak of particle concentration during generation within. All testing demonstrated declining inside concentrations over time. Conclusions. Our simulations suggest our device has the potential to effectively decrease HCWs' exposure to infectious droplets and aerosolized viral particles.","Brant-Zawadzki, Graham M; Ockerse, Patrick; Brunson, Justin R; Smith, Jared L; McRae, Bryan R; Fonnesbeck, Annie; Ledyard, Holly; Ruechel, Adam; Fassl, Bernhard A",Surgical innovation,https://doi.org/10.1177/1553350621999976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710929/,132

There is little information about their role in complex procedures, such as esophagectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of an ERP on duration of stay, complications, and readmissions after esophagectomy. METHODS Patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer or high-grade dysplasia from June 2009 to December 2011 were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Beginning in June 2010, all patients were enrolled in a 7-day multidisciplinary ERP including written patient education with daily treatment plan, indications for intensive care admission, early structured mobilization, and diet and drain management. Short-term (30-day) outcomes were compared for patients undergoing esophagectomy pre- and post-pathway. Data are expressed as median values [interquartile range]. RESULTS We identified 106 patients; 47 underwent esophagectomy before ERP implementation and 59 after. Patients were similar with respect to age, gender, diagnosis, and operative time. Hospital stay was shorter in the ERP group (8 [7-17] vs 10 [9-17] days; P = .01). There were no differences in rates of complications (59% vs 62%) or readmissions (6% vs 5%).

Seven male Mongrel dogs received single-fraction 33 Gy SABR. We designed the en-bloc circular target of total PVs and LA posterior wall to avoid the esophagus. The circular box lesion included the LA roof and ridge, low posterior wall, and posterior interatrial septum. At 6 weeks or 4 months post-SABR, electrical isolation of the SABR lesion was confirmed using LA posterior wall pacing, and histopathological review was performed. Electrical isolation of all PVs and the LA posterior wall was achieved in three of five dogs in the 4-month group. There was one target failure and one sudden death at 15 weeks. Although two dogs in the 6-week group failed to achieve electrical lesion isolation, the irradiated atrial myocardium showed diffuse hemorrhage with inflammatory cell infiltration. In successfully isolated 4-month model dogs, we observed transmural fibrotic scarring with extensive fibrosis on irradiated atrial tissue. The findings suggest that this novel circular box-design radiotherapy technique using SABR could be applied to humans after further studies are conducted to confirm safety.","Chang, Ji Hyun; Cha, Myung-Jin; Seo, Jeong-Wook; Kim, Hak Jae; Park, So-Yeon; Kim, Byoung Hyuck; Lee, Euijae; Kim, Moo-Kang; Yoon, Hye-Sun; Oh, Seil",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91660-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117284/,132
96178,"The Impact of Early Epidural Discontinuation on Pain, Opioid Usage, and Length of Stay After Periacetabular Osteotomy.",2020-06-10,"X-ray microtomography (micro-CT), one of the most resourceful instruments for high resolution 3D analysis, can provide qualitative and quantitative accurate structural and compositional information for a broad range of materials. Yet its contribution to the field of biopolymeric materials science is often limited by low imaging contrast due to scarce X-ray attenuation features, particularly for sponges and foam-like structures. This limitation can be overcome to some extent by adjusting the working parameters of micro-CT equipment. However, such approach also facilitates noise and artefacts, and solving the signal-to-noise trade-off has been always problematic. Searching for alternatives turns one's attention towards the improvement of X-ray attenuation features. While several studies report the use of contrast agents for biological materials, studies to integrate multiple micro-CT approaches for biopolymers were not conducted so far. This method paper is thus aimed to serve as a platform for micro-CT analysis of low X-ray absorptive polymers. Here, several contrast enhancing artifices were developed and trialled on gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol) biopolymer composites (GP). Accordingly, GP were modified with iodine, barium, silver-based chemicals and hexa(methyl disilazane) by two different methods, i.e. addition of high atomic number chemicals during materials synthesis and post-synthesis staining, respectively. Consequently, cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy emerged as complementary characterization, aimed to confirm the reproducibility of samples morphological features. The most versatile methods were barium chloride additive incorporation and iodine staining coupled with hexa(methyl disilazane) chemical drying. Both methods significantly improved the X-ray absorbance of our polymeric samples, providing better contrast of micro-CT tomograms.","Crica, Livia Elena; Wengenroth, Jonas; Tiainen, Hanna; Ionita, Mariana; Haugen, Håvard Jostein",Journal of biomaterials science.

97495,Should We Trust Patient-Reported Outcomes?,2021,"Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) is a method for treating unresectable lesions of limbs in patients with melanoma or sarcoma by using high doses of tumor necrosis factor alpha and melphalan. These high doses can result in high systemic toxicity if there is a drug leak from the isolated circulation of the limb to the systemic. This makes it imperative to monitor the leakage rate (F[%]) during the infusion, currently performed with radiotracers. The objective of this work was to develop a leakage monitoring protocol as accurate as possible to ensure safe ILP. MATERIAL AND METHOD We built a phantom with 3compartments (body, limb and precordial area) and a high sensitivity collimator fitted to a portable gammacamera. We simulate ILP with scheduled leaks every 10minutes from 1% to 9% (theorical F[%]). We mesured F(%) using 2equation: one is the proposed in the literature and another corrected by decay of the radioisotope. We test the optimal radiopharmaceutical doses to minimize the detector dead time error and compare F(%) mesured by both equations regarding the theoretical F(%). The leakage monitoring protocol was used in 17 ILP of 16 patients and an analysis of the recorded data was performed. RESULTS We found significant differences between F(%) mesured using the first equation and theoretical F(%), obtaining results very adjusted to the theorical after applying the decay correction.

The Chicago Classification for esophageal motility disorders is based on a set of normative values for key metrics that was obtained using one of the commercially available HRM systems. Thus, it is of great importance to evaluate whether these normative values can be used for other HRM systems as well. PURPOSE In this review, we describe the presently available HRM systems, the currently known normative thresholds and the factors that influence them, and assess the use of these thresholds. Numerous factors including the type of HRM system, demographic factors, catheter diameter, body position during testing, consistency of bolus swallows, and esophageal length have an influence on the normative data. It would thus be ideal to have different sets of normal values for each of these factors, yet at the moment the amount of normative data is limited. We suggest broadening the normal range for parameters, as this would allow abnormal values to be of more significance. In addition, we suggest conducting studies to assess the physiological relevance of abnormal values and stress that for each system different normative thresholds may apply.","Herregods, T V K; Roman, S; Kahrilas, P J; Smout, A J P M; Bredenoord, A J",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.12500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545201/,132

We conducted an ecological momentary assessment study in which female undergraduate students (N = 146) completed a brief online survey at five random times every day for five days. In this survey, participants were asked if they had made an appearance comparison. If so, they were asked who they compared themselves to (i.e., close peer, acquaintance, stranger, celebrity/model), how they rated compared to that person (i.e., more attractive, just as attractive, less attractive), and how attainable that person's appearance is to them. All participants then completed state measures of mood, appearance satisfaction, and intention to diet and exercise. Upward comparisons (i.e., to more attractive others) to all targets were associated with less appearance satisfaction, lower positive mood, and more thoughts of dieting and exercising than when no comparisons were made. There were indirect relationships between comparisons to celebrities/models versus all other targets and appearance satisfaction via perceived attainability of the target's appearance. These findings suggest that celebrities may be particularly harmful appearance comparison targets in women's everyday lives because their attractive appearance is perceived to be less personally attainable than other targets.","Fardouly, Jasmine; Pinkus, Rebecca T; Vartanian, Lenny R",Body image,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bodyim.2021.04.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932884/,132
99625,Statement from JBJS.,2020-06-25,"Outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT) refers to the monitored provision of intravenous antibiotics for complicated infections outside of a hospital setting, typically in a rehabilitation facility, an infusion center, or the home. Home-based OPAT allows for safe completion of prolonged courses of therapy while decreasing costs to the healthcare system, minimizing the risk of hospital-related infectious exposures for patients, and permitting patients to recover in a familiar environment. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, during which nursing facilities have been at the center of many outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, completion of antimicrobial therapy in the home is an even more appealing option. Persons who inject drugs (PWID) frequently present with infectious complications of their injection drug use which require long courses of parenteral therapy. However, these individuals are frequently excluded from home-based OPAT on the basis of their addiction history. This commentary describes perceived challenges to establishing home-based OPAT for PWID, discusses ways in which this is discriminatory and unsupported by available data, highlights ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated inequities in care, and proposes a multidisciplinary approach championed by Addiction specialists to increasing implementation of OPAT for appropriate patients with substance use disorders.","Jawa, Raagini; Rozansky, Hallie; Clemens, Dylan; Fagan, Maura; Walley, Alexander Y",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870955/,132

La faible densité de la population canadienne et les populations en région éloignée posent un problème particulier à l’accès et à l’utilisation des soins chirurgicaux. Aucune synthèse des données sur les issues chirurgicales chez les Autochtones au Canada n’avait été publiée jusqu’à maintenant. MÉTHODES: Nous avons interrogé 4 bases de données pour recenser les études comparant les issues chirurgicales et les taux d’utilisation chez les adultes des Premières Nations, inuits et métis et chez les adultes non autochtones au Canada. Des évaluateurs indépendants ont réalisé toutes les étapes en parallèle. L’issue primaire était la mortalité; les issues secondaires comprenaient le taux d’utilisation des chirurgies, les complications et la durée du séjour à l’hôpital. Nous avons effectué une méta-analyse pour l’issue primaire à l’aide d’un modèle à effets aléatoires. Nous avons évalué les risques de biais à l’aide de l’outil ROBINS-I. RÉSULTATS: Vingt-huit études ont été analysées, pour un total de 1 976 258 participants (10,2 % d’Autochtones). Aucune étude ne portait précisément sur les populations inuites et métisses. Quatre études portant sur 7 cohortes ont fourni des données corrigées sur la mortalité pour 7135 participants (5,2 % d’Autochtones); les Autochtones présentaient un risque de décès après une intervention chirurgicale 30 % plus élevé que les patients non autochtones (rapport de risque combiné 1,30; IC à 95 % 1,09–1,54; I 2 = 81 %). Les complications étaient aussi plus fréquentes chez le premier groupe, notamment les infections (RC corrigé 1,63; IC à 95 % 1,13–2,34) et les pneumonies (RC 2,24; IC à 95 % 1,58–3,19). Les taux de différentes interventions chirurgicales étaient plus faibles, notamment pour les transplantations rénales, les arthroplasties, les chirurgies cardiaques et les accouchements par césarienne. INTERPRÉTATION: Les données disponibles sur les issues postopératoires et le taux d’utilisation de la chirurgie chez les Autochtones au Canada sont limitées et de faible qualité. Elles suggèrent que les Autochtones ont de plus hauts taux de décès et d’issues négatives postchirurgicales et qu’ils font face à des obstacles dans l’accès aux interventions chirurgicales. Ces conclusions indiquent qu’il y a un besoin de réévaluer en profondeur les soins chirurgicaux prodigués aux Autochtones au Canada pour leur assurer un accès équitable et améliorer les issues.

There is no consensus, however, on the most appropriate material to be used in a given situation. METHODS A literature review of published articles reporting the utilization of biological meshes in ventral/incisional hernia repair was conducted. Data were analyzed to compare the recurrence rates obtained with biological meshes. MAIN FINDINGS Only a few prospective comparative studies were identified. Most publications relate to AlloDerm®, Permacol™ and Surgisis™ with data from other meshes insufficient to draw conclusions. AlloDerm has a 0-100% recurrence rate among studies. It compares poorly with Surgisis and results in an unfavorable outcome when used as a 'bridge prosthesis'. Permacol has consistent recurrence rates of 0-15%, whatever the patients' profiles or the context of infected fields, when considering the most relevant studies. The Surgisis results are more conflicting: the mesh exhibits low recurrence rates in clean fields, but in infected fields the recurrence rate is up to 39%. CONCLUSION Taken together, these studies suggest that the cross-linked mesh, Permacol has the lowest failure rate and the longest time to failure, particularly in contaminated or infected fields. However, this data should be confirmed by large prospective randomized studies.","Smart, Neil J; Marshall, Morwena; Daniels, Ian R",The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2012.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22436406/,132

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has remained the only cure for β-TM in mainland China since 1998. METHODS This multicenter retrospective study provides a comprehensive review of the outcomes of 50 pediatric patients with β-TM who received HSCT between 1998 and 2009 at five centers in mainland China. Both related (n = 35) and unrelated donors (n = 15) with complete human leukocyte antigen matches were included. The stem cell sources included bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood stem cells, umbilical cord blood (UCB) and a combination of BM and UCB or a combination of BM and peripheral blood stem cells from a single sibling donor. RESULTS The probabilities of 5-year overall survival (OS) and thalassemia-free survival (TFS) after the first HSCT were 83.1 and 67.3%, respectively. Graft failure (GF) occurred in 17 patients. Univariate analyses showed that umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) was one of the potential risk factors for decreased OS (P = 0.051), and that UCBT (P = 0.002) was potentially related to TFS. GF incidence was distinct between the UCBT and non-UCBT groups (P = 0.004). Four cases of UCB-BM combined transplantation led to decreased risks of mortality and recurrence. In the UCBT group, related donor transplantation produced more favorable results than unrelated donor transplantation in OS (P = 0.009) but not in TFS (P = 0.217). CONCLUSIONS GF was the primary cause of UCBT failure. Though UCBT from related donors was not favorable, the combined transplantation of UCB and BM could improve the prognosis of UCBT.","Li, Xin-Yu; Sun, Xin; Chen, Jing; Qin, Mao-Quan; Luan, Zuo; Zhu, Yi-Ping; Fang, Jian-Pei",World journal of pediatrics : WJP,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12519-017-0107-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29511925/,132

102867,Surgical repair of the ruptured Achilles tendon: the cost-effectiveness of open versus percutaneous repair.,2013,"Highly reactive carbenes are usually produced by photolysis of ketenes, diazoalkanes, or diazirines. Sequential kinetic pathways for deactivation of nascent carbenes usually involve bimolecular reactions in competition with isomerization producing stable products such as alkenes. However, the direct photolytic production of stable products, effectively bypassing formation of free carbenes, has been postulated for over 50 years but remains very poorly understood. Often termed ""rearrangement in the excited state"" (RIES), examples include 1,2-hydrogen migration within photoexcited carbene precursors yielding alkenes and the Wolff rearrangement in photogenerated carbonyl-substituted carbenes producing ketenes. In this study, the two competing CO elimination channels from photoexcited gaseous dimethylketene, producing dimethylcarbene and propene, were studied as a function of electronic excitation energy, under collision-free conditions, by using photofragment translational energy spectroscopy with vacuum ultraviolet photoionization of the products. A significant fraction of the dimethylcarbene → propene isomerization exothermicity (∼300 kJ/mol) was released as propene + CO translational energy, indicating that propene is formed prior to or concurrent with CO elimination. An increase in the propene yield with increasing excitation energy suggests that the effective potential energy barrier for this channel lies ∼24 kJ/mol above the energetic threshold for dimethylcarbene formation via C═C bond fission. Possible mechanisms for direct propene elimination are discussed in light of the observed energy dependence for the competing pathways.","Datta, Sagnik; Davis, H Floyd",The journal of physical chemistry.

Although many investigators in randomized studies have noted the cosmetic advantages of SILC, the benefit of decreased pain in SILC remains controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the efficacy of the rectus sheath block in SILC with respect to subjective pain. METHODS From April 2010 to March 2012, 75 patients with symptomatic gallstone or gallbladder polyps were assigned to one of three groups: (i) four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (n = 29); (ii) SILC (n = 15); and (iii) rectus sheath block in SILC (n = 30). We evaluated the operative details, length of hospital stay, and the need and usage of analgesia. Postoperative pain was recorded at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h after surgery based on a visual analog scale. RESULTS There was no difference with regard to age, ASA score, BMI, duration of operation, or length of hospital stay among the three groups. A significantly lower pain score was observed in the rectus sheath block in SILC group than in the SILC group at 2 and 6 h after operation. The pain score and need for analgesia were similar between the SILC group and the four-port cholecystectomy group. CONCLUSION SILC using an ultrasound-guided rectus sheath block significantly reduces postoperative pain.","Kamei, Hideki; Ishibashi, Nobuya; Nakayama, Gouichi; Hamada, Nobuya; Ogata, Yutaka; Akagi, Yoshito",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12178; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25720303/,132

Many procedures have been reported that repair rectal prolapses, and the procedure used depends on the severity of the prolapse; however, the treatments are yet to be established. Here we report a simple and safe procedure to repair rectal prolapse perineally using stapling devices. We performed this procedure on 5 patients within a short time. All patients were followed up for over 24 months and none had any recurrences of their rectal prolapses. No complications occurred during the operations and postoperative periods. Most patients who have prolapses are elderly and fragile, so the treatment must be easy, safe, and rapid. While rectal prolapse is not life-threatening, the goal of treatment is to alleviate its symptoms. The procedure we describe is consistent with this concept. We suggest that this procedure, which uses surgical stapling devices, might be a better option for the treatment of complete rectal prolapse. We will continue to surgically correct complete rectal prolapses and investigate the long-term outcomes of the procedure.","Hata, Fumitake; Nishimori, Hidefumi; Ikeda, Shinichiro; Yajima, Tomomi; Nishio, Akihiko; Ishiyama, Yuji",Case reports in gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000354970; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24574948/,132
106399,A Bout of High Intensity Interval Training Lengthened Nerve Conduction Latency to the Non-exercised Affected Limb in Chronic Stroke.,2018,"Acute renal injury (AKI) causes a long-term risk for progressing into chronic kidney disease (CKD) and interstitial fibrosis. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a key transcriptional cofactor in Hippo signaling pathway, shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus, which is required for the renal tubular epithelial cells repair in the acute phase of AKI. In this study we investigated the role of YAP during ischemia-reperfusion (IR)-induced AKI to CKD. Mice were subjected to left kidney IR followed by removal of the right kidney on the day before tissue harvests. Mouse shRNA expression adenovirus (Ad-shYAP or Ad-shKLF4) and mouse KLF4 expression adenovirus (Ad-KLF4) were delivered to mice by intrarenal injection on D7 after IR. We showed that the expression and nucleus distribution of YAP were persistently increased until the end of experiment (D21 after IR). The sustained activation of YAP in post-acute phase of AKI was accompanied by renal dysfunction and interstitial fibrosis. Knockdown of YAP significantly attenuated IR-induced renal dysfunction and decreased the expression of fibrogenic factors TGF-β and CTGF in the kidney. We showed that the expression of the transcription factor KLF4, lined on the upstream of YAP, was also persistently increased. Knockdown on KLF4 attenuated YAP increase and nuclear translocation as well as renal functional deterioration and interstitial fibrosis in IR mice, whereas KLF4 overexpression caused opposite effects. KLF4 increased the expression of ITCH, and ITCH facilitated YAP nuclear translocation via degrading LATS1. Furthermore, we demonstrated in primary cultured renal tubular cells that KLF4 bound to the promoter region of YAP and positively regulates YAP expression. In biopsy sample from CKD patients, we also observed increased expression and nuclear distribution of YAP. In conclusion, the activation of YAP in the post-acute phase of AKI is implicated in renal functional deterioration and fibrosis although it exhibits beneficial effect in acute phase. Reprogramming factor KLF4 is responsible for the persistent activation of YAP. Blocking the activation of KLF4-YAP pathway might be a way to prevent the transition of AKI into CKD.","Xu, Dan; Chen, Pan-Pan; Zheng, Pei-Qing; Yin, Fan; Cheng, Qian; Zhou, Zhuan-Li; Xie, Hong-Yan; Li, Jing-Yao; Ni, Jia-Yun; Wang, Yan-Zhe; Chen, Si-Jia; Zhou, Li; Wang, Xiao-Xia; Liu, Jun; Zhang, Wei; Lu, Li-Min",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-0463-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647339/,132

The effects of parity and body condition of the dam, the duration of parturition, the time spent licking the calf, the sex and birth weight of the calf were also analyzed. Neonatal salivary cortisol concentrations were influenced neither by factors related to the dam (parity, body condition) nor the calf (sex, birth weight). The duration of parturition and the time spent licking the calf also had no effect on salivary cortisol levels. Salivary cortisol concentrations increased rapidly after delivery in both groups to reach their peak levels at 45 and 60 min after delivery in EUT and DYS calves, respectively supporting that the birth process means considerable stress for calves and the immediate postnatal period also appears to be stressful for newborn calves. DYS calves exhibited higher salivary cortisol concentrations compared to EUT ones for 0 (P = 0.022), 15 (P = 0.016), 30 (P = 0.007), 45 (P = 0.003), 60 (P = 0.001) and 120 min (P = 0.001), and for 24 h (P = 0.040), respectively. Peak levels of salivary cortisol and the cortisol release into saliva calculated as AUC were higher in DYS than in EUT calves for the 48-h of the sampling period (P = 0.009 and P = 0.003, respectively). The greater magnitude of saliva cortisol levels in DYS calves compared to EUT ones suggest that difficult parturition means severe stress for bovine neonates and salivary cortisol could be an opportunity for non-invasive assessment of stress during the early neonatal period in cattle.","Kovács, Levente; Kézér, Fruzsina Luca; Bodó, Szilárd; Ruff, Ferenc; Palme, Rupert; Szenci, Ottó",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85666-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737596/,132

The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the factors associated with maternal hypothermia in this setting. METHODS Women scheduled for elective or emergency CD were consecutively included in this study from November 2014 to October 2015. Maternal temperature was measured using an infrared tympanic thermometer on the patient's arrival in the operating room, at skin incision, and at the end of skin suture. Maternal hypothermia was defined by tympanic temperature < 36°C at the end of skin suture. Univariate analysis was performed, followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis, in order to determine the factors associated with maternal hypothermia at the end of the surgery. RESULTS Three hundred fifty-nine women were included and analyzed during this study. The incidence of hypothermia was 23% (95% confidence interval, 18 to 27) among the total population included. According to multivariate analysis, obesity, oxytocin augmentation of labour, and use of active forced-air warming were associated with a decreased risk of maternal hypothermia, while maternal temperature < 37.1°C on arrival in the operating room, maternal temperature < 36.6°C at skin incision, and an infused volume of fluids > 650 mL were significantly associated with maternal hypothermia. Both goodness of fit and predictive value of multivariate analysis were high. CONCLUSION Several predictive factors for maternal hypothermia during CD were identified.

METHODS This was a comparative study including two groups of participants: (1) general population in an online survey in Ya'an and Jingzhou cities during the COVID-19 outbreak from 10-20 February 2020; and (2) matching general population selected from the mental health survey in Ya'an in 2019 (from January to May 2019). General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) were used. RESULTS There were 1775 participants (Ya'an in 2019 and 2020: 537 respectively; Jingzhou in 2020: 701). Participants in Ya'an had a significantly higher rate of general health problems (GHQ scores ⩾3) in 2020 (14.7%) than in 2019 (5.2%) (p < 0.001). Compared with Ya'an (8.0%), participants in Jingzhou in 2020 had a significantly higher rate of anxiety (SAS scores ⩾50, 24.1%) (p < 0.001). Participants in Ya'an in 2020 had a significantly higher rate of depression (SDS scores ⩾53, 55.3%) than in Jingzhou (16.3%) (p < 0.001). The risk factors of anxiety symptoms included female, number of family members (⩾6 persons), and frequent outdoor activities. The risk factors of depression symptoms included participants in Ya'an and uptake self-protective measures. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of psychological symptoms has increased sharply in general population during the COVID-19 outbreak. People in COVID-19 severely affected areas may have higher scores of GHQ and anxiety symptoms. Culture-specific and individual-based psychosocial interventions should be developed for those in need during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Ran, Mao-Sheng; Gao, Ru; Lin, Jing-Xia; Zhang, Tian-Ming; Chan, Sherry Kit Wa; Deng, Xiao-Peng; Zhang, Bing-Zhi; Zhang, Xin-Feng; Huang, Guo-Ping; Pu, Dao-Shen; Bai, Jing-Zhen; Xu, Liu-Xiu; Liu, Bo",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291720004717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298220/,132

This study estimated the effects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Medicaid expansion on hospital finances in 2017 to update earlier findings. The analysis also explored how the ACA Medicaid expansion affects different types of hospitals by size, ownership, rurality, and safety-net status. We found that the early positive financial impact of Medicaid expansion was sustained in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as hospitals in expansion states continued to experience decreased uncompensated care costs and increased Medicaid revenue and financial margins. The magnitude of these impacts varied by hospital type. As COVID-19 has brought hospitals to a time of great need, findings from this study provide important information on what hospitals in states that have yet to expand Medicaid could gain through expansion and what is at risk should any reversal of Medicaid expansions occur.","Blavin, Fredric; Ramos, Christal",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.00502; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400570/,132

A prospective pilot study addressed the question if addition of FRWBH to re-irradiation is feasible in recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) with unfavorable prognostic features. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study completed accrual with the recruitment of ten patients between April 2018 and March 2020. Re-irradiation was administered using volumetric arc hyperfractionated radiotherapy with bi-daily 1.2 Gray (Gy) single fractions and a total dose of 66 Gy to all macroscopic tumor lesions. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted mostly of cisplatin (7 patients). FRWBH was scheduled weekly during re-irradiation. The study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (NCT03547388). RESULTS Only five patients received all cycles of FRWBH. Poor patient compliance, active infections during treatment and study restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic were the main reasons for omitting FRWBH. No increase of acute toxicity was observed by FRWBH. Exploratory evaluation of outcome data suggests that FRWBH treatment according to protocol does not seem to have a detrimental effect on tumor control or survival and might even increase treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION FRWBH is difficult to apply concomitant to re-irradiation in HNSCC. No excess toxicity was observed in patients receiving FRWBH and exploratory analyses suggest potential anti-tumor activity and decreased patient-reported depression scores after FRWBH.","Zschaeck, Sebastian; Weingärtner, Julian; Ghadjar, Pirus; Wust, Peter; Mehrhof, Felix; Kalinauskaite, Goda; Ehrhardt, Vincent H; Hartmann, Vivian; Tinhofer, Ingeborg; Heiland, Max; Coordes, Annekatrin; Kofla, Grzegorz; Budach, Volker; Stromberger, Carmen; Beck, Marcus",Oral oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.oraloncology.2021.105240; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33626457/,132

Traditionally, surgical trainees acquired these skills in the operating room; however, operative time for residents has decreased with duty hour restrictions. As in other professions, video analysis may help maximize the learning experience. Objective To develop and evaluate a postoperative video-based coaching intervention for residents. Design, Setting, and Participants In this mixed methods analysis, 10 senior (postgraduate year 4 and 5) residents were videorecorded operating with an attending surgeon at an academic tertiary care hospital. Each video formed the basis of a 1-hour one-on-one coaching session conducted by the operative attending; although a coaching framework was provided, participants determined the specific content collaboratively. Teaching points were identified in the operating room and the video-based coaching sessions; iterative inductive coding, followed by thematic analysis, was performed. Main Outcomes and Measures Teaching points made in the operating room were compared with those in the video-based coaching sessions with respect to initiator, content, and teaching technique, adjusting for time. Results Among 10 cases, surgeons made more teaching points per unit time (63.0 vs 102.7 per hour) while coaching. Teaching in the video-based coaching sessions was more resident centered; attendings were more inquisitive about residents' learning needs (3.30 vs 0.28, P = .04), and residents took more initiative to direct their education (27% [198 of 729 teaching points] vs 17% [331 of 1977 teaching points], P < .001). Surgeons also more frequently validated residents' experiences (8.40 vs 1.81, P < .01), and they tended to ask more questions to promote critical thinking (9.30 vs 3.32, P = .07) and set more learning goals (2.90 vs 0.28, P = .11). More complex topics, including intraoperative decision making (mean, 9.70 vs 2.77 instances per hour, P = .03) and failure to progress (mean, 1.20 vs 0.13 instances per hour, P = .04) were addressed, and they were more thoroughly developed and explored. Excerpts of dialogue are presented to illustrate these findings. Conclusions and Relevance Video-based coaching is a novel and feasible modality for supplementing intraoperative learning. Objective evaluation demonstrates that video-based coaching may be particularly useful for teaching higher-level concepts, such as decision making, and for individualizing instruction and feedback to each resident.","Hu, Yue-Yung; Mazer, Laura M; Yule, Steven J; Arriaga, Alexander F; Greenberg, Caprice C; Lipsitz, Stuart R; Gawande, Atul A; Smink, Douglas S",JAMA surgery,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamasurg.2016.4619; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27973648/,132

Genome replication of EAV has been associated with modified intracellular membranes that are shaped into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs). We showed by immuno-electron microscopy that the DMVs induced in EAV-infected cells contain double-strand (ds)RNA molecules, presumed RNA replication intermediates, and are decorated with the autophagy marker protein microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3). Replication of EAV, however, was not affected in autophagy-deficient cells lacking autophagy-related protein 7 (ATG7). Nevertheless, colocalization of DMVs and LC3 was still observed in these knockout cells, which only contain the nonlipidated form of LC3. Although autophagy is not required, depletion of LC3 markedly reduced the replication of EAV. EAV replication could be fully restored in these cells by expression of a nonlipidated form of LC3. These findings demonstrate an autophagy-independent role for LC3 in EAV replication. Together with the observation that EAV-induced DMVs are also positive for ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase-like 1 (EDEM1), our data suggested that this virus, similarly to the distantly-related mouse hepatitis coronavirus, hijacks the ER-derived membranes of EDEMosomes to ensure its efficient replication.","Monastyrska, Iryna; Ulasli, Mustafa; Rottier, Peter J M; Guan, Jun-Lin; Reggiori, Fulvio; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Autophagy,https://doi.org/10.4161/auto.22743; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23182945/,132

It uses the latest Brazilian consumption survey (POF 2017/2018) to analyze the composition of household health spending and applies two thresholds of household consumption to identify households facing catastrophic expenditures and impoverishment due to health care payments. Results show that a third of households spend more than 10% of their budget on health, and the share of households facing financial hardship is significantly higher among the Brazilian poor (37% among the bottom consumption deciles). Medicines are the main contributor to component of OOP health spending, reaching 85% of all OOP payments for the lowest consumption deciles. Households with women as household head and those with heads with more years of schooling have higher probability of incurring catastrophic health spending. Yearly, more than 10 million Brazilians are pushed into poverty due to OOP health care payments, which represents a larger percentage of individuals (4.87%) than reported globally (2.5%) or among Latin America and Caribbean countries (1.8%). Conclusions: Despite the achievements in implementing universal health coverage in Brazil, challenges remain to guarantee financial protection to its population (especially the Brazilian poor).

112655,A systematic review of existing ageism scales.,2019,"We report on numerical simulations of late stage undulation growth in Dutcher films. Dutcher films are ultrathin trilayer films consisting of a fluid layer sandwiched in between two solid layers. The van der Waals forces acting across the film can result in the spontaneous formation of surface undulations and corrugations. The complex interplay between the van der Waals forces, the elastic deformation of the solid layers and the fluid dynamics of the sandwiched fluid essentially selects a wavelength of undulation which grows most rapidly. We show how the lateral deformations in the solid layers can be obtained from the elastic stretching free energy as a function of the height variations. Furthermore, these lateral deformations can be shown to contribute to a pressure normal to the film which influences the dynamics of fluctuation growth. By taking into consideration the large-amplitude elastic stretching effects we simulate the late stages of undulation growth including the contact between the upper and lower solid layers. As the area of contact between the solid layers increases the fluid is corralled into isolated pockets. Because our numerical model captures the full elasticity of the solid layers we show how internal forces can be incorporated into the system. As a demonstration, we simulate the effects of thermal mismatch between a small region of the film and the surrounding matrix and show how concentric grooves can be formed in Dutcher films.","Buxton, Gavin A; Clarke, Nigel",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b604790d; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680225/,132

There has been much interest in the use of three-dimensional (3D) engineered scaffolds (PLA) complexed with human gingival mesenchymal stem cells (hGMSCs) as a new therapeutic strategy to improve bone tissue regeneration. These devices can mimic a more favorable endogenous microenvironment for cells in vivo by providing 3D substrates which are able to support cell survival, proliferation and differentiation. The present study evaluated the in vitro and in vivo capability of bone defect regeneration of 3D PLA, hGMSCs, extracellular vesicles (EVs), or polyethyleneimine (PEI)-engineered EVs (PEI-EVs) in the following experimental groups: 3D-PLA, 3D-PLA + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + EVs, 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs. METHODS The structural parameters of the scaffold were evaluated using both scanning electron microscopy and nondestructive microcomputed tomography. Nanotopographic surface features were investigated by means of atomic force microscopy. Scaffolds showed a statistically significant mass loss along the 112-day evaluation. RESULTS Our in vitro results revealed that both 3D-PLA + EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs showed no cytotoxicity. However, 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs exhibited greater osteogenic inductivity as revealed by morphological evaluation and transcriptomic analysis performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, in vivo results showed that 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs + hGMSCs and 3D-PLA + PEI-EVs scaffolds implanted in rats subjected to cortical calvaria bone tissue damage were able to improve bone healing by showing better osteogenic properties. These results were supported also by computed tomography evaluation that revealed the repair of bone calvaria damage. CONCLUSION The re-establishing of the integrity of the bone lesions could be a promising strategy in the treatment of accidental or surgery trauma, especially for cranial bones.","Diomede, Francesca; Gugliandolo, Agnese; Cardelli, Paolo; Merciaro, Ilaria; Ettorre, Valeria; Traini, Tonino; Bedini, Rossella; Scionti, Domenico; Bramanti, Alessia; Nanci, Antonio; Caputi, Sergio; Fontana, Antonella; Mazzon, Emanuela; Trubiani, Oriana",Stem cell research & therapy,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13287-018-0850-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653587/,132

In this work, novel ZnO/biochar nanocomposites were synthesized using a facile ball-milling method. A series of characterization results showed that the ZnO nanoparticles dispersed uniformly on carbon surface within the biochar matrix. Ball milling increased the mesopores and macropores of the nanocomposites by breaking biochar and squeezing ZnO. The addition of appropriate amount of ZnO into biochar enhanced both the adsorption capacity and photocatalytic ability of the nanocomposites for methylene blue (MB) removal. When the initial concentration of MB was 160 mg/g, the nanocomposites exhibited high MB removal efficiency (up to 95.19%) under visible light through the combination of adsorption and photocatalysis.

There is concern that the relaxation may increase fatal overdose rates. This study examines opioid treatment program (OTP) changes to methadone treatment during COVID-19 and changes in fatal methadone-involved overdose rates in Connecticut. METHODS From July 8th to August 18th, 2020, we conducted a comprehensive state-wide survey of all eight OTPs that dispense methadone in Connecticut to examine programmatic changes during COVID-19. We also analyzed state-level data on confirmed accidental opioid-involved deaths to assess if relaxation of take-home dosing restrictions and in-person attendance requirements correlated with increased methadone-involved fatal overdose rates. RESULTS OTPs reported implementing multiple changes to methadone treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The percent of patients receiving 28-day take-home doses increased from 0.1% to 16.8%, 14-day take-home doses increased from 14.2% to 26.8%, and the percent receiving one or no take-home doses decreased from 37.5% to 9.6%. Monthly or more frequent drug testing decreased from 15% to 4.6% and 75.2% of individual counseling for methadone patients transitioned to telehealth. However, changes to methadone treatment varied considerably by program. OTP providers said restrictions on methadone should be relaxed and increases in take-home dosing as well as telehealth should be continued in non-pandemic situations. Methadone-involved fatalities relative to other opioid-involved fatalities did not increase in Connecticut following changes in OTP practices. CONCLUSIONS Connecticut OTPs relaxed methadone treatment requirements during COVID-19. Since relaxing restrictions on methadone treatment has not increased fatal overdoses, we recommend that the reductions in-person dosing and attendance requirements implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should be continued and made permanent.","Brothers, Sarah; Viera, Adam; Heimer, Robert",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108449; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34098303/,132

In agreement with that observation, nsp4 was shown to be engaged in homotypic and heterotypic interactions, the latter with nsp3 and nsp6. In addition, the coexpression of nsp4 with nsp3 affected the subcellular localization of the two proteins.","Hagemeijer, Marne C; Ulasli, Mustafa; Vonk, Annelotte M; Reggiori, Fulvio; Rottier, Peter J M; de Haan, Cornelis A M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00042-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21345958/,132
119799,Hyperferritinemia in patients with COVID-19: An opportunity for iron chelation?,2020-09-03,"Pharmacogenomics, nutrigenomics, vaccinomics, and the nascent field of plant omics are examples of variability science. They are embedded within an overarching framework of personalized medicine. Across these public health specialties, the significance and biology of the placebo response have been historically neglected. A placebo is any substance such as a sugar pill administered in the guise of medication, but one that does not have pharmacological activity. Placebos do have clinical effects, however, that can be substantive in magnitude and vary markedly from person-to-person depending, for example, on the type of disease, symptoms, or clinical trial design. Research over the past several decades attests to a genuine neurobiological basis for placebo effects. All drugs have placebo components that contribute to their overall treatment effect. Placebos are used in clinical trials as control groups to ascertain the net pharmacological effect of a drug candidate. Not only less well known but also relevant to rational therapeutics and personalized medicine is the nocebo. A nocebo effect occurs when an inert substance is administered in a context that induces negative expectations, worsening patients' symptoms. With the COVID-19 pandemic, there are high public expectations for new vaccines and medicines to end the contagion, while at the same time antiscience, post-truth, and antivaccine movements are worrisomely on the rise. These social movements, changes in public health cultures, and conditioned behavioral responses can trigger both placebo and nocebo effects. Hence, in clinical trials, forecasting and explaining placebo and nocebo variability are more important than ever for robust science and personalized health care. Against this overarching context, this article provides (1) a brief history of placebo and (2) a discussion on biology, mechanisms, and variability of placebo effects, and (3) discusses three emerging new concepts: placebogenomics, nocebogenomics, and augmented placebo, that is, the notion of a ""placebo dose."" We conclude with a roadmap for placebogenomics, its synergies with the nascent field of social pharmacology, and the ways in which a new taxonomy of drug and placebo variability can be anticipated in the next decade.","Özdemir, Vural; Endrenyi, Laszlo",Omics : a journal of integrative biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/omi.2020.0208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33305994/,132

120256,Lung transplantation protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic: a single center experience.,2021-04-01,"INTRODUCTION Bisphosphonates are commonly used in the treatment of metabolic bone disease. However, they are associated with gastrointestinal side effects including acid reflux, mucosal erosion, and oesophageal stricture. We present a rare case of alendronate causing perforated gastric volvulus in a patient with giant hiatus hernia. PRESENTATION OF CASE An 82-year-old woman presented to our hospital with central chest pain, palpitations and new onset atrial fibrillation on the background of 2 weeks of vomiting. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a perforated, mixed type organoaxial/mesoenteroaxial gastric volvulus within a giant hiatus hernia, with partial gastric outlet obstruction. The patient underwent laparoscopic reduction of hiatus hernia and gastric volvulus, conversion to laparotomy, and distal gastrectomy with Bilroth II reconstruction. An alendronate tablet was found in the right mediastinum. The patient had a prolonged post-operative course and was discharged home after completing extensive physical rehabilitation. DISCUSSION Bisphosphonates are widely used to treat metabolic bone disease, however can have devastating adverse effects on the gastrointestinal tract. There are a number of mechanisms postulated for how these medications cause injury to the gastric and oesophageal mucosa. CONCLUSION This case illustrates the importance of considering the gastrointestinal effects associated with bisphosphonates when prescribing them to patients, especially those with functional or anatomical disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The presence of a large hiatus hernia should be a contraindication to prescribing alendronate.","Kwan, Bianca; Wong, Jason",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.06.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32622185/,132
120454,Diagnosing Nonfunctional Pancreatic NETs in MEN1: The Evidence Base.,2018,"BACKGROUND Human parechoviruses are a major cause of CNS infection in neonates and young children. They have been implicated in neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay. However, the magnitude of this effect has not been systematically reviewed or assessed with meta-analyses. We investigated short-term, medium-term, and long-term neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay in neonates and young children after parechovirus-CNS-infection. METHODS In this systematic review and meta-analyses of studies, we searched PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo, from the inception of the database until March 18, 2019, for reviews, systematic reviews, cohort studies, case series, and case control studies reporting on neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes of children 3 months or younger with parechovirus infection of the CNS. Studies that were published after Dec 31, 2007, assessed children younger than 16 years, detailed parechoviruses infection of the CNS (confirmed by PCR), and followed up on neurological and neurodevelopmental outcomes were included. Studies published before Dec 31, 2007, were excluded. The predefined primary outcomes were the proportions of children with neurological sequelae, impairment in auditory or visual functions, or gross motor function delay. The proportion of children in whom neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported was pooled in meta-analyses. For each outcome variable we calculated the pooled proportion with 95% CI. The proportion of children in whom neurological or neurodevelopmental outcomes were reported was extracted by one author and checked by another. Two authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the studies. FINDINGS 20 studies were eligible for quantitative synthesis. The meta-analyses showed an increasing proportion of children with neurological sequelae over time: 5% during short-term follow-up (pooled proportion 0·05 [95% CI 0·03-0·08], I2=0·00%; p=0·83) increasing to 27% during long-term follow-up (0·27 [0·17-0·40], I2=52·74%; p=0·026). The proportion of children with suspected neurodevelopmental delay was 9% or more during long-term follow-up. High heterogeneity and methodological issues in the included studies mean that the results should be interpreted with caution. INTERPRETATION This systematic review suggests the importance of long follow-up, preferably up to preschool or school age (5-6 years), of children with parechovirus infection of the CNS. Although not clinically severe, we found an increasing proportion of neonates and young children with CNS infection had associated neurological sequelae and neurodevelopmental delay over time. We recommend the use of standardised methods to assess neurological and neurodevelopmental functions of these children and to compare results with age-matched reference groups.

122500,Outcomes for Patients Following Hospitalization for COVID-19.,2021-03-17,"BACKGROUND Placement of a primary gastrojejunal tube (GJT) can be technically challenging and often requires an open procedure to negotiate the tube past the duodenal sweep into the jejunum. The alternative approach is to first place a gastrostomy tube (GT), which is then changed to a GJT under endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidance after waiting 6-8 weeks to allow the stoma to mature. We report a case series of primary GJT placement using a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic approach. SUBJECTS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement. Patients' demographics and relevant clinical information were analyzed. RESULTS Six patients (4 male, 2 female) were identified. The median age at the time of operation was 30.2 months (range, 28 days-10 years). Five GJTs were successfully placed laparoscopically/endoscopically, and one procedure was converted to open. The mean operative time was 84 minutes (range, 63-102 minutes). Postoperative abdominal radiography confirmed post-pyloric tube position in all patients. Feedings were initiated on the first postoperative day. One intraoperative complication required conversion to an open procedure. No patients developed postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic-endoscopic primary GJT placement is technically feasible and an excellent alternative in patients who require transpyloric feeding access.","Castle, Shannon L; Speer, Allison L; Torres, Manuel B; Anselmo, Dean M; Nguyen, Nam X",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

123203,Predictive role of FAR ratio in Covid-19 patients.,2021-10-04,"BACKGROUND Application of a mesh in presence of pneumoperitoneum may cause deformation or wave formation when gas is released. Moreover, mesh shrinkage during subsequent wound healing cannot be detected in vivo without invasive diagnostics. Using MRI-visible polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) mesh, the extend of mesh deformation and shrinkage could be objectified by MRI for the first time. MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh (IPOM) implantation was performed in 10 female rabbits using ferro-oxide loaded PVDF meshes. MRI measurements were performed postoperatively at days 1 and 90. After three-dimensional reconstruction of all MRI images the total surface and the effective surface of the implanted mesh were explored and calculated computer-assisted. RESULTS In all cases, the mesh could be identified in MRI. The subsequent three-dimensional reconstruction always allowed a calculation of the mesh area. In relation to the original size of the used textile implant, we found neither a significant reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of the pneumoperitoneum at day 1 after laparoscopic surgery nor a significant change of the total surface of this large pore mesh by the end of the observation period. CONCLUSIONS In vivo investigation of mesh surface via MRI could exclude a significant initial reduction of the effective mesh surface after release of pneumoperitoneum, in this IPOM rabbit model. A further subsequent shrinkage of these large pore PVDF meshes could be excluded, as well. Imaging of MRI-visible IPOM mesh turned out to be a sufficient tool to objectify mesh configuration and position in vivo.","Otto, Jens; Kuehnert, Nicolas; Kraemer, Nils A; Ciritsis, Alexander; Hansen, Nienke Lynn; Kuhl, Christiane; Busch, Daniel; Peter Neumann, Ulf; Klinge, Uwe; Conze, Klaus-Joachim","Journal of biomedical materials research.

124283,"What's Important: Orthopaedics, a Pandemic, and Poetry.",2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND Pelvic organ prolapse (POP) represents a common female pelvic floor disorder that has a serious impact on quality of life. Several types of procedures with different surgical approaches have been described to correct these defects, but the optimal management is still debated. OBJECTIVE To describe our surgical technique of robot-assisted sacrocolpopexy (RASC) for POP and to assess its safety and long-term outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of the medical records of 95 consecutive patients who underwent RASC for POP at our centre from April 2006 to December 2011 was performed. SURGICAL PROCEDURE RASC with use of polypropylene meshes was performed in all cases using a standardised technique with the da Vinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in a four-arm configuration. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Clinical data were collected in a dedicated database. Intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, and outcomes of RASC were assessed. A descriptive statistical analysis was performed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS Median operative time was 101 min. No conversion to open surgery was needed. One vaginal and two bladder injuries occurred and were repaired intraoperatively. Only one Clavien grade 3 postoperative complication was observed (bowel obstruction treated laparoscopically). At a median follow-up of 34 mo, persistent POP was observed in four cases (4.2%). One mesh erosion occurred and required robot-assisted removal of the mesh. Ten (10.5%) patients complained de novo urgency after RASC, which resolved in the first few weeks after surgery. No significant de novo bowel or sexual symptoms were reported. CONCLUSIONS Our technique of RASC for correction of POP is safe and effective, with limited risk of complications and good long-term results in the treatment of all types of POP. The robotic surgical system facilitates precise and accurate placement of the meshes with short operative time, thereby favouring wider diffusion of minimally invasive treatment of POP. PATIENT SUMMARY We studied the treatment of patients with vaginal prolapse by using a robot-assisted surgical technique to fix the vaginal wall with a synthetic mesh. This technique was found to be safe and effective, with limited risk of complications and good long-term results.","Ploumidis, Achilles; Spinoit, Anne-Françoise; De Naeyer, Geert; Schatteman, Peter; Gan, Melanie; Ficarra, Vincenzo; Volpe, Alessandro; Mottrie, Alexandre",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2013.05.054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23806518/,132

Diagnosis is challenging, especially in mild forms, leading to unnecessary periods of cessation of enteral feeding. This study aimed at establishing a prognosis score of enteropathy combining clinical parameters and faecal calprotectin concentration. METHODS This prospective multicentric study included preterm neonates born at a gestational age of 33 weeks or less. Stools were collected weekly until hospital discharge, and daily in case of digestive events for calprotectin measurement (ELISA and immunochromatography) and microbiota analyses (16S rRNA gene sequencing). RESULTS Among the 121 neonates included, 21 experienced at least one episode of enteropathy, mainly mild forms. By ELISA testing, median faecal calprotectin was 88 (8-798) µg/g faeces. No statistically significant association was found between the outset of enteropathy and maternal and neonatal characteristics, and calprotectin levels. The agreement between ELISA and immunochromatography assay was moderate (intra-class correlation coefficient 0.58, 95%CI [0.47-0.66]). Comparison of species diversity and relative bacterial abundance profiles between infants with or without enteropathy revealed no specific alterations associated with enteropathy. CONCLUSION The study failed to propose a prognostic score of enteropathy, probably due the large inter- and intra-individual variability of faecal calprotectin in very preterm neonates.","Campeotto, Florence; Elie, Caroline; Rousseau, Clotilde; Giuseppi, Agnès; Hachem, Taymme; Gobalakichenane, Ponny; Le Touzey, Mathilde; de Stefano, Marie; Butel, Marie-José; Kapel, Nathalie",Acta paediatrica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apa.15354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418251/,132
126010,Readmissions among Patients with COVID-19.,2020-09-07,"BACKGROUND Readiness to change is a pivotal construct for psychotherapy research and a major target of motivational interventions. Our primary objective was to examine whether pre-treatment readiness to change moderated therapy effects of Bridging Intervention in Anesthesiology (BRIA), an innovative psychotherapy approach for surgical patients. This stepped care program aims at motivating and supporting surgical patients with mental disorders to engage in psychosocial mental health care. METHODS The major steps of BRIA are two motivational interventions with different intensity. The first step of the program consists of preoperative computer-assisted psychosocial self-assessment including screening for psychological distress and automatically composed computerized brief written advice (BWA). In the second step, patients participate in postoperative psychotherapy sessions combining motivational interviewing with cognitive behavioural therapy (BRIA psychotherapy sessions). We performed regression-based moderator analyses on data from a recent randomized controlled trial published by our research group. The sample comprised 220 surgical patients with diverse comorbid mental disorders according to ICD-10. The most frequent disorders were mood, anxiety, substance use and adjustment disorders. The patients had a mean age of 43.31 years, and 60.90% were women. In a regression model adjusted for pre-treatment psychological distress, we investigated whether readiness to change moderated outcome differences between (1) the BRIA psychotherapy sessions and (2) no psychotherapy / BWA only. RESULTS Multiple regression analyses showed that readiness to change moderated treatment effects regarding the primary outcomes ""Participation in psychosocial mental health care options at month 6"" (p = 0.03) and ""Having approached psychosocial mental health care options at month 6"" (p = 0.048) but not regarding the secondary outcome ""Change of general psychological distress between baseline assessment and month 6"" (p = 0.329). Probing the moderation effect with the Johnson-Neyman technique revealed that BRIA psychotherapy sessions were superior to BWA in patients with low to moderate readiness, but not in those with high readiness. CONCLUSIONS Readiness to change may act as moderator of the efficacy of psychosocial therapy. Combinations of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioural therapy may be effective particularly in patients with a variety of mental disorders and low readiness to change.

MATERIAL AND METHODS DSCTA was performed in 42 patients, using either 120 kVp tube voltage, 120 mAS tube current, 2.4 pitch and filtered back projection, or 100 kVp tube voltage, 100 mAs tube current, 3.2 pitch, and sinogram affirmed iterative reconstruction. Measurements of vessel attenuation, of the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were performed to objectively evaluate image quality. Two readers evaluated subjective image quality and image noise, using a four-point scale. Effective dose was used to compare the differences in radiation dose. RESULTS Low-dose protocol application showed significantly higher vessel opacification (p = 0.013), and non-significantly higher CNR and SNR values. There was no difference in the subjective image quality and image noise reading between the protocols. Effective dose was significantly lower using the low-dose protocol (1.29 ± 0.21 mSv vs. 2.92 ± 0.72 mSv; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The combined use of reduced tube voltage, reduced tube current, and iterative reconstruction reduces radiation dose by 55.4% in high-pitch DSCTA of the supraaortic arteries without impairment of image quality.","Beitzke, Dietrich; Nolz, Richard; Unterhumer, Sylvia; Plank, Christina; Weber, Michael; Schernthaner, Rüdiger; Schöpf, Veronika; Wolf, Florian; Loewe, Christian",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0099832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24919195/,132

Moench) is a widely used medicinal and ornamental plant. In the present study, the callus embryogenesis was examined using benzyl adenine (BA) at three levels (3, 4, 5 mg L-1), 1-Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) at three levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg L-1) with or without activated charcoal (1 g L-1), coconut milk (50 ml L-1) and casein hydrolysate (50 mg L-1) in the MS (Murashige and Skoog 1962) medium. The embryogenesis indirectly occurred with the production of callus. The calli were observed in three forms: undifferentiated, embryogenic and organogenic. The embryogenic calli were dark green and coherent with a faster growth rate. The highest embryogenesis (100%) and embryonic regeneration (plantlet production) were obtained in the combined BA + NAA treatments with the activated charcoal, coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. However, the combined treatments of growth regulators failed to produce somatic embryos without the use of coconut milk and casein hydrolysate. The maximum amount of protein, peroxidase and catalase activity of embryogenic calli (2.02, 1.79 and 6.62ΔOD/Min/mg.protein, respectively), and highest percentage of acclimatization success (29.3% of plants) were obtained in the combined treatment of 5 mg L-1 BA + 0.5 mg L-1 NAA + activated charcoal + coconut milk + casein hydrolysate.

128770,The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and low back pain among Italian nurses: An observational study.,2020-11-30,"Wandering spleen is a condition in which an incomplete fusion of the splenic ligaments allows the spleen to move within the abdomen, predisposing it to splenic torsion along its vascular pedicle. Torsion of a wandering spleen is an uncommon occurrence, especially in children, and associated torsion of the distal pancreas is even more unusual, with only four cases having been reported in adults. Non-specific clinical presentation makes radiologic evaluation essential in order to obtain a diagnosis and to send the patient for early surgery before life-threatening complications arise. Here we present a rare case of torsion of wandering spleen together with volvulus of the distal pancreas in a 13-year-old girl. In this case, prompt radiological assessment allowed for an early diagnosis, and the patient was successfully treated with urgent laparoscopic derotation of both the spleen and the distal pancreas as well as mesh splenopexy. To the best of our knowledge, this procedure has never been described in a pediatric setting.","Torri, Fabio; Parolini, Filippo; Vanzetti, Enrico; Milianti, Susanna; Cheli, Maurizio; Alberti, Daniele",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12188; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26303736/,132
130471,From the Eye of the Storm: Multi-Institutional Practical Perspectives on Neuroradiology from the COVID-19 Outbreak in New York City.,2020-04-30,"Deep learning based medical image segmentation is an important step within diagnosis, which relies strongly on capturing sufficient spatial context without requiring too complex models that are hard to train with limited labelled data. Training data is in particular scarce for segmenting infection regions of CT images of COVID-19 patients. Attention models help gather contextual information within deep networks and benefit semantic segmentation tasks. The recent criss-cross-attention module aims to approximate global self-attention while remaining memory and time efficient by separating horizontal and vertical self-similarity computations. However, capturing attention from all non-local locations can adversely impact the accuracy of semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new Dynamic Deformable Attention Network (DDANet) that enables a more accurate contextual information computation in a similarly efficient way. Our novel technique is based on a deformable criss-cross attention block that learns both attention coefficients and attention offsets in a continuous way. A deep U-Net [1] segmentation network that employs this attention mechanism is able to capture attention from pertinent non-local locations and also improves the performance on semantic segmentation tasks compared to criss-cross attention within a U-Net on a challenging COVID-19 lesion segmentation task. Our validation experiments show that the performance gain of the recursively applied dynamic deformable attention blocks comes from their ability to capture dynamic and precise attention context. Our DDANet achieves Dice scores of 73.4% and 61.3% for Ground-glass opacity and consolidation lesions for COVID-19 segmentation and improves the accuracy by 4.9% points compared to a baseline U-Net and 24.4% points compared to current state of art methods [2].","Rajamani, Kumar T; Siebert, Hanna; Heinrich, Mattias P",Journal of biomedical informatics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2021.103816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34022421/,132
130852,COVID-19 and diabetes: What have we learned so far?,2020-05-22,"PURPOSE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a relatively newer treatment modality for treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and only a few small studies have examined the short- and long-term outcomes for MWA applied to renal tumors. The purpose of this retrospective review is to assess the initial experience including technical short- and long-term success rates of using radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and MWA for RCC at a single Veterans Affairs (VA) medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS Tumor characteristics were recorded using the R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score. Group comparisons were performed by using univariate logistic regression analysis to determine factors affecting primary treatment success, failure, and effectiveness. Kaplan-Meier local tumor progression-free survival following ablation was calculated. RESULTS MWA and RFA groups were not significantly different in primary treatment success (P = 0.82). MWA primary treatment success (90.2%) was not associated with R.E.N.A.L criteria, whereas primary success in the RFA group (88.2%) was predicted by smaller tumor size (P = 0.002). Primary treatment effectiveness rates were not significantly different in MWA (88.2%) and RFA (80.3%) groups (P = 0.29). Although overall primary technique effectiveness was associated with size (P = 0.02), univariate analysis showed a significant association between tumor size and primary effectiveness for RFA (P = 0.002) but not MWA. There was no significant association between R.E.N.A.L score or criteria and primary treatment effectiveness in the RFA or MWA groups. CONCLUSION RFA and MWA both represent effective treatment modalities for RCC; larger tumor size may be associated with decreased efficacy of thermal ablation techniques.","Abboud, Salim E; Patel, Tanay; Soriano, Stephanie; Giesler, Joseph; Alvarado, Nannette; Kang, Preet",Current problems in diagnostic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1067/j.cpradiol.2017.05.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28648469/,132

Further, this study demonstrated that properly enabled DNA vaccination has the potential to trigger very significant cell-based immune responses in dogs, establishing needle-free transdermal plasmid delivery as a critical technology for successful immunotherapy of cancer and/or chronic infectious diseases in companion animal medicine.","Goubier, A; Fuhrmann, L; Forest, L; Cachet, N; Evrad-Blanchard, M; Juillard, V; Fischer, L",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.01.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18395307/,132
131888,"Ageing, sex, obesity, smoking and COVID-19 - truths, myths and speculations.",2020,"OBJECTIVES We sought to evaluate the safety, efficacy and feasibility of same-day discharge after uncomplicated, minimalist TAVR. BACKGROUND At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we created a same-day discharge (SDD) pathway after conscious sedation, transfemoral (minimalist) TAVR to help minimize risk of viral transmission and conserve hospital resources. Studies support that next-day discharge (NDD) for carefully selected patients following minimalist TAVR is safe and feasible. There is a paucity of data regarding the safety of SDD after TAVR. METHODS In-hospital and 30 day outcomes of consecutive patients meeting pre-specified criteria for SDD after minimalist TAVR at our institution between March and July of 2020 were reviewed. Outcomes were compared to a NDD cohort from July 2018 through July 2020 that would have met SDD criteria. Primary endpoints were mortality, delayed pacemaker placement, stroke and cardiovascular readmission at 30 days. RESULTS Twenty nine patients were discharged via the SDD pathway after TAVR. 128 prior NDD patients were identified who met all criteria for SDD. The STS scores were similar between the two groups (SDD 2.6% ±1.5 vs. NDD 2.3% ± 1.2). There were no deaths at 30 days in either group. There was no significant difference in delayed pacemaker placement (SDD 0% vs. NDD 0.8%, p > .99) or cardiovascular readmission (SDD 0% vs. NDD 5.5%, p = .35) at 30 days. CONCLUSIONS Same day discharge following uncomplicated, minimalist TAVR in selected patients appears to be safe, achieving similar 30 day outcomes as a cohort of next day discharge patients.","Perdoncin, Emily; Greenbaum, Adam B; Grubb, Kendra J; Babaliaros, Vasilis C; Keegan, Patricia; Ceretto-Clark, Brendan; Wei, Jane; Guyton, Robert A; Paone, Gaetano; Byku, Isida; Gleason, Patrick T; Biven, Kelby; Mathew, Preethy; Mortorano, Cecilia; Inci, Errol K; Faaborg-Andersen, Christian; Mitchell, Rae; Devireddy, Chandan M",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29453; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33382519/,132

Provider documentation data collected by the electronic health record (EHR) represents an underutilized tool for assessing the provider experience. Through Epic Signal, we collected data regarding the actions logged in the EHR by health care providers of the Montefiore Health System (Bronx, NY) before and after the implementation of telemedicine during the pandemic. Focusing on five metrics (appointments per day, visits closed same day, time spent outside 7 AM-7 PM, time spent on unscheduled days, and pajama time), we performed a preliminary analysis of providers across the institution, by specialty, and according to demographic characteristics such as gender and years since graduation. We observed that after telemedicine implementation, a greater proportion of providers had fewer appointments per day, closed more notes same day, and spent less time in the EHR outside of normal working hours for each of the time-related metrics. We additionally found that providers who graduated longer ago as well as female providers spent more time documenting in the EHR after hours. This brief analysis highlights the potential of using EHR data to inform decisions based on provider well-being, specifically in the setting of telemedicine implementation.","Beiser, Moshe; Lu, Vivian; Paul, Soaptarshi; Ni, Jason; Nazar, Nijas; Epstein, Eric; Mammen, Adrin; Short, Jeffrey; Tomer, Yaron; Jariwala, Sunit P",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0490; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600728/,132

Here we evaluated the transcriptomic responses of the model cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme after exposure to each of these conditions. Overall, response to UVA was characterized by more gene down-regulation than the UVB or ROS response, although UVB affected over four-fold more genes than UVA or ROS. Regarding expression patterns, responses to UVA and ROS were more similar and differentiated from those to UVB. For example, genes involved in ROS metabolism were up-regulated under both UVA and ROS. However, when it came to RNA and protein metabolism, there were more up-regulated genes under UVB and ROS compared to UVA. This suggests that the response to UVB and ROS is more active than the response to UVA, which stimulated more genes in secondary metabolism. Histidine kinases and response regulators were often differentially expressed, demonstrating that regulatory systems were at the base of the patterns. This study provides background for future studies targeting different genes, proteins, and systems sensitive to these conditions. It also highlights the significance of considering multiple stress conditions.","Soule, Tanya; Ferreira, Daniela; Lothamer, Justin; Garcia-Pichel, Ferran",Photochemistry and photobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955032/,132

Here, to identify factors that might play a role in conveying epigenetic memory through cell division, we report on the isolation of unfixed, native chromosomes from metaphase-arrested cells using flow cytometry and perform LC-MS/MS to identify chromosome-bound proteins. A quantitative proteomic comparison between metaphase-arrested cell lysates and chromosome-sorted samples reveals a cohort of proteins that were significantly enriched on mitotic ESC chromosomes. These include pluripotency-associated transcription factors, repressive chromatin-modifiers such as PRC2 and DNA methyl-transferases, and proteins governing chromosome architecture. Deletion of PRC2, Dnmt1/3a/3b or Mecp2 in ESCs leads to an increase in the size of individual mitotic chromosomes, consistent with de-condensation. Similar results were obtained by the experimental cleavage of cohesin. Thus, we identify chromosome-bound factors in pluripotent stem cells during mitosis and reveal that PRC2, DNA methylation and Mecp2 are required to maintain chromosome compaction.","Djeghloul, Dounia; Patel, Bhavik; Kramer, Holger; Dimond, Andrew; Whilding, Chad; Brown, Karen; Kohler, Anne-Céline; Feytout, Amelie; Veland, Nicolas; Elliott, James; Bharat, Tanmay A M; Tarafder, Abul K; Löwe, Jan; Ng, Bee L; Guo, Ya; Guy, Jacky; Huseyin, Miles K; Klose, Robert J; Merkenschlager, Matthias; Fisher, Amanda G",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17823-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807789/,132

It is worth to highlight the use of the developed model as a tool to analyze the influence of the temperature on the performance of microalgae cultures at large scale. As example, the annual variation of the performance of up to five different microalgae strains has been determined by computing the temperature index, thus the normalized value of performance of whatever microalgae at the real temperature with respect to that achievable at optimal temperature can be established.

138253,Workflow management for COVID-19 patients needing an urgent neurosurgical procedure.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is a widely prevalent yet manageable condition that has been linked to neurocognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple barriers hinder older individuals from being diagnosed with ARHL through pure-tone audiometry. This is especially true during the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the closure of many outpatient audiology and otolaryngology offices. Smartphone-based hearing assessment apps may overcome these challenges by enabling patients to remotely self-administer their own hearing exam. The objective of this review is to provide an up-to-date overview of current mobile health applications (apps) that claim to assess hearing. DESIGN Narrative review. METHODS AND MEASUREMENTS The Apple App Store and Google Play Store were queried for apps that claimed to assess hearing. Relevant apps were downloaded and used to conduct a mock hearing assessment. Names of included apps were searched on four literature databases (PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL) to determine which apps had been validated against gold standard methods. RESULTS App store searches identified 44 unique apps. Apps differed with respect to the type of test offered (e.g., hearing threshold test), cost, strategies to reduce ambient noise, test output (quantitative vs qualitative results), and options to export results. Validation studies were identified for seven apps. CONCLUSION Given their low cost and relative accessibility, smartphone-based hearing apps may facilitate screening for ARHL, particularly in the setting of limitations on in-person medical care due to COVID-19. However, app features vary widely, few apps have been validated, and user-centered designs for older adults are largely lacking.

STUDY DESIGN We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of the first 94 consecutive patients who underwent LESS for adnexal tumors at Cheil General Hospital and Women's Healthcare Center, Seoul, Korea between March 2009 and July 2010. Our retrospective chart review was approved by our local Institutional Review Board (IRB). We used a homemade wound retractor and surgical glove as the single-port device. All LESS procedures were performed by a single surgeon. RESULTS Of 94 patients, 90 (95.7%) successfully underwent LESS for the treatment of an adnexal tumor. The mean age of the patients was 38.51 ± 11.65 years, and the mean body mass index was 21.22 ± 2.79 kg/m(2). The mean operative time was 50.33 ± 13.26 min, and the mean diameter of the adnexal tumors was 6.26 ± 3.19 cm. The procedures included enucleation of an ovarian cyst (n=56), salpingo-oophorectomy (n=32), and salpingectomy (n=4). Two cases with suspicion for malignancy underwent conversion to laparotomy (2.1%), and frozen sections revealed serous ovarian adenocarcinoma (n=1) and chronic inflammation (n=1). Except for those two cases, the pathologic diagnoses were confirmed as mature cystic teratoma (n=30), endometriosis (n=24), mucinous cystadenoma (n=14), serous cystadenoma (n=14), borderline ovarian tumor (n=4), hydrosalpinx (n=4), serous adenocarcinoma of the salpinx (n=1), and ectopic pregnancy (n=1). Two cases required an additional trocar for adhesiolysis of severe pelvic adhesion. No major intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred.

In ST cells, caspase activity assay showed that the activity of caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 increased significantly with the infection of PDCoV, but not observed in UV irradiated PDCoV-infected cells, indicating that PDCoV infection activated both endogenous and exogenous apoptotic pathways in ST cells, and the induction of apoptosis depended on viral replication. To further investigate the endogenous apoptosis induced by PDCoV, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factors in cytoplasm and mitochondria were detected. Compared with normal cells, the amount of cytochrome C released from mitochondria to cytoplasm increased significantly in PDCoV-infected cells, and the release increased with the prolongation of infection, while the apoptosis-inducing factor was always localized to mitochondria, suggesting that PDCoV induced apoptosis was initiated through caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by promoting cytochrome C in the mitochondrial membrane gap into the cytosol.

Interleukin-6 as a predictor of COVID-19 outcome.,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND Anaesthesia is neurotoxic in developing primates. Retrospective clinical studies show a correlation between exposure to anaesthesia during infancy and the occurrence of learning disorders (LD). Prospective studies failed to detect any influence of a single exposure to anaesthesia on neurodevelopment. We hypothesised that some specific populations of children were electively sensitive to anaesthesia-related neurotoxicity. METHODS Using a case-control design, we analysed the medical histories of children with LD, compared to those of their normally reading siblings. Interviews were conducted and medical records were reviewed. The numbers of hospitalisations and anaesthesia exposures before the age of five years were determined. RESULTS Four hundred fourteen dyslexic children were screened over a one-year period. Two hundred and seventy patients were excluded due to confounding variables (single child, all siblings showing LD or any condition placing the neurological prognosis at risk (N = 107/414 for the latter)) or inability to accurately collect evaluation criteria. In the 144 case-control pairs studied, the mean number of hospitalisations was significantly different (N = 1.097 ± 0 .135/case versus 0.667 ± 0.097/control, p = 0.0052), as was the proportion of hospitalised patients (54.2% versus 38.9%, p = 0.0031). The mean number of anaesthesia exposures per individual was not statistically different (N = 0.958 ± 0.183/case versus 0.569 ± 0.107/control, p = 0.0732), but the proportion of children anaesthetised at least once was (43.8% (cases) versus 33.3% (controls), p = 0.0301). DISCUSSION One or more hospitalisation(s) may reflect a health status and/or have an iatrogenic effect disrupting the normal setting up of learning abilities.

'Dead-on-farm'(DOF) broilers from 145 commercial flocks were investigated at two different time points (TP1:7-14 and TP2:28-35 days of age); per sampling, 6-10 DOF broilers were selected for post-mortem investigation and gross pathomorphological changes were assessed, in total from 2,717 birds. Post-mortem findings were substantiated by bacteriological, virological and parasitological investigations. Furthermore, production data of all flocks were collected and used to perform comprehensive statistical analysis. Overall, colibacillosis was found most important with a significant negative impact on flock health, productivity and profitability through all ages of broiler production. At TP1, primary reasons for mortality comprised yolk sac infections, generally found together with fibrinous polyserositis due to E. coli. Furthermore, femoral lesions, which correlated with increased flock mortality, were associated with detection of E. coli. At TP2, ascites was detected frequently in DOF broilers, correlating with increased production losses in the 4th and 5th week of life. No etiological link between the presence of ascites and the detection of the investigated pathogens was observed.A positive correlation was noticed between the prevalence of ascites within flocks and the sea level of the farm, and with the sex of the birds. These disease conditions could not be linked with the housing system. Presence of Infectious Bronchitis virus, avian reovirus and fowl adenovirus did not correlate with macroscopic lesions or a specific disease. Research Highlights  In young broilers lesions of visceral organs due to bacterial infections dominated.  Colibacillosis impacts broiler health, productivity and profitability independent of the age of birds.  Disorders of the locomotor system were frequently observed throughout production.  Older broilers frequently showed pathologic changes due to metabolic disorders.  Overall, a shift from infectious towards metabolic disease conditions was noticed.","Grafl, Beatrice; Gaußmann, Barbara; Sulejmanovic, Tarik; Hess, Claudia; Hess, Michael",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2020.1805411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32746625/,132

Methods- A total of 534 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with MT were enrolled in this prospective cohort study. The primary outcome measured was the modified Rankin Scale score at 3 months, according to HbA1c level. High HbA1c levels were defined as a plasma level of HbA1c >6.5%. Favorable outcomes were defined as functional independence, with modified Rankin Scale scores of 0 to 2. Secondary functional outcomes included mortality, early clinical outcomes, and intracranial hemorrhage. Results- The number of patients with a favorable outcome was significantly lower in patients with HbA1c >6.5% than in those with HbA1c ≤6.5% (28.8% versus 42.1%; P=0.006). In multivariate analysis, high HbA1c levels (especially >7.0% HbA1c) were significantly associated with poor functional outcomes 3 months after AIS in patients with large vessel occlusion treated with MT. High HbA1c was also significantly associated with increased mortality and worse early clinical outcomes after AIS in patients treated with MT. Subgroup analyses showed that HbA1c >6.5% was associated with significantly lower odds of functional independence at 3 months after AIS, when comparing the recanalized group with nonrecanalized patients. Conclusions- These results suggest that high HbA1c level is an independent predictor of a poor outcome at 3 months after AIS in patients with large vessel occlusion treated with MT, particularly in those with recanalization, and may augment the risk of mortality and early clinical worsening after AIS.","Choi, Kang-Ho; Kim, Ja-Hae; Kang, Kyung-Wook; Kim, Joon-Tae; Choi, Seong-Min; Lee, Seung-Han; Park, Man-Seok; Kim, Byeong-Chae; Kim, Myeong-Kyu; Cho, Ki-Hyun",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.118.021598; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30580713/,132

CVI has either a nonthrombotic (primary) or postthrombotic (secondary) cause involving reflux, obstruction, or a combination of both. The role of venous obstruction is increasingly recognized as a major cause of CVI, with obstructive lesions in the iliocaval segment being markedly more relevant than lesions at the levels of the crural and femoral veins. Approximately 70-80 % of iliac veins develop a variable degree of obstruction following an episode of acute deep venous thrombosis. Nonthrombotic iliac vein obstruction also known as May-Thurner or Cockett's syndrome is the most common cause of nonthrombotic iliac vein occlusion. While compression therapy is the basis of therapy in CVI, in many cases, venous recanalization or correction of obstructive iliac vein lesions may result in resolution of symptoms. This document reviews the current evidence on iliocaval vein recanalization and provides standards of practice for iliocaval stenting in primary and secondary causes of chronic venous disease.","Mahnken, Andreas H; Thomson, Ken; de Haan, Michiel; O'Sullivan, Gerard J",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-014-0875-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24633533/,132
141986,Using Helping Mothers Survive to Improve Intrapartum Care.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Irradiation can cause lipid oxidation of fish. This study aimed to examine the effect of radiation (method, dose, and dose rate) on the acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) content, and fatty acid profile of fresh and freeze-dried largemouth bass fleshes. RESULTS The AV, PV and TBARS presented dose dependent increase in fish meat for both cobalt-60 (60 Co) and electron beam (EB) irradiation. With a 6 kGy of radiation, all measured indices in 60 Co group were significantly higher than those in EB group (P<0.05 or P<0.01). With a 3 kGy of radiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in 200 Gy/min dose rate group were significantly lower than those in 2 Gy/min and 80 Gy/min groups (P<0.05). After 60 Co irradiation, the AV, PV and TBARS in most of fresh samples were significantly higher than those in freeze-dried samples (P<0.01). And 60 Co radiation decreased the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) content in fresh samples and increased the UFA content in freeze-dried samples. Our study indicated that 60 Co irradiation, particularly at a low dose rate, accelerated lipid oxidation in fish meat. A large amount of muscle moisture enhances the amount of UFA loss in fish meat during 60 Co irradiation. CONCLUSION Low dose (3 kGy) of EB irradiation, high dose rate (200 Gy/min) of 60 Co irradiation or freeze-drying treatment can alleviate the lipid oxidation of largemouth bass meat.

A retrospective analysis in a Pediatric Emergency Room after the introduction of the PIPER recommendations.,2020-11-30,"OBJECTIVE To identify potential strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in a Utah meat-processing facility and surrounding community. DESIGN/SETTING During March-June 2020, 502 workers at a Utah meat-processing facility (facility A) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Using merged data from the state disease surveillance system and facility A, we analyzed the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 positivity and worker demographics, work section, and geospatial data on worker residence. We analyzed worker survey responses to questions regarding COVID-19 knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors at work and home. PARTICIPANTS (1) Facility A workers (n = 1373) with specimen collection dates and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results; (2) residential addresses of all persons (workers and nonworkers) with a SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test (n = 1036), living within the 3 counties included in the health department catchment area; and (3) facility A workers (n = 64) who agreed to participate in the knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES New cases over time, COVID-19 attack rates, worker characteristics by SARS-CoV-2 test results, geospatially clustered cases, space-time proximity of cases among workers and nonworkers; frequency of quantitative responses, crude prevalence ratios, and counts and frequency of coded responses to open-ended questions from the COVID-19 knowledge, attitudes, and practices survey. RESULTS Statistically significant differences in race (P = .01), linguistic group (P < .001), and work section (P < .001) were found between workers with positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Geographically, only 6% of cases were within statistically significant spatiotemporal case clusters. Workers reported using handwashing (57%) and social distancing (21%) as mitigation strategies outside work but reported apprehension with taking COVID-19-associated sick leave. CONCLUSIONS Mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks among workers in congregate settings requires a multifaceted public health response that is tailored to the workforce. IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE Tailored, multifaceted mitigation strategies are crucial for reducing COVID-19-associated health disparities among disproportionately affected populations.","Rogers, Tia M; Robinson, Susan J; Reynolds, Laura E; Ladva, Chandresh N; Burgos-Garay, Maria; Whiteman, Ari; Budge, Holly; Soto, Natalie; Thompson, Mariela; Hunt, Estee; Barson, Todd; Boyd, Andrew T",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,https://doi.org/10.1097/phh.0000000000001383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34081669/,132
143620,Disaster preparedness among nurses: a systematic review of literature.,2018,"INTRODUCTION The age of patients with gastric cancer has increased worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and feasibility of laparoscopic gastrectomy (LG) for early gastric cancer in elderly patients. METHODS We retrospectively investigated 221 consecutive patients who underwent LG for early gastric cancer during a 5-year period (January 2010 to December 2014). We divided the patients into two groups: elderly patients (≥75 years old) and younger patients (<75 years old). We compared these two groups with respect to clinical characteristics, histopathological findings, intraoperative factors, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS The preoperative characteristics were similar in both groups. Except for the number of harvested lymph nodes (42.0 vs 34.9; P = 0.0016), the short-term operative outcomes, including postoperative complications and histopathological findings, were comparable between the two groups. Although significantly fewer lymph nodes were harvested in the elderly group, the overall survival and relapse-free survival rates did not significantly differ between the groups. Postoperative complications, such as acute cholecystitis and internal hernia, occurred during the long-term postoperative period after LG, and these unexpected complications were more frequently observed in elderly patients. All elderly patients required additional emergent surgeries for delayed complications. CONCLUSION The outcomes of LG for early gastric cancer in elderly patients seem to be reasonable. Aggressive lymph node dissection may be omissible in elderly patients with acceptable results. LG can be a safe and feasible procedure in elderly patients. However, the higher rate of delayed but urgent complications during the long-term postoperative period must be considered.","Yasukawa, Daiki; Kadokawa, Yoshio; Kato, Shigeru; Aisu, Yuki; Hori, Tomohide",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12480; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29577648/,132

Here, we explore the use of polymer probes together with untargeted proteomics for large scale protein analysis in sewage and treated water. Polymeric probes were immersed in the influent, anoxic reactor and effluent waters of a Spanish WWTP during 11 days. Proteins sorbed were extracted and identified by mass spectrometry. A total of 690 proteins from bacteria, plants and animals, including human, were identified showing different proteome profiles in the different sites. Bacterial proteins (510) pointed at 175 genera distributed in 22 bacterial classes. The most abundant were EF-Tu, GroEL and ATP synthase which were contributed by a high number of species. Human was the species contributing the greatest number of identified proteins (57), some in high abundance like keratins. Human proteins dominated in the influent water and were efficiently removed at the effluent. Several of the proteins identified (S100A8, uromodulin, defensins) are known disease biomarkers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between December 2014 and March 2016, a total of 114 LESS RPs and RCs were performed, comprising 68 LESS RPs, 38 LESS RCs with cutaneous ureterostomy (CU) and eight LESS RCs with orthotopic ileal neobladder (OIN). Access was achieved via a single-port, with four channels placed through a transumblical incision. After the apex of prostate was separated from the urethra, a self-developed port ('Zhu's port') was inserted through the urethra to facilitate resection of prostate and urethrovesical anastomosis. The peri-operative and postoperative data were collected and analysed retrospectively. Patients were followed up postoperatively for evidence of long-term side effects. RESULTS All the procedures were completed successfully. No conversion to conventional laparoscopic surgery was necessary. For LESS RP, the average operating time was 152 min. Estimated blood loss was 117 mL. The mean hospital stay was 16.4 days after surgery. For LESS RC with CU and LESS RC with OIN, the mean operating times were 215 and 328 min, mean estimated blood loss was 175 and 252 mL, and mean hospital stay was 9.4 and 18.2 days, respectively. Six patients required blood transfusion (5.26%). Intra-operative complications occurred in two patients (1.75%), and postoperative complications in nine (7.89%). Fourteen out of 68 (20.6%) patients who underwent LESS RP had positive surgical margins. Follow-up ranged from 10 to 30.6 months. In the prostate cancer cases, good urinary control was observed in 35.3%, 97.1% and 100% of patients at 1, 6 and 12 months after the operation, respectively, while biochemical recurrence was observed in 11.8% patients. In the bladder cancer cases, two patients had local recurrence and two patients had distant metastasis. CONCLUSION Our results showed that LESS RP and LESS RC are feasible and safe with the aid of a transurethral port. Operating through the transurethral port might overcome the challenges posed by the single-port laparoscopic approach.","Su, Jian; Zhu, Qingyi; Yuan, Lin; Zhang, Yang; Zhang, Qingling; Wei, Yunfei",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/bju.13965; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28734080/,132

We evaluated the relationship between peristaltic breaks and esophageal symptoms, reflux exposure, and symptom outcomes in a prospective patient cohort. Methods Two hundred and eighteen patients (53.2 ± 0.9 years, 68.3% female) undergoing both pH-impedance testing and HRM over a 5-year period were prospectively evaluated. Demographics, symptom presentation, acid exposure time, symptom association probability, and symptom burden scores were collected. Outcomes were assessed on follow-up using changes in symptom scores. Presence of long breaks (≥ 5 cm) on HRM was assessed by a blinded author. Relationships between breaks, reflux parameters, presenting symptoms, and outcomes were assessed. Results Patients with long breaks were more likely to have cough as a presenting symptom than those without (43.4% vs 28.6%, P = 0.024); statistical differences were not demonstrated with other symptoms (P ≥ 0.3). Numbers of swallows with long breaks were higher in patients with cough compared to those without (2.4 ± 0.3 vs 1.6 ± 0.2, P = 0.021); differences were not found with other symptoms (P ≥ 0.4). Long breaks were not associated with age, gender, race, reflux burden, symptom association, or changes in symptom metrics (P ≥ 0.1 for all comparisons). Among patients with cough, the presence of long breaks predicted suboptimal symptom improvement with antireflux therapy (P = 0.018); this difference did not hold true for other symptoms (P ≥ 0.2). Conclusions Long breaks in esophageal peristaltic integrity are associated with cough. The presence of long breaks is associated with suboptimal benefit from antireflux therapy.","Bennett, Michael C; Patel, Amit; Sainani, Nitin; Wang, Dan; Sayuk, Gregory S; Gyawali, C Prakash",Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,https://doi.org/10.5056/jnm17126; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969856/,132

Factors that influence health disparities in this population include inadequate dissemination of culturally and linguistically appropriate health information. METHOD Our qualitative analysis is based on data obtained from three focus groups with Spanish-speaking Hispanic adults conducted at a clinic in Nebraska. Participants were asked about their perceptions of health information in the form of videos, brochures, and websites. We followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research and used the theoretical framework of content analysis. RESULTS For videos, attributes associated with higher levels of trust included a friendly health professional, the logo or name of a health care institute, and a reference specifying ""se habla Español."" For brochures, attributes associated with trust included use of visual aids, use of numerous colors and big font sizes, the year of printing, and a health care agency logo. For websites, characteristics associated with trust were inclusion of plain language, use of pictures and videos, and date of last update. In all focus groups, participants perceived the use of mixed English/Spanish language in health information from pamphlets and websites as unprofessional. The use of unknown governmental logos in health promotional videos and websites was perceived as untrustworthy information. CONCLUSIONS Spanish-speaking Hispanics prefer health information supported by a health care agency or delivered by a health care professional.

147432,What's Important: Operating Room Waste: Why We Should Care.,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) currently serves as a surrogate for portal pressure measurement but has many limitations. We developed a novel technique for rapid and direct portal pressure measurements using a digital pressure wire delivered through an EUS-guided 22-gauge FNA needle. Our aims were to evaluate (1) the short-term safety and technical feasibility, (2) procedural duration and subjective workload assessment, and (3) accuracy compared with a transjugular criterion standard approach. METHODS The subjects were Yorkshire pigs, weighing 40 to 55 kg. The portal vein was identified by using a linear array echoendoscope and accessed with a commercially available 22-gauge FNA needle preloaded with a digital pressure wire. Access was confirmed by portal venography. Mean digital pressure measurements were recorded over 30 to 60 seconds, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index was scored. The control measurements were conventional transjugular catheterization with a balloon occlusion catheter to obtain free and wedged hepatic pressures, with subsequent HVPG calculation. RESULTS The total time required for EUS identification and needle access of the portal vein, venography, and digital pressure measurement was less than 5 minutes in 5 of 5 pigs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index scores revealed a low subjective workload. Baseline portal pressure measurements via EUS ranged from 5 mm Hg to 10 mm Hg (mean, 6.4 mm Hg). HVPG measurements were consistently ±1 mm Hg of portal pressure. CONCLUSIONS This study is the first report of direct EUS-guided portal pressure measurements by using a digital pressure wire. This method is routinely performed in minutes and provides real-time pressure tracings via wireless transmission. This novel approach for direct portal pressure measurement has the potential to replace traditional indirect HVPG measurements.","Schulman, Allison R; Thompson, Christopher C; Ryou, Marvin",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2015.11.038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26684600/,132

Following the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, a study was undertaken of the prevalence of, and factors contributing to, symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant women in Shenzhen, China. METHODS A cross-sectional study on pregnant women was conducted from September to December 2020 in Shenzhen, using a random-recruit method. The General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) surveys were used to evaluate symptoms of anxiety and depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to explore factors potentially associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. RESULTS A total of 3,434 pregnant women aged 15 to 59 years were enrolled. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were present in 9.8% and 6.9%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis using a stepwise procedure revealed that an increased risk of symptoms of anxiety and depression was associated with unmarried/divorced/widowed, unemployed, received professional psychological counseling, family dysfunction, the first trimester of pregnancy, pregnancy complications and vaginal bleeding, unplanned pregnancy, decline in household income and disputes between partners caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, consumption of alcoholic drinks by women and their partners, smoking, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle.

Using a Monte-Carlo method and data derived from UK sources, we predict that an infectious student would, on average, infect 0.94 other household members. Or, as a rule of thumb, each infected student would generate (just less than) one secondary within-household infection. The total number of secondary cases for all returning students is dependent on the virus prevalence within each student population at the time of their departure from campus back home. Although the proposed estimation method is general and robust, the results are sensitive to the input data. We provide Matlab code and a helpful online app (http://bit.ly/Secondary_infections_app) that can be used to estimate numbers of secondary infections based on local parameter values. This can be used worldwide to support policy making.","Harper, Paul R; Moore, Joshua W; Woolley, Thomas E",Health systems,https://doi.org/10.1080/20476965.2020.1857214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763227/,132

Various surgical methods of performing SILC are present in each institute; however, it is necessary to develop a standardized procedure that we can perform safely, such as the conventional 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). The SILC experiment in our institute was started by use of the commercial SILS Port and changed from a 3-port method via an umbilicus to a 2-port method to improve some problems. Although none of the conversions to conventional 4-port LC and also none of the complications such as bile duct injury occurred in each method, the 2-port method functioned best and was also economical. However, it is most important to adopt strict criteria and select the patients suitable for SILC to demonstrate SILC safety same as 4-port LC.","Adachi, Tomohiko; Okamoto, Tatsuya; Ono, Shinichiro; Kanematsu, Takashi; Kuroki, Tamotsu",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2011/972647; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22091367/,132

METHODS A prospective data collection was performed in 21 consecutive patients in March 2010 and August 2011. Surgical outcome including operative time (OT) and estimated blood loss (EBL) were analyzed. RESULTS SPA-TLH procedures were successfully performed in 16 cases (76.2%). Of the 5 failed cases, 4 were converted to multiport TLH because of distorted uterine contours and pelvic adhesions and 1 was converted to laparotomy for bleeding control. The median OT, uterine weight, and EBL were 110 (65-165) min, 600 (502-980) g, and 200 (100-800) ml, respectively. Spearman's correlation analysis demonstrated that OT and blood loss increased with increasing uterine weight (p = 0.003 and p = 0.033, respectively). No operative complications were observed during the hospital stay and 3-month follow-up following discharge.

150438,Rapid health systems change: online medical consultations to fight COVID-19.,2020-06-01,"INTRODUCTION Due to a relatively high prevalence and negative impact on quality of life chronic cough (CC) is a challenge for both patients and clinicians. Our approach to CC management has changed significantly over the recent years. There is ongoing research to address the unmet need and develop more effective antitussive treatment options. This is the first part of a series of two reviews of new antitussive medications. Medical databases (Medline, Embase and SCOPUS) and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT) were searched for studies on antitussive drugs targeting peripheral sensory nerves. AREAS COVERED This review presents current knowledge of peripheral receptors, that are not only involved in evoking the cough reflex, but are also potentially responsible for more sustained neural alterations. Blockage of the receptors and ion channels is discussed in terms of its potential antitussive effect. EXPERT OPINION A better understanding of CC mechanisms has facilitated the development of novel treatments including the expected imminent launch of one of the first antitussive drugs acting peripherally, gefapixant, a P2X2/3 receptor inhibitor. There remain several gaps in the knowledge about the mechanisms and treatment of CC. These include the lack of tests to diagnose cough hypersensitivity syndrome and predictors of response to specific treatments. Also, the mechanism and site of the cough hypersensitivity remains unknown. Further research into cough phenotypes and endotypes will yield important insights and a personalized approach to cough management.","Grabczak, Elzbieta M; Dabrowska, Marta; Birring, Surinder S; Krenke, Rafal",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1811686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804594/,132
150631,Editorial Concern-Possible Reporting of the Same Patients With COVID-19 in Different Reports.,2020-03-16,"With the outbreak of COVID-19, there have been growing reports of racial harassment targeting Asian Americans. We study one such manifestation of racial harassment that Asian employees may face in the workplace: Leaders' use of stigmatizing labels for COVID-19 such as the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu."" Integrating organizational justice theories with research on racial harassment in the workplace, we theorize that leaders' use of stigmatizing COVID-19 labels reduces employees' perceptions of interpersonal justice, which subsequently impact employees' emotional exhaustion and work engagement. We further theorize that while such effects will be stronger among Asian employees who experience both moral anger and reduced public collective self-esteem, that the effects will also be present among non-Asian employees who experience moral anger. Using one survey (Study 1) and one experiment (Study 2), we find support for our predictions. We find that leaders' use of stigmatizing language to depict COVID-19 leads to deleterious workplace experiences for employees, and especially for Asian employees. The current research thus deepens our understanding of the relatively understudied work experiences of Asian Americans and brings to light the underlying psychological mechanisms linking racial harassment and employee work outcomes for both targeted employees and employees not targeted.

AIM The study was performed to describe the changes in hospital admissions during the first phase of the pandemic. METHODS The Norwegian Institute of Public Health established a national preparedness register with daily updates on COVID-19 cases and the use of health services. We used individual-level information on inpatients from the electronic journal systems for all hospitals in Norway to estimate daily hospital admissions. RESULTS Before the onset of the pandemic in March, there was an average of 2400 inpatient admissions per day in Norway, which decreased to approximately 1500 in the first few days after lockdown measures were implemented. The relative magnitudes of the decreases were similar in men and women and across all age groups. The decreases were substantial for both elective (54%) and emergency (29%) inpatient care. The admission rate gradually increased and reached pre-pandemic levels in June. However, the reductions in admissions for pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease seemed to persist. CONCLUSIONS The elective and emergency inpatient admission rates were substantially reduced a few days after the pandemic response measures were implemented. The ways in which the lack or postponement of care may have affected the health and well-being of patients is an important issue to be addressed in future research.","Helgeland, Jon; Telle, Kjetil E; Grøsland, Mari; Huseby, Beate M; Håberg, Siri; Lindman, Anja S E",Scandinavian journal of public health,https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211000813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33764202/,132

AIM To evaluate the adherence to guideline-directed anticoagulation and its impact on clinical outcomes in a high-risk cohort of elderly Chinese patients. METHODS The Optimal Thromboprophylaxis in Elderly Chinese Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (ChiOTEAF) registry is a prospective, multicenter study conducted from October 2014 to December 2018. Endpoints of interest were all-cause death, thromboembolic (TE) events and major bleedings in patients with a guideline-directed indication for OACs (CHA2DS2VASc ≥1 if male or ≥2 if female). RESULTS The eligible cohort consisted of 5742 patients, of whom 2567 (44.7%) patients were treated with an OAC. Seven independent predictors of OAC undertreatment were identified: age (OR: 1.04; 95%CI 1.03-1.05, P < 0.001), first diagnosed AF (OR: 1.71; 95%CI 1.44-2.03, P < 0.001), chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.67; 95%CI 1.36-2.06, P < 0.001), liver disease (OR: 1.69; 95%CI 1.19-2.41, P = 0.003), dementia (OR: 1.67; 95%CI 1.06-2.64, P = 0.026), prior extracranial bleeding (OR: 1.89; 95%CI 1.35-2.64, P < 0.001), and the use of antiplatelet drug (OR: 6.97; 95%CI 5.89-8.23, P < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, OAC undertreatment was significantly associated with a higher risk all-cause death (OR: 3.79; 95%CI: 2.61-5.53; P < 0.001) and TE events (OR: 2.28; 95%CI: 1.39-3.72; P = 0.001), and a similar risk of major bleeding as compared to guideline-directed OAC therapy. CONCLUSIONS Only 44.7% of all eligible patients were prescribed OAC in accordance with guideline recommendations. The independent predictors for OAC undertreatment were age, first diagnosed AF, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, prior extracranial bleeding, and the use of the antiplatelet drugs. Guideline-adherent thromboprophylaxis was safe and may be associated with improved survival and less TE among elderly Chinese patients with AF.","Guo, Yutao; Kotalczyk, Agnieszka; Imberti, Jacopo F; Wang, Yutang; Lip, Gregory Y H",European heart journal.

This project evaluated the respiratory toxicity of sand particles collected at military bases near Fort Irwin USA, in Iraq (Camp Victory, Taji and Talil), and Khost Afghanistan. Our primary focus was on assessing the role of soluble metals in the respiratory toxicity of the sand particles using in vitro and in vivo methods. Replicating rat type II alveolar cell cultures (RLE-6TN) were exposed to sand extracts or vehicle control in serum-free media for ≤24 h. Cytotoxicity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and assessment of lactate dehydrogenase leakage. The relative in vitro cytotoxicity of the sand extracts was Taji ≈ Talil > Afghanistan > Camp Victory ≈ Fort Irwin. We also assessed extracts of Camp Victory, Afghanistan, and Taji sand for acute and delayed pulmonary toxicity in rats following intratracheal administration. Assessments included biochemical analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung histopathology. The in vitro cytotoxicity assay results were partially predictive of in vivo responses. The more cytotoxic Taji sand extract induced an acute irritant response in rats following intratracheal administration. Rats given the less cytotoxic Camp Victory sand extract had minimal biochemical or cytological BALF changes whereas rats given either the Afghanistan or Taji sand extracts demonstrated BALF changes that were suggestive of mild lung inflammation. Unexpectedly, we observed similar lung pathology in all extract-exposed rats. The results of our study can be used to prioritize future particle inhalation studies or guide epidemiological study design.","Taylor, Karen; Foster, Melanie L; Law, J McHugh; Centeno, Jose A; Fornero, Elisa; Henderson, M Stephen; Trager, Sabrina A; Stockelman, Michael G; Dorman, David C",Inhalation toxicology,https://doi.org/10.3109/08958378.2013.797524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23796017/,132
152743,Determinants of Depression Risk among Three Asian American Subgroups in New York City.,2020,"BACKGROUND Chronic periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication that can occur following total joint replacement. Patients with chronic PJI report a substantially lower quality of life and face a higher risk of short-term mortality. Establishing a diagnosis of chronic PJI is challenging because of conflicting guidelines, numerous tests, and limited evidence. Delays in diagnosing PJI are associated with poorer outcomes and morbid revision surgery. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of serum, synovial, and tissue-based tests for chronic PJI. METHODS This review adheres to the Cochrane Collaboration's diagnostic test accuracy methods for evidence searching and syntheses. A detailed search of MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the grey literature was performed to identify studies involving the diagnosis of chronic PJI in patients with hip or knee replacement. Eligible studies were assessed for quality and bias using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analyses were performed on tests with sufficient data points. Summary estimates and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) curves were obtained using a bivariate model. RESULTS A total of 12,616 citations were identified, and 203 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these 203 studies, 170 had a high risk of bias. Eighty-three unique PJI diagnostic tests were identified, and 17 underwent meta-analyses. Laboratory-based synovial alpha-defensin tests and leukocyte esterase reagent (LER) strips (2+) had the best performance, followed by white blood-cell (WBC) count, measurement of synovial C-reactive protein (CRP) level, measurement of the polymorphonuclear neutrophil percentage (PMN%), and the alpha-defensin lateral flow test kit (Youden index ranging from 0.78 to 0.94). Tissue-based tests and 3 serum tests (measurement of interleukin-6 [IL-6] level, CRP level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) had a Youden index between 0.61 to 0.75 but exhibited poorer performance compared with the synovial tests mentioned above. CONCLUSIONS The quality of the literature pertaining to chronic PJI diagnostic tests is heterogeneous, and the studies are at a high risk for bias. We believe that greater transparency and more complete reporting in studies of diagnostic test results should be mandated by peer-reviewed journals. The available literature suggests that several synovial fluid-based tests perform well for diagnosing chronic PJI and their use is recommended in the work-up of any suspected case of chronic PJI.

Analyses of 2 large-scale data sets with over 80,000 participants and more than 40,000,000 behavioral observations demonstrate that individuals scoring high on Openness show higher variability in the psychological profiles associated with their personal interests-a novel concept termed psychological interest diversity. Study 1 examines the Facebook profiles of 57,185 users to demonstrate that a person's Openness level predicts the degree to which the pages they like are diverse in the political ideologies, personal values, and personality traits of their followers. Study 2 replicates the findings of Study 1 using over 28,000,000 GPS-tracked event attendances collected via people's smartphones. Specifically, the results show that individuals (N = 22,953) with higher levels of Openness also show higher levels of psychological interest diversity in the events they attend, and that this effect is incremental to county-level variation in psychological interest diversity. The findings empirically support the theoretical conceptualization of Openness as a preference for variety and exploration and corroborate the role of personal dispositions in the creation of personal echo chambers. The discussion highlights the need to further explore psychological interest diversity as the initial basis of algorithmic filter bubbles-for example, recommendation systems or targeted advertising-which further amplify and reinforce existing interests and preferences.

The development of the EndoMaster EASE System aims to enhance safety and efficacy of ESD through 2 flexible robotic arms for tissue retraction and dissection. This is a preclinical animal study to evaluate performance of colorectal ESD using latest version of the EndoMaster EASE System. METHOD The latest version of the EndoMaster EASE System consisted of an independently designed flexible platform with build-in endoscopic imaging system and 3 working channels, 2 for passage of robotic arms and one for accessories. In this animal study, the outcome measures included operating time (from starting incision to finishing dissection), completeness of resection, procedure-related adverse events as well as limitation of arms manipulation in narrow working space as assessed by counting the frequency of blind cutting. RESULTS A total of 5 ESD procedures were performed in a 66.7kg porcine model under general anesthesia. The mean operative time was 73.8 minutes, and the mean size of specimen resected was 1340 mm2. There was no perforation, although profuse bleeding was encountered during one of the robotic ESD procedures. CONCLUSIONS The current preclinical study confirmed the feasibility of performing colorectal ESD using the latest version of EndoMaster EASE System. The system was also tested for the ability to tackle with adverse events including bleeding and perforation. This provided important preclinical experience for clinical trial.","Chiu, Philip Wai Yan; Ho, Khek Yu; Jay, Soo",Gastrointestinal endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gie.2020.09.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991869/,132

Specifically, clinicians have been compelled by the idea that insecure attachment, broadly speaking, may bring about stressful (real or perceived) interpersonal experiences that increases risk for internalizing symptoms. However, recent meta-analyses examining the links between attachment representations and internalizing symptoms have challenged this assumption, highlighting the importance of considering insecure attachment subtypes in understanding one's vulnerability for internalizing symptoms. Here we expand on this special issue's target papers and propose that, despite an increase in citation impact of clinically relevant attachment research, there are still core theoretical and methodological questions left unanswered. We highlight three clinical conundrums: (1) hyperactivating, but not deactivating, attachment is linked to increased internalizing symptoms in adolescence and adulthood; (2) the magnitude of the associations between insecure attachment subtypes and internalizing symptoms varies depending on the developmental period; and (3) self-reported, but not narrative-based, deactivating attachment is associated with increased internalizing symptoms. We call for engagement with adjunct academic disciplines to elucidate these issues. These clinical conundrums have important ethical implications regarding how we understand insecure attachment and necessitate close theoretical and empirical attention before attachment findings can truly inform clinical practice.","Dagan, Or; Bernard, Kristin",Attachment & human development,https://doi.org/10.1080/14616734.2021.1918455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886408/,132

METHODS Analysis of septic shock patients monitored with an oesophageal Doppler and equipped with an indwelling arterial catheter in whom a fluid challenge was performed because of the presence of systemic hypoperfusion. Measures of arterial load [systemic vascular resistance, SVR = mean arterial pressure (MAP)/cardiac output (CO); net arterial compliance, C = stroke volume (SV)/arterial pulse pressure; and effective arterial elastance, Ea = 90% of systolic arterial pressure/SV] were studied both before and after volume expansion (VE). RESULTS Eighty-one patients were analysed, 54 (67%) increased their CO by at least 10% after VE (preload responders). In the whole population, 29 patients (36%) increased MAP by at least 10 % from preinfusion level (pressure responders). In the preload responder group, only 24 patients (44%) were pressure responders. Fluid administration was associated with a significant decrease in Ea [from 1.68 (1.11-2.11) to 1.57 (1.08-1.99) mmHg/mL; P = 0.0001] and SVR [from 1035 (645-1483) to 928 (654-1452) dyn s cm(-5); P < 0.01]. Specifically, in preload responders in whom arterial pressure did not change, VE caused a reduction in Ea from 1.74 (1.22-2.24) to 1.55 (1.24-1.86) mmHg/mL (P < 0.0001), affecting both resistive [SVR: from 1082 (697-1475) to 914 (624-1475) dyn s cm(-5); P < 0.0001] and pulsatile [C: from 1.11 (0.84-1.49) to 1.18 (0.99-1.44) mL/mmHg; P < 0.05] components. There was no relationship between preinfusion arterial load parameters and VE-induced increase in arterial pressure. CONCLUSION Fluid administration significantly reduced arterial load in critically patients with septic shock and acute circulatory failure, even when increasing cardiac output. This explains why some septic patients increase their cardiac output after fluid administration without improving blood pressure.","Monge García, Manuel Ignacio; Guijo González, Pedro; Gracia Romero, Manuel; Gil Cano, Anselmo; Oscier, Chris; Rhodes, Andrew; Grounds, Robert Michael; Cecconi, Maurizio",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-015-3898-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26077088/,132

Trilobed flap variations are some of the more commonly used flaps for nipple-areola complex reconstruction. The donor-site scar frequently extends outside the width of an ideal areolar tattoo diameter. There have been many modifications to the original flap design, but none of them addresses the length of the donor-site scar. The technique described uses a triangular stitch in the donor site to limit the length of the scar. This also creates tiny dog-ears within the future areola zone that give a natural wrinkled appearance when tattooed.","Butz, Daniel R; Kim, Eun Key; Song, David H",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000001408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26218373/,132

Prospective data are scarce in the field of deep infiltrating endometriosis surgery. OBJECTIVE The study aimed to assess pelvic pain and quality of life before and after laparoscopic bowel resection for rectosigmoid endometriosis. DESIGN The study involved prospectively collected data regarding pelvic pain and quality of life before and after surgery. SETTINGS It was conducted at a tertiary endometriosis referral unit at Aarhus University Hospital. PATIENTS A total of 175 women were included. INTERVENTION Patients underwent laparoscopic bowel resection for endometriosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Questionnaires for pain (Numerical Rating Scale) and quality of life (RAND Short Form-36) were answered before and 1 year after surgery. Data on analgesic and hormone treatment were collected. Preoperative and postoperative pelvic pain and quality-of-life scores were compared, and risk factors for improvement/worsening were identified. RESULTS A total of 97.1% of the women completed the 1-year follow up. A significant decrease (p = 0.0001) was observed on all pelvic pain parameters. Most profound was the decrease in dyschezia. A significant improvement on all quality-of-life scores was observed (p = 0.0001). A surgical complication did not have a negative impact on outcome 1 year after surgery. The postoperative outcome was not related to the type of surgery. LIMITATIONS This is an observational study without a control group. Risk factor data should be interpreted with caution, because the study was relatively underpowered for some of the rare outcomes. CONCLUSIONS A significant and clinically relevant improvement in pelvic pain and quality of life 1 year after laparoscopic bowel resection for endometriosis was found. We strongly recommend surgery for rectosigmoid endometriosis that is unresponsive to conservative treatment.

METHODS We analyzed prospectively collected data from the Safe Implementation of Treatments in Stroke (SITS) International Stroke Thrombolysis Register on consecutive IVT-treated AIS patients during a 7-year period (2010-2017). In propensity score matched groups of patients with dual antiplatelet pretreatment and no antiplatelet pretreatment, we compared: (1) symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (SICH), according to SITS Monitoring Study (MOST), European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) II, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) definitions; (2) 3-month mortality; (3) 3-month favorable functional outcome (FFO; modified Rankin Scale [mRS] scores = 0-1); (4) 3-month functional independence (FI; mRS scores = 0-2); and (5) distribution of the 3-month mRS scores. Dual antiplatelet pretreatment was defined as all possible combinations among aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, and any other antiplatelet. RESULTS Propensity score matching resulted in 2 groups of 1,043 patients each, balanced for all baseline characteristics. In the propensity score matched analysis, the 2 groups had comparable (p > 0.017 using Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons) SICH rates according to SITS-MOST (2.9% vs 1.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.03 to -0.01), ECASS II (5.2% vs 4.4%, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.01), and NINDS (7.7% vs 6.6%, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.01) definitions. No differences in the 3-month mortality (17.9% vs 16.6%, 95% CI = -0.05 to 0.02), FFO (45.6% vs 46.0%, 95% CI = -0.04 to 0.05), FI (59.2% vs 60.7%, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.06), or distribution in 3-month mRS scores (2 [1-4] vs 2 [0-4], 95% CI = -0.29 to 0.09) were documented between the 2 groups. INTERPRETATION Given that patients on dual antiplatelet pretreatment have similar SICH, 3-month mortality rates, and functional outcomes compared to patients with no antiplatelet pretreatment, dual antiplatelet pretreatment history should not be used as a reason to withhold IVT in otherwise eligible AIS patients.

157662,COVID-19 patients in the operating room: a concise review of existing literature.,2020-12-17,"Background Recent randomized controlled trials show benefit of thrombectomy for large vessel occlusion in stroke. Real-world data aid in assessing reproducibility of outcomes outside of clinical trials. The Trevo Retriever Registry is a multicenter, international, prospective study designed to assess outcomes in a large cohort of patients. Methods and Results The Trevo Registry is a prospective database of patients with large vessel occlusion treated with the Trevo device as the first device. The primary end point is revascularization based on modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score and secondary end points include 90-day modified Rankin Scale, 90-day mortality, neurological deterioration at 24 hours, and device/procedure related adverse events. Year 2008 patients were enrolled at 76 centers in 12 countries. Median admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 16 (interquartile range, 11-20). Occlusion sites were internal carotid artery (17.8%), middle cerebral artery (73.5%), posterior circulation (7.1%), and distal vascular locations (1.6%). A modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b or 3 was achieved in 92.8% (95% CI, 91.6, 93.9) of procedures, with 55.3% (95% CI, 53.1, 57.5) of patients achieving modified Rankin Scale ≤2 at 3 months. Patients meeting revised 2015 American Heart Association criteria for thrombectomy had a 59.7% (95% CI , 56.0; 63.4) modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2 at 3 months, whereas 51.4% treated outside of American Heart Association criteria had modified Rankin Scale 0 to 2. 51.4% (95% CI , 49.6, 55.4). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rate was 1.7% (95% CI , 1.2, 2.4). Conclusions The Trevo Retriever Registry represents real-world data with stent retriever. The registry demonstrates similar reperfusion rates and outcomes in the community compared with rigorous centrally adjudicated clinical trials.

157741,A case of acute bacterial pericarditis in a COVID-19 patient.,2021-03-12,"BACKGROUND Debate exists as to whether patients with acute ischemic stroke who are undergoing mechanical thrombectomy should receive general anaesthesia or conscious sedation during the procedure. Using a multihospital administrative database, we compared outcomes and complications of patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy, who were receiving general anaesthesia and conscious sedation, and studied trends in usage over time. MATERIALS AND METHODS Premier database patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy from 2006 to 2013 for acute ischemic stroke were identified. Using propensity score analysis, recipients of general anaesthesia and conscious sedation underwent 1:1 matching. Outcomes including usage trends, discharge status, mortality, length of stay, haemorrhage and pneumonia were examined. RESULTS A total of 2512 patients receiving mechanical thrombectomy were identified. 1999 (80%) received general anaesthesia and 513 (20%) received conscious sedation. Following 1:1 matching by the propensity score matching, 507 general anaesthesia and 507 conscious sedation patients were matched. Patients who received general anaesthesia during their procedure had significantly higher rates of in-hospital mortality (25% vs 12%, OR=2.37 95% CI 1.68 to 3.37, p<0.0001), and pneumonia (17.0% vs 9.3%, OR=2.0, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.96, p=0.0005) compared with patients of thrombectomy who received conscious sedation. ICH/SAH rates were similar between patients receiving general anaesthesia and patients receiving conscious sedation (11% vs 12%, p=0.62). Usage rate of general anaesthesia decreased from 83.8% in 2006 and 74.0% in 2013. CONCLUSIONS In our cohort, thrombectomy patients receiving conscious sedation have decreased in-hospital mortality, decreased rates of pneumonia, and lower hospital costs and lengths of stay when compared with patients who received general anaesthesia. However, most practitioners continue to use general anaesthesia in the setting of acute stroke interventions.","McDonald, Jennifer S; Brinjikji, Waleed; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Cloft, Harry J; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Kallmes, David F",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261440/,132

SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is susceptible to all populations. Immunosuppressed patients have greater risk for opportunistic infections. However, the understanding regarding the biological characteristics of SARSCoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients remains unclear. Herein, we present a case of prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in a liver transplant patient with COVID-19. A 61-year-old male post liver transplant was confirmed COVID-19 infection on day 10 of illness onset. The patient has received immunosuppressive treatment for over 11 years and has a history of hypertension for 10 years. With antiviral treatment and temporary discontinuation of tacrolimus immunosuppression, he had complete clinical symptoms relieve on day 24. However, recurrently positive tests of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were presented on day 35 and on day 39 after two consecutive negative tests. IgG antibody test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive with IgM negative on day 41. The final shedding duration lasted 52 days. Prolonged shedding of SARS-CoV-2 should be a matter of concern and might attribute to long-term immunosuppression. Therefore, dynamic surveillance and prolonged quarantine are required for immunocompromised individuals. Further data should be collected to investigate if there is a universal prolonged shedding window of SARS-CoV-2 in immunosuppressed patients.","Wei, Lai; Liu, Bin; Zhao, Yuanyuan; Chen, Zhishui",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-996; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33183020/,132

Thus, the uncoordinated double bond, as a more reactive partner on the basis of the principle of vinylogy, can directly attack imines, furnishing a formal hydrodienylation reaction enantioselectively. A chemoselective cascade vinylogous addition/allylic alkylation difunctionalization process between 1,3-dienes and imines with a nucleophilic group is also compatible, by trapping in situ formed π-allylpalladium species after initial ene addition. This π-Lewis base catalytic mode, featuring simple η2coordination, vinylogous activation, and compatibility with both conjugated neutral polyenes and electron-deficient polyenes, is elucidated by control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.","Xiao, Ben-Xian; Jiang, Bo; Yan, Ru-Jie; Zhu, Jian-Xiang; Xie, Ke; Gao, Xin-Yue; Ouyang, Qin; Du, Wei; Chen, Ying-Chun",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c01420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730847/,132
160305,Colorectal Cancer Surgery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Single Center Experience.,2021,"Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is a major driver of global liver related morbidity and mortality. There are 2.4 billion drinkers (950 million heavy drinkers) and the lifetime prevalence of any alcohol use disorder (AUD) is 5.1%-8.6%. In 2017, global prevalence of alcohol-associated compensated and decompensated cirrhosis was 23.6 million and 2.5 million, respectively. Combined, alcohol-associated cirrhosis and liver cancer account for 1% of all deaths worldwide with this burden expected to increase. Solutions for this growing epidemic must be multi-faceted and focused on both population and patient-level interventions. Reductions in ALD-related morbidity and mortality require solutions that focus on early identification and intervention, reducing alcohol consumption at the population level (taxation, reduced availability and restricted promotion), and solutions tailored to local socioeconomic realities (unrecorded alcohol consumption, focused youth education). Simple screening tools and algorithms can be applied at the population level to identify alcohol misuse, diagnose ALD using non-invasive serum and imaging markers, and risk-stratify higher-risk ALD/AUD patients. Novel methods of healthcare delivery and platforms are needed (telehealth, outreach, use of non-healthcare providers, partnerships between primary and specialty care/tertiary hospitals) to proactively mitigate the global burden of ALD. An integrated approach that combines medical and AUD treatment is needed at the individual level to have the highest impact. Future needs include (1) improving quality of ALD data and standardizing care, (2) supporting innovative healthcare delivery platforms that can treat both ALD and AUD, (3) stronger and concerted advocacy by professional hepatology organizations, and (4) advancing implementation of digital interventions.","Asrani, Sumeet K; Mellinger, Jessica; Arab, Juan P; Shah, Vijay H",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986883/,132
160514,Factors associated with hospital admission for COVID-19 in HIV patients.,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND It is a common practice to secure both mesh and peritoneum using tacks when performing a transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair. The use of tacks to secure the mesh is well documented and has been associated with postoperative chronic pain. Recently, fibrin glue has been used to secure the mesh in these repairs but not used to reapproximate the incised peritoneum. This study assessed the technical feasibility of using fibrin glue for fixation of both mesh and peritoneum. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 33 TAPP hernia repairs were carried out in 27 consecutive patients. In all the patients, both mesh and peritoneum were secured with fibrin glue (20 primary inguinal hernia repairs, 5 bilateral hernia repairs, 1 recurrent inguinal hernia, and 1 recurrent bilateral hernia repair). RESULTS Patients were followed up at an outpatient clinic between the second and third week after surgery. Six patients were followed up through telephone. Patients were questioned on the following factors: residual postoperative pain (groin and port sites), unplanned GP or hospital visits, employment status and number of days between their surgery and return to both work and normal activities, and recurrence. No patients had residual groin or port site pain at a median of 21 days after surgery. No patient required an unplanned follow-up appointment with their GP. One patient (recurrent repair) developed a seroma postoperatively. Median time to normal activities was 10 days (range, 3 to 21 d). CONCLUSIONS Total glue fixation of mesh and peritoneum is technically feasible and early results show low rates of postoperative complications and pain. Randomized studies are needed to confirm this.","Phillips, Alexander W; Viswanath, Yirupaiahgari K S; Burns, Jessica K; Hall, Catriona E J; Horgan, Alan F","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e31828f85d5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686360/,132

There are many exogenous and endogenous etiological factors behind autoimmune diseases, which may be combined or dispersed to stimulate the autoimmune responses. Protein citrullination represents one of these factors. Harnessing specific citrullinated proteins/peptides could early predict and/or diagnose some of autoimmune diseases. Many generations of diagnostic tools based on citrullinated peptides with comparable specificity/sensitivity are available worldwide. AREAS COVERED In this review, we discuss the deimination reaction behind the citrullination of most known autoantigens targeted, different generations of diagnostic tools based on citrullinated probes with specificity/sensitivity of each as well as newly developed assays. Furthermore, the most advanced molecular analytical tools to detect the citrullinated residues in the biological fluid and their performance are also evaluated, providing new avenues to early detect autoimmune diseases with high accuracy. EXPERT OPINION With the current specificity/sensitivity tools available for autoimmune disease detection, emphasis must be placed on developing more advance and effective, early, rapid, and simple diagnostic devices for autoimmune disease monitoring (similar to a portable device for sugar test at home). The molecular analytical devices with dual and/or multiplexes functions should be more simplified and invest in clinical laboratories.","Alghamdi, Mohammed F; Redwan, Elrashdy M",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737159.2021.1933946; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34024239/,132

Our aim was to develop a system for early detection of disease pattern in the emergency department (ED) that would enhance opportunities for personalised accelerated care to prevent disease progression. A single Trust's COVID-19 response control command was established, and a reporting team with bioinformaticians was deployed to develop a real-time traffic light system to support clinical and operational teams. An attempt was made to identify predictive elements for thromboembolism, cytokine storm and ARDS based on physiological measurements and blood tests, and to communicate to clinicians managing the patient, initially via single consultants. The input variables were age, sex, and first recorded blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, heart rate, indices of oxygenation and C-reactive protein. Early admissions were used to refine the predictors used in the traffic lights. Of 923 consecutive patients who tested COVID-19 positive, 592 (64%) flagged at risk for thromboembolism, 241/923 (26%) for cytokine storm and 361/923 (39%) for ARDS. Thromboembolism and cytokine storm flags were met in the ED for 342 (37.1%) patients. Of the 318 (34.5%) patients receiving thromboembolism flags, 49 (5.3% of all patients) were for suspected thromboembolism, 103 (11.1%) were high-risk and 166 (18.0%) were medium-risk. Of the 89 (9.6%) who received a cytokine storm flag from the ED, 18 (2.0% of all patients) were for suspected cytokine storm, 13 (1.4%) were high-risk and 58 (6.3%) were medium-risk. Males were more likely to receive a specific traffic light flag. In conclusion, ED predictors were used to identify high proportions of COVID-19 admissions at risk of clinical deterioration due to severity of disease, enabling accelerated care targeted to those more likely to benefit. Larger prospective studies are encouraged.","Vizcaychipi, Marcela P; Shovlin, Claire L; McCarthy, Alex; Howard, Alice; Brown, Alexander; Hayes, Michelle; Singh, Suveer; Christie, Linsey; Sisson, Alice; Davies, Roger; Lockie, Christopher; Popescu, Monica; Gupta, Amandeep; Armstrong, James; Said, Hisham; Peters, Timothy; T Keays, Richard",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210199; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32948623/,132

METHODS Opioid-tolerant patients with 1 to 4 episodes of BTCP per day were enrolled. For randomization into double-blind treatment, patients must have titrated to a dose (100 to 1,600 mcg) providing effective analgesia for 2 consecutive BTCP episodes. The Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication was administered at baseline and at titration end and included a Global Satisfaction domain. RESULTS Of 130 patients undergoing titration, 98 (75%) achieved pain relief (median dose = 800 mcg). The most common doses that allowed for adequate pain relief were 800 mcg (24.5%) and 1,200 mcg (20.4%). Of 32 (25%) patients who withdrew from the study, only 3 (2.3%) did not achieve an effective dose. In patients attaining an effective dose, mean Global Satisfaction increased from 54.9 ± 2.1 at baseline to 75.3 ± 1.7 at the end of the titration phase. Seventy-eight patients (60%) reported ≥ 1 adverse event (AE). Thirty-three AEs (25.4%) were considered probably related to treatment, with nausea (6.2%) and somnolence (4.6%) most commonly reported. CONCLUSIONS In patients with BTCP, fentanyl sublingual spray can be rapidly and safely titrated to an effective dose, resulting in greater satisfaction with fentanyl sublingual spray than previous BTCP medications.","Rauck, Richard; Bull, Janet; Parikh, Neha; Dillaha, Larry; Stearns, Lisa",Pain practice : the official journal of World Institute of Pain,https://doi.org/10.1111/papr.12360; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26509361/,132

The tumour demonstrated hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The second case is a 45-year-old Asian male who had undergone kidney transplantation 16 years ago for IgA glomerulonephritis and who developed mild, self-limiting epigastric pain. US showed a 4.3-cm-diameter lesion that was predominantly hypoechoic and was either compressing or arising from segment 2 of the liver.

The cost and risk of R&D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vaccines in the event of an outbreak.","Vu, J.; Kaplan, B.; Chaudhuri, S.; Mansoura, M.; Lo, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.20.20039966v1?rss=1,132
163450,Cognitive impairment in patients after COVID-19,2021,"Oligomannoses are evolutionarily the oldest class of N-glycans, where the arms of the common pentasaccharide unit, i.e. Man α1-6)-[Manα(1-3)]-Manβ(1-4)-GlcNAcβ(1-4)-GlcNAcβ1-Asn, are functionalized exclusively with branched arrangements of mannose (Man) monosaccharide units. In mammalian species oligomannose N-glycans can have up to 9 Man, meanwhile structures can grow to over 200 units in yeast mannan. The highly dynamic nature, branching complexity and 3D structure of oligomannoses have been recently highlighted for their roles in immune escape and infectivity of enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1 and SARS-CoV2. The architectural features that allow these N-glycans to perform their functions is yet unclear, due to their intrinsically disordered nature that hinders their structural characterization. In this work we will discuss the results of over 54 µs of cumulative sampling by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of differently processed, free (not protein-linked) oligomannose N-glycans common in vertebrates. We then discuss the effects of a protein surface on their structural equilibria based on over 4 µs cumulative MD sampling of the fully glycosylated CD16a Fc gamma receptor (FcγRIIIa), where the type of glycosylation is known to modulate its binding affinity for IgG1s, regulating the antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Our results show that the protein’s structural constraints shift the oligomannoses conformational ensemble to promote conformers that satisfy the steric requirements and hydrogen bonding networks demanded by the protein’s surface landscape. More importantly, we find that the protein does not actively distort the N-glycans into structures not populated in the unlinked forms in solution. Ultimately, the highly populated conformations of the Man5 linked glycans support experimental evidence of high levels of hybrid complex forms at N45 and show a specific presentation of the arms at N162, which may be involved in mediating binding affinity to the IgG1 Fc.","Fogarty, Carl A; Fadda, Elisa",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.11.426234,132
163611,Extent of pharmacotherapy in COVID-19: an observational study in a dedicated hospital in Bangladesh,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease vaccine has been recently rolled out for health care workers in India. We aimed to determine the incidence of adverse events following immunization (AEFI) among healthcare workers (HCWs) after their first dose of the ChAdOx1nCoV-19 vaccine. Methodology: We recruited 218 HCWs for this cross-sectional study. We circulated a google form on the hospital and asked them to self-report their vaccination experience. Results: Two-thirds (69.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 63.1-75.7) had minor AEFI, and none had severe AEFI. Body ache (46.8%, 95% CI: 40-53.6) was the most common symptom followed by headache (30.3%, 95% CI: 24.2-36.8). Most of them (39.4%, 95% CI: 32.9-46.2) experienced symptoms within 4-24 h after taking the vaccine. Majority (78.9%) were anxious before the vaccination. The younger age group and female gender were significantly associated with AEFI. Conclusion: HCWs experienced minor, self-limiting AEFI with the first dose of ChAdOx1nCoV-19. The hospital reported no serious AEFI following the vaccination.","Inbaraj, L. R.; George, C. E.; Franklyn, N. N.",Current Medical Issues,https://doi.org/10.4103/cmi.cmi_50_21,132
165657,Evaluation of lymphocyte subtypes in COVID-19 patients,2021-07-16,"Introduction COVID-19 is a multi-systemic disease and cardiac involvement has been widely recognised. Impaired cardiac function is linked to worse prognosis and has important implications on patient management. Evidence-based recommendations to guide selection of COVID-19 patients for transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are lacking, and there are concerns regarding unnecessary exposure of sonographers to infection risks. Purpose 1. To determine the prevalence and nature of abnormal TTE findings in patients who underwent TTE within 6 months of admission to our centre with COVID-19 infection. 2. To determine if specific clinical characteristics were predictors of an abnormal TTE finding. Methods A retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to a single hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (through PCR) from 27/03/2020 to 21/06/2020, cross matched with the local TTE database.Data on patient demographics, TTE indication, biochemical markers, selected co-morbidities, ITU admission and mortality were collected. Patients with abnormal TTE were defined by the presence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), right ventricular systolic dysfunction (RVSD), regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA) or pericardial effusion. Where available, patients with abnormal TTE were compared to previous TTE results to determine if findings were new. If LVSD was previously present, any worsening in category of severity was considered significant. Unpaired t test and Fisher's exact test were used for between group statistical analysis. Results We identified 71 (12%) patients who underwent TTE from 597 patients admitted with a diagnosis of COVID-19. The mean age was 71 (42-93) years and 37 (52%) were male. 18 (25%) patients died within the admission and 15 (21%) required ITU care. The most frequent indications for TTE were suspected heart failure (42%), endocarditis (17%), MI (13%), valvular dysfunction (7%) and myopericarditis/effusion (7%).A total of 33 (46%) patients had an abnormal TTE. Of these, 30 (91%) were new findings. LVSD was detected in 26 (37%) cases: 5 (7%) mild, 8 (11%) moderate and 12 (17%) severe. RVSD was detected in 12 (17%), pericardial effusion in 9 (13%) and RWMA in 10 (14%).The only clinical characteristic that predicted an abnormal TTE was raised high sensitivity troponin (table 1). There was a trend towards an abnormal TTE in patients with known ischaemic heart disease (30% Vs 13%, p = 0.09). Increased mortality was observed in the abnormal TTE group (34% Vs 18%) although this did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions There was a high prevalence of significant TTE abnormalities in patients admitted to our hospital with COVID-19 where TTE was clinically indicated. Our cohort had a predominance for LVSD rather than RVSD compared to other studies. Raised high sensitivity troponin level was a predictor of an abnormal TTE and may guide selection of COVID-19 patients for TTE.","Chong, D.; Seyala, I.; Hamza, M.; Shah, S.; Makhlouf, K.; Wong, W.

This review focuses on the use of social media as a medium of instruction to aid the acquisition of speaking skills, which many learners find extremely challenging and inhibiting. Thus, this systematic review investigates the integration of social media in the teaching and learning of speaking skills. To ensure the systematic analysis of the selected articles, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines were utilized. A total of 36 peer-reviewed journal articles from the year 2016 to 2021 were accessed from two databases: ERIC and Google Scholar. Prior to the start of the review, an inclusion and exclusion criteria selection process was conducted to ensure the focus of the review. Overall, the articles reviewed presented the claim that the integration of social media is seen as a positive inclusion for the teaching of speaking skills using various social media applications. Findings reveal that there are improvements in speaking skills, as well as confidence to speak and a decline in speaking anxiety. Teachers and educators can now make use of the various social media platforms such as Telegram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and others to provide learners with more practice that is not only restricted to the classroom but has moved beyond it. © 2021 by the authors.

169395,Lung physiological variations in COVID-19 patients and inhalation therapy development for remodeled lungs,2021,"Hospitalized patients often do not reach the ADA-recommended glucose targets, which in turn increases complications, costs, length of stay, and readmission rate. The ADA supports the availability of trained specialists and teams to improve outcomes. Partly in response to the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, we instituted an inpatient ""virtual care"" initiative by electronic medical record (EMR) review. The ProActive Glucose Advice Team (pGAT) utilizes specialist expertise, automated computerized detection of hyperglycemia, and feedback to the primary service. The pGAT team members consist of an endocrinologist, a nurse diabetes care and education specialist, and a clinical dietician. The team reviewed a computer-generated report of inpatients with either 2 or more blood glucose values ≥180 mg/dl within the last 24 hours, and/or a hemoglobin A1c (A1c) ≥8%. We proposed to enter a brief, structured ""pGAT Note"" in the EMR, followed by a ""gentle reminder"" note the next day, including advice for a formal diabetes education and an endocrinology consultation. This proactive approach to the management of hyperglycemia would provide a summary review of the patient's glucose state, determine the level of patient's self-care skills, and steps to improve inpatient glycemic control. For preliminary data during the first 4-month phase after implementation of the pGAT initiative, we examined individualized discharge management and timely outpatient follow-up with endocrinology. Of 37 patients (28 males, 9 females;average age 60.4 years), 34 were treated with intensive insulin therapy with multiple daily insulin injections, 31 were seen in f/u within 2 weeks of discharge, and 25 were begun on Continuous Glucose Monitoring. The average A1c fell from an inpatient value of 11.6% to 8.4% measured between 2-4 months later. During the next pGAT phase, we intend to study inpatient therapy parameters, notably appropriate use of computerized insulin order sets, titration of basal insulin, and prandial-correction bolus insulin use.","Rizvi, Ali A.; Rich, Anita O.; Eldridge, Rita",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-827-p,132

Results from the population-based HUNT study in Norway,2021-08-26,"Recently, the world is witnessing a severe global health issue owing to the COVID 19 pandemic, initially encountered in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province in China. It spread rapidly, so does the fatality ratio. This pandemic has jeopardized the sustainable development goals at large. Still, the future is uncertain-the current study aimed at two objectives. The first is to review the past literature on the coronavirus family to map our current understanding of its epidemic outbarks and overview its social, environmental, and economic impact. The second stream of literature focused on classifying the best possible solutions under different scenarios due to the current situation. Finally, to provide future agenda for policymakers to restrain the sustainable development goals. We used Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) databases for the systematic literature review process. We followed a strict screening process recommended in the PRISMA guidelines for the screening and quality assessment of systematic literature review. The final 51 studies are included for the systematic literature review. A systematic review of the past literature identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), bovine Coronavirus, canine Coronavirus, and feline Coronavirus are the significant classifications of the Coronavirus family discuss in the literature. We highlighted the potential pitfalls in the past literature, mainly serious scarce collaborative and multidisciplinary research on the pandemic, although several researchers highlighted the issue. Findings of the current study indicate that most research is in a lab setting and experimental design. For sustainable development, there is a need to start collaborative work among the nations. We provided a framework for a pandemic strategic response plan through multidisciplinary research to mitigate the impact of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and to be prepared for future episodes. The future of the world after the 2019-COVID is more challenging and vital for humanity in terms of business, economic and social perspective. Social structures will change the current situation is showing based on literature and reports.

A huge number of lives succumbed to death due to the sudden outbreak of this corona virus infection. The specified symptoms of COVID-19 detection are very common like as normal flu;asymptomatic version of COVID-19 has become a critical issue. Therefore, as a precautionary measurement oxygen level needs to be monitored by every individual if no other critical condition is found. It is not the only parameter for COVID-19 detection but, as per the suggestions by different medical organizations such as WHO it is better to use oximeter to monitor the oxygen level in probable patients as a precaution. People are using the oximeters personally;however, not having any clue or guidance regarding the measurements obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we have shown a framework of oxygen level monitoring and severity calculation and probabilistic decision of being a COVID-19 patient. This framework is also able to maintain the privacy of patient information and uses probabilistic classification to measure the severity. Results are measured based on latency of blockchain creation and overall response, throughput, detection and severity accuracy.

172351,"Community and Academic Partner Creation of a Community-Informed, Behavior Theory-Based Music Video to Encourage Stroke Preparedness During the Covid-19 Pandemic",2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic confronts society with a dilemma between (in)visibility, security, and care. While invisibility might be sought by unregistered and undocumented people, being counted and thus visible during a pandemic is a precondition of existence and care. This article asks whether and how unregistered populations like undocumented migrants should be included in statistics and other “counting” exercises devised to track virus diffusion and its impact. In particular, the paper explores how such inclusion can be just, given that for unregistered people visibility is often associated with surveillance. It also reflects on how policymaking can act upon the relationship between data, visibility, and populations in pragmatic terms. Conversing with science and technology studies and critical data studies, the paper frames the dilemma between (in)visibility and care as an issue of sociotechnical nature and identifies four criteria linked to the sociotechnical characteristics of the data infrastructure enabling visibility. It surveys “counting” initiatives targeting unregistered and undocumented populations undertaken by European countries in the aftermath of the pandemic, and illustrates the medical, economic, and social consequences of invisibility. On the basis of our analysis, we outline four scenarios that articulate the visibility/invisibility binary in novel, nuanced terms, and identify in the “de facto inclusion” scenario the best option for both migrants and the surrounding communities. Finally, we offer policy recommendations to avoid surveillance and overreach and promote instead a more just “de facto” civil inclusion of undocumented populations.","Pelizza, Annalisa Milan Stefania Lausberg Yoren",Data & Policy,https://doi.org/10.1017/dap.2021.19,132
173248,Use of 1-MNA to Improve Exercise Tolerance and Fatigue in Patients After COVID-19,2021-07-14,"The scope of this paper is focused on the multidimensional poverty problem in Jordan. Household expenditure and income surveys provide data that are used for identifying and measuring the poverty status of Jordanian households. However, carrying out such surveys is hard, time consuming, and expensive. Machine learning could revolutionize this process. The contribution of this work is the proposal of an original machine learning approach to assess and monitor the poverty status of Jordanian households. This approach takes into account all the household expenditure and income surveys that took place since the early beginning of the new millennium. This approach is accurate, inexpensive, and makes poverty identification cheaper and much closer to real-time. Data preprocessing and handling imbalanced data are major parts of this work. Various machine learning classification models are applied. The LightGBM algorithm has achieved the best performance with 81% F1-Score. The final machine learning classification model could transform efforts to track and target poverty across the country. This work demonstrates how powerful and versatile machine learning can be, and hence, it promotes for adoption across many domains in both the private sector and government.","Alsharkawi, Adham Al-Fetyani Mohammad Dawas Maha Saadeh Heba Alyaman Musa",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13031412,132
173259,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the MR availability for iron overloaded patients,2021,"Digital culture is impacting heavily on young people's lives, be it through their own attachment to social media through mobile devices, or the new Covid-19 demands on distance online education. Maryanne Wolf in Reader, Come Home (2018) argues through her cognitive neuroscientific studies on reading, that the mind of readers is changing given the media they are constantly using (mobile phones, computers). One of the issues Wolf debates is the loss of deep detailed modes of reading comprehension or the willingness of today's (young) readers to engage with complex sentences or longer texts. She claims, however, that really good reading is close reading, a form of reading that requires intellectual effort from the reader involving the intellectual skills of reasoning, thinking and understanding (Wolf, 2018). How can this be promoted in the digital age? This is the aim of a European Erasmus+ funded project the authors are involved in called e-Mysteries: Detective Stories to Engage Students in Close Reading with the Use of Mobile Devices (short name: e-Mysteries). New forms of reading, such as those being developed by the e-Mysteries project, create opportunities for the participatory empathetic, critical, and analytical engagement of students with what they read as well as with individual and collaborative writing in a modern flux of consumer-producer.","Pires, M.

However, a global shortage of N95 FFRs was observed worldwide during initial phase of pandemic. Reusing mask was the only strategy and various decontamination methods were suggested. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the compliance rate of limited reuse and extended use policy implemented in hospital. Methods: Limited reuse and extended use policy of N95 FFRs was implemented for one month in lower risk areas. Compliance to policy was checked by questionnaires asked to 100 healthcare workers verbally and challenges faced by them were noted. Results: It was observed that overall compliance to policy was 80%. Major reasons of non-compliance were suffocation, followed by smell from mask and loosened strips. Conclusion: Limited reuse and extended use method was successfully used as a bridge until sufficient N95 FFRs were not available although effective decontamination method must be established in hospitals to prepare ourselves for the future pandemics. © 2021 Occupational Health and Safety Society of Nepal.

The concepts of Rhetoric of Reaction (HIRSCHMAN, 1992), Ethos and Pathos of Aristotle's Classical Rhetoric and Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca's New Rhetoric (1996) were the framework for the analysis. Our methodology was based on the analysis of three fake news reports related to the negationist campaign against the Covid-19 pandemic, each of which was taken as a prototype of the following categories proposed by Hirschman (1992): perversity, futility, and jeopardy theses. The results indicate that fake news should be understood as an inherently digital phenomenon that uses well-developed argumentative strategies as its objective is to cause discredit and doubt in the public opinion. Therefore, if we take the average citizen into account, fake news is highly persuasive and consequently should be considered of extreme danger to society and its democratic and scientific principles.

A number of vaccines are available for this novel virus, but these are in the preliminary stage and are also not available to everyone. As the virus is very contagious, protection and prevention are the best way to survive and get rid of this disease. The virus affects the human body by entering through the nose, mouth, and eyes, so face protection with an appropriate mask is highly advisable. Combined masks made with activated carbon (AC) can effectively adsorb the virus because of its high surface area and broad functional groups. Such combined masks can also control coronavirus transmission by capturing harmful gases and smoke as they help in decreasing the spread of the virus.","Reza, M.

Several epidemiological studies suggested cross-protection between influenza vaccination and COVID-19. In a large academic Dutch hospital, we found that SARS-CoV-2 infection was less common among employees who had received a previous influenza vaccination: relative risk reductions of 37% and 49% were observed following influenza vaccination during the first and second COVID-19 waves, respectively. The quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine induced a trained immunity program that boosted innate immune responses against various viral stimuli and fine-tuned the anti-SARS-CoV-2 response, which may result in better protection against COVID-19. Influenza vaccination led to transcriptional reprogramming of monocytes and reduced systemic inflammation. These epidemiological and immunological data argue for potential benefits of influenza vaccination against COVID-19, and future randomized trials are warranted to test this possibility.","Debisarun, P.

The simple and rapid detection techniques with high sensitivity and specificity are always urgently needed. However, the current nucleic acid detection techniques are still limited the traditional amplification and hybridization. To overcome the limitation, we here develop a CRISPR/Cas9-assisted DNA detection (CADD). In this detection, DNA sample is incubated with a pair of capture sgRNAs (sgRNAa and sgRNAb) specific to a target DNA, dCas9, a signal readout-related probe, and an oligo-coated solid support beads or microplate at room temperature for 15 min. During this incubation, the dCas9-sgRNA-DNA complex is formed and captured on solid support by the capture sequence of sgRNAa and the signal readout-related probe is captured by the capture sequence of sgRNAb. Finally the detection result is reported by a fluorescent or colorimetric signal readout. This detection was verified by detecting DNA of bacteria, cancer cell and virus. Especially, by designing a set of sgRNAs specific to 15 high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs), the HPV infection in 64 clinical cervical samples were successfully detected by the method. All detections can be finished in 30 minutes at room temperature.

The author argues teachers regulated their responses to literature according to emotional rules they perceived to be associated with the teaching profession. Understanding teachers’ responses helps educators, teacher educators and educational researchers consider what conditions and supports may be required for teachers and students to share emotions related to loss in authentic ways in ELA classrooms.Design/methodology/approachTo examine changes teachers made in literature instruction following personal loss, the author conducted a thematic analysis of 80 questionnaire responses.FindingsThe author found teachers changed literature instruction related to three areas: teachers’ relationship to students, teachers’ instruction surrounding texts and teachers’ reader responses. Responses highlighted how teachers adhered to emotional rules, including a perception of teachers as authorities and caretakers of children. Teachers considered literature instruction to require maintaining focus on texts, and avoided emotional response unless it aided textual comprehension.Originality/valueScholars have argued for literature instruction inclusive of both loss experiences and also emotional response, with particular focus on students’ loss experiences.

177536,Genetic risk factors and Covid-19 severity in Brazil: results from BRACOVID Study,2021-10-07,"BACKGROUND: Multimorbid patients have worse outcomes following acute hospitalisation. These include increased mortality as an in-patient and after hospital discharge, and increased morbidity and dependence requiring greater use of care facilities. The literature is unclear on the views and wishes of multimorbid patients regarding the outcomes of acute hospitalisation, specifically regarding survival with additional functional disability following acute illness. This is increasingly relevant, with the recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance on admission to hospital and critical care being based on the presence of comorbidities and function as opposed to numerical age. Objectives: We performed a systematic review to assess the current qualitative literature exploring attitudes, wishes and perspectives of adult patients with multimorbidity on surviving future acute illness and subsequent acquired functional disability. METHODS: Eligibility criteria: Eligible studies addressed the attitudes, wishes and perspectives of multimorbid adults to illness and treatment-acquired disability using qualitative methods. Information sources: A search of PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases was conducted from database inception through April 2020. References lists from selected papers and NICE Guidelines on Multimorbidity (NG56) were searched iteratively for additional relevant articles. Review methods: Two researchers reviewed candidate full texts independently. Relevant data was extracted to an evidence table. The risk of bias was avoided by adhering to the previously published extensive search strategy and use of qualitative methodology. RESULTS: From 35606 records of which 6370 were duplicates, 20 full texts were reviewed for inclusion, but none met the eligibility criteria. Coverage of domains of importance to multimorbid adults and those highlighted in the NICE guidelines on multimorbidity (NG56) by the 20 short-listed papers was determined; no publications were found to address all domains. DISCUSSION: No studies were identified which have applied appropriate qualitative methodology to understand the wishes, attitudes, and preferences of multimorbid adults regarding treatment and outcomes of acute illness. Such enquiries need to be urgently undertaken to inform and progress policy and clinical practice relating to decisions around admission to hospital and critical care.

Objectives: of the current study to assess the prevalence and course of SARSCoV-2 infection in patients receiving various biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. Methods: to assess the severity of the course of SARS-CoV-2, discharged epicrisis from hospitals or the conclusion of computed tomography were used. The average age of the patients ranged from 41.4 + 11.6 years. In the evaluated sample, 47 patients (49.47%) were males. Among the infected of SARS-CoV-2 were patients with rheumatoid arthritis -45 (47.4%), spondyloarthritis -39 (41.1%), systemic connective tissue diseases -11 (11.5%). Results: Since March 2020, among the 1319 patients with rheumatic diseases observed at the St. Petersburg Center of therapy biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs, 95 patients (7,2%) had SARS-CoV-2 infection. In 57,9% (55 patients) there was a mild course of infection, in 35,8% of cases (34 patients) -a moderate course, in 6,3% (6 patients) -a severe course. Inpatient treatment was received by 29,5% (28 patients). A favorable outcome was noted in 95.8%, and a lethal outcome in 4,2%. The use of interleukin-6 inhibitors was required in 2,1% of patients (2) due to the development of a cytokine storm. The structure of the received biological therapy in the severity of the course is shown in Table 1. Conclusion: Taking into account the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, further study of the course of infection in patients with rheumatic diseases, including those receiving biological therapy, is required.

Asian individuals have reported discrimination within their workplaces, in their communities, and against Asian-owned businesses. Many for-profit organizations have failed to acknowledge this surge. We argue that organizations should adopt policies to protect their Asian employees and clientele. On the basis of behavioral science research and knowledge of best practices for promoting diversity and inclusion, we suggest that organizational leaders create crisis task forces to find ways to reduce discrimination against Asian employees and that the leaders more generally reaffirm organizational commitments to diversity and inclusion, communicate those commitments to stakeholders, visibly enact expected organizational norms related to diversity and inclusion, and establish or reassess accountability systems to ensure that policies and norms are followed. © 2020, Brookings Institution Press.

In this study, we develop an optimization model to optimize the logistics for a fleet of drones for timely delivery of medical items (e.g., medicines, test kits, and vaccines) to hard-to-access locations (i.e., rural and suburban areas). We propose a novel timeslot formulation that schedules and sequences a set of trips to serve several demand locations. On each trip, a drone starts from an urban provider, visits one or more charging platforms (if required), serves a clinic in rural or suburban areas, and returns to the corresponding provider. The problem consists of selecting locations for charging stations, assigning clinics to providers, and scheduling and sequencing the trips such that the total completion time to serve all demand points is minimized. To improve the computational efficiency of the solution method, we use a preprocessing procedure to reduce the solution space by eliminating the dominated trips from the pool of trips. A set of numerical experiments performed on simulated instances and on a case study in Louisville, KY. The results unveil interesting insights into the logistics of the proposed drone delivery system.","Ghelichi, Zabih Gentili Monica Mirchandani Pitu B.; en,",Computers &amp; Operations Research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cor.2021.105443,132

Notwithstanding, the 1-meter distance is not straightforward to estimate by unaided eyes, and it is difficult to carry along a meter rule regularly. Subsequently, inadvertently connect with others. Therefore, this would build our danger of getting contaminated by the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, the thermometer put at each person’s passageway has the threat of causing disease since numerous individuals share it.

The objective was to develop a mathematical model designed to predict the hospitalization and ICU admission demands due to COVID-19 to forecast the availability of hospital resources for the scheduling of oncological surgery and medical treatment that require hospitalitation or possible use of ICU services. Methods: We have implemented a SEIR model designed to predict the number of patients requiring hospitalization and ICU admissions for COVID-19. We evaluated the model using the number of cases registered in the hospitals of the province of Granada (Spain), that altogether cover 914,678 inhabitants. Calibration was performed using data recorded between March 15 and September 22, 2020. After that, the model was validated by comparing the predictions with data registered between September 23 and November 7, 2020. Besides, we performed a predictive analysis of scenarios regarding different possible sanitary measures. Results: Using patient registered data we developed a mathematical model that reflects the flow among the different sub-groups related to COVID-19 pandemics (Table). The best algorithm that fitted the disease dynamics was Particle Swarm Optimization, that minimized the difference between model output and real data used to calibrate the model. The validation phase showed the accuracy of the predictions, especially concerning trends in hospitalizations and ICU admissions. The different scenarios modelled on November 10, 2020 allowed us to predict the evolution of the pandemic until July 1, 2021, and to detect the peaks and valleys of disease prevalence. Conclusions: The mathematical model presented provides predictions on the evolution of COVID-19, the prevalence and hospital or ICU care demands. The predictions can be used to detect periods of greater availability of hospital resources that make it possible to schedule the oncologic surgery and intensify the care for oncologic patients. Furthermore, our model can be adapted to other population by recalibrating the model according to demographic data, the local evolution of the pandemic and the health policies.

183018,COVID-19 Pandemic and the New State of Oncology Practice: An Editorial,2020,"At times of crisis, access to information takes on special importance, and in the Internet age of constant connectedness, this is truer than ever. Over the course of the pandemic, the huge public demand for constantly updated health information has been met with a massive response from official and scientific sources, as well as from the mainstream media. However, it has also generated a vast stream of user-generated digital postings. Such phenomena are often regarded as unhelpful or even dangerous since they unwittingly spread misinformation or make it easier for potentially harmful disinformation to circulate. However, little is known about the dynamics of such forums or how scientific issues are represented there. To address this knowledge gap, this chapter uses a corpus-assisted discourse approach to examine how “expert” knowledge and other sources of authority are represented and contested in a corpus of 10,880 reader comments responding to Mail Online articles on the development of the COVID-19 vaccine in February–July 2020. The results show how “expert” knowledge is increasingly problematized and politicized, while other strategies are used to claim authority. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of sociological theories, and some tentative solutions are proposed.","Breeze, Ruth",Publications,https://doi.org/10.3390/publications9030034,132

This research was conducted to investigate a possible connection between the amount of vaccination-related disinformation and the willingness among the Dutch population to get vaccinated. The contribution of this research is 1) developing a tool-supported approach to identify words and bigrams used in alternative news outlet, 2) classifying disinformation-related vocabulary, 3) applying the approach that relates disinformation and vaccination willingness in the context of the COVID pandemic, highlighting its strengths and limitations. We conceptualised vaccination disinformation, expressed it in certain’trigger terms’ and plotted the popularity of those terms amongst Dutch Internet users over time, using Google Trends and Twitter data. Using a linear regression model, we combined this with vaccination willingness studies of June through December of 2020 to investigate a possible correlation. Our results, while not statistically significant, did point towards a negative relationship between disinformation spread and willingness to vaccinate.

For investigating whether this is truly the case, we conducted a survey to estimate the COVID-19 related mortality and cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Omdurman the most populated city of the tripartite metropolis Khartoum in Sudan. Methods A retrospective, cross-sectional, mortality and seroprevalence survey was conducted in Omdurman, Sudan, from March 1, until April 10 2021. A two-stage cluster sampling method was used to investigate the death rate for the pre-pandemic (January 1, 2019-February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1, 2020 - day of the survey) period using questionnaires. The seroprevalence survey was performed in a subset of households and all consenting members were tested with a rapid serological test (SD-Biosensor) and a subgroup additionally with ELISA (EUROIMMUN). Fisher's exact test was used to assess differences between the pre-and pandemic periods and a random effect and Bayesian latent class model to adjust for test performance. Findings Data from 27315 people (3716 households) for the entire recall period showed a 67% (95% CI 32-110) increase in death rate between the pre-pandemic (0.12 deaths/10000 people/day [95% CI 0.10-0.14]) and pandemic (0.20 [0.16-0.23]) periods. Notably, a 74% (30-133) increase in death was observed among people aged [≥]50 years. The adjusted seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 54.6% (95% CI 51.4-57.8). The seroprevalence was significantly associated with age, increasing up to 80.7% (71.7-89.7) for the oldest age group ([≥]50 years). Interpretation Our results showed a significant elevated mortality for the pandemic period with a considerable excess mortality in Omdurman, Sudan. The overall high seroprevalence indicated a different age pattern compared to other countries, with a significant increase by age. Funding Medecins Sans Frontieres","Moser, W.; Fahal, M. A.

186049,Methods to identify increased risk of coronary disease in the general population: conclusion is oversimplification.,2003,"To analyze the mechanism of integral membrane protein localization in the early Golgi apparatus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we have used Och1p, a cis-Golgi mannosyltransferase. A series of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged fusion proteins was constructed in which invertase is appended to the Golgi-luminal carboxy terminus of full-length Och1p. Several constructs included a Kex2p cleavage site between the Och1p and invertase moieties to monitor transit to the Kex2p-containing TGN. Cells expressing an Och1p-invertase fusion do not secrete invertase, but those expressing an Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein secrete high levels of invertase in a Kex2p-dependent manner. The Och1p-Kex2p site-invertase fusion protein is cleaved with a half-time of 5 min, and the process proceeds to completion. Before cleavage the protein receives glycosyl modifications indicative of passage through the medial- and trans-Golgi, therefore cleavage occurs after ordered anterograde transport through the Golgi to the TGN. Transit to distal compartments is not induced by the invertase moiety, since noninvertase fusion constructs encounter the same glycosyltransferases and Kex2p as well. The Och1p-HA moiety, irrespective of whether it is generated by cleavage of the fusion protein in the TGN or synthesized de novo, is degraded with a half-time of about 60 min. Thus, the half-time of degradation is 12-fold longer than the time required to reach the TGN. At steady state, de novo- synthesized and TGN-generated HA epitope-tagged Och1p reside in a compartment with a buoyant density identical to that of wild-type Och1p and distinct from that of the vacuole or the TGN. Finally, och1 null cells that express an Ochlp fusion construct known to rapidly encounter the TGN glycosylate invertase to the same extent as wild-type cells, indicating that they have phenotypically wild-type Och1p activity. These results lead us to propose a model for Och1p-HA localization that involves movement to distal compartments, at least as far as the TGN, followed by retrieval to the cis compartment, presumably by vesicular transport.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120767/,132

One outcome of many virus infections is the regulation of cellular trafficking machinery. Viral proteins recruit and interact with cellular trafficking proteins to divert the normal trafficking of key proteins or to induce the formation of novel membrane structures in the host cell. These alterations often increase replication efficiency by mislocalizing immune regulators or restriction factors ot by creating platforms for replication and assembly of new virus particles. Our knowledge of how viruses interact with the cellular trafficking machinery is still limited and furthering this understanding will be important for the future development of prophylactic and therapeutic treatments. This review provides a glimpse of the types of interplay between viral and cellular factors that result in a disruption of cellular trafficking or modifications to cellular membranes.,"Cruz, Linda; Buchkovich, Nicholas J",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28410149/,132

According to recommendations implemented by the Israeli Obstetric Anesthesia Society, which were implemented due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, we increased the rate of neuraxial anesthesia among deliveries. OBJECTIVES To compare the rates of neuraxial anesthesia in our cesarean population before and during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. METHODS We included consecutive women undergoing an elective cesarean delivery from two time periods: pre-SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (15 February 2019 to 14 April 2019) and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (15 February 2020 to 15 April 2020). We collected demographic data, details about cesarean delivery, and anesthesia complications. RESULTS We included 413 parturients undergoing consecutive elective cesarean delivery identified during the study periods: 205 before the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and 208 during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We found a statistically significant difference in neuraxial anesthesia rates between the groups: before the pandemic (92/205, 44.8%) and during (165/208, 79.3%; P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated that patient and provider education about neuraxial anesthesia can increase its utilization.

We designed the Rapid Reperfusion Registry to capture the percentage of stroke patients who meet the target and its impact on outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS This is a retrospective analysis of anterior circulation patients treated with IAT within 9 hours of symptom onset. Data was collected from December 31, 2011 to December 31, 2012 at 2 centers and from July 1, 2012 to December 31, 2012 at 7 centers. Short “Door-to-Puncture” (D2P) time was hypothesized to be associated with good patient outcomes. A total of 478 patients with a mean age of 68±14 years and median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 18 (IQR 14 to 21) were analyzed. The median times for IAT delivery were 234 minutes (IQR 163 to 304) for “last known normal-to-groin puncture” time (LKN-to-GP) and 112 minutes (IQR 68 to 176) for D2P time. The overall good outcome rate was 39.7% for the entire cohort. In a multivariable model adjusting for age, NIHSS, hypertension, diabetes, reperfusion status, and symptomatic hemorrhage, both short LKN-to-GP (OR 0.996; 95% CI [0.993 to 0.998]; P<0.001) and short D2P times (OR 0.993, 95% CI [0.990 to 0.996]; P<0.001) were associated with good outcomes. Only 52% of all patients in the registry achieved the targeted D2P time of 2 hours.

192794,[CPAP for patients with COVID-19].,2020-08-10,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is associated with serious complications, such as staple line (SL) leaks and bleeding. In order to prevent the occurrence of these complications, surgeons have advocated the need to strengthen the staple line. The aim of this randomized controlled study was to compare the efficacy of three different ways of strengthening of the SL in LSG in preventing surgical post-operative complications. METHODS Between April 2012 and December 2014, 600 patients (pts) scheduled for LSG were prospectively randomized into groups without SL reinforcement (group A) or with SL reinforcement including fibrin glue coverage (group B), or oversewn SL with imbricating absorbable (Monocryl™; group C) or barbed (V lock®) running suture (group D). Primary endpoints were post-operative leaks, bleeding, and stenosis, while secondary outcomes consisted of the time to perform the staple line reinforcement (SLR) and total operative time. RESULTS Mean SLR operative time was lower for group B (3.4 ± 1.3 min) compared with that for groups C (26.8 ± 8.5 min) and D (21.1 ± 8.4 min) (p < 0.0001). Mean total operative time was 100.7 ± 16.4 min (group A), 104.4 ± 22.1 min (group B), 126.2 ± 18.9 min (group C), and 124.6 ± 22.8 (group D) (p < 0.0001). Post-operative leaks, bleeding, and stenosis were recorded in 14 pts (2.3 %), 5 pts (0.8 %), and 7 pts (1.1 %), respectively, without statistical difference between the groups. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that SLR during LSG, with an imbricating or non-imbricating running suture or with fibrin glue, is an unrewarding surgical act with the sole effect of prolonging the operative time.","Carandina, S; Tabbara, M; Bossi, M; Valenti, A; Polliand, C; Genser, L; Barrat, Christophe",Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26489744/,132

193672,Repeated Covid-19 Infection Exists: A Case Series From Pakistan.,2021,"The life cycle of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) involves a unique process called discontinuous transcription by which a set of 3' coterminal subgenomic mRNAs (sgmRNA) with identical 5' leader sequences can be generated. The current study demonstrates that the replication intermediates of minus strand of subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) can be readily recovered from SARS-CoV infected cells. A novel sgmRNA (M-1) was identified as a short version of membrane (M) gene. Transcriptional regulatory sequences (TRS) of SARS-CoV and Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV) sgmRNAs contain a species specific core element (CE). The sizes of leader sequences in MHVs vary not only in different viral strains but also among different genes in the same strain. Leader alterations such as deletion and nucleotide substitution were observed in MHVs, while a dynamic one-orientation 'sequential deletion' was found among the leaders of 76 SARS-CoV isolates. These results imply that the leader sequence of coronavirus might be unstable and leader alterations during SARS-CoV transmission in humans might have negative impact on its viral infectivity.","Liu, Li; Chen, Wei",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28930535/,132

Twenty-five four-week-old BALB/c female mice inoculated intranasally with either ReoV (strain BYD1) alone, or ReoV combined with SARS-CoV (strain BJF) displayed ejecting fur and loss of body weight compared with control animals. ReoV and SARS-CoV were isolated from most postmortem tissues. The histopathological features of ReoV infected animals consisted of diffuse alveolar damage, with scattered hemorrhage, hyaline membrane formation and interstitial pneumonia. A typical type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and fibrogranulomatous tissue formation in the alveolar septae were observed both in the animals inoculated simultaneously with these two viruses and in the animals inoculated firstly with SARS-CoV, followed by ReoV. The animals inoculated firstly with ReoV, followed with SARS-CoV displayed scattered hemorrhage in the alveolar septa. Furthermore, other lesions in above two combination groups included depletion of lymphocytes in the germinal center of lymph nodes in the lung hilus and the spleen, hemorrhagic necrosis in white pulp of spleen, hydroid degeneration, and fatty degeneration in the liver and kidney. Mice induced with SARS-CoV alone did not display clinical signs, characteristically hyaline membrane formation, hemorrhage and early pulmonary fibrosis in lung tissue. This study demonstrated that the newly isolated ReoV might be a virulent pathogen for BALB/c mice.

These factors operate in the context of an increasingly globalized economy. From an ethical point of view, selective and targeted ""raiding"" of developing countries' medical workforce by wealthier countries is not acceptable. However, within specific countries, additional factors need to be identified to moderate the situation. I discuss the context in which Canada, a developed country, has struggled with workforce planning, with troubling results. I identify challenges for Canada but emphasize that decisions based on sloppy assumptions or inadequate data can lead to invalid policies, and poorly coordinated implementation can lead to a waste of human capital.

As a technique, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has proven to reduce the rate of occurrence of complications, and thereby obtain improved survival rates. In the present case study, its use in treating central bronchogenic carcinoma with invasion of the main bronchus and pulmonary artery is reported. A case study of a 68-year-old man with a history of smoking 15-20 cigarettes per day for 40 years is described, who presented with a cough and hemoptysis. A bronchial sleeve left upper lobectomy and pulmonary angioplasty were performed with complete VATS and routine lymph node dissection. The preoperative diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung (cT2, N2, M0, stage IIIA) was confirmed as SCC through the postoperative pathological examination, leading to the tumor staging: pT2, N1, M0, stage IIB. These results were obtained without sacrificing the oncological principles of thoracic surgery. It has been demonstrated that VATS may be applied for treating central bronchogenic carcinoma with invasion of the main bronchus and pulmonary artery. However, end-to-end bronchial anastomosis and continuous suture of the pulmonary artery were difficult to perform, and use of the VATS procedure is on a learning curve, which will be informative for surgeons and their assistants.","Wan, Jun; Zhang, Renquan",Molecular and clinical oncology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27900078/,132

The outcome will revolve around preparation in three key areas: Definition of the role of general practice within a broad primary care pandemic response, and adequate preparation within general practices so they can play that role well. Planning exercises and forums must include GPs, and rehearsals must include practical experience for general practices and their staff. Local Divisions of General Practice and GP practices can advocate for this, can define their role, and can prepare by using pandemic preparedness checklists; Definition and enactment of communication strategies to facilitate transfer of useful clinical and administrative data from practices and rapid dissemination of information into the community via general practice; Resource provision, which should be centrally funded but locally distributed, with personal protective equipment, vaccines and antivirals readily available for distribution. Resources must include support for human resource management to ensure appropriate health care professionals reach areas of workforce demand.

Previous reports have suggested a possible correlation between iNOS, peroxynitrite, related nitrogen-derived oxidants, and the demyelinating processes in MS. We have demonstrated iNOS-immunoreactive cells in both acute-MS and diffuse-sclerosis-type lesions. In acute-MS lesions, iNOS was localized in both monocytes/macrophages and reactive astrocytes. However, foamy (myelin-laden) macrophages and the majority of reactive astrocytes were iNOS negative. In specimens from the childhood MS patient, iNOS protein was present only in a subpopulation of reactive or hypertrophic astrocytes. In contrast, no iNOS staining was detected in chronic-MS lesions. Immunohistochemical staining of acute-MS lesions with an antibody to nitrotyrosine revealed codistribution of iNOS- and nitrotyrosine-positive cells, although nitrotyrosine staining was more widespread in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. In diffuse-sclerosis-type lesions, nitrotyrosine staining was present in hypertrophic astrocytes, whereas it was absent in chronic-MS lesions. These results suggest that NO and nitrogen-derived oxidants may play a role in the initiation of demyelination in acute-MS lesions but not in the later phase of the disease.","Oleszak, E L; Zaczynska, E; Bhattacharjee, M; Butunoi, C; Legido, A; Katsetos, C D",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9665945/,132

202060,Hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19: the importance of scrutiny of positive trials,2020,"Centromeres of mammalian chromosomes are rich in repetitive DNAs that are packaged into specialized nucleoprotein structures called heterochromatin. In humans, the major centromeric repetitive DNA, alpha-satellite DNA, has been extensively sequenced and shown to contain binding sites for CENP-B, an 80-kDa centromeric autoantigen. The present report reveals that African green monkey (AGM) cells, which contain extensive alpha-satellite arrays at centromeres, appear to lack the well-characterized CENP-B binding site (the CENP-B box). We show that AGM cells express a functional CENP-B homolog that binds to the CENP-B box and is recognized by several independent anti-CENP-B antibodies. However, three independent assays fail to reveal CENP-B binding sites in AGM DNA. Methods used include a gel mobility shift competition assay using purified AGM alpha-satellite, a novel kinetic electrophoretic mobility shift assay competition protocol using bulk genomic DNA, and bulk sequencing of 76 AGM alpha-satellite monomers. Immunofluorescence studies reveal the presence of significant levels of CENP-B antigen dispersed diffusely throughout the nuclei of interphase cells. These experiments reveal a paradox. CENP-B is highly conserved among mammals, yet its DNA binding site is conserved in human and mouse genomes but not in the AGM genome. One interpretation of these findings is that the role of CENP-B may be in the maintenance and/or organization of centromeric satellite DNA arrays rather than a more direct involvement in centromere structure.","Goldberg, I G; Sawhney, H; Pluta, A F; Warburton, P E; Earnshaw, W C",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8756673/,132

Extreme production of many kinds of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines occur in severe COVID-19 that called cytokine storm. Signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT-3) present in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and can be stimulated by a vast range of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Thus, STAT-3 can participate in the induction of inflammatory responses during coronavirus infections. STAT-3 can also suppress anti-virus interferon response and induce unbalanced anti-virus adaptive immune response, through influencing Th17-, Th1-, Treg-, and B cell-mediated functions. Furthermore, STAT-3 can contribute to the M2 macrophage polarization, lung fibrosis and thrombosis. Moreover, STAT-3 may be directly targeted by some virus-derived protein and operate as a pro-viral or anti-viral element in a virus-specific process. Here, the possible contribution of STAT-3 to the pathogenesis of COVID-19 was explained, while providing potential approaches to target this transcription factor in an attempt for COVID-19 treatment.","Jafarzadeh, Abdollah; Nemati, Maryam; Jafarzadeh, Sara",Microb Pathog,,132

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,491; deaths = 102. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 215 cases notified between 8 and 21 June, 75% (163 cases) were notified from Victoria. Most of these cases were acquired locally. In contrast, cases notified from other states (NSW, Qld and WA) over this period were mostly overseas-acquired. Of locally-acquired cases in Victoria in this period, 51% were associated with contacts of a confirmed case or in a known outbreak, while 49% were unable to be linked to another case or were under investigation at the time of reporting. There are several clusters across a range of settings, including extended families, hotel quarantine facilities and a retail store, with most cases limited in geographic spread to a number of Local Government Areas around Melbourne. In response, the Victorian Government has re-introduced restrictions for household and outdoor gatherings, has delayed plans to ease other restrictions and has implemented enhanced public health response activities, particularly with regard to testing and contact tracing. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care, with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18 years, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 21 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.3%. Other countries in the Americas region, such as Brazil and Chile, are seeing rapid growth in case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, while there is significant growth in the South East Asia region, including in India and Bangladesh. Reported cases are increasing in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. In the Pacific region there are few new cases reported daily.",,,,132

205218,Journal Club,2021,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ventilator sharing was suggested to increase availability of mechanical ventilation. The safety and feasibility of ventilator sharing is unknown. METHODS: A single ventilator in pressure control mode was used with flow control valves to simultaneously ventilate two patients with different lung compliances. The system was first evaluated using high-fidelity human patient simulator mannequins and then tested for 1 h in two pairs of COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. Patients were matched on positive end-expiratory pressure, fractional inspired oxygen tension, and respiratory rate. Tidal volume and peak airway pressure (PMAX) were recorded from each patient using separate independent spirometers and arterial blood gas samples drawn at 0, 30, and 60 min. The authors assessed acid-base status, oxygenation, tidal volume, and PMAX for each patient. Stability was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variation. RESULTS: The valves performed as expected in simulation, providing a stable tidal volume of 400 ml each to two mannequins with compliance ratios varying from 20:20 to 20:90 ml/cm H2O. The system was then tested in two pairs of patients. Pair 1 was a 49-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, and a 55-yr-old man, ideal body weight 64 kg, with lung compliance 27 ml/cm H2O versus 35 ml/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.2 to 1.7%, and for PMAX 0 to 1.1%. Pair 2 was a 32-yr-old man, ideal body weight 62 kg, and a 56-yr-old woman, ideal body weight 46 kg, with lung compliance 12 ml/cm H2O versus 21 ml/cm H2O. The coefficient of variation for tidal volume was 0.4 to 5.6%, and for PMAX 0 to 2.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Differential ventilation using a single ventilator is feasible. Flow control valves enable delivery of stable tidal volume and PMAX similar to those provided by individual ventilators.","Levin, Matthew A; Shah, Anjan; Shah, Ronak; Kane, Erica; Zhou, George; Eisenkraft, James B; Chen, Martin D",Anesthesiology,,132

208131,The impact of coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) on oral health,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since March 11, 2020 when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of infected cases, the number of deaths, and the number of affected countries have climbed rapidly. To understand the impact of COVID-19 on public health, many studies have been conducted for various countries. To complement the available work, in this article we examine Canadian COVID-19 data for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020 with the aim to forecast the dynamic trend in a short term. METHOD: We focus our attention on Canadian data and analyze the four provinces, Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Quebec, which have the most severe situations in Canada. To build predictive models and conduct prediction, we employ three models, smooth transition autoregressive (STAR) models, neural network (NN) models, and susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) models, to fit time series data of confirmed cases in the four provinces separately. In comparison, we also analyze the data of daily infections in two states of USA, Texas and New York state, for the period of March 18, 2020 to August 16, 2020. We emphasize that different models make different assumptions which are basically difficult to validate. Yet invoking different models allows us to examine the data from different angles, thus, helping reveal the underlying trajectory of the development of COVID-19 in Canada. FINDING: The examinations of the data dated from March 18, 2020 to August 11, 2020 show that the STAR, NN, and SIR models may output different results, though the differences are small in some cases. Prediction over a short term period incurs smaller prediction variability than over a long term period, as expected. The NN method tends to outperform other two methods. All the methods forecast an upward trend in all the four Canadian provinces for the period of August 12, 2020 to August 23, 2020, though the degree varies from method to method. This research offers model-based insights into the pandemic evolvement in Canada.","Chen, Li-Pang; Zhang, Qihuang; Yi, Grace Y; He, Wenqing",PLoS One,,132
208343,"Spatiotemporal evolution of case fatality rates of COVID-19 in Brazil, 2020",2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China in December 2019 which was later declared to be a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO). This virus proved to be very contagious resulting in life-threatening respiratory intricacies posing overall public health and governance challenges. Amid the coronavirus pandemic and the unprecedented increase in healthcare demands, only inventive and adaptive practice among healthcare professionals is the need of the hour. Pharmacy services are an important mainstay in the public health and have considerable potential to combat the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Pharmacists working in several localities and health facilities are linked to patients either directly or indirectly. They can act swiftly in public health response such as drafting professional service guidance to pharmacists working in various healthcare facilities, ensuring effective medicine supply system, monitoring and resolving drug shortage issues, establishing and promoting remote pharmacy services, counseling the public on infection prevention basics, educating about proper use of personal protective equipment, discouraging self-medication, participating in clinical trials, small-scale manufacturing of sanitizers and disinfectants, busting the prevailing myths, and conducting drug evaluation and active surveillance. These interventions will help ease unprecedented burden on healthcare facilities during the ongoing pandemic and eventually will add value to patients and the healthcare system. The current manuscript accentuates the potential roles and activities that pharmacists can initiate in various healthcare facilities to help in relieving pressure on the overwhelmed healthcare system. The information and suggestions offered in this review could help in the restructuring of existing pharmacy services by governments, public health bodies, and policy makers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, this manuscript will underscore any unrealized potential among pharmacists working in various sectors including community, hospital, industry, and drug regulatory authorities.","Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Liaqat, Aroosa; Abid, Arooj; Khan, Yusra Habib; Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Alzarea, Abdulaziz Ibrahim; Tanveer, Nida; Khan, Tahir Mehmood",Front Public Health,,132

The existing evidence for hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir comes from clinical trials reporting favorable results for the first two drugs, while no benefit was observed when lopinavir/ritonavir was added to standard treatment. However, due to methodological issues, the evidence for hydroxychloroquine is very low. For favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir the evidence is low. Regarding the use of arbidol interferon, or the combined use of these with lopinavir/ritonavir, the evidence is limited since it derives from case series or case report with non-determining results.

These 97 isolated patients were then divided into three groups according to age: group A (up to 35 years old), group B (36-60 years), and group C (over 60 years). One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the scores among groups. The Q-test was used for pairwise comparison.P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.There was a negative correlation between age and SAS score in isolated Covid-19 patients, and the differences in the score among groups were statistically significant. Patients under 35 years old were more prone to anxiety when they were isolated for seven days. Isolated patients aged up to 35 years old need more attention from quarantine medical staff, communication should be strengthened, and psychological intervention from psychotherapists should be given if necessary.","Sun, Peng; Fan, Duo-Jiao; Li, Heng-Zhou; He, Tao; Zhang, Xiao-Kun; Wang, Guang; Chen, Wan-Li; Liu, Li-Min",Psychol Health Med,,132

Emerging epidemiological studies brought the attentions towards liver injury and impairment as a potential outcome of COVID19. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are the main cell entry receptors of SARS-CoV-2. We have tested the ability of medications to regulate expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors. Understanding that may reflect how such medications may affect the level of infectivity and permissibility of the liver following COVID-19. Using transcriptomic datasets, Toxicogenomic Project-Genomics Assisted Toxicity Evaluation System (Open TG-GATEs) and GSE30351, we have tested the ability of ninety common medications to regulate COVID-19 receptors expression in human primary hepatocytes. Most medications displayed a dose-dependent change in expression of receptors which could hint at a potentially more pronounced change with chronic use. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased noticeably with a number of medications such as metformin. Within the analgesics, acetaminophen revealed a dose-dependent reduction in expression of ACE2, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had mixed effect on receptors expression. To confirm the observed effects on primary human hepatocytes, rat hepatocyte treatments data was obtained from DrugMatrix toxicogenomic database (GSE57805), which showed a similar ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression pattern. Treatment of common co-morbidities often require chronic use of multiple medications, which may result in an additive increase in the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. More research is needed to determine the effect of different medications on COVID-19 receptors.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Narjes; Saheb Sharif-Askari, Fatemeh; Mdkhana, Bushra; Al Heialy, Saba; Ratemi, Elaref; Alghamdi, Malak; Abusnana, Salah; Kashour, Tarek; Hamid, Qutayba; Halwani, Rabih",Arch Toxicol,,132

213362,Proteinase release from activated neutrophils in mechanically ventilated patients with non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"Background: At present, the epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has quickly engulfed the world. Inflammatory cytokines are associated with the severity and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. However, the prognostic value of pro-inflammatory factors in cancer patients with COVID-19 are unknown. Methods: A multi-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study, based on five designated tertiary hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. 112 cancer patients with COVID-19, and 105 COVID-19 patients without cancer were enrolled in the study between January 1st, 2020 and April 30th, 2020. The risk assessment of pro-inflammatory factors for disease severity and clinical adverse outcomes was identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of the 112 cancer patients with COVID-19, 40 (35.7%) patients were in critical condition and 18 (16.1%) patients died unfortunately. Univariate and multivariate analysis demonstrated that hemoglobin level and pro-inflammatory neutrophils and C-reactive protein (CRP), can be used as independent factors affecting the severity of COVID-19; Meanwhile, pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP can be used as an independent influencing factor for adverse clinical outcome of death. Moreover, the dynamic changes of neutrophils and CRP were also presented, and compared with COVID-19 patients without cancer, cancer patients with COVID-19 showed higher neutrophil counts and CRP levels. Conclusion: In cancer patients with COVID-19, the significant increase in pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP indicated a more critical illness and adverse clinical outcome, and pro-inflammatory neutrophils and CRP played a greater adverse role compare with COVID-19 patients without cancer, which may be the cause of critical illness and adverse clinical outcomes of cancer patients with COVID-19.","Zhang, Bo; Yu, Yuanhang; Hubert, Shawna M; Zhang, Yue; Lu, Jianhua; Liu, Shihua; Xie, Fang; Zhao, Liang; Lei, Xiao; Deng, Wei; Chen, Jianying; Li, Yunqiao",Front Pharmacol,,132
213363,Proteinase release from activated neutrophils in mechanically ventilated patients with non-COVID-19 and COVID-19 pneumonia,2021,"There is an under-recognized role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in co-ordinating the entry and pathophysiology of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that underpins the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise in pro-inflammatory cytokines during the ‘cytokine storm’ induce indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), leading to an increase in kynurenine that activates the AhR, thereby heightening the initial pro-inflammatory cytokine phase and suppressing the endogenous anti-viral response. Such AhR-driven changes underpin the heightened severity and fatality associated with pre-existent high-risk medical conditions, such as type II diabetes, as well as to how racial discrimination stress contributes to the raised severity/fatality in people from the Black Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) communities. The AhR is pivotal in modulating mitochondrial metabolism and co-ordinating specialized, pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), the melatonergic pathways, acetyl-coenzyme A, and the cyclooxygenase (COX) 2-prostaglandin (PG) E2 pathway that underpin ‘exhaustion’ in the endogenous anti-viral cells, paralleling similar metabolic suppression in cytolytic immune cells that is evident across all cancers. The pro-inflammatory cytokine induced gut permeability/dysbiosis and suppression of pineal melatonin are aspects of the wider pathophysiological underpinnings regulated by the AhR. This has a number of prophylactic and treatment implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancers and future research directions that better investigate the biological underpinnings of social processes and how these may drive health disparities.","Anderson, George; Carbone, Annalucia; Mazzoccoli, Gianluigi",Biology,,132

These structures are deep and respond quickly, making them difficult to study during ongoing speech. Recent techniques begin to address this problem, but yield temporally broad responses with consequently ambiguous neural origins. Here we describe a method that pairs re-synthesized 'peaky' speech with deconvolution analysis of EEG recordings. We show that in adults with normal hearing, the method quickly yields robust responses whose component waves reflect activity from distinct subcortical structures spanning auditory nerve to rostral brainstem. We further demonstrate the versatility of peaky speech by simultaneously measuring bilateral and ear-specific responses across different frequency bands, and discuss important practical considerations such as talker choice. The peaky speech method holds promise as a tool for investigating speech encoding and processing, and for clinical applications.","Polonenko, Melissa J; Maddox, Ross K",eLife (Cambridge),,132
214179,An evaluation of patients with a previous endemic coronavirus infection during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted clinical practice and all aspects of medical education. Yet the need to continue to train physicians to care for patients and communities is greater than ever. Medical educators are responding by adapting curricula in response to requirements for social distancing, changing availability of clinical learning opportunities, and limitations on testing center availability for examinations. These disruptions require a systems approach to ensure that learners achieve competence in preparation for advancement in training toward unsupervised practice. In this article, the authors assert that medical educators, obligated by current conditions to adapt educational experiences, should seize the opportunity presented by the pandemic to make needed changes in 3 areas aligned with competency-based medical education: focusing on outcomes, broadening the assessment toolbox, and improving the undergraduate medical education (UME) to graduate medical education (GME) transition. Defined outcomes, as exemplified by entrustable professional activities, will enable curricular designers to shorten and adapt learning experiences by focusing on students' achievement of prespecified learning outcomes. Broadening the assessment toolbox entails capturing more and different assessment information about learners to provide a well-rounded view of their strengths and areas for growth in both traditional and novel settings, such as telehealth. Limitations on available data, such as licensing examination scores and clerkship grades, heighten the urgency to revise the system for the UME to GME transition by enhancing the quality and usability of information available to residency program directors. Educators should capitalize on the opportunity presented by altered conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic to make these needed changes to the educational system, in order to prepare physicians to provide health care and lead the health care system into the future.","Hauer, Karen E; Lockspeiser, Tai M; Chen, H Carrie",Acad. med,,132
215155,A multifactorial score including autophagy for prognosis and care of COVID-19 patients,2020,"As COVID-19 has been spreading across the world since early 2020, a growing number of malicious campaigns are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic. Cryptocurrency has attracted great attentions from attackers in this pandemic, namely, COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams are increasingly popular during the pandemic. However, these newly emerging scams are poorly understood by our community. In this paper, we present the first measurement study of COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams. We first create a comprehensive taxonomy of COVID-19 scams by manually analyzing the existing scams reported by users from online resources. Then, we propose a hybrid approach to perform the investigation by: 1) collecting reported scams in the wild; and 2) detecting undisclosed ones based on information collected from suspicious entities (e.g., domains, tweets, etc). We have collected 195 confirmed COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams in total, including 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmail scams, 14 crypto malware scams, 9 Ponzi scheme scams, and 53 donation scams.

216185,Men more vulnerable to COVID-19: explained by ACE2 on the X chromosome?,2020,"Aim: As individuals adjust to new 'norms' and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. Methods: This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The cross-sectional study data was collected using an online survey following the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), with some other basic information collected. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the influence of socio-demographic and media specific factors on anxiety and depression. Results: The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores. Conclusion: This study indicated that higher media consumption was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Worldwide it should be acknowledged that excessive media consumption, particularly social media relating to COVID-19, can have an effect on mental health. However, as this was a cross-sectional study we cannot infer any directionality as we cannot infer cause and effect; therefore, future research involving longitudinal data collection and analyses of variables over time is warranted.","Neill, Ruth D; Blair, Carolyn; Best, Paul; McGlinchey, Emily; Armour, Cherie",Z Gesundh Wiss,,132
216878,Successful heart transplantation in a patient who recovered from COVID-19,2021,"Balconies, windows and terraces have come to be identified as spaces with newfound meaning over the past year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and concomitant lockdowns. There was not only a marked increase in the use of these spaces, but more importantly a difference in the very nature of this use since March 2020. It is keeping this latter point in mind, that I make an attempt to understand the spatial mobilities afforded by the balcony in the area of ethnographic research. The street overlooking my balcony, situated amidst an urban village in the city of Delhi ? one of my field sites, is composed of middle and lower-middle class residents, dairy farms and farmers, bovines and other nonhumans. In this note, through ethnographic observations, I reflect upon the balcony as constituting that liminal space between ?field? and ?home?, as well as, as a spatial framing device which conditions and affects our observations and interactions. This is explored by examining two elements ? the gendered nature of the space, and the notion of ?distance and proximity?, through personal narratives of engaging-with the field, and subjects-objects of study in the city.","Ragavan, Shruti",cultural geographies,,132

Previous studies described the clinical characteristics of COVID-19, but knowledge gaps remain in the Middle East region. Identifying these features will help in mapping the disease and guiding pandemic management. A multi-center, retrospective cross-sectional study was initiated to describe the demographic data, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of COVID-19 cases across all the regions of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: The analysis included all laboratory-confirmed positive COVID-19 patients from the 1st of March 2020 to 31st of March 2020 across all regions of Saudi Arabia. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, incubation periods, laboratory findings, and patient outcomes data were retrieved from 1519 cases in the Health Electronic Surveillance Network Database. RESULTS: The median age was 36 years and 54.3% (n = 825) of the patients were men. Patients working in health care facilities represented 12.5% of the cases (n = 190) and 9.3% of cases were asymptomatic. The median incubation period was 6 days. The most common symptoms were cough (89.4%), fever (85.6%), and sore throat (81.6%); 20.1% of the patients had underlying comorbidities. Hypertension was seen in 8.8% and diabetes in 7.6% of all the cases. The percentage of cases with temperatures >38Ö¯C was 20.3% (n = 129), and 1.6% of patients had heart rates &#8805;125 beats/min and 4.7% of them had respiratory rates of >24 breaths/min. Lymphocytopenia occurred in 37.5% of cases. Overall, 71.6% of patients were admitted to hospitals and 4.7% required ICU treatment. We could not completely assess the clinical courses or final outcomes of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: In this multi-center retrospective study, fever and cough were common symptoms. Special attention should be addressed toward asymptomatic carriers and workers in health care facilities as they play a key role in disease transmission.","Alsofayan, Yousef M; Althunayyan, Saqer M; Khan, Anas A; Hakawi, Ahmed M; Assiri, Abdullah M",J. infect. public health,,132

METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing TCZ versus placebo/control, for treatment of adults with COVID-19. Primary outcome was 28-30 days all-cause mortality. Search was conducted up to April 1st 2021. Two independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were pooled. We performed subgroup analysis for patients with critical illness and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included, assessing 6,481 patients with mostly severe non-critical COVID-19 infection. TCZ was associated with a reduction in all-cause 28-30-day mortality compared to placebo/control (RR = 0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.96). Among the subgroup of critically ill patients no reduced mortality was demonstrated (RR = 0.94, 95%CI 0.74-1.19). No mortality benefit with TCZ was demonstrated in trials that used steroids for >80% of patients. TCZ was associated with significantly reduced risk for mechanical ventilation (MV); for combined endpoint of death or MV; and for intensive care unit (ICU) admission. No significant difference in adverse events was demonstrated. Risk of serious superinfection was significantly lower with TCZ (RR = 0.57, 95%CI 0.35-0.93). CONCLUSION: The treatment with TCZ reduces 28-30 days all-cause mortality, ICU admission, superinfections, MV and the combined endpoint of death or MV. Among critically ill patients, and when steroids were used for most patients, no mortality benefit was demonstrated. Additional research should further define sub-groups that would benefit most and preferred timing of administration of TCZ in severe COVID-19.","Avni, Tomer; Leibovici, Leonard; Cohen, Ido; Atamna, Alaa; Guz, Dmitri; Paul, Mical; Gafter-Gvili, Anat; Yahav, Dafna",QJM,,132
220145,Invasive Fungal Sinusitis in Post COVID-19 Patients: A New Clinical Entity,2021,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare services, faced with the twin challenges in acutely meeting the medical needs of patients with COVID-19 while continuing essential services for non-COVID-19 illnesses. The need to re-invent, re-organize and transform healthcare and co-ordinate clinical services at a population level is urgent as countries that controlled initial outbreaks start to experience resurgences. A wide range of digital health solutions have been proposed, although the extent of successful real-world applications of these technologies is unclear. This study aims to review applications of artificial intelligence (AI), telehealth, and other relevant digital health solutions for public health responses in the healthcare operating environment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic scoping review was performed to identify potentially relevant reports. Key findings include a large body of evidence for various clinical and operational applications of telehealth (40.1%, n = 99/247). Although a large quantity of reports investigated applications of artificial intelligence (AI) (44.9%, n = 111/247) and big data analytics (36.0%, n = 89/247), weaknesses in study design limit generalizability and translation, highlighting the need for more pragmatic real-world investigations. There were also few descriptions of applications for the internet of things (IoT) (2.0%, n = 5/247), digital platforms for communication (DC) (10.9%, 27/247), digital solutions for data management (DM) (1.6%, n = 4/247), and digital structural screening (DS) (8.9%, n = 22/247); representing gaps and opportunities for digital public health. Finally, the performance of digital health technology for operational applications related to population surveillance and points of entry have not been adequately evaluated.","Gunasekeran, Dinesh Visva; Tseng, Rachel Marjorie Wei Wen; Tham, Yih-Chung; Wong, Tien Yin",NPJ Digit Med,,132

221304,Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19,2020,"Lead halide perovskite has in recent years gained widespread interest due to its excellent physical and chemical properties, as well as superior optoelectronic performance. However, some restrictions still preclude full industrialization of the material, in particular toxicity issues and instability as a result to sensitivity to humidity. Lead-free all-inorganic double perovskite materials have thus recently become a focus of research. Herein, a new narrow bandgap lead-free double perovskite solar cell with a high-quality Cs2PtI6 film is proposed. It exhibits an optical bandgap of 1.37 eV, absorption within a wide range of wavelengths, and a high absorption coefficient. Following optimization, the device displays a best power conversion efficiency of 0.72% with an open-circuit voltage of 0.73 V, a short-circuit current of 1.2 mA/cm2, and a fill factor of 0.82. Crucially, it also demonstrates excellent stability when exposed to extreme conditions such as high humidity, high temperature, and UV-light irradiation. Stability tests show that the PSCs can retain almost 80% of the original efficiency over 60 days stored in ambient temperature without any encapsulation, boosting prospects for applications of lead-free perovskite solar cells.","Yang, Shuzhang; Wang, Liang; Zhao, Shuai; Liu, Anmin; Zhou, Yi; Han, Qianji; Yu, Fengyang; Gao, Liguo; Zhang, Chu; Ma, Tingli",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,132
221959,Why continued lipoprotein apheresis is vital for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia patients with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Ramifications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the re-structuring of healthcare are widespread, including delivery of surgical services across all specialties, including plastic surgery. Re-deployment of personnel and cessation of elective services are commonplace. However, there is a continued need for both emergency and oncological surgery. A national review of practice was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, to assess impact on services, staffing and training. METHODS: Key aspects of current plastic surgery practice in the United Kingdom were examined in this cross-sectional study; operating capacity, location of theatre lists (national health service or outsourced private institutions (PIs)), differences across sub-specialties, change in anaesthesia practices, staffing, re-deployment, on-call provision and impact on training. RESULTS: Three-hundred and forty-four plastic surgeons in the United Kingdom provided practice data across 51 units. Theatre capacity and outpatient services were markedly reduced. Outsourcing of operating lists to PIs was widely utilised. Increased use of local anaesthetic hand procedures, the prioritisation of shorter operations with reduced microsurgery in both head and neck/lower limb and almost complete cessation of breast reconstruction were noted, together with marked regional variations. Re-deployment occurred at all staffing levels, whilst telemedicine played a critical role in both patient management and training. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has enforced unprecedented changes to surgical care delivery and training, as identified by examination of plastic surgery nationally in the United Kingdom. Novel means to support continued elective and emergency services, including oncology have been identified. Lessons learned will allow phased return of services and improved preparation for the future.","Johal, Kavan S; Vinnicombe, Zak; Khan, Umraz; Mohanna, Pari-Naz",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,132

223477,The Comparison of Lopinavir/Ritonavir Combination and Favipiravir In COVID-19 Treatment,2021,"Introduction Le calcul de la taille d’étude pour le développement d’un modèle de prédiction clinique utilise encore souvent la règle empirique proposée par Peduzzi en 1996 qui recommande l’inclusion de 10 événements à prédire par paramètre envisagé dans le modèle de prédiction. Une nouvelle approche a été proposée par Riley et al. en 2020 pour répondre aux enjeux majeurs du développement d’un modèle de prédiction : précision des estimations et contrôle de l’optimisme sur les performances de prédiction. Nous rapportons ici l’application de cette approche pour le développement d’un modèle de prédiction combinant des facteurs cliniques, biologiques et d’imagerie pour prédire la survenue d’une aggravation d’une forme légère de COVID-19 chez des patients ayant des résultats d’imagerie thoracique compatibles ou typiques de la COVID-19. Méthodes La stratégie de modélisation envisagée était un modèle de régression logistique avec une sélection a priori de facteurs identifiés dans la littérature. Comme dans la règle empirique, la nouvelle approche nécessite de préciser l’incidence de l’événement à prédire et le nombre de paramètres envisagés dans le modèle de prédiction. La taille d’étude déterminée par cette approche doit satisfaire quatre critères : précision souhaitée pour l’incidence de l’événement ;précision souhaitée pour les prédictions individuelles (sous la forme d’un pourcentage d’erreur absolu moyen) ;niveau maximal souhaité de sur-ajustement aux données (facteur de réduction minimal) et d’optimisme (surestimation maximale du R2 de Nagelkerke). Pour les deux derniers critères, le calcul requiert de préciser le R2 de Cox–Snell qui, en l’absence d’éléments probants dans la littérature, peut être déterminé en faisant une hypothèse sur le niveau de performance attendu du modèle de prédiction en termes de pourcentage de la variation totale observée dans les données expliqué par le modèle. Résultats L’incidence de l’évènement à prédire a été fixée à 20 % selon les données de la littérature. Une revue de la littérature sur les modèles de prédiction développés dans le contexte d’infection à COVID-19 nous a conduits à envisager 16 paramètres dans le modèle. Nous avons suivi les recommandations des auteurs pour définir la précision souhaitée pour l’incidence d’événement (±0,05), le pourcentage d’erreur absolu moyen (5 %), le facteur de réduction minimal (3 0,9) et la surestimation maximale du critère de performance (£ 0,05). Nous avons fait varier le pourcentage de la variation totale observée dans les données expliqué par le modèle entre 10 et 50 %. Pour satisfaire l’ensemble des critères, la taille d’étude requise variait entre 587 et 2205 patients. Nous avons retenu l’hypothèse d’un pourcentage de variance expliqué de 25 % conduisant à l’inclusion de 829 patients pour le développement du modèle. Conclusion La nouvelle approche de calcul de taille d’étude permet de considérer dès la conception, des éléments majeurs qui favorisent le développement d’un modèle de prédiction clinique de qualité, en particulier la précision des probabilités individuelles de survenue de l’événement et le contrôle de l’optimisme. En contrepartie, elle nécessite une expertise statistique plus poussée que pour la règle empirique. Néanmoins, son application est possible même dans un délai court et devrait donc être systématiquement envisagée dans les études de développement d’un modèle de prédiction clinique.","Asselineau, J.; Duperron, M.; Zysman, M.; Laurent, F.; Ben-Lala, I.; Berger, P.; Thiébaut, R.; Frison, E.",Revue d&#039;Épidémiologie et de Santé Publique,,132

State workers and researchers organized an informal learning collaborative primarily through teleconference meetings with representatives of 11 health service vendors to support implementation. This study presents qualitative analysis of the teleconference meeting discussions that guided RCPSI implementation to display how the informal learning collaborative functioned to support implementation. This informal learning collaborative model can be applied in similar situations where there is limited guidance available for a practice being implemented by multidisciplinary teams. Authors conducted a thematic analysis of data from 32 stakeholder teleconference meetings held between February 2018 and April 2020. The analysis explored the function of these collaborative teleconferences for stakeholders. Major themes representing functions of the meetings for stakeholders include: social networking; executing the implementation plan; identifying and addressing barriers and facilitators; educating on peer recovery services and target population; and working through data collection. During the last 2 months of meetings, stakeholders discussed how the COVID-19 pandemic created multiple barriers but increased use of telehealth for recovery services. Teleconference meetings served as the main component of an informal learning collaborative for the RCPSI through which the vendor representatives could speak with each other and with organizers as they implemented the use of PRCs in EDs.","Staton, Monte D; Watson, Dennis P; Thorpe, Dillon",Translational behavioral medicine (Internet),,132

225251,Longitudinal birth cohort study finds that life-course frailty associates with later-life heart size and function,2021,"Data sources This review article scrutinised 16 clinical studies (clinical trials and observational studies) concerning coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Additionally, 18 guidelines about the COVID-19 were reviewed and the key points were represented in this study.Study selection The review included human trials, in-vitro studies, review articles, and credible news reports about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and COVID-19 complications, treatment guidelines, management strategies, and epidemiological features. There were no exclusion criteria reported in this review and the included information was in English and Chinese languages.Data extraction and synthesis A descriptive review of the literature was conducted, taking a comprehensive approach. The paper consisted of three main parts: introduction, presentation, and management. The introduction part presented basic information about the SARS-CoV-2, its evolution and transmission, and the course of disease. The presentation section introduced the signs and symptoms, diagnosis, high risk groups, and complications of COVID-19. Eventually, some evidence was presented about the prevention, medical management, and measuring responses to the treatments in the management section.Results Based on the results of this study, non-pharmaceutical interventions, including strict social isolation and distancing measures, might reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 by nearly 99.3 percent (reproduction number mitigating from 406 to 2.5 in 30 days). In the supportive management section, monitoring vital signs and neonatal feeding were stated as the most important factors to consider. For symptomatic neonates, medical management and intervention were mentioned as essential. It was claimed that for adults with mild infection, the best option would be home quarantine with further medical monitoring or hospitalisation if required. The following sequence was also suggested as early supportive therapy and monitoring: intravenous fluid administration, oxygen therapy, and application of corticosteroids. Management of critical patients with critical COVID-19 included admission to intensive care unit, use of continuous positive airway pressure and bi-level positive airway pressure in certain circumstances, endotracheal intubation, invasive mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and fluid resuscitation and vasopressors. Additionally, this study suggested oseltamivir, iopinavir, remdesivir, chloroquine, baricitinib, ruxolitinib, and fedratinib as possible drugs to help manage COVID-19. A soaring c-reactive protein level and decreased albumin content in the blood were reported to be associated with a deteriorating status in COVID-19 patients. To keep the number of exposures to a minimum, two separate viral clearance tests taken at least 24 hours apart, were stated as necessary laboratory results before the discharge of patients with COVID-19.Conclusions The study warns about possible exponential spread of COVID-19 and proposes to adhering to tighter restrictions of social distancing. Besides the clinical guidelines presented within the study, it also encourages further up-to-date and evidence-based management guidelines for patients with COVID-19.","Shamsoddin, Erfan",Evid Based Dent,,132
225337,Caring for Pregnant Patients with COVID-19: Practical Tips Getting from Policy to Practice,2020,"The pandemic of COVID-19 forced K-12 schools worldwide to transfer their educational programs from in-person instruction to remote online teaching.

The objective of this case presentation is to highlight an important complication and to explore potential predisposing risk factors and possible underlying pathophysiology of this phenomenon. CASE PRESENTATION: We present two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by spontaneous pneumomediastinum, pneumopericardium, pneumothorax and subcutaneous emphysema without positive pressure ventilation. Both patients had multiple comorbidities, received a combination of antibiotics, steroids and supportive oxygen therapy, and underwent routine laboratory workup. Both patients then developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and ultimately required intubation and mechanical ventilation, which proved to be challenging to manage. CONCLUSIONS: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a serious complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, of which clinicians should be aware. Further studies are needed to determine risk factors and laboratory data predictive of development of spontaneous pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Hazariwala, Vikisha; Hadid, Hind; Kirsch, Denise; Big, Cecilia",J Cardiothorac Surg,,132
225904,Yield of screening for COVID-19 in asymptomatic patients before elective or emergency surgery using chest CT and RT-PCR (SCOUT),2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic constitutes an ongoing worldwide threat to human society and has caused massive impacts on global public health, the economy and the political landscape. The key to gaining control of the disease lies in understanding the genetics of SARS-CoV-2 and the disease spectrum that follows infection. This study leverages traditional and intelligent bibliometric methods to conduct a multi-dimensional analysis on 5,632 COVID-19 genetic research papers, revealing that 1) the key players include research institutions from the United States, China, Britain and Canada;2) research topics predominantly focus on virus infection mechanisms, virus testing, gene expression related to the immune reactions and patient clinical manifestation;3) studies originated from the comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to previous human coronaviruses, following which research directions diverge into the analysis of virus molecular structure and genetics, the human immune response, vaccine development and gene expression related to immune responses;and 4) genes that are frequently highlighted include ACE2, IL6, TMPRSS2, and TNF. Emerging genes to the COVID-19 consist of FURIN, CXCL10, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, and ISG15. This study demonstrates that our suite of novel bibliometric tools could help biomedical researchers follow this rapidly growing field and provide substantial evidence for policymakers' decision-making on science policy and public health administration.","Wu, M.; Zhang, Y.; Grosser, M.; Tipper, S.; Venter, D.; Lin, H.; Lu, J.",Frontiers in Research Metrics &amp; Analytics,,132
226052,Cutaneous eruption in COVID-19-infected patients in Thailand: An observational descriptive study,2021,"Pandemic control measures like lock-down, restrictions on restaurants and gatherings, social-distancing have shown to be effective in curtailing the spread of COVID-19. However, their sustained enforcement has negative economic effects. To craft strategies and policies that reduce the hardship on the people and the economy while being effective against the pandemic, authorities need to understand the disease dynamics at the right geo-spatial granularity. Considering factors like the hospitals' ability to handle the fluctuating demands, evaluating various reopening scenarios, and accurate forecasting of cases are vital to decision making. Towards this end, we present a flexible end-to-end solution that seamlessly integrates public health data with tertiary client data to accurately estimate the risk of reopening a community. At its core lies a state-of-the-art prediction model that auto-captures changing trends in transmission and mobility. Benchmarking against various published baselines confirm the superiority of our forecasting algorithm. Combined with the ability to extend to multiple client-specific requirements and perform deductive reasoning through counter-factual analysis, this solution provides actionable insights to multiple client domains ranging from government to educational institutions, hospitals, and commercial establishments.","Gopalakrishnan, Vishrawas; Navalekar, Sayali; Ding, Pan; Hooley, Ryan; Miller, Jacob; Srinivasan, Raman; Deshpande, Ajay; Liu, Xuan; Bianco, Simone; Kaufman, James H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.02094v1.pdf,132
226270,Underestimation of COVID-19 mortality during the pandemic,2021,"In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, reassessing intensive care unit (ICU) use by population should be a priority for hospitals planning for critical care resource allocation. In our study, we reviewed the impact of COVID-19 on a community hospital serving an urban region, comparing the sociodemographic distribution of ICU admissions before and during the pandemic. We executed a time-sensitive analysis to see if COVID-19 ICU admissions reflect the regional sociodemographic populations and ICU admission trends before the pandemic. Sociodemographic variables included sex, race, ethnicity, and age of adult patients (ages 18 years and older) admitted to the hospital's medical and cardiac ICUs, which were converted to COVID-19 ICUs. The time period selected was 18 months, which was then dichotomized into pre-COVID-19 admissions (December 1, 2018 to March 13, 2020) and COVID-19 ICU admissions (March 14 to May 31, 2020). Variables were compared using Fisher's exact tests and Wilcoxon tests when appropriate. During the 18-month period, 1,861 patients were admitted to the aforementioned ICUs. The mean age of the patients was 62.75 (SD 15.57), with the majority of these patients being male (52.23%), White (64.43%), and non-Hispanic/Latinx (95.75%). Differences were found in racial and ethnic distribution comparing pre-COVID-19 admissions to COVID-19 admissions. Compared with pre-COVID-19 ICU admissions, we found an increase in African American versus White admissions (P = .01) and an increase in Hispanic/Latinx versus non-Hispanic/Latinx admissions (P < .01), during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first 3 months of admissions to COVID-19 ICUs, the number of admissions among Hispanic/Latinx and African American patients increased while the number of admissions among non-Hispanic/Latinx and White patient decreased, compared with the pre-COVID-19 period. These findings support development of strategies to enhance allocation of resources to bolster novel, equitable strategies to mitigate the incidence of COVID-19 in urban populations.","Galiatsatos, Panagis; Page, Kathleen R; Chatterjee, Souvik; Maygers, Joyce; Sarker, Sauradeep; Jones, Vanya; Lugo, April; Tolson, Tina; Hill-Briggs, Felicia; Chen, Edward S; Golden, Sherita H",Health Secur,,132
227570,Inflammation and Vascular Injury as the Basis of COVID-19 Skin Changes: Preliminary Analysis of 23 Patients from the Literature [Letter],2021,"BACKGROUND: Mortality from the novel coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) continues to rise across the United States. Evidence is emerging that environmental factors may contribute to susceptibility to disease and mortality. Greenspace exposure promotes enhanced immunity and may protect against risk of mortality among those with COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to determine if high county level greenspace exposure is associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. METHODS: Greenspace exposure was characterized in 3049 counties across the conterminous United States using Leaf Area Index (LAI) deciles that were derived from satellite imagery via Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer from 2011 to 2015. COVID-19 mortality data were obtained from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. We used a generalized linear mixed model to evaluate the association between county level LAI and COVID-19 mortality rate in analyses adjusted for 2015-2019 county level average total county population, older population, race, overcrowding in home, Medicaid, education, and physical inactivity. RESULTS: A dose-response association was found between greenness and reduced risk of COVID-19 mortality. COVID-19 mortality was negatively associated with LAI deciles 8 [MRR = 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.93)], 9 [MRR = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.89)], and 10 [MRR = 0.59 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.69)]. Aside from LAI decile 5, no associations were found between the remaining LAI deciles and COVID-19 mortality. Increasing prevalence of counties with older age residents, low education attainment, Native Americans, Black Americans, and housing overcrowding were significantly associated with increased risk of COVID-19 mortality, whereas Medicaid prevalence was associated with a reduced risk. DISCUSSION: Counties with a higher amount of greenspace may be at a reduced risk of experiencing mortality due to COVID-19.","Russette, Helen; Graham, Jon; Holden, Zachary; Semmens, Erin O; Williams, Elizabeth; Landguth, Erin L",Environ Res,,132

228110,Transmission and risk factors of OF COVID-19,2020,"Background: Vaccinations against Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are intended to induce an immune response in the sense of protection against infection/disease. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (AIT) is also thought to induce a (different) immune response in the sense of tolerance to allergens. There is uncertainty among patients and physicians regarding the use of vaccination and AIT in temporal relation, which this position paper aims to clarify. The four vaccines currently approved in Germany for vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are described and possible immunological interactions with AIT are highlighted, as well as practical recommendations for action. Methods: Based on the current internationally published literature, this position paper provides specific recommendations for action regarding the use of AIT in temporal relation to a SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Results: The present recommendations for action relate to the following conditions for which AIT is used i) allergic rhinitis, ii) allergic bronchial asthma, iii) insect venom allergy, iiii) food allergy (peanut). Conclusions: If vaccination is imminent, initiation of subcutaneous (SCIT), sublingual (SLIT), or oral (OIT) AIT should be delayed until 1 week after the 2nd vaccination date. Thus, there should generally be an interval of approximately 1 week between SCIT and COVID-19 vaccination. For the continuation of an ongoing AIT, we recommend an interval of 1 week before and after vaccination for SCIT. For SLIT and OIT, we recommend taking them up to the day before vaccination and taking a break from SLIT and OIT for 2 – 7 days after vaccination.","Klimek, L.; Pfaar, O.; Hamelmann, E.; Kleine-Tebbe, J.; Taube, C.; Wagenmann, M.; Werfel, T.; Brehler, R.; Novak, N.; Mülleneisen, N.; Becker, S.; Worm, M.",Allergologie,,132

Human encroachment into wildlife habitats as a consequence of expanding urbanization, cropland area and intensive animal farming is hypothesized to favour the emergence of zoonotic diseases. Here we analyse comprehensive, high-resolution datasets on forest cover, cropland distribution, livestock density, human population, human settlements, bat species’ distribution and land-use changes in regions populated by Asian horseshoe bats (&gt;28.5 million km2)—the species that most commonly carry severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronaviruses. We identify areas at risk of SARS-related coronavirus outbreaks, showing that areas in China populated by horseshoe bats exhibit higher forest fragmentation and concentrations of livestock and humans than other countries. Our findings indicate that human–livestock–wildlife interactions in China may form hotspots with the potential to increase SARS-related coronavirus transmission from animals to humans. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Rulli, M.

229041,Chilblains and COVID-19: can recent epidemiological data shed light on the aetiological debate?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: There have been recent mounting concerns regarding multiple reports stating a significantly elevated relative-risk of COVID-19 mortality amongst the Black and Minority Ethnic (BAME) population. An urgent national enquiry investigating the possible reasons for this phenomenon has been issued in the UK. Inflammation is at the forefront of COVID-19 research as disease severity appears to correlate with pro-inflammatory cytokine dysregulation. This narrative review aims to shed light on the novel, pathophysiological role of inflammation in contributing towards the increased COVID-19 mortality risk amongst the BAME population. METHODS: Searches in PubMed, Medline, Scopus, medRxiv and Google Scholar were performed to identify articles published in English from inception to 18th June 2020. These databases were searched using keywords including: 'COVID-19' or 'Black and Minority Ethnic' or 'Inflammation'. A narrative review was synthesized using these included articles. RESULTS: We suggest a novel pathophysiological mechanism by which acute inflammation from COVID-19 may augment existing chronic inflammation, in order to potentiate a 'cytokine storm' and thus the more severe disease phenotype observed in the BAME population. Obesity, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, psychological stress, chronic infections and genetic predispositions are all relevant factors which may be contributing to elevated chronic systemic inflammation amongst the BAME population. CONCLUSION: Overall, this review provides early insights and directions for ongoing research regarding the pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain the severe COVID-19 disease phenotype observed amongst the BAME population. We suggest 'personalization' of chronic disease management, which can be used with other interventions, in order to tackle this.","Vepa, Abhinav; Bae, Joseph P; Ahmed, Faheem; Pareek, Manish; Khunti, Kamlesh",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,132

The plan was finalized in May 2020. The plan triages patients based on exclusion criteria (imminent mortality), prognosis and expected benefit of ventilation (using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), and change in prognosis over time. Decisions are made by committee in order to minimize moral distress among individual patient care providers.Due to international concerns about healthcare resource shortages during the Covid-19 pandemic, hospitals need allocation policies informed by the crisis standard of care, the hospital’s ethical duty to plan for an emergency, and federal civil rights laws Policy Implications: This type of policy can serve as a model for other institutions to develop crisis standards of care resource allocation policies, which are a necessary component of disaster planning.

229963,Intravenous ketamine is a risk factor for jaundice in Covid-19 patients,2021,"The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, can be deadly to people, causing COVID-19. The ease of its propagation, coupled with its high capacity for illness and death in infected individuals, makes it a hazard to the community. Chest X-rays are one of the most common but most difficult to interpret radiographic examination for early diagnosis of coronavirus-related infections. They carry a considerable amount of anatomical and physiological information, but it is sometimes difficult even for the expert radiologist to derive the related information they contain. Automatic classification using deep learning models can help in better assessing these infections swiftly. Deep CNN models, namely, MobileNet, ResNet50, and InceptionV3, were applied with different variations, including training the model from the start, fine-tuning along with adjusting learned weights of all layers, and fine-tuning with learned weights along with augmentation. Fine-tuning with augmentation produced the best results in pretrained models. Out of these, two best-performing models (MobileNet and InceptionV3) selected for ensemble learning produced accuracy and FScore of 95.18% and 90.34%, and 95.75% and 91.47%, respectively. The proposed hybrid ensemble model generated with the merger of these deep models produced a classification accuracy and FScore of 96.49% and 92.97%. For test dataset, which was separately kept, the model generated accuracy and FScore of 94.19% and 88.64%. Automatic classification using deep ensemble learning can help radiologists in the correct identification of coronavirus-related infections in chest X-rays. Consequently, this swift and computer-aided diagnosis can help in saving precious human lives and minimizing the social and economic impact on society.","Ahmad, Fareed; Farooq, Amjad; Ghani, Muhammad Usman",Comput Intell Neurosci,,132

Adults answered a version of the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) modified for COVID-19 (PSS-10-C), with Cronbach alpha equal to 0.86. In total, 406 individuals aged between 19 and 88 years (M = 43.9; SD = 12.4) agreed to participate in the survey: 61.8% were females, 90.6% had a university degree, 44.1% were health professionals, and 45.7% considered public health policies for preventing the spread of the disease inconsistent with scientific recommendations. PSS-10-C scores ranged from 0 to 36 (M = 16.5; SD = 7.3); 58 individuals (14.3%) scored for high perceived stress (cut-off point = 25). The inconsistency between policies and scientific evidence was significantly related to high perception of stress associated with COVID-19 (OR = 2.36; 95%CI: 1.32-4.20), after adjusting for gender. We concluded that the study group presented the prevalence of perceived stress associated with COVID-19 at high levels, arising from the inconsistent strategies developed by health authorities in view of scientific recommendations.

231886,Multi-modality imaging of inflammation and ischemia for assessment of myocardial injury in Covid-19,2020,"Background: The severity and outcome of COVID-19 cases has been associated with the percentage of circulating lymphocytes (LYM%), levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), procalcitonin (PCT), lactic acid (LA), and viral load (ORF1ab Ct). However, the predictive power of each of these indicators in disease classification and prognosis remains largely unclear. Methods: We retrospectively collected information on the above parameters in 142 patients with COVID-19, stratifying them by survival or disease severity. Findings: CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, and ORF1ab Ct were significantly altered between survivors and non-survivors. LYM%, CRP, and IL-6 were the most sensitive and reliable factors in distinguishing between survivors and non-survivors. These indicators were significantly different between critically ill and severe/moderate patients. Only LYM% levels were significantly different between severe and moderate types. Among all the investigated indicators, LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable in discriminating between critically ill, severe, and moderate types and between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusions: CRP, PCT, IL-6, LYM%, and ORF1ab Ct, but not LA, could predict prognosis and guide classification of COVID-19 patients. LYM% was the most sensitive and reliable predictor for disease typing and prognosis. We recommend that LYM% be further investigated in the management of COVID-19.

Using keywords as listed, Pubmed, Google Scholar and Cochrane databases were searched during a period extending from 1995 to 2019. A total of 782 abstracts were identified. A total of 50 papers were analysed, and of these, 29 satisfied criteria required for systematic review in accordance with an optimized PRISMA statement. Clinical outcome as reported was subject to analysis with respect to time of intervention, incidence and severity of oral mucositis, and pain amelioration, and a comprehensive combined univariate and multivariate statistical analysis of the methods employed was performed. Recommendations are made with respect to the timing of the intervention. Moreover, there is an extended discussion available on the treatment care rationale of photobiomodulation (PBM), and its adjunctive association with OM. In conclusion, early prophylactic application offers clear advantages in clinical management. The many studies and associated variables and covariables assessed here revealed a choice of delivery techniques, associated wavelengths and many further indices to consider with regard to the accomplishment of optical parameters. It is therefore our recommendation that clinicians use PBM as a therapy with a full and proper understanding and training in order to optimise the clinical effects achievable.","Cronshaw, Mark; Parker, Steven; Anagnostaki, Eugenia; Mylona, Valina; Lynch, Edward; Grootveld, Martin",,,132

232951,Will COVID-19 Vaccinations End Discrimination against COVID-19 Patients in China? New Evidence on Recovered COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Since the discovery in 1796 by Edward Jenner of vaccinia virus as a way to prevent and finally eradicate smallpox, the concept of using a virus to fight another virus has evolved into the current approaches of viral vectored genetic vaccines. In recent years, key improvements to the vaccinia virus leading to a safer version (Modified Vaccinia Ankara, MVA) and the discovery that some viruses can be used as carriers of heterologous genes encoding for pathological antigens of other infectious agents (the concept of 'viral vectors') has spurred a new wave of clinical research potentially providing for a solution for the long sought after vaccines against major diseases such as HIV, TB, RSV and Malaria, or emerging infectious diseases including those caused by filoviruses and coronaviruses. The unique ability of some of these viral vectors to stimulate the cellular arm of the immune response and, most importantly, T lymphocytes with cell killing activity, has also reawakened the interest toward developing therapeutic vaccines against chronic infectious diseases and cancer. To this end, existing vectors such as those based on Adenoviruses have been improved in immunogenicity and efficacy. Along the same line, new vectors that exploit viruses such as Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV), Measles Virus (MV), Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), have emerged. Furthermore, technological progress toward modifying their genome to render some of these vectors incompetent for replication has increased confidence toward their use in infant and elderly populations. Lastly, their production process being the same for every product has made viral vectored vaccines the technology of choice for rapid development of vaccines against emerging diseases and for 'personalised' cancer vaccines where there is an absolute need to reduce time to the patient from months to weeks or days. Here we review the recent developments in viral vector technologies, focusing on novel vectors based on primate derived Adenoviruses and Poxviruses, Rhabdoviruses, Paramixoviruses, Arenaviruses and Herpesviruses. We describe the rationale for, immunologic mechanisms involved in, and design of viral vectored gene vaccines under development and discuss the potential utility of these novel genetic vaccine approaches in eliciting protection against infectious diseases and cancer.","Sasso, Emanuele; D039,; Alise, Anna Morena; Zambrano, Nicola; Scarselli, Elisa; Folgori, Antonella; Nicosia, Alfredo",Semin Immunol,,132

233727,Remdesivir Use in COVID-19 Patients: Cutaneous Adverse Effect or Disease Manifestation?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Real-time PCR is recommended to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, PCR availability is restricted in most countries. Rapid diagnostic tests are considered acceptable alternatives, but data are lacking on their performance. We assessed the performance of four antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests and one antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community in Cameroon. METHODS: In this clinical, prospective, diagnostic accuracy study, we enrolled individuals aged at least 21 years who were either symptomatic and suspected of having COVID-19 or asymptomatic and presented for screening. We tested peripheral blood for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Innovita (Biological Technology; Beijing, China), Wondfo (Guangzhou Wondfo Biotech; Guangzhou, China), SD Biosensor (SD Biosensor; Gyeonggi-do, South Korea), and Runkun tests (Runkun Pharmaceutical; Hunan, China), and nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using the SD Biosensor test. Antigen rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Abbott PCR testing (Abbott; Abbott Park, IL, USA), and antibody rapid diagnostic tests were compared with Biomerieux immunoassays (Biomerieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France). We retrospectively tested two diagnostic algorithms that incorporated rapid diagnostic tests for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients using simulation modelling. FINDINGS: 1195 participants were enrolled in the study. 347 (29%) tested SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive, 223 (19%) rapid diagnostic test antigen-positive, and 478 (40%) rapid diagnostic test antibody-positive. Antigen-based rapid diagnostic test sensitivity was 80·0% (95% CI 71·0-88·0) in the first 7 days after symptom onset, but antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests had only 26·8% sensitivity (18·3-36·8). Antibody rapid diagnostic test sensitivity increased to 76·4% (70·1-82·0) 14 days after symptom onset. Among asymptomatic participants, the sensitivity of antigen-based and antibody-based rapid diagnostic tests were 37·0% (27·0-48·0) and 50·7% (42·2-59·1), respectively. Cohen's &#954; showed substantial agreement between Wondfo antibody rapid diagnostic test and gold-standard ELISA (&#954;=0·76; sensitivity 0·98) and between Biosensor and ELISA (&#954;=0·60; sensitivity 0·94). Innovita (&#954;=0·47; sensitivity 0·93) and Runkun (&#954;=0·43; sensitivity 0·76) showed moderate agreement. An antigen-based retrospective algorithm applied to symptomatic patients showed 94·0% sensitivity and 91·0% specificity in the first 7 days after symptom onset. For asymptomatic participants, the algorithm showed a sensitivity of 34% (95% CI 23·0-44·0) and a specificity of 92·0% (88·0-96·0). INTERPRETATION: Rapid diagnostic tests had good overall sensitivity for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infection. Rapid diagnostic tests could be incorporated into efficient testing algorithms as an alternative to PCR to decrease diagnostic delays and onward viral transmission.

233949,Predicting COVID-19 Severity with a Specific Nucleocapsid Antibody plus Disease Risk Factor Score,2021,"Mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 spread are used for guiding the design of mitigation steps aimed at containing and decelerating the contagion, and at identifying impending breaches of health care system surge capacity. The challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections are compounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. To address this problem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The setting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency of contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may change over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other communities where the infection is present. To account for these important aspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact between its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census and cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network, which can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation measures. In order to make the network SEIR model that we propose easy to customize, it is formulated in terms of easily interpretable parameters that can be estimated from available community level data. The models parameters are estimated with Bayesian techniques using COVID-19 data for the states of Ohio and Michigan. The network model also gives rise to a geographically distributed computational model that explains the geographic dynamics of the contagion, e.g., in larger cities surrounded by suburban and rural areas.","Calvetti, Daniela; Hoover, Alexander; Rose, Johnie; Somersalo, Erkki",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.06137v1.pdf,132

However, there is a paucity of data on the efficiency of different nucleic acid extraction platforms on pooled specimens.

A total of 60 pools of nasopharyngeal swab and 60 pools of posterior oropharyngeal saliva specimens, each consisting of 1 SARS-CoV-2 positive and 9 SARS-CoV-2 negative specimens, were included for the comparison. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/Hel gene was performed, and GAPDH RT-PCR was used to detect RT-PCR inhibitors. No significant differences were observed in the Ct values and overall RT-PCR positive rates between LRE and MBTE platforms (92.5% (111/120] vs. 90% (108/120]), but there was a slightly higher positive rate for LRE (88.3% (53/60]) than MBTE (81.7% (49/60]) among pooled saliva. The automated LRE method is comparable to a standard MBTE method for the detection of SAR-CoV-2 in pooled specimens, providing a suitable alternative automated extraction platform. Furthermore, LRE may be better suited for pooled saliva specimens due to more efficient removal of RT-PCR inhibitors.","Chu, A. W.; Yip, C. C.; Chan, W. M.; Ng, A. C.; Chan, D. L.; Siu, R.

In this article, we highlight lessons learned from previous efforts to scale up vaccine distribution and offer considerations for policymakers and key stakeholders to use for successful COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Africa. These considerations range from improving weak infrastructure for managing data and identifying adverse events after immunization to considering financing options for overcoming the logistical challenges of vaccination campaigns and generating demand for vaccine uptake.

233979,Lifestyle changes associated with COVID-19 quarantine among young Saudi women: A prospective study,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly caused a global pandemic associated with a novel respiratory infection: coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is necessary to facilitate SARS-CoV-2 infection, but-owing to its essential metabolic roles-it may be difficult to target it in therapies. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), which interacts with ACE2, may be a better candidate for targeted therapies. Using publicly available expression data, we show that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in many host tissues, including lung. The highest expression of ACE2 is found in the testes, whereas the prostate displays the highest expression of TMPRSS2. Given the increased severity of disease among older men with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we address the potential roles of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their contribution to the sex differences in severity of disease. We show that expression levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are overall comparable between men and women in multiple tissues, suggesting that differences in the expression levels of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in the lung and other non-sex-specific tissues may not explain the gender disparities in severity of SARS CoV-2. However, given their instrumental roles for SARS-CoV-2 infection and their pleiotropic expression, targeting the activity and expression levels of TMPRSS2 is a rational approach to treat COVID-19.","Baughn, Linda B; Sharma, Neeraj; Elhaik, Eran; Sekulic, Aleksandar; Bryce, Alan H; Fonseca, Rafael",Mayo Clin Proc,,132

New surveillance and control strategy was set up to detect emerging outbreaks. AIM: To detect and describe the evolution of COVID-19 clusters and cases during the 2020 summer in Spain. METHODS: A near-real time surveillance system to detect active clusters of COVID-19 was developed based on Kulldorf's prospective space-time scan statistic (STSS) to detect daily emerging active clusters. RESULTS: Analyses were performed daily during the summer 2020 (June 21st - August 31st) in Spain, showing an increase of active clusters and municipalities affected. Spread happened in the study period from a few, low-cases, regional-located clusters in June to a nationwide distribution of bigger clusters encompassing a higher average number of municipalities and total cases by end-August. CONCLUSION: STSS-based surveillance of COVID-19 can be of utility in a low-incidence scenario to help tackle emerging outbreaks that could potentially drive a widespread transmission. If that happens, spatial trends and disease distribution can be followed with this method. Finally, cluster aggregation in space and time, as observed in our results, could suggest the occurrence of community transmission.","Rosillo, Nicolás; Del-Águila-Mejía, Javier; Rojas-Benedicto, Ayelén; Guerrero-Vadillo, María; Peñuelas, Marina; Mazagatos, Clara; Segú-Tell, Jordi; Ramis, Rebeca; Gómez-Barroso, Diana",BMC Public Health,,132

A pescada-foguete Macrodon ancylodon pertence à família Sciaenidae é um peixe de alto consumo no Brasil. A qualidade do frescor do pescado é avaliada perante diferentes parâmetros: avaliações sensoriais, físico-químicas, microbiológicas, parasitológica e determinação de metais pesados, ou contaminantes inorgânicos. Para as avaliações foram coletados na CEAGESP 60 elementos amostrais para as avaliações sensoriais, microbiológicas, parasitológicas e de contaminantes inorgânicos (30 inverno / 30 verão). Para as avaliações físico-químicas foram coletados 33 elementos amostrais (15 inverno / 18 verão). Pela a avaliação sensorial as amostras do inverno e do verão tiveram resultados entre bom e moderado perante diferentes atributos avaliados. Pela avaliação físico-química os valores de BVT variaram de 7,410 a 39,240mg/100g; os valores de TMA variaram de 0,00 a 11,30mg/100g; os valores de TBA variaram de 0,250 a 1,070mgAM/100g; os valores de pH variaram de 6,890 a 7,200. Pela avaliação microbiológica a contagem de microrganismos mesófilos aeróbios estritos e facultativos viáveis variou de 9,0x103 a 8,5x105UFC/g; a contagem de microrganismos psicrotróficos aeróbios estritos e facultativos viáveis variou de 1,9x104 a >2,5x107UFC/g; a contagem de coliformes totais variou de 8,0x10 a 1,8x105UFC/g; a contagem de coliformes termotolerantes variou de <10 a 7,5x102 UFC/g; não houveram testes positivos na pesquisa de Salmonella spp. Pela avaliação parasitológica 30% dos elementos amostrais foram positivos para anisaquíase, sendo encontrados 17 elementos com Contracaecum spp. e um com Pseudoterranova spp. Pela determinação de contaminantes inorgânicos, os valores de As variaram de 0,011 a 1,700mg/Kg; os valores de Cd variaram de 0,003 a 0,031mg/Kg; os valores de Cr variaram de 0,00 a 0,124mg/Kg; os valores de Pb variaram de 0,007 a 0,458mg/Kg; os valores de Hg total variaram de 0,001 a 0,099mg/Kg. Houve diferença estatisticamente significativa a 5% entre os grupos do inverno e do verão para os seguintes parâmetros: aceitabilidade da aparência e do frescor e intenção de compra na avaliação sensorial; BVT na avaliação físico-química; microrganismos mesófilos, microrganismos psicrotróficos e coliformes totais na avaliação microbiológica; As, Cr e Hg total na determinação de contaminantes inorgânicos. Foi verificado que a análise sensorial e a microbiológica são bons avaliadores do estado de frescor. A análise de BVT e a contagem de coliformes termotolerantes são bons indicadores do frescor da pescada. Os valores de pH obtidos sugerem que para a pescada Macrodon ancylodon ocorra variação em uma escala superior a de outras espécies de pescado.

The current study systematically examined the emerging evidence to identify an association between body mass index (BMI) and COVID-19 disease outcome. Online literature databases (e.g., Google Scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Medrixv and BioRixv) were screened following standard search strategy having the appropriate keyword such as ""Obesity"", ""Underweight"", ""BMI"", ""Body Mass Index"", ""2019-nCov"", ""COVID-19, ""novel coronavirus"", ""coronavirus disease"". Studies published till 20th April 2020 were included without language restriction. These studies include case reports, case series, cohort, and any other which reported BMI, overweight/obesity or underweight, and its complication with COVID-19 disease. This study observed COVID-19 infection among BMI < 25 kg/m2 with prevalence of 0.60 (95%CI: 0.34-0.86, I2 = - 76.77) as compared to the 0.34 (95%CI: 0.23-0.44, I2 = 53.45% heterogeneity) having BMI > 25 kg/m2. The results of the current study show that BMI plays a significant role in COVID-19 severity in all age groups, especially the older individuals. A panel of doctors and nursing staff should review COVID-19 patients with higher BMI with other co-morbidities (diabetes and hypertension), and they should be given increased vigilance, priority in testing, and treatment to control the associated co-morbidities. Further, the COVID-19 patients whose illness entered 7-10 days, age > 50 years, and elevated CRP levels should be given additional medical considerations. Our finding showed that the population and patients with high BMI have moderate to high risk of medical complications with COVID-19, and hence, their health status should be monitored more frequently including monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose.","Malik, Vivek Singh; Ravindra, Khaiwal; Attri, Savita Verma; Bhadada, Sanjay Kumar; Singh, Meenu",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,,132

We aimed to describe the characteristics of patients transported by the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS) for confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and to investigate the surge capacity of and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. To determine the characteristics of patients transported for confirmed or suspected COVID-19, we included patient data from February 2, 2020, to May 6, 2020. To investigate the surge capacity and operational implications for the RFDS in dealing with COVID-19, we built and validated an interactive operations area-level discrete event simulation decision support model underpinned by RFDS air medical activity data from 2015 to 2019 (4 years). This model was subsequently used in a factorial in silico experiment to systematically investigate both the supply of RFDS air medical services and the increased rates of demand for these services for diseases of the respiratory system. Results: The RFDS conducted 291 patient episodes of care for confirmed or suspected COVID-19. This included 288 separate patients, including 136 men and 119 women (sex missingâ¯=â¯33), with a median age of 62.0 years (interquartile range, 43.5-74.9 years). The simulation decision support model we developed is capable of providing dynamic and real-time support for RFDS decision makers in understanding the system's performance under uncertain COVID-19 demand. With increased COVID-19-related demand, the ability of the RFDS to cope will be driven by the number of aircraft available. The simulation model provided each aviation section with estimated numbers of aircraft required to meet a range of anticipated demands. Conclusion: Despite the lack of certainty in the actual level of COVID-19-related demand for RFDS services, modeling demonstrates that the robustness of meeting such demand increases with the number of operational and medically staffed aircraft.","Gardiner, Fergus W; Johns, Hannah; Bishop, Lara; Churilov, Leonid",Air Med J,,132

However, their treatment options are currently unavailable. Current studies have shown that quercetin is both resistant to COVID-19 and DENGUE; this study aimed to evaluate the possible functional roles and underlying mechanisms of action of quercetin as a potential molecular candidate against COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. METHODS: We used a series of bioinformatics analyses to understand and characterize the biological functions, pharmacological targets and therapeutic mechanisms of quercetin in COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. RESULTS: We revealed the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and DENGUE, including pathological mechanisms, key inflammatory pathways and possible methods of intervention, 60 overlapping targets related to the co-infection and the drug were identified, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) was constructed and TNF&#945;, CCL-2 and CXCL8 could become potential drug targets. Furthermore, we disclosed the signaling pathways, biological functions and upstream pathway activity of quercetin in COVID-19 and DENGUE. The analysis indicated that quercetin could inhibit cytokines release, alleviate excessive immune responses and eliminate inflammation, through NF-&#954;B, IL-17 and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to reveal quercetin as a pharmacological drug for COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection. COVID-19 and DENGUE co-infection remain a potential threat to the world's public health system. Therefore, we need innovative thinking to provide admissible evidence for quercetin as a potential molecule drug for the treatment of COVID-19 and DENGUE, but the findings have not been verified in actual patients, so further clinical drug trials are needed.","Zheng, Wenjiang; Wu, Hui; Wang, Ting; Zhan, Shaofeng; Liu, Xiaohong",Brief. bioinform,,132

Non-urgent out-patient work was initially postponed or performed virtually, but is now being re-established. In ENT surgery, aerosol-generating procedures pose a particular challenge in out-patient settings. OBJECTIVE: A rapid restructuring of ENT out-patient services is required, to safely accommodate aerosol-generating procedures and increase in-person attendances, whilst coronavirus disease 2019 persists. METHODS: Data were collected prospectively over four consecutive cycles. Two surveys were conducted. Results were analysed and disseminated, with recommendations for service restructuring implemented at cycle end-points. RESULTS: Out-patient activity increased four-fold, associated with a significant rise in aerosol-generating procedures during the study period. Mean aerosol-generating procedure duration dropped weekly, implying a learning curve. Service restructuring occurred at cycle end-points. CONCLUSION: Iterative data gathering, results analysis and outcome dissemination enabled a swift, data-driven approach to the restructuring of ENT out-patient services.

This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement appropriateness. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Select cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources. The views expressed should help guide clinical practice, future innovation, and research.","Kesselman, Andrew; Oo, Thein Hlaing; Johnson, Matthew; Stecker, Michael S; Kaufman, John; Trost, David",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,132

Understanding communities' responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories. METHODS: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually. Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted. RESULTS: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71).

241826,ANMCO POSITION PAPER: The management of suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patients needing urgent electrophysiology and/or electrostimulation procedures,2020,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals from four different communities to estimate cumulative incidence of infection. Our results showed that 1,332 individuals (3.77%) showed positive COVID-19 antibody (either IgM or IgG). Males had a lower positivity rate than females (3.02% versus 4.52%). The antibody positivity rates showed a clear trend of increase according to patients' ages and varied among different communities. The results indicate that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.IMPORTANCE Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Afterwards, a number of public health interventions were implemented, including lock-down, face mask ordinances, and social distancing. Studies that rely on viral RNA testing of symptomatic patients have shown that these multifaceted interventions contributed to the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and delayed the epidemic's progression. However, these estimates of confirmed cases may miss large numbers of asymptomatic patients and recovered symptomatic patients who were not tested. To investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 in Wuhan, we conducted serologic tests on 35,326 individuals to estimate the cumulative incidence of infection. The results suggest that public health interventions may play important roles in the control of COVID-19.","Han, Huan; Yi, Junzhu; Cheng, Gongbo; Jiang, Wuhui; Brozek, Grzegorz M; Jiang, Yingan; Zhu, Chengliang; Xia, Yuchen",MSphere,,132

242076,Cholangiopathy After Severe COVID-19: Clinical Features and Prognostic Implications,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented global public health and economic crisis. The origin and emergence of its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, in the human population remains mysterious, although bat and pangolin were proposed to be the natural reservoirs. Strikingly, unlike the SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses (CoVs) identified in bats and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 harbors a polybasic furin cleavage site in its spike (S) glycoprotein. SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as its receptor to infect cells. Receptor recognition by the S protein is the major determinant of host range, tissue tropism, and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. In an effort to search for the potential intermediate or amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, we examined receptor activity of ACE2 from 14 mammal species and found that ACE2s from multiple species can support the infectious entry of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with the wild-type or furin cleavage site-deficient S protein of SARS-CoV-2. ACE2 of human/rhesus monkey and rat/mouse exhibited the highest and lowest receptor activities, respectively. Among the remaining species, ACE2s from rabbit and pangolin strongly bound to the S1 subunit of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and efficiently supported the pseudotyped virus infection. These findings have important implications for understanding potential natural reservoirs, zoonotic transmission, human-to-animal transmission, and use of animal models.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 uses human ACE2 as a primary receptor for host cell entry. Viral entry mediated by the interaction of ACE2 with spike protein largely determines host range and is the major constraint to interspecies transmission. We examined the receptor activity of 14 ACE2 orthologs and found that wild-type and mutant SARS-CoV-2 lacking the furin cleavage site in S protein could utilize ACE2 from a broad range of animal species to enter host cells. These results have important implications in the natural hosts, interspecies transmission, animal models, and molecular basis of receptor binding for SARS-CoV-2.","Zhao, Xuesen; Chen, Danying; Szabla, Robert; Zheng, Mei; Li, Guoli; Du, Pengcheng; Zheng, Shuangli; Li, Xinglin; Song, Chuan; Li, Rui; Guo, Ju-Tao; Junop, Murray; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",J. virol,,132

The Paradigm Shift in the COVID Era,2021,"Glioma is the most common and lethal type of primary brain tumor, with a high mortality and recurrence rate. Rab5, which serves as a classic ontogenetic gene, is highly expressed in various types of tumor, including lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer. However, the exact role and the underlying mechanism of Rab5 in glioma remain unknown. Herein, the role of Rab5 in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of glioma cells was investigated. The upregulation of Rab5 in glioma tissues and cells was observed. The expression of Rab5 was positively associated with proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. Moreover, Rab5 was involved in the cell cycle of glioma cells via the regulation of cyclin E. Data presented in the present study suggest Rab5 as a potential novel diagnostic and prognosis marker of glioma.","Jian, Zhao; Zhang, Lianglong; Jin, Liang; Lan, Weitu; Zhang, Wei; Gao, Guiyan",Oncol Lett,,132

Although young adults with multiple sclerosis (yawMS) might be at greater risk of developing psychological distress linked to the pandemic, they might also be able to adapt to stress and find meaning in adverse life events. The aim of the present study was to explore benefit finding in response to the pandemic in a sample of yawMS. As part of a larger project, data were collected using a cross-sectional, web-based survey. Benefit finding was analysed using a qualitative thematic approach;descriptive and inferential statistics were performed to describe the sample and compare sub-groups. Out of 247 respondents with mostly relapsing-remitting MS, 199 (31.9 +/- 6.97 years) reported at least one benefit. Qualitative analysis showed that during the pandemic yawMS found benefits related to three themes: personal growth, relational growth, and existential growth. No differences in benefit finding were found between age sub-groups (18-30 vs. 31-45). Participants reported a wide range of benefits, some of which seem to be specific to MS or the pandemic. Results have been transformed into tips to be introduced in clinical practice to promote resilience in yawMS through meaning making.","Poli, S.; Rimondini, M.; Gajofatto, A.; Mazzi, M. A.; Busch, I.

These patients had follow-up after an initial in-person evaluation. We designed this retrospective case series to describe the diagnostic categories seen through telehealth, management steps completed during video visits, and to understand whether additional in-person care was required within 90 days of video visits. In addition, we estimated time and cost savings for patients attributed to video visits. RESULTS: Most men seen during video visits had an endocrinologic (29%) or anatomic (21%) cause for their infertility. 73% of video visits involved reviewing results; 30% included counseling regarding assistive reproductive technologies; and 25% of video visits resulted in prescribing hormonally active medications. The two patients (3%) who were seen in clinic after their video visit underwent a varicocelectomy in the interim. No patients required an unplanned in-person visit. From a patient perspective, video visits were estimated to save a median of 97 minutes (IQR 64-250) of travel per visit. Median cost savings per patient- by avoiding travel and taking time off work for a clinic visit-were estimated to range from $149 (half day off) to $252 (full day off). CONCLUSIONS: Video visits for established male infertility patients were used to manage different causes of infertility while saving patients time and money. Telehealth for established patients did not trigger additional in-person evaluations.","Andino, Juan; Zhu, Alex; Chopra, Zoey; Daignault-Newton, Stephanie; Ellimoottil, Chad; Dupree, James M",Urology,,132

Recently, to obtain more informative medical images, multi-modality images have been used. These images have significantly more information as compared to traditional medical images. However, the construction of multi-modality images is not an easy task. The proposed approach, initially, decomposes the image into sub-bands using a non-subsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) domain. Thereafter, an extreme version of the Inception (Xception) is used for feature extraction of the source images. The multi-objective differential evolution is used to select the optimal features. Thereafter, the coefficient of determination and the energy loss based fusion functions are used to obtain the fused coefficients. Finally, the fused image is computed by applying the inverse NSCT. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the competitive multi-modality image fusion approaches.","Kaur, Manjit; Singh, Dilbag",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,132

The most common tests to identify COVID-19 are invasive, time consuming and limited in resources. Imaging is a non-invasive technique to identify if individuals have symptoms of disease in their lungs. However, the diagnosis by this method needs to be made by a specialist doctor, which limits the mass diagnosis of the population. Image processing tools to support diagnosis reduce the load by ruling out negative cases. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques such as Deep Learning have shown high effectiveness in identifying patterns such as those that can be found in diseased tissue. This study analyzes the effectiveness of a VGG16-based Deep Learning model for the identification of pneumonia and COVID-19 using torso radiographs.

253417,Anakinra for severe forms of COVID-19 - Authors' reply,2020,"Pandemic management is likely to represent a global reality for years to come, but the roadmap for how to approach pandemic restrictions is as yet unclear. Of the restrictions enacted during COVID-19, among the more controversial surround alcohol. Like many infectious diseases, the principal mode of transmission for COVID-19 is direct respiration of droplets emitted during close social contact, and health officials warn that alcohol consumption may lead to decreased adherence to physical distancing guidelines. Governing bodies have acted to close bars before restaurants and have also specifically restricted alcohol sales, while at the same time those in the nightlife industry have labeled such actions unfounded and discriminatory. Complicating such debates is the lack of evidence on alcohol's effects on physical distance. In the current study we employed a randomized alcohol-administration design paired with computer-vision measures, analyzing over 20,000 proximity readings derived from video to examine the effect of alcohol consumption on physical distance during social interaction. Results indicated that alcohol caused individuals to draw significantly closer to an unfamiliar interaction partner during social exchange, reducing physical proximity at a rate with potentially important implications for public health. In contrast, alcohol had no effect on physical distance with a familiar interaction partner. Findings suggest that alcohol might act to overcome a natural caution people feel towards strangers and thus promote virus transmission between previously unconnected social groups.","Gurrieri, Laura; Fairbairn, Catharine E; Sayette, Michael A; Bosch, Nigel",Proc.

There is a need to understand the impact on different health care professionals in different countries. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological impact of the pandemic among dental staff in Norway in relation to background characteristics, work situation and preparedness of the service. METHODS: A structured questionnaire sent electronically to dentists, dental hygienists and dental assistants inquired information about the lockdown period in Norway (13 March-17 April 2020). Distributions of background characteristics, perceptions of preparedness and psychological impact were calculated. Exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Structural Equation Models (SEMs) were used to compare psychological impact between dental professionals treating patients versus not during lockdown. RESULTS: Among the 1237 respondents, 58.8% worked clinically with patients. The majority were concerned of becoming infected (71.9%), of infecting others (85.4%) and/or of their family becoming infected (76.9%). Respondents who treated patients felt significantly more insecure about whether having become infected or not. The minority felt discriminated (6.7%), worried about death (11.7%), felt that life was threatening (9.8%) or felt loss of control of their lives (8.9%). More than 80% agreed that their workplace handled the situation well. Four factors were retrieved from the factor analysis. SEMs showed that gender and work experience had a significant effect on the factors Instability, Infection and Concerns. Respondents with work experience &#8805;10 years were less likely to express fear about Instability and Infection. Personnel reporting that their workplace had adequate equipment were also less concerned, however having adequate equipment did not reduce the factor Loss of control. CONCLUSION: The present study showed a considerable psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on dental personnel in Norway regardless of working clinically with patients or not. However, working with patients increased the insecurity about own infection status and of infecting people close to them. A safe working environment and adequate infection control measures are associated with less fear of infection and feeling of instability.","Uhlen, M M; Ansteinsson, V E; Stangvaltaite-Mouhat, L; Korzeniewska, L; Skudutyte-Rysstad, R; Shabestari, M; Mdala, I; Hovden, E A S",BMC Health Serv Res,,132

Complications such as pleural thickening, hydrothorax, pericardial effusion, and enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were detected but only in rare cases. For the follow-up chest CT examinations (91 cases), We found 66 (73%) cases changed very quickly, with an average of 3.5 days, 25 cases (27%) presented absorbed lesions, progression was observed in 41 cases (46%), 25 (27%) cases showed no significant changes. CONCLUSION: Chest CT plays an important role in diagnosing COVID-19. The imaging pattern of multifocal peripheral ground glass or mixed consolidation is highly suspicious of COVID-19, that can quickly change over a short period of time.","Li, Xiaoming; Zeng, Wenbing; Li, Xiang; Chen, Haonan; Shi, Linping; Li, Xinghui; Xiang, Hongnian; Cao, Yang; Chen, Hui; Liu, Chen; Wang, Jian",J Transl Med,,132

255207,Defogging Strategy for Protective Eye Goggles to Prevent Microorganism Transmission While Performing Neurosurgical Procedures,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Emerging evidence suggests young children are at greater risk of COVID-19 infection than initially predicted. However, a comprehensive understanding of epidemiology of COVID-19 infection in young children under five years, the most at-risk age-group for respiratory infections, remain unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection in children under five years. METHOD: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses , we searched several electronic databases (Pubmed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Scopus) with no language restriction for published epidemiological studies and case-reports reporting laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in children under five years until June 4, 2020. We assessed pooled prevalence for key demographics and clinical characteristics using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine random-effects model for studies except case-reports. We evaluated risk of bias separately for case-reports and other studies. RESULTS: We identified 1,964 articles, of which, 65 articles were eligible for systematic review that represented 1,214 children younger than five years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. The pooled estimates showed that 50% young COVID-19 cases were infants (95% CI: 36% - 63%, 27 studies); 53% were male (95% CI: 41% - 65%, 24 studies); 43% were asymptomatic (95% CI: 15% - 73%, 9 studies) and 7% (95% CI: 0% - 30%, 5 studies) had severe disease that required intensive-care-unit admission. Of 139 newborns from COVID-19 infected mothers, five (3.6%) were COVID-19 positive. There was only one death recorded. DISCUSSION: This systematic review reports the largest number of children younger than five years with COVID-19 infection till date. Our meta-analysis shows nearly half of young COVID-19 cases were asymptomatic and half were infants, highlighting the need for ongoing surveillance to better understand the epidemiology, clinical pattern, and transmission of COVID-19 to develop effective preventive strategies against COVID-19 disease in young paediatric population.","Bhuiyan, Mejbah Uddin; Stiboy, Eunice; Hassan, Md Zakiul; Chan, Mei; Islam, Md Saiful; Haider, Najmul; Jaffe, Adam; Homaira, Nusrat",Vaccine,,132
255212,The COVID-19 Arterial Thromboembolic Complications: From Inflammation to Immunothrombosis Through Antiphospholipid Autoantibodies,2020,"Sustainability certification schemes such as FAIRTRADE, FLO, WFTO and FT-USA have gained increasing markets. The significant growth of the fair trade (FT) movement in the last decades draws attention to ethical consumption. FT's aim at improving the livelihoods of producers in developing countries and promotion of social change is considered a model that shows the benefits of trade to development. Although conveying a large number of publications, not all questions about the movement are explored. The literature is prolific on coffee, cacao, flowers, wine, and gold. In contrast, the engagement with staple foods - a prominent globally traded food category - seems minor. The primary objective of this review was to map the existing literature about FT and staple foods; then, to investigate the role of staple foods in the FT movement. The search strategy was designed to retrieve publications on the intersection of FT and staple foods. To date, there is no review about FT and staple foods nexus. Our systematic review addressed this gap considering FT as an alternative capable of addressing unsustainable food consumption and production impacts. Our research protocol included keywords searching across four databases, screening, and comparative analysis. From 283 documents retrieved, 49 were deemed relevant to reflect the role of staple foods in the FT movement. This systematic review discusses challenges and opportunities for the FT model to further engage with staples and recommends improvement of its environmental credentials. The present study can contribute by informing decision makers, policy makers, businesses, NGOs, producers, and consumers.","Ribeiro-Duthie, Ana Cristina; Gale, Fred; Murphy-Gregory, Hannah",J Clean Prod,,132

Progressive respiratory failure with pronounced diffuse alveolar damage has been identified as the primary cause of death in COVID-19. COVID-19 pneumonia shares common histopathological hallmarks with influenza (H1N1)-related ARDS, like diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with edema, hemorrhage, and intra-alveolar fibrin deposition. The lungs with COVID-19 pneumonia revealed perivascular inflammation, an endothelial injury, microangiopathy, and an aberrant blood vessel neoformation by intussusceptive angiogenesis. While this pronounced angiocentric inflammation is likely be found - to varying degrees - in numerous other organs, e.g., the heart, COVID-19 is hypothesized to be not just a pulmonary, but rather a systemic ""vascular disease.""","Ackermann, Maximilian; Werlein, Christopher; Länger, Florian; Kühnel, Mark P; Jonigk, Danny D",Pathologe,,132

257296,Non-invasive ventilatory support in COVID-19: operating in the evidence free zone,2020,"BACKGROUND: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains one of the leading causes of premature death in diabetes. DKD is classified on albuminuria and reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)) but these have modest value for predicting future renal status. There is an unmet need for biomarkers that can be used in clinical settings which also improve prediction of renal decline on top of routinely available data, particularly in the early stages. The iBEAt study of the BEAt-DKD project aims to determine whether renal imaging biomarkers (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US)) provide insight into the pathogenesis and heterogeneity of DKD (primary aim) and whether they have potential as prognostic biomarkers in DKD (secondary aim). METHODS: iBEAt is a prospective multi-centre observational cohort study recruiting 500 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and eGFR &#8805;30 ml/min/1.73m2. At baseline, blood and urine will be collected, clinical examinations will be performed, and medical history will be obtained. These assessments will be repeated annually for 3 years. At baseline each participant will also undergo quantitative renal MRI and US with central processing of MRI images. Biological samples will be stored in a central laboratory for biomarker and validation studies, and data in a central data depository. Data analysis will explore the potential associations between imaging biomarkers and renal function, and whether the imaging biomarkers improve the prediction of DKD progression. Ancillary substudies will: (1) validate imaging biomarkers against renal histopathology; (2) validate MRI based renal blood flow measurements against H2O15 positron-emission tomography (PET); (3) validate methods for (semi-)automated processing of renal MRI; (4) examine longitudinal changes in imaging biomarkers; (5) examine whether glycocalyx and microvascular measures are associated with imaging biomarkers and eGFR decline; (6) explore whether the findings in T2D can be extrapolated to type 1 diabetes. DISCUSSION: iBEAt is the largest DKD imaging study to date and will provide valuable insights into the progression and heterogeneity of DKD. The results may contribute to a more personalised approach to DKD management in patients with T2D.

Bennett et al. (Educ Tech Res Dev 65:125-145) present a descriptive model of the design process that reports findings from a qualitative study investigating the design processes of 30 instructors from 16 Australian universities through semi-structured interviews. This exploratory study provides rich, contextualized descriptions about university teachers' design process and pinpoints key design characteristics as top-down, breadth-first, iterative, responsive, and reflective. These key design characteristics revealed by the rich contextual descriptions could provide applicable insights into the design process especially for new instructors. The findings of the study could inform how learning design could be adapted during an emergency remote teaching (ERT) as it is dynamic and open to revision. A noteworthy limitation of the study is that complementary data such as design artifacts could be utilized to ensure data triangulation in addition to self-reported data obtained via interviews. The study found that university instructors' design process did not appear to draw on instructional design models. Therefore, future studies could focus on to what extent and how such models could be used by university instructors. Lastly, future studies may explore how technology is used in ERT design to support their needs. In this article, I share how design can be informed by humanizing pedagogy and pedagogy of care during ERT.","Karakaya, Kadir",Educ Technol Res Dev,,132

259319,Myocardial injury and COVID-19: Possible mechanisms,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Both the political appetite for a science-based coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) policy and its acceptability to the public are little understood, at a time of sharp distrust not only of governments but also of scientists and their journals' review practices. We studied the case of France, where the independent Scientific Council on COVID-19 was appointed by President Macron on March 12, 2020. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a survey on a representative sample of the French adult population. METHODS: Our data were collected by the French Institute of Public Opinion using a self-administered online questionnaire. This was completed by a sample of 1016 people stratified to match French official census statistics for gender, age, occupation, and so on. We conducted statistical analysis using Python (Pandas-SciPy-Statsmodels) with Chi-squared and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to control for statistical significance. RESULTS: Intense media coverage has given the council a very high public profile, with three respondents out of four (73%) having heard about it. Perceptions are positive but complex. French citizens expect science to be important in political decision-making. Four of five (81.5%) want political decisions, in general, to be based on scientific knowledge. But one in two (55%) says that the government has not relied enough on science and only 36% are satisfied with the government's crisis management to date. Although most feel that the council has a legitimate advisory role even in situations of uncertainty (only 15% disagree), it is not perceived as fully independent. Only 44% think that it directly represents the scientific community, and only one of three people considers it completely independent from the government (39%) and the pharmaceutical industry (36%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that while the transparency of scientific advice is important, it alone cannot ensure public confidence in political decision-making. We suggest that efforts made today to instill a 'science-savvy' public culture-one that allows the complex articulation between scientific knowledge, uncertainty, and political decision-making to be understood and accounted for would greatly benefit evidence-based policy in future crises.","Schultz, É; Ward, J K",Public Health,,132
259697,"Noninvasive strategies in COVID-19: epistemology, randomised trials, guidelines, physiology",2020,"Novel coronavirus (nCoV) first emerged in Hubei province of China in December 2019. The virus initially known as 2019-nCoV was renamed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The associated disease is known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, interest has grown in antibody testing as a way to measure how far the infection has spread and to identify individuals who may be immune. Molecular diagnostic tests like polymerase chain reaction are developed rapidly, however they are not able to fulfill all the requirements of an epidemic reaction. Hence, to complement molecular diagnostic tests, serology tests emerged as a vital aspect of the overall response by confirming the presence of antibodies during the early stage of the infection. Antibody tests help in assessing herd immunity, data about the ongoing phase of infection, identifying potential donors for convalescent plasma therapy, etc. This review currently focuses on giving an overview about the antibody tests in SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Ravi, Arjun Singh V.; Chandran, Roshni Krishnan Venugopal Haridas Kaushik Kavitha R.",Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences,,132

It is essential to monitor the contaminated regions with geographical information systems on city maps. Outbreak maps visualize and help analyze the patterns of transmission and serve as a communication and education tool.

The probes are used for solution-based capture and enrichment of pathogen nucleic acid followed by high-throughput sequencing. We evaluated the performance of TBDCapSeq to surveil samples that included human whole blood, mouse tissues, and field-collected ticks. For Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti, the sensitivity of TBDCapSeq was comparable and occasionally exceeded the performance of agent-specific quantitative PCR and resulted in 25 to > 10,000-fold increase in pathogen reads when compared to standard unbiased sequencing. TBDCapSeq also enabled genome analyses directly within vertebrate and tick hosts. The implementation of TBDCapSeq could have major impact in studies of tick-borne pathogens by improving detection and facilitating genomic research that was previously unachievable with standard sequencing approaches.","Jain, Komal; Tagliafierro, Teresa; Marques, Adriana; Sanchez-Vicente, Santiago; Gokden, Alper; Fallon, Brian; Mishra, Nischay; Briese, Thomas; Kapoor, Vishal; Sameroff, Stephen; Guo, Cheng; Marcos, Luis A; Hu, Linden; Lipkin, W Ian; Tokarz, Rafal",Sci Rep,,132

It is also intended to verify whether there are differences in the various risk types between companies that had or did not have a plan or strategy to act in a pandemic, such as the one caused by COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative methodology was used, based on the application of a questionnaire survey targeting the Portuguese companies. The sample is composed of 1,647 Portuguese companies, which were queried through a questionnaire survey that analyses different risk types. Then, the software R was used to treat the results. Findings: The results show that companies are exposed and vulnerable to uncertain events, and five risk types were formed: legal, image, financial, strategic and operational. There is a bigger concern about the management of financial risks. Practical implications: Academics and companies can become more aware and master the concept of risk and its different branches, which consequently favours the adoption of strategies to better manage and plan risk. Originality/value: The literature on international businesses and their risks assumes that all crises are the same. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, besides causing a recession, obliges people and companies to adapt to a new scenario. Risks become more important to companies, in a way that had not been academically studied. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Tavares, F.; Santos, E.; Tavares, V.",Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy,,132

Galectin-3 is known to play a key role in the inflammation and fibrosis process. We aimed to evaluate the predictive role of Galectin-3 levels for pneumonia in patients with COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Total of 176 patients with COVID-19, confirmed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, admitted to the Erzurum Regional Training and Research Hospital was analyzed. The study was designed as a cross sectional. The baseline data of laboratory examinations, including galectin-3 were collected at the time of diagnosis. CT images evaluated by a single radiologist according to the recommendation of the Radiological Society of North America Expert Consensus Document for pulmonary involvement. The severity of COVID-19 pneumonia was assessed using the total severity score. RESULTS: The mean Galectin-3 level in patients with typical pneumonia was found to be significantly higher than those patients with atypical (p<0.01) and indeterminate appearance (p<0.01) and patients without pneumonia (p: <0.01). The severity of lung involvement was significantly associated with Galectin-3 levels (p<0.01 r: 0.76). Stepwise logistic regression model showed that the levels of ferritin (odds ratio [OR] = 0.05, p:0.08) and Galectin-3 (OR = 0.1, p:<0.01) were significantly and independently associated with typical pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. When COVID-19 patients were evaluated in terms of typical pneumonia, we determined a cut-off value of 18,9 ng/ml for Galectin-3 via ROC analysis.

Here, experiments with 18 pseudotyped viruses showed that the 501Y.V2 variants do not confer increased infectivity in multiple cell types except for murine ACE2-overexpressing cells, where a substantial increase in infectivity was observed. Notably, the susceptibility of the 501Y.V2 variants to 12 of 17 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies was substantially diminished, and the neutralization ability of the sera from convalescent patients and immunized mice was also reduced for these variants. The neutralization resistance was mainly caused by E484K and N501Y mutations in the receptor-binding domain of spike. The enhanced infectivity in murine ACE2-overexpressing cells suggests the possibility of spillover of the 501Y.V2 variants to mice. Moreover, the neutralization resistance we detected for the 501Y.V2 variants suggests the potential for compromised efficacy of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.","Li, Qianqian; Nie, Jianhui; Wu, Jiajing; Zhang, Li; Ding, Ruxia; Wang, Haixin; Zhang, Yue; Li, Tao; Liu, Shuo; Zhang, Mengyi; Zhao, Chenyan; Liu, Huan; Nie, Lingling; Qin, Haiyang; Wang, Meng; Lu, Qiong; Li, Xiaoyu; Liu, Junkai; Liang, Haoyu; Shi, Yi; Shen, Yuelei; Xie, Liangzhi; Zhang, Linqi; Qu, Xiaowang; Xu, Wenbo; Huang, Weijin; Wang, Youchun",Cell,,132

The aim of the present study was to explore whether hospital isolation and containment policies among women giving birth in COVID‐19 Level 3 facility enhanced psycho‐emotional distress in the immediate postpartum period. Methodology: The study was designed as an observational study. All women giving birth at Santosh Hospital, a Level 3 COVID facility in Ghaziabad, from June 2020 to October 2020, were studied. Data collection was done by a pretested structured questionnaire which was administered to the participants in isolation ward on the second postpartum day. The women were interrogated regarding the experiences of the COVID isolation ward with special reference to the problems faced during their stay there, the anxiety for the baby, loneliness, and other factors. The women were evaluated using Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Result: The study group comprised 61 women who delivered in our hospital. The mean age of the subjects was 24.2 ± 1.2 years. In the study, majority of the patients were distressed with loneliness (54%) and anxiety for the baby (43%). As the policy of the institution was to hand over the newborn baby immediately to the attendants, the mother was bound to be distressed. Sleeplessness, loss of appetite, and boredom were other problems faced by the COVID-positive patients. The incidence of postnatal depression was 24.5% during COVID-19 pandemic in this institution. In the study, we found that patients with postnatal complications, patients who had symptoms of COVID, whose baby was handed over to the attendants, postpartum stay more than 7 days, and inability to connect to the family had a statistically significant correlation with those who had EPDS score &gt;13. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has shown that perinatal mental health and well-being needs to be protected during this time.","Gupta, M.; Agarwal, N.; Agrawal, A. G.",Journal of SAFOG,,132

This review will provide a systematic framework for infectious risk mitigation strategies relevant to these therapies. RECENT FINDINGS: We classify risk mitigation strategies according to the following framework: (1) screening and patient selection, (2) vaccinations, (3) antibiotic prophylaxis, (4) laboratory and MRI monitoring, (5) adjusting dose and frequency of DMT, and (6) behavioral modifications to limit the risk of infection. We systematically apply this framework to the infections for which risk mitigations are available: hepatitis B, herpetic infections, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and tuberculosis. We also discuss up-to-date recommendations regarding COVID-19 vaccinations for patients on DMTs. We offer a practical, comprehensive, DMT-specific framework of derisking strategies designed to minimize the risk of infections associated with the newer MS therapies.","Smith, Tyler Ellis; Kister, Ilya",Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,,132

El objetivo del presente estudio es caracterizar a las embarazadas con COVID-19 que tuvieron su parto y determinar la razón de aumento de parto prematuro en este grupo en comparación con aquellas que no presentaban la enfermedad. MÉTODOS: Estudio observacional de cohorte retrospectivo donde se incluyeron pacientes embarazadas entre abril y junio del año 2020 en la Maternidad del Hospital San Juan de Dios. Se seleccionaron aquellas que tuvieron su parto y se evaluaron los datos demográficos y médicos, antecedentes obstétricos, información respecto al parto, antecedentes del recién nacido y características de la enfermedad por COVID-19. RESULTADOS: Entre las pacientes COVID-19 un 16.9% tuvo parto prematuro, alcanzando un OR de 1,79 (0,76-3,84 IC 95%) respecto a aquellas sin la enfermedad que, aunque no significativo, evidencia tendencia. Entre las que cursaron con COVID-19 severo todas tuvieron parto prematuro, con un OR significativo (&gt;= 7.84 IC 95%) en comparación con aquellas con cuadro leve o negativas a COVID-19. Un 10.1% de los recién nacidos de madres COVID-19 requirió reanimación neonatal, mientras que en las negativas fue de un 5.5%. CONCLUSIONES: Entre las pacientes COVID-19 se observo una tendencia a aumento del riesgo de parto prematuro respecto a aquellas sin la enfermedad, siendo significativo el aumento del riesgo en aquellas que cursaban con síntomas y aún más significativo si presentaban enfermedad severa.","Vielma O, Sebastián; López A, Marcia; Bustos V, Juan Carlos; Assar, Rodrigo; Valdés P, Fernanda",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

This article argues that a deeper appreciation of these risks as complex—as opposed to complicated—is vital to an effective global governance response It joins other IR scholarship seeking to invigorate a rigorous research agenda on complex system dynamics within world politics, highlighting the value of complexity theory, not simply as a contextual descriptor, but as a conceptual toolkit to inform CGCR governance research and action Taking seriously the implications of “restricted complexity,” it interrogates why the legacy governing toolkit—the assumptions, heuristics, models, and practices conventionally employed to solve international collective action problems—are unlikely to suffice It further draws laterally upon design science to offer a novel design model for governing complex systems, with broad application across global policy domains A case study of the COVID-19 pandemic response illustrates the importance of supplementing inherited “complicated” governance system design and practices with design principles explicitly oriented to working with complexity, rather than against it We contend that IR scholars and practitioners must update old ways of thinking in light of a complexification of the discipline Such a shift involves both revisiting the design logics underlying how we build global governance structures, as well as pursuing a generative research agenda more capable of responding adequately to instability, surprise, and extraordinary change","Kreienkamp, Julia; Pegram, Tom",International Studies Review,,132

O Mycoplasma ovine/caprine sorotipo 11, conhecido como cepa 2D, ainda não classificado como espécie, vem sendo relacionado a casos de vulvovaginite e problemas reprodutivos em ovinos e caprinos. Os ureaplasmas apresentam a habilidade em induzirem doenças no trato genital, confirmada por inoculações experimentais de isolados obtidos de animais doentes em animais saudáveis, resultando em moderada granularidade e hiperemia na vulva. Estes ureaplasmas não receberam ainda a designação de espécie, sendo apenas conhecidas suas características sorológicas, nas quais é fundamentada a classificação em nove sorotipos, sendo o IX relacionado a infertilidade e aborto em ovelhas. Este trabalho teve como objetivo o isolamento de micoplasmas e ureaplasmas do trato reprodutivo de fêmeas e machos das espécies caprina e ovina e tipificação genotípica dos isolados por meio de PFGE e sequenciamento do gene 16S rRNA. Foram obtidos 20 isolamentos de ureaplasma no trato reprodutivo de fêmeas e machos da espécie ovina, um isolamento de micoplasma e sete com crescimento misto de micoplasma e ureaplasma. Nas fêmeas da espécie caprina foram obtidos cinco isolamentos, sendo quatro de ureaplasma e um de micoplasma. Dos isolados submetidos a PFGE , 11 de origem ovina resultaram em oito diferentes perfis confirmando a capacidade da técnica em tipificar ureaplasma de origem ovina. O sequenciamento do gene 16S rRNA, analisado pelo UPGMA, permitiu agrupar seis isolados ao Ureaplasma diversum ATCC 49782, e quatro não foram agrupados com nenhuma outra espécies de ureaplasma, quando utilizado o ponto de corte 97%. Em nosso estudo, os isolados de ovino e caprino agrupados às referências de U. diversum não permite concluir que sejam da mesma espécie. A utilização do gene 16S rRNA gera grande quantidade de informações úteis para inferências filogenéticas e pode ser a primeira escolha na investigação de novas espécies. Técnicas filogenéticas como sequenciamento do espaço intergênico 16S-23S rRNA, e gene da urease podem auxiliaram futuramente na classificação dos isolados obtidos de ovino e caprino","Oliveira, Rosangela Claret de",,,132

This is an anonymous survey study distributed to all employees within the division of hand surgery at a single quaternary-care academic medical facility. The primary outcome measure was the result of their employee surveillance and/or symptom initiated COVID-19 antibody (prior transmission) or polymerase chain reaction test (active infection) after institution of a COVID-19 exposure and transmission mitigating clinical care protocol. Employees were also asked multiple questions regarding their perceived and actual risk of exposure to COVID-19 while performing their clinical duties. Fifty-five of 69 (79.7%) hand clinic personnel employed during the COVID-19 surge from March 23, 2020 to May 18, 2020 (therapist: 15/19; consulting physicians: 11/16, nurses: 10/11; hand surgery residents: 6/6; hand surgery fellows: 4/5; physician assistant/nurse practitioners: 4/7; clinical desk operations specialists 3/4) responded to the survey. Forty-two employees were tested and all were negative for COVID-19 antibodies (42/42). Seventeen (17/55, 30.9%) employees had a known exposure to COVID-19 of which 13 of the 17 (76.5%) were from patients. Ten of these 17 (58.8%) employees were tested for COVID-19 antibodies and were negative. Twenty four of the 55 (43.6%) respondents felt they were at high risk for transmission of COVID-19. These data support ongoing care of emergent and urgent hand surgery patients during the COVID-19 surge and safe operation of an elective hand surgery practice amidst the ongoing pandemic through a multimodal approach.","Bartoletta, J J; Rhee, P C",Hand Surg.

The social distancing in the school environment and the use of strategies to limit viral infection are not very compatible with group motor activity and team sports. The aim of this study is to verify the effectiveness of a CrossFit program in order to mitigate the deficits in fitness caused by COVID-19 prevention measures and to evaluate the effects on self-efficacy in a group of young adolescents. MethodsË 30 healthy participants were randomly allocated into an intervention group (IG) that performed the 8 weeks CrossFit training program or control group (CG). Physical fitness tests (i.e., Squat, push-up, lunge, and 20 m run) and psychological measures Regulatory Emotional Self-Efficacy scale (RESE) were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. ResultsË After 8 weeks, the intervention group showed significant improvements for all fitness tests (p < 0.0001). Additionally, higher scores for the RESE negative and positive (p < 0.0001) scales were found in the intervention group. No statistical differences were found in the control group except for the push up test. ConclusionsË the 8-week CrossFit intervention program could positively affect the general physical well-being and improve the emotional perceived self-efficacy in healthy adolescents.","Cataldi, Stefania; Francavilla, Vincenzo Cristian; Bonavolontà, Valerio; De Florio, Ornella; Carvutto, Roberto; De Candia, Michele; Latino, Francesca; Fischetti, Francesco",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,132

While there is no intervention for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 with proven clinical efficacy to date, tools to distil the current research landscape by intervention, level of evidence and those studies likely powered to address future research questions is essential. This living systematic review aims to provide an open, accessible and frequently updated resource summarising the characteristics of COVID-19 clinical trial registrations. Weekly search updates of the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and source registries will be conducted. Data extraction by two independent reviewers of trial characteristic variables including categorisation of trial design, geographic location, intervention type and targets, level of evidence and intervention adaptability to low resource settings will be completed. Descriptive and thematic synthesis will be conducted. A searchable and interactive visualisation of the results database will be created, and made openly available online. Weekly results from the continued search updates will be published and made available on the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO) website ( COVID-19 website). This living systematic review will provide a useful resource of COVID-19 clinical trial registrations for researchers in a rapidly evolving context.

This cross-sectional study was conducted on a statistical sample of pregnant women in southwestern Iran between March and April 2020 to evaluate their knowledge and attitude toward this condition. So, pregnant mothers registered in antenatal clinics affiliated to Shiraz University of Medical Sciences were called and asked to fill in a three-part online questionnaire including sociodemographic characteristics, obstetric/medical history, and knowledge/attitude toward COVID-19. P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The mean score of knowledge among 540 respondents was 34 (±4.1) out of 43. Also, 44.3% answered more than 80% of the items correctly. Higher knowledge scores were accordingly associated with marriage duration, area of residence, health insurance coverage, socioeconomic status (SES), and self-rated health status. However, a strong relationship was found between knowledge, SES, and health insurance coverage with reference to multivariate analysis results. Moreover, majority of the pregnant women and their households expressed their concern about using preventive measures against COVID-19. Although most respondents were moderately worried about becoming infected with COVID-19, 264 (48.9%) cases reported that they were very much anxious about their newborns being infected with COVID-19 and 388 (71.9%) individuals asserted that they were worried about their mortality due to this infection. Besides, most mothers maintained that they had some degrees of rumination, which could interfere with their routine daily chores.

274099,Positive direct antiglobulin tests in patients with COVID-19,2020,"IntroductionSerological testing can augment delayed case identification programmes for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronoravirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Immunoassays employ anti-nucleocapsid (anti-NP;the majority) or potentially neutralising anti-spike (including anti-receptor binding domain;anti-RBD) antibody targets, yet correlation between assays and variability arising from disease symptomatology remains unclear. We explore these possibly differential immune responses across the disease spectrum.MethodsA multicentre prospective study was undertaken via a SARS-CoV-2 delayed case identification programme (08 May-11 July 2020). Matched samples were tested for anti-NP and anti-RBD (utilising an ‘inhouse’ double-antigen bridged assay), reactivity expressed as test/cut-off binding ratios (BR) and results compared. A multivariate linear regression model analysed age, sex, symptomatology, PCR positivity, anti-NP, and anti-RBD BRs. Participants were followed up for possible reinfection.Results902 individuals underwent matched testing;109 were SARS-CoV-2 PCR swab positive. Anti-NP, anti-RBD immunoassay agreement was 87.5% (95% CI 85.3–89.6), with BRs strongly correlated (R=0.75). PCR confirmed cases were more frequently identified by anti-RBD (sensitivity 108/109, 99.1%, 95% CI 95.0–100.0) than anti-NP (102/109, 93.6%, 95% CI 87.2–97.4). Anti-RBD identified an additional 83/325 (25.5%) cases in those seronegative for anti-NP. Presence of anti-NP (p&lt;0.0001), fever (p=0.005), or anosmia (p=0.002) were all significantly associated with an increased anti-RBD BR. Age was associated with reduced anti-RBD BR (p=0.052). Three cases with evidence of seroconversion (anti-RBD seropositive) presented with subsequent reactive PCR results, two of which coincided with first time onset of Public Heath England SARS-CoV-2 symptoms.ConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD shows significant correlation with anti-NP for absolute seroconversion, and BRs. Higher BRs are seen in symptomatic individuals with significantly higher levels seen in those with fever and anosmia. The degree of discordant results (12.5%) limits the use of anti-NP as a stand-alone for delayed case finding programmes. Similarly, this discordance limits the utility of non-neutralising anti-NP assays in place of potentially neutralising anti-RBD to infer possible immunity.** this abstract presentation was awarded an Honourable Mention","Pallett, Scott Jones Rachael Rayment Michael Pallett Mitchell A.; Mughal, Nabeela Carolina Rosadas de Oliveira Randell Paul Davies Gary W.; Tedder, Richard McClure Myra O.; Matthew, K.

274165,Moving From Robotic to Personalized COVID-19 Care,2020,"We present a GIS-based crowdsourcing application that was launched soon after the first COVID-19 cases had been recorded in Greece, motivated by the need for fast, location-wise data acquisition regarding COVID-19 disease spread during spring 2020, due to limited testing. A single question was posted through a web App, to which the anonymous participants subjectively answered whether or not they had experienced any COVID-19 disease symptoms. Our main goal was to locate geographical areas with increased number of people feeling the symptoms and to determine any temporal changes in the statistics of the survey entries. It was found that the application was rapidly disseminated to the entire Greek territory via social media, having, thus, a great public reception. The higher percentages of participants experiencing symptoms coincided geographically with the highly populated urban areas, having also increased numbers of confirmed cases, while temporal variations were detected that accorded with the restrictions of activities. This application demonstrates that health systems can use crowdsourcing applications that assure anonymity, as an alternative to tracing apps, to identify possible hot spots and to reach and warn the public within a short time interval, increasing at the same time their situational awareness. However, a continuous reminder for participation should be scheduled.","Antoniou, V.; Vassilakis, E.; Hatzaki, M.",ISPRS International Journal of Geo Information,,132

It was approved for use in 2017 by NICE for thetreatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Consideringthe current risk of COVID-19, the BSR have advocated the use ofshort-acting drugs such as baricitinib when escalating treatment in RA.As real-world data is limited, we aimed to explore the efficacy ofbaricitinib in clinical practice.MethodsObservational data was collected retrospectively for patients at theDudley Group NHSFT with RA (ACR/EULAR criteria) who had receivedat least one dose of baricitinib prior to 1st October 2019, with a followup period to 1st October 2020. Patients were identified from a localbiologics database. Further data was identified from patients' medicalrecords including, demographics, features of RA, previous RA therapyhistory and disease activity scores (DAS28) at 0, 6 and 12 months.Data was input into an Excel spreadsheet with subsequent analysisconducted using SPSS Version26.ResultsWe identified 26 RA patients (77% female) treated with baricitinib;mean age 61.6 (SD 14.6) years and median disease duration of 12.1(IQR 5.8-18.4) years. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody werepositive in 73% and 65% respectively. 35% (n = 9) of patients werebiologically naïve, in whom baricitinib was chosen due to needlephobia (n = 7), or where anti-TNF drugs were considered inappropriate(bronchiectasis, ANA positivity). Mean DAS28 (SD) scores at baseline, 6 and 12 months were 5.9(0.8), 2.8(0.9) and 2.7(1.3) respectively, withsignificant reduction from baseline to both 6 and 12 months(P &lt; 0.001). A drop of 1.2 in DAS28 was recorded in 94% of patientswith complete data at 6 months (n = 18, 4 missing, 4 discontinued). At6 and 12 months, 85% and 81% of patients remained on Baricitinib. Intotal five patients discontinued Baricitinib due to side effects ortolerability issues. Reasons for discontinuation did not includethromboembolic events, zoster or serious infections. When comparingnaïve and non-naïve groups, there was no significant difference in age, sex or disease duration. The number of previous biologics used bypatients were 1(n = 6), 2(n = 3), 3(n = 8). Biologically naive comparedto non-naïve patients had a higher DAS28 at baseline, (Mean [SD])(6.2[0.9] versus 5.7[0.8] NS) but lower at 6 months (2.1[1.6] versus3.1[1.1] P = 0.023) and greater DAS improvement at 6months (-4.4[1.2]versus -2.5[0.9] P &lt; 0.002).ConclusionWe observed that up to 94% of patients responded to baricitinib with amean DAS improvement at 6 months of -3.1, biologic naïve patientsdoing best. Drug survival at 12 months was 81%. These trends arecomparable to findings in clinical trials. However, due to our smallsample size, the findings are vulnerable to type 1 and 2 errors andshould be interpreted with caution.","Vardon, H. J. S.; Douglas, K. M.

275674,Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of COVID-19: Perspectives of the National Institutes of Health COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel,2020,"Overweight and obesity are defined as an unnecessary accumulation of fat, which poses a risk to health. It is a well-identified risk factor for increased mortality due to heightened rates of heart disease, certain cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and bacterial, protozoan and viral infections. The increasing prevalence of obesity is of concern, as conventional pathogenesis may indeed be increased in obese hosts rather than healthy hosts, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a new disease and we do not have the luxury of cumulative data. Obesity activates the development of gene induced hypoxia and adipogenesis in obese animals. Several factors can influence obesity, for example, stress can increase the body weight by allowing people to consume high amounts of food with a higher propensity to consume palatable food. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis and psoriasis, leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents, leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover, the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, marked by persistent low-grade inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to sustain healthy eating habits by increasing the consumption of various plant-based and low-fat foods to protect our bodies and decrease the risk of infectious diseases, especially COVID-19.","Magdy Beshbishy, Amany; Hetta, Helal F; Hussein, Diaa E; Saati, Abdullah A; C Uba, Christian; Rivero-Perez, Nallely; Zaragoza-Bastida, Adrian; Shah, Muhammad Ajmal; Behl, Tapan; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber",,,132

276271,Diagnostic performance of chest CT in differentiating COVID-19 from other causes of ground-glass opacities,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the survival of patients hospitalized with covid-19 and who presented some vascular thrombotic complication. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with covid-19 who were treated during the months of March and April 2020 at our institution were included. All patients were symptomatic and the thrombotic event objectively confirmed. Patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), ischemic stroke, and peripheral arterial thrombosis (PAT) were included. Survival curves for all groups were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier with log rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: During the pandemic period from March-1 to April-30, 2943 patients were treated with confirmed covid-19 in our center. Of them, 106 patients showed some symptomatic vascular thrombosis: 13 patients had PAT, 15 ischemic stroke, 20 DVT and 58 PE. Another 11 patients presented multiple vascular thrombosis. Although the mean age was 65 years, there were differences between groups being older those patients with arterial thrombosis. A 67.92% were men. In total, 25 patients died during their hospital admission (23.58%), with differences between groups, being more common in patients with PAT (9 patients out of 13) and ischemic stroke (8 patients out of 15), than in those with DVT (1 patient out of 20) or PE (7 patients out of 58). CONCLUSIONS: The venous thromboembolic risk in these patients is greater than the arterial, but arterial thrombosis when it occurs was associated with high mortality rates. Survival was better in patients with DVT and PE than in patients with ischemic stroke or PAT.","Gonzalez-Fajardo, José A; Ansuategui, Marina; Romero, Carmen; Comanges, Alejandra; Gómez-Arbeláez, Diego; Ibarra, Gabriela; Garcia-Gutierrez, Ania",Med Clin (Barc),,132
276962,An interpretable mortality prediction model for COVID-19 patients,2020,"This paper argues that diverse disciplines within the human sciences have converged in identifying the conditions that human beings need to thrive and the programs, policies, and practices that are needed to foster well-being. In the interest of promoting this view, we suggest that this convergence might usefully be labeled ""The Nurture Consilience."" We review evidence from evolutionary biology, developmental, clinical, and social psychology, as well as public health and prevention science indicating that, for evolutionary reasons, coercive environments promote a ""fast"" life strategy that favors limited self-regulation, immediate gratification, and early childbearing. However, this trajectory can be prevented through programs, practices, and policies that (a) minimize toxic social and biological conditions, (b) limit opportunities and influences for problem behavior, (c) richly reinforce prosocial behavior, and (d) promote psychological flexibility. The recognition of these facts has prompted research on the adoption, implementation, and maintenance of evidence-based interventions. To fully realize the fruits of this consilience, it is necessary to reform every sector of society. We review evidence that free-market advocacy has promoted the view that if individuals simply pursue their own economic well-being it will benefit everyone, and trace how that view led business, health care, education, criminal justice, and government to adopt practices that have benefited a small segment of the population but harmed the majority. We argue that the first step in reforming each sector of society would be to promote the value of ensuring everyone's well-being. The second step will be to create contingencies that select beneficial practices and minimizes harmful ones.","Biglan, Anthony; Johansson, Magnus; Van Ryzin, Mark; Embry, Dennis",Clin Psychol Rev,,132

277721,Imaging Review of Peripheral Nerve Injuries in Patients with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical departments were forced to re-schedule their activity giving priority to urgent procedures and non-deferrable oncological cases. There is a lack of evidence-based literature providing clinical and organizational guidelines for the management of a general surgery department. Aim of our study was to review the available recommendations published by general Surgery Societies and Health Institutions and evaluate the underlying Literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the English Literature was conducted according to the AMSTAR and to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. RESULTS: After eligibility assessment, a total of 22 papers and statements were analyzed. Surgical societies have established criteria for triage and prioritization in order to identify procedures that can be postponed after the pandemic and those that should not. Prioritization among oncologic cases represents a difficult task: clinicians have to balance a possible delay in cancer diagnosis or treatment against the risk for a potential COVID-19 exposure. There is broad agreement among guidelines that indication to proceed with surgery should be discussed in virtual Tumor Boards taking into consideration alternative therapeutic approaches. Several guidelines deal with the role of laparoscopic surgery during the pandemic: a tailored approach is currently suggested, with a case-by-case evaluation provided that appropriate personal protective equipment is available in order to minimize the potential risk of transmission. Finally, there is a considerable agreement in the published Literature concerning the management of the personnel during the peri- and intraoperative phase and on the technical advices regarding the induction, operative and recover maneuvers in COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: During COVID-19 pandemic, it is of paramount importance to face the emergency in the most effective and efficient manner, retrieving resources from non-essential settings and, at the same time, providing care to high priority non-COVID-19 related diseases.","Moletta, Lucia; Pierobon, Elisa Sefora; Capovilla, Giovanni; Costantini, Mario; Salvador, Renato; Merigliano, Stefano; Valmasoni, Michele",Int J Surg,,132

A comparative observational study, using routine hospital data, was carried out in a large tertiary care hospital in Al Baha, Saudi Arabia, providing care to patients with COVID-19 between April 2019 and August 2019. Patients were categorized into two groups: the Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) group, treated with HCQ in a dose of 400 mg twice daily on the first day, followed by 200 mg twice daily; the non HCQ group, treated with other antiviral or antibacterial treatments according to protocols recommended by the Ministry of Health (MOH) at the time. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, need for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation. Overall survival was also assessed. 568 patients who received HCQ (treatment group) were compared with 207 patients who did not receive HCQ (control group). HCQ did not improve mortality in the treated group (7.7% vs. 7.2%). There were no significant differences in terms of duration of hospitalization, need for and time in ICU, and need for mechanical ventilation among the groups.

280295,Prerequisite of doing clinical trial with drugs in COVID-19 patients: Situational experience,2020,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) severely threatens the public health worldwide, but the transmission mechanism and the effectiveness of mitigation measures remain uncertain. Here we assess the role of airborne transmission in spreading the disease and the effectiveness of face covering in preventing inter-human transmission for the top-fifteen infected U.S. states during March 1 and May 18, 2020. For all fifteen states, the curve of total confirmed infections exhibits an initial sub-exponential growth and a subsequent linear growth after implementing social distancing/stay-at-home orders. The linearity extends one to two months for the six states without mandated face covering and to the onset of mandated face covering for the other nine states with this measure, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between first-order transmission kinetics and intervention. For the states with mandated face covering, significant deviation from this linearity and curve flattening occur after the onset of this measure for seven states, with exceptions for two states. Most states exhibit persistent upward trends in the daily new infections after social distancing/stay-at-home orders, while reversed downward or slowing trends occur for eight states after implementing mandated face covering. The inadequacy of social distancing and stay-at-home measures alone in preventing inter-human transmission is reflected by the continuous linear growth in the total infection curve after implementing these measures, which is mainly driven by airborne transmission. We estimate that the number of the total infections prevented by face covering reaches ~252,000 on May 18 in seven states, which is equivalent to ~17% of the total infections in the nation. We conclude that airborne transmission and face covering play the dominant role in spreading the disease and flattening the total infection curve, respectively. Our findings provide policymakers and the public with compelling evidence that universal face covering, in conjunction with social distancing and hand hygiene, represents the maximal protection against inter-human transmission and the combination of these intervention measures with rapid and extensive testing as well as contact tracing is crucial in containing the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Yixin; Zhang, Renyi; Zhao, Jiayun; Molina, Mario J",Sci Total Environ,,132

280609,"Cancer patients affected by COVID-19: Experience from Milan, Lombardy",2020,"BACKGROUND: The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in Wuhan (China) in December of 2019 is responsible for the current global pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that it is similar to other betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, MERS-CoV. Its genome is â¼ 30 kb in length and contains two large overlapping polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab that encode for several structural and non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) is arguably the most important pathogenic determinant, and previous studies on SARS-CoV indicate that it is both involved in viral replication and hampering the innate immune system response. Detailed experiments of site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution studies determined that the mechanisms of action are mediated by (a) the presence of specific amino acid residues of nsp1 and (b) the interaction between the protein and the host's small ribosomal unit. In fact, substitution of certain amino acids resulted in reduction of its negative effects. METHODS: A total of 17,928 genome sequences were obtained from the GISAID database (December 2019 to July 2020) from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 from different areas around the world. Genomes alignment was performed using MAFFT (REFF) and the nsp1 genomic regions were identified using BioEdit and verified using BLAST. Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 with and without deletion have been subsequently modelled using I-TASSER. RESULTS: We identified SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, from several Countries, carrying a previously unknown deletion of 9 nucleotides in position 686-694, corresponding to the AA position 241-243 (KSF). This deletion was found in different geographical areas. Structural prediction modelling suggests an effect on the C-terminal tail structure. CONCLUSIONS: Modelling analysis of a newly identified deletion of 3 amino acids (KSF) of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 suggests that this deletion could affect the structure of the C-terminal region of the protein, important for regulation of viral replication and negative effect on host's gene expression. In addition, substitution of the two amino acids (KS) from nsp1 of SARS-CoV was previously reported to revert loss of interferon-alpha expression. The deletion that we describe indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing profound genomic changes. It is important to: (i) confirm the spreading of this particular viral strain, and potentially of strains with other deletions in the nsp1 protein, both in the population of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic subjects, and (ii) correlate these changes in nsp1 with potential decreased viral pathogenicity.","Benedetti, Francesca; Snyder, Greg A; Giovanetti, Marta; Angeletti, Silvia; Gallo, Robert C; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Zella, Davide",J Transl Med,,132

BackgroundLow dose of dexamethasone reduced mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who required respiratory support. Less is known about the efficacy of other corticosteroids in severe COVID-19 patients. This study was designed to determine if longer and earlier corticoid therapy in severe COVID-19 patients is associated with reduced mortality and/or reduced rate of ICU admission for worsening of respiratory state. MethodsWe performed a retrospective study with patients aged [≥] 18 years, with epidemiological and/or radiological suspected COVID-19, hospitalized in a regional hospital GHRMSA Mulhouse, France. Twenty-three patients received methylprednisolone (MP) as compassionate use, 1 mg/kg/day for seven days followed by prednisolone at a gradually reduced dosage, for 4 to 6 weeks. MP was started one week after COVID-19 symptoms first appeared. The primary composite outcome was mortality and/or ICU admission during hospitalisation. ResultsBetween March 14th to June 5th 2020, 255 patients were screened, 181 were included, and 92 were analysed, 23 patients treated with MP and 69 received standard care.

This study aims to identify the causes of this health disparity, determine prognostic indicators, and assess efficacy of treatment interventions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of clinical features and laboratory data of COVID-19 patients admitted over a 52-day period at the height of the pandemic in the United States. This study was performed at an urban academic medical center in New York City, declared a COVID-only facility, serving a majority Black population. RESULTS: Of the 1103 consecutive patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 529 required hospitalization and were included in the study. 88% of patients were Black; and a majority (52%) were 61-80 years old with a mean body mass index in the ""obese"" range. 98% had one or more comorbidities. Hypertension was the most common (79%) pre-existing condition followed by diabetes mellitus (56%) and chronic kidney disease (17%). Patients with chronic kidney disease who received hemodialysis were found to have lower mortality, than those who did not receive it, suggesting benefit from hemodialysis Age > 60 years and coronary artery disease were independent predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis. Cox proportional hazards modeling for time to death demonstrated a significantly high ratio for COPD/Asthma, and favorable effects on outcomes for pre-admission ACE inhibitors and ARBs. CRP (180, 283 mg/L), LDH (551, 638 U/L), glucose (182, 163 mg/dL), procalcitonin (1.03, 1.68 ng/mL), and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (8.3:10.0) were predictive of mortality on admission and at 48-96 h.

283866,Loss of smell and taste in COVID-19 infection in adolescents,2021,"As a core activity in the tourism sector, hospitality accounts for the largest share of the sector's revenue. The last few years, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been years of strong growth both in the number of hotel companies and in the number of available rooms. The hospitality industry has also been betting on diversification as well as on the quality of its services. This activity has a strong impact on the various agents in the sector, thus it makes it essential to measure and analyze the sustainability of these hotels. One of the indicators that proficiently measure short-term sustainability is the company's liquidity level, as it demonstrates its ability to meet short-term financial obligations. This type of indicator is useful since it provides relevant information not only for managers, but also for banks and lenders, and investors. Volatility is a characteristic of hotels which are associated with geographic location, implying changes in the main operating revenue indicators. In this sense, this research aimed to investigate if the ability to reimburse short-term responsibilities differs according to the geographic location, food and beverage service existence, official stars classification, and hotel size. Portuguese hotels with and without restaurants were analyzed in the 2013-2017 period and the number of available rooms and star rating were included in the database. All the information was obtained on SABI (a database of detailed financial information of Portuguese and Spanish companies) and RNET (the Portuguese Register of Tourist Enterprises). Findings show that the behavior of some hotels concerning short-term obligations does not differ much considering the location of the hotels. However, the Algarve and the North region have the highest values. In fact, the official star rating proved to have the greatest influence. The size of the hotels, as well as the existence of restaurants negatively influences liquidity. This information is very important for hotel investors. This study can also provide management information that allows more informed decision-making as well as the definition of corrective measures if necessary.","Santos, L.

285893,Prior Treatment with Statins is Associated with Improved Outcomes of Patients with COVID-19: Data from the SEMI-COVID-19 Registry,2021,"The present ongoing global pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus is creating havoc across the world. The absence of any vaccine as well as any definitive drug to cure, has made the situation very grave. Therefore only few effective tools are available to contain the rapid pace of spread of this disease, named as COVID-19. On 24th March, 2020, the the Union Government of India made an announcement of unprecedented complete lockdown of the entire country effective from the next day. No exercise of similar scale and magnitude has been ever undertaken anywhere on the globe in the history of entire mankind. This study aims to scientifically analyze the implications of this decision using a kinetic model covering more than 96% of Indian territory. This model was further constrained by large sets of realistic parameters pertinent to India in order to capture the ground realities prevailing in India, such as: (i) true state wise population density distribution, (ii) accurate state wise infection distribution for the zeroth day of simulation (20th March, 2020), (iii) realistic movements of average clusters, (iv) rich diversity in movements patterns across different states, (v) migration patterns across different geographies, (vi) different migration patterns for pre- and post-COVID-19 outbreak, (vii) Indian demographic data based on the 2011 census, (viii) World Health Organization (WHO) report on demography wise infection rate and (ix) incubation period as per WHO report. This model does not attempt to make a long-term prediction about the disease spread on a standalone basis; but to compare between two different scenarios (complete lockdown vs. no lockdown). In the framework of model assumptions, our model conclusively shows significant success of the lockdown in containing the disease within a tiny fraction of the population and in the absence of it, it would have led to a very grave situation.","Kishore, Raj; Jha, Prashant Kumar; Das, Shreeja; Agarwal, Dheeresh; Maloo, Tanmay; Pegu, Hansraj; Sahoo, Devadatta; Singhal, Ankita; Sahu, Kisor K.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05684v1.pdf,132

IRT is a useful tool that has been used mainly as a diagnostic method for various stress-causing pathologies, though recent suggestions indicate that it can be used to assess the block quality of certain body regions. In the field of anaesthesiology, IRT has been applied to brachial and epidural blocks, while in algology, changes in surface blood circulation associated with sympathetic activity have been investigated. Thermography has also been employed to complement pain level scales based on the facial expressions of patients in critical condition, or after surgery. In addition, it has been used as a tool in research designed to evaluate different surgical procedures in human medicine, as in the case of surgical burrs for placing dental implants, where IRT helps assess the degree of heating associated with bone devascularisation, reduction in vascular perfusion as a consequence of stroke, and changes in the autonomous nervous system, or the degree of vascular changes in flaps applied to burn patients. In veterinary medicine, thermography has brought several benefits for animals in terms of evaluating lesions, diseases, and surgical procedures. The aim of this review is to evaluate how IRT can be used as a tool in surgical procedures, cases of vascular change, and pain monitoring in veterinary medicine with an emphasis on small animals.","Casas-Alvarado, Alejandro; Mota-Rojas, Daniel; Hernández-Ávalos, Ismael; Mora-Medina, Patricia; Olmos-Hernández, Adriana; Verduzco-Mendoza, Antonio; Reyes-Sotelo, Brenda; Martínez-Burnes, Julio",J Therm Biol,,132

287424,The COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on hospitals in Italy: the model of cardiac surgery,2020,"BACKGROUND: About 15 million people worldwide were affected by the Sars-Cov-2 infection, which already caused 600,000 deaths. This virus is mainly transmitted through exhalations from the airways of infected persons, so that Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems might play a role in increasing or reducing the spreading of the infection in indoor environments. METHODS: We modeled the role of HVAC systems in the diffusion of the contagion through Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of cough at the ""Bambino Gesù"" Vatican State Children's Hospital. Both waiting and hospital rooms were modeled as indoor scenarios. A specific Infection-Index (Î·) parameter was used to estimate the amount of contaminated air inhaled by each person present in the simulated indoor scenarios. The potential role of exhaust air ventilation systems placed above the coughing patient's mouth was also assessed. RESULTS: Our CFD-based simulations of the waiting room show that HVAC air-flow remarkably enhances infected droplets diffusion in the whole indoor environment within 25 s from the cough event, despite the observed dilution of saliva particles containing the virus. At the same time also their number is reduced due to removal through the HVAC system or deposition on the surfaces. The proper use of Local Exhaust Ventilation systems (LEV) simulated in the hospital room was associated to a complete reduction of infected droplets spreading from the patient's mouth in the first 0.5 s following the cough event. In the hospital room, the use of LEV system completely reduced the Î· index computed for the patient hospitalized at the bed next to the spreader, with a decreased possibility of contagion. CONCLUSIONS: CFD-based simulations for indoor environment can be useful to optimize air conditioning flow and to predict the contagion risk both in hospitals/ambulatories and in other public/private settings.","Borro, Luca; Mazzei, Lorenzo; Raponi, Massimiliano; Piscitelli, Prisco; Miani, Alessandro; Secinaro, Aurelio",Environ Res,,132

Several reports indicate short lasting immunity against endemic coronaviruses, which contrasts studies showing that biobanked venous blood contains T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 S-protein even before the outbreak in Wuhan. This suggests a preformed T cell memory towards structural proteins in individuals not exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to other members of the Coronaviridae family, the endemic coronaviruses appear likely candidates to generate this T cell memory. However, given the apparent poor immunological memory created by the endemic coronaviruses, immunity against other common pathogens might offer an alternative explanation. Here, we utilize a combination of epitope prediction and similarity to common human pathogens to identify potential sources of the SARS-CoV-2 T cell memory. Although beta-coronaviruses are the most likely candidates to explain the pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells in uninfected individuals, the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes with the highest similarity to those from beta-coronaviruses are confined to replication associated proteins-not the host interacting S-protein. Thus, our study suggests that the observed SARS-CoV-2 pre-formed immunity to structural proteins is not driven by near-identical epitopes.","Stervbo, Ulrik; Rahmann, Sven; Roch, Toralf; Westhoff, Timm H; Babel, Nina",Sci Rep,,132

The primary aim of this preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of CRT for AN relative to control treatments in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on neuropsychological inefficiencies at end-of-treatment. Secondary aims were to assess the effect of CRT for AN on dropout, eating-disorder-related, and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines. RCTs evaluating CRT for AN compared to a control treatment were identified via ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Seven RCTs and one quasi-RCT of CRT for AN were included. RCT quality ratings ranged from fair (n = 3) to good (n = 4). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge's g. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and publication bias was assessed with Begg's adjusted-rank correlation and the trim-and-fill method. CRT was not associated with improvement in central coherence compared to control treatments at end-of-treatment (g = 0.25, 95% CI = -0.35, 0.85, k = 3). Set-shifting outcomes were mixed due to heterogeneity of set-shifting measures across studies. CRT may prevent dropout; yet, more studies are needed to draw conclusions. CRT did not confer advantage over control treatments for eating-disorder-related and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Future RCTs of CRT for AN should use precise measures to assess constructs (particularly for set shifting), increase sample size, and implement longitudinal follow-up.

The recent coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak share many overlapping deleterious pathogenic mechanisms with those of FD and therefore we analyze the available information regarding the pathophysiology mechanisms of both disorders and hypothesize that there is a markedly increased risk of ischemic and hemorrhagic cerebrovascular complications in Fabry patients suffering from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Reisin, R C; Rozenfeld, P; Bonardo, P",Med Hypotheses,,132

To control this imminent threat, Jordan has enforced public health infection prevention and control measures, called for social distancing, seized all forms of inbound and outbound movement and international travel, and enacted the Defence Law that transferred the authority to the Minister of Defence to work and formulate orders according to the situation. In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed. This viewpoint suggests different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations' contribution. It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic, and financial impacts. This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine. Specifically, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness toward public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation and active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts. It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs, and mobilize the resources of nongovernmental sectors and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.","Alqutob, Raeda; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Tarawneh, Mohammed Rasoul; Ajlouni, Musa; Khader, Yousef; Aqel, Ibrahim; Kharabsheh, Saad; Obeidat, Nathir",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,132

Colleges in China have reopened, and how to prevent college students from suffering secondary damage due to school reopening remains elusive. This cross-sectional study was aimed to evaluate the psychological impact of COVID-19 after school reopening and explore via machine learning the factors that influence anxiety and depression among students. Among the 478 valid online questionnaires collected between September 14th and September 20th, 74 (15.5%) showed symptoms of anxiety (by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), and 155 (32.4%) showed symptoms of depression (by Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Descriptive analysis of basic personal characteristics indicated that students at a higher grade, having relatives or friends who have been infected, fearing being infected, and having a pessimistic attitude to COVID-19 easily experience anxiety or depression. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was utilized to counteract the imbalance of retrieved data. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and multivariate logistic regression were performed to explore significant influence factors. The results indicate that exercise frequency, alcohol use, school reopening, having relatives or friends who have been infected, self-quarantine, quarantine of classmates, taking temperature routinely, wearing masks routinely, sleep quality, retaining holiday, availability of package delivery, take-out availability, lockdown restriction, several areas in school closed due to COVID-19, living conditions in the school, taking the final examinations after school reopening, and the degree to which family economic status is influenced by COVID-19 are the primary influence factors for anxiety or depression. To evaluate the effect of our model, we used 5-fold cross-validation, and the average area under the curve (AUC) values of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of anxiety and depression on the test set reached 0.885 and 0.806, respectively. To conclude, we examined the presence of anxiety and depression symptoms among Chinese college students after school reopening and explored many factors influencing students' mental health, providing reasonable school management suggestions.","Ren, Z.; Xin, Y.; Ge, J.; Zhao, Z.; Liu, D.; Ho, R.

291834,Double-edged sword: Granulocyte colony stimulating factors in cancer patients during the COVID-19 era,2020,"This paper addresses the airplane passengers’ seat assignment problem while practicing social distancing among passengers. We proposed a mixed integer programming model to assign passengers to seats on an airplane in a manner that will respect two types of social distancing. One type of social distancing refers to passengers being seated far enough away from each other. The metric for this type of social distancing is how many passengers are seated so close to each other as to increase the risk of infection. The other type of social distancing refers to the distance between seat assignments and the aisle. That distance influences the health risk involved in passengers and crew members walking down the aisle. Corresponding metrics for both health risks are included in the objective function. To conduct simulation experiments, we define different scenarios distinguishing between the relative level of significance of each type of social distancing. The results suggest the seating assignments that best serve the intention of the scenarios. We also reformulate the initial model to determine seat assignments that maximize the number of passengers boarding an airplane while practicing social distancing among passengers. In the last part of this study, we compare the proposed scenarios with the recommended middle-seat blocking policy presently used by some airlines to keep social distancing among passengers. The results show that the proposed scenarios can provide social distancing among seated passengers similar to the middle-seat blocking policy, while reducing the number of passengers seated close to the aisle of an airplane.","Salari, Mostafa; Milne, R.

We describe a local experience in providing care for patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD. METHOD: Patient treatment and disease status since the beginning of the pandemic on March 11, 2020 as declared by WHO, were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients with AL amyloidosis and IDD were included. Four patients with IDD and 22 patients with systemic AL amyloidosis were receiving treatment during the pandemic. Since the pandemic, patients' treatments were discontinued if they achieved VGPR or better post induction. Seven patients discontinued all treatment after achieving VGPR and others required treatment modifications. 28 patients have been tested for COVID-19, and all tests have been negative. Three patients died since the pandemic, two from organ complications of systemic AL amyloidosis and one from an unrelated cause. CONCLUSION: The management of AL amyloidosis and IDD must be individualized on the clinical characteristics, centers' access to care under the pandemic restrictions, and the epidemiological aspects of the outbreak.","Lee, Holly; Tay, Jason; Duggan, Peter; McCulloch, Sylvia; Neri, Paola; Bahlis, Nizar J; Jimenez-Zepeda, Victor H",Eur. j. haematol,,132

295192,Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and liver failure-induced massive hyperferritinaemia in a male COVID-19 patient,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual-, population-, and system-level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing, and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety, and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children, and other family members. In addition, they are a vulnerable group at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high-risk external environment. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to examine the public discourse of a perinatal cohort to understand unmet health information and support needs, and the impacts on mothering identity and social dynamics in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to postbirth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from January 27 to May 12, 2020, inclusive. Key search terms included ""COVID,"" ""corona,"" and ""pandemic."" A three-phase analysis was conducted, including thematic analysis, sentiment analysis, and word frequency calculations. RESULTS: The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. The qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation, and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. These were (1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; (2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; (3) altered family and support relationships; (4) guilt-tampered happiness; and (5) family future postponed. Sentiment analysis revealed that the content was predominantly negative (very negative: n=537 and moderately negative: n=443 compared to very positive: n=236 and moderately positive: n=340). Negative words were frequently used in the 831 posts with associated derivatives including ""worried"" (n=165, 19.9%), ""risk"" (n=143, 17.2%), ""anxiety"" (n=98, 11.8%), ""concerns"" (n=74, 8.8%), and ""stress"" (n=69, 8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate the risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely, and reassuring. Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort.","Chivers, Bonnie R; Garad, Rhonda M; Boyle, Jacqueline A; Skouteris, Helen; Teede, Helena J; Harrison, Cheryce L",J Med Internet Res,,132

295297,Neuroimaging Patterns in Patients with COVID-19-Associated Neurological Complications: A Review,2021,"In the last several weeks we have been witnessing the exponentially progressing pandemic SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. As the number of people infected with SARS-CoV2 escalates, the problem of surgical management of patients requiring urgent surgery is increasing. Patients infected with SARS-CoV2 virus but with negative test results will appear in general hospitals and may pose a risk to other patients and hospital staff. Health care workers constitutes nearly 17% of infected population in Poland, therefore early identification of infected people becomes a priority to protect human resources and to ensure continuity of the access to a surgical care. Both surgical operations, and endoscopic procedures are considered as interventions with an increased risk of infection. Therefore, determining the algorithm becomes crucial for qualifying patients for surgical treatment, but also to stratify the risk of personnel being infected during surgery and to adequately protect staff. Each hospital should be logistically prepared for the need to perform urgent surgery on a patient with suspected or confirmed infection, including personal protective equipment. Limited availability of the equipment, working under pressure and staff shortages in addition to a highly contagious pathogen necessitate a pragmatic management of human resources in health care. Instant synchronized action is needed, and clear uniform guidelines are essential for the healthcare system to provide citizens with the necessary surgical care while protecting both patients, and staff.

All countries collaborating in the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer were approached to participate. Experts from 28 European countries responded to a web-based survey providing data on key organisational and policy characteristics of breast screening at the national or regional level. A total of 35 responses were received including data from regionally organised breast screening in several countries. 27 respondents, covering 21 countries, reported the existence of a policy towards IFD and stated that they communicated to women about the benefit and risks. Few countries had attempted to measure the proportion of women making an informed choice. A cluster analysis of the survey responses allowed to identify three categories: countries in a confirmation phase who have adopted a policy specific to mammography screening; countries in an implementation phase with generic polices and limited administrative support dedicated yet to IFD; and countries in a decision phase who are deliberating how to address IFD. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the key policy and organisational characteristics of approaches taken to facilitate IFD in Europe. The results demonstrate a broad adoption of the principle of enabling IFD but indicate heterogeneity of implementation.","Ritchie, David; Van Hal, Guido; Van den Broucke, Stephan",Health policy,,132

The Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI) &#x2014;including Machine Learning (ML) and Big Data analytics &#x2014;as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This paper provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely, i) tracking and tracing, ii) Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) by Wearable IoT (WIoT), iii) Personal Digital Twins (PDT), and iv) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: i) diagnosis and prognosis, ii) risk prediction, iii) vaccine and drug development, iv) research dataset, v) early warnings and alerts, vi) social control and fake news detection, and vii) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including i) crowd surveillance, ii) public announcements, iii) screening and diagnosis, and iv) essential supply delivery.

297996,COVID-19 Patients Treatment in the Cabin Hospital Based on Informationization,2020,"Goal: We hypothesized that COVID-19 subjects, especially including asymptomatics, could be accurately discriminated only from a forced-cough cell phone recording using Artificial Intelligence. To train our MIT Open Voice model we built a data collection pipeline of COVID-19 cough recordings through our website (opensigma.mit.edu) between April and May 2020 and created the largest audio COVID-19 cough balanced dataset reported to date with 5,320 subjects. Methods: We developed an AI speech processing framework that leverages acoustic biomarker feature extractors to pre-screen for COVID-19 from cough recordings, and provide a personalized patient saliency map to longitudinally monitor patients in real-time, non-invasively, and at essentially zero variable cost. Cough recordings are transformed with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient and inputted into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based architecture made up of one Poisson biomarker layer and 3 pre-trained ResNet50's in parallel, outputting a binary pre-screening diagnostic. Our CNN-based models have been trained on 4256 subjects and tested on the remaining 1064 subjects of our dataset. Transfer learning was used to learn biomarker features on larger datasets, previously successfully tested in our Lab on Alzheimer's, which significantly improves the COVID-19 discrimination accuracy of our architecture. Results: When validated with subjects diagnosed using an official test, the model achieves COVID-19 sensitivity of 98.5% with a specificity of 94.2% (AUC: 0.97). For asymptomatic subjects it achieves sensitivity of 100% with a specificity of 83.2% . Conclusions: AI techniques can produce a free, non-invasive, real-time, any-time, instantly distributable, large-scale COVID-19 asymptomatic screening tool to augment current approaches in containing the spread of COVID-19. Practical use cases could be for daily screening of students, workers, and public as schools, jobs, and transport reopen, or for pool testing to quickly alert of outbreaks in groups. General speech biomarkers may exist that cover several disease categories, as we demonstrated using the same ones for COVID-19 and Alzheimer's.","Laguarta, Jordi Hueto Ferran Subirana Brian",IEEE Open Journal of Engineering in Medicine and Biology,,132

As a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Cuscutae Semen-Mori Fructus coupled-herbs (CSMFCH) has been known to act a curative effect on OA for thousands of years. Nevertheless, the substantial basis and molecular mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA remain elusive. Methods: Herein, an integrated approach, including network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment validation, was utilized to reveal the new candidate active component and mechanism of CSMFCH in treating OA. Results: The results show that kaempferol is the most significant bioactive component of CSMFCH on OA. The mechanism and targets of CSMFCH against OA are relevant to hormone regulation, oxidant stress, and reproductive promotion. In order to validate network pharmacology results, molecular docking and experiment validation were conducted. In detail, molecular docking was employed to verify the strong binding interactions between kaempferol and the core targets. UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap-MS was used to identify kaempferol in the CSMFCH extract. In vitro and in vivo experiments further proved CSMFCH and kaempferol could enhance the mouse Leydig (TM3) and mouse Sertoli (TM4) cell viability, improve the male reproductive organ weights, sperm quality, and decrease testis tissue damage in the OA mouse model induced by CP. Conclusion: Our results not only identify the new candidate active component of CSMFCH in treating OA but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of CSMFCH against OA.","Bai, Xue; Tang, Yibo; Li, Qiang; Liu, Dan; Liu, Guimin; Fan, Xiaolei; Liu, Zhejun; Yu, Shujun; Tang, Tian; Wang, Shuyan; Li, Lingru; Zhou, Kailin; Zheng, Yanfei; Liu, Zhenquan",Drug Des Devel Ther,,132

However, studies quantifying the benefit of specific distancing strategies to prevent transmission, such as keeping aircraft cabin middle seats vacant, are limited. Using bacteriophage MS2 virus as a surrogate for airborne SARS-CoV-2, CDC and Kansas State University (KSU) modeled the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 exposure and aircraft seating proximity, including full occupancy and vacant middle seat occupancy scenarios. Compared with exposures in full occupancy scenarios, relative exposure in vacant middle seat scenarios was reduced by 23% to 57% depending upon the modeling approach. A 23% exposure reduction was observed for a single passenger who was in the same row and two seats away from the SARS-COV-2 source, rather than in an adjacent middle seat. When quantifying exposure reduction to a full 120-passenger cabin rather than to a single person, exposure reductions ranging from 35.0% to 39.4% were predicted. A 57% exposure reduction was observed under the vacant middle seat condition in a scenario involving a three-row section that contained a mix of SARS-CoV-2 sources and other passengers. Based on this laboratory model, a vacant middle seat reduces risk for exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from nearby passengers. These data suggest that increasing physical distance between passengers and lowering passenger density could help reduce potential COVID-19 exposures during air travel. Physical distancing of airplane passengers, including through policies such as middle seat vacancy, could provide additional reductions in SARS-CoV-2 exposure risk.","Dietrich, Watts L; Bennett, James S; Jones, Byron W; Hosni, Mohammad H",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,132

To this point, epidemiological, clinical and experimental evidence supports the existence of a unique disease entity termed ""obesity cardiomyopathy"", which develops independent of hypertension, coronary heart disease and other heart diseases. Our contemporary review evaluates the evidence for this pathological condition, examines putative responsible mechanisms, and discusses therapeutic options for this disorder. Clinical findings have consolidated the presence of left ventricular dysfunction in obesity. Experimental investigations have uncovered pathophysiological changes in myocardial structure and function in genetically-predisposed and diet-induced obesity. Indeed, contemporary evidence consolidates a wide array of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the etiology of obesity cardiomyopathy including adipose tissue dysfunction, systemic inflammation, metabolic disturbances (insulin resistance, abnormal glucose transport, spillover of free fatty acids, lipotoxicity, and amino acid derangement), altered intracellular especially mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, oxidative stress, autophagy/mitophagy defect, myocardial fibrosis, dampened coronary flow reserve, coronary microvascular disease (microangiopathy), and endothelial impairment. Given the important role of obesity in the increased risk of heart failure, especially that with preserved systolic function and the recent rises in COVID-19-associated cardiovascular mortality, this review should provide compelling evidence for the presence of obesity cardiomyopathy, independent of various comorbid conditions, underlying mechanisms, and offer new insights into potential therapeutic approaches (pharmacological and lifestyle modification) for the clinical management of obesity cardiomyopathy.","Ren, Jun; Wu, Ne N; Wang, Shuyi; Sowers, James R; Zhang, Yingmei",Physiol. rev,,132

Results: As shown in the table, a significant raise in mortality was observed in patients older than 65 years (p&lt;0.001), of male sex (p&lt;0.001), hypertensives (p&lt;0.001) as well as in patients with heart disease (picture 1;p&lt;0.001), COPD (picture 2;p=0.004), diabetes (p&lt;0.001) and neoplasms (p=0.03) compared with patients with no comorbidities or different diseases, both at discharge and at standard follow-up. The number of comorbidities impacted on survival as well. Conclusions: Hypertension, heart disease and cardiovascular risk factors play a significant role as a negative prognostic factor in patients affected by SARSCoV-2 pneumonia. This confirms previous observations (Pol Arch Intern Med 2020;130(4):304-309) and outlines the importance of prevention of contagion in population with cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease.","Chiarini, G.; Boari, G.

301297,Nurse-driven rapid COVID-19 testing in emergency department stroke patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: Little is known as yet about the outcome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in children being treated for cancer. METHODS: We collected information on the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a cohort of 29 children (16 female and 13 male; median age, 7 years [range, 0-16 years]) diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection while on chemotherapy/immunotherapy (n = 26), or after stem cell transplantation (n = 3) during the peak of the epidemic in Italy. These patients suffered from leukemia (n = 16), lymphoma (n = 3), solid tumors (n = 10), and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n = 1). RESULTS: The course of the disease was mild in all cases, with only 12 children developing symptoms (pneumonia in 3 cases), and none needing intensive care. Fifteen patients were hospitalized, including 7 asymptomatic patients. Nine patients (including 5 with no symptoms) were given hydroxychloroquine, and 3 of them were also given lopinavir/ritonavir. Among the 26 patients on chemotherapy/immunotherapy, the treatment was suspended in 16 cases for a median of 26 days (range, 15-68 days), whereas 8 patients continued their chemotherapy and 2 had minor modifications to their treatment regimen. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to take a milder clinical course in children than in adults with cancer. Specific SARS-CoV-2 treatment seems unnecessary for most children. In light of our findings, and albeit with the necessary caution, we suggest avoiding major changes to planned anticancer treatments in pediatric patients acquiring COVID-19.","Bisogno, Gianni; Provenzi, Massimo; Zama, Daniele; Tondo, Annalisa; Meazza, Cristina; Colombini, Antonella; Galaverna, Federica; Compagno, Francesca; Carraro, Francesca; De Santis, Raffaela; Meneghello, Linda; Baretta, Valentina; Cesaro, Simone",J Pediatric Infect Dis Soc,,132

301839,Pulmonary and systemic involvement in COVID-19 patients assessed with ultrasound-guided minimally invasive autopsy,2020,"Microplastics are small plastic fragments that have been found around the world, however, research into microplastics in Africa and freshwater systems remains insufficient. In this study, the snapshot microplastic profile of an urban stream was assessed in the Braamfontein Spruit, located in Johannesburg the largest city in South Africa. The abundance of microplastics was determined in water, Chironomus sp. larvae and sediment, while in situ parameters were taken to investigate their relationship to the microplastic profile of the different matrices. Microplastics were detected in water (mean of 705 particles m-3), Chironomus sp. larvae (mean of 53.4 particles g-1 wet weight) and sediment (mean of 166.8 particles kg-1 dry weight). The study found evidence of how urban stream characteristics such as a weir, stream depth and velocity could affect the abundance and dispersion of microplastics. The results indicate that areas of increased depth and decreased flow allowed microplastics to settle down to the sediment where benthic macroinvertebrates could ingest these fragments. Large obstructions like a weir also increased microplastic counts in sediment and invertebrates above the obstruction, with a decrease of fragments after the obstruction, however, microplastics in surface water were able to flow over the obstruction and increase in abundance downstream. This study concludes that first order urban streams such as the Braamfontein Spruit may be contributing large numbers of microplastics to higher order streams and large rivers in times of increased flow.","Dahms, Heinrich T J; van Rensburg, Gregg J; Greenfield, Richard",Sci Total Environ,,132

A psychological-psychiatric perspective,2020,"COVID-19, although a respiratory illness, has been clinically associated with non-respiratory symptoms. We conducted a negative case-control study to identify the symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2-positive results in Portugal. Twelve symptoms and signs included in the clinical notification of COVID-19 were selected as predictors, and the dependent variable was the RT-PCR test result. The &#967;2 tests were used to compare notified cases on sex, age group, health region and presence of comorbidities. The best-fit prediction model was selected using a backward stepwise method with an unconditional logistic regression. General and gastrointestinal symptoms were strongly associated with a positive test (P < 0.001). In this sense, the inclusion of general symptoms such as myalgia, headache and fatigue, as well as diarrhoea, together with actual clinical criteria for suspected cases, already updated and included in COVID-19 case definition, can lead to increased identification of cases and represent an effective strength for transmission control.","Duque, M Perez; Lucaccioni, H; Costa, C; Marques, R; Antunes, D; Hansen, L; Sá Machado, R",Epidemiol Infect,,132

Nas últimas décadas a frequência e a intensidade de eventos climáticos extremos estão aumentando. Estes eventos são raros e incomuns, mas provocam uma série de alterações no clima regional como a intensidade dos eventos de seca e chuva, além de mudanças nas temperaturas. A temperatura e a pluviosidade são os fatores climáticos mais importantes que governam a biologia de grande parte da assembleia de peixes, tendo um efeito direto sobre a taxa da maioria dos processos biológicos. As mudanças nos padrões pluviométricos afetam a hidrologia de rios e reservatórios, alterando o regime de cheias e secas, os quais geralmente determinam os padrões de reprodução e dominância trófica nos sistemas aquáticos. O clima não é o único fator a influenciar a ictiofauna e os demais grupos aquáticos da região Neotropical. A construção de barragens também altera as características do ambiente aquático, modificando habitats e estratégias de vida. Nesses ambientes espera-se que quanto mais antigo for o reservatório maior a abundância de espécies sedentárias, com maior plasticidade alimentar. Isso porque as mudanças ambientais proporcionadas pelo envelhecimento dos reservatórios atuam como filtros para determinados traços funcionais. Portanto nossa hipótese é que se as mudanças no clima local influenciam na temperatura da água e assim na qualidade do habitat dos peixes, logo qualquer mudança extrema nos níveis de temperatura do ar e precipitação poderão afetar a assembleia de peixes. Em vista disso, o objetivo deste trabalho é avaliar se as mudanças que ocorreram no clima regional durante o início dos anos 2000, influenciaram a reorganização trófica da assembleia de peixes em reservatórios Neotropicais. As alterações climáticas locais registradas durante o período de estudo contribuíram para a organização da assembleia de peixes nos reservatórios.","CAMPOS, JOANA CARNEIRO DE",,,132

Here, a DENV-derived DIP production cell line was developed that continuously produced DENV-free DIPs. The DIPs contained and could deliver to cells a DENV serotype 2 subgenomic defective-interfering RNA, which was originally discovered in DENV infected patients. The DIPs released into cell culture supernatant were purified and could potently inhibit replication of all DENV serotypes in cells. Antiviral therapeutics are limited for many viral infection.

METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted from 9 February to 4 April 2020. COVID-19 patients at Leishenshan Hospital in Wuhan, China (125 total cases; 87 RT-PCR positive and 38 RT-PCR negative) were included. COVID-19 serology was assessed by colloidal gold assay. All cases were analyzed for demographic, clinical, and serological features. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in most demographic features, clinical symptoms, complications or treatments of RT-PCR positive and negative COVID-19 patients. Serum IgM/IgG was positive in 82 (94%) and 33 (87%) RT-PCR positive and negative cases, respectively. IgM was detectable as early as 3 days after symptom onset and was undetectable 60 days after symptom onset. By contrast, IgG could be detected only 10 days after symptom onset and reached its peak 60 days after symptom onset.

Few SLPs had received training in telepractice to prepare them for changes from an in-person service delivery model to synchronous telepractice. The new telepractice environment may alter vocal behaviors and communication interactions in such a way that negatively impacts voice production. Thus, delivering synchronous online clinical services may require that SLPs adopt novel prevention strategies for avoiding phonogenic voice problems. Guided by two complementary injury frameworks, the Haddon Matrix and the Haddon Countermeasures, this article provides an overview of potential factors associated with phonogenic voice problems among SLPs in telepractice and proposes possible prevention strategies to maintain optimal vocal health and function with synchronous modes of online clinical practice.

Treatment was started with oral favipiravir and ciclesonide inhalation. On the 10th day of treatment, the patient had a persistent high fever and a chest CT showed exacerbation of pneumonia, so dexamethasone was intravenously started. He was discharged after confirming two consecutive negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests. Three months after COVID-19 treatment, a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test was negative and he underwent a deceased donor kidney transplantation. Basiliximab induction with triple drug immunosuppression consisting of extended-release tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, which is our regular immunosuppression protocol, was used.

As the pandemic continues, clinical practices have discovered ways to resume operations. Opportunities exist to understand patient preferences for telehealth clinical services and to tailor offerings to different demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a survey of patients receiving telehealth services through our outpatient practice to understand the types of healthcare services for which patients report preferences for telehealth. RESULTS: We received 551 survey responses (response rate = 20.8%; 551/2650). More than half of patients indicated being 'very likely' to use telehealth services to refill medication(s) (67.3%), prepare for an upcoming visit (66.1%), review test results (60.3%), or receive education (54.2%). Males had lower odds of preferring telehealth services for reviewing test results (odds ratio (OR) = 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34-0.94) or mental health issues (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.38-0.77). Respondents who received a video visit were significantly more likely than those who received a telephone visit to report preferences for using telehealth for education, care plan discussions, long-term health issues, and mental health.

A significant proportion of such patients were noted to be hypokalemic. Hypokalemia can be life threatening as it is known to cause cardiac arrhythmia. Case presentation Our encounter with said presentation was incidental. The on-call medical team was involved in a cardiac arrest call for a 74-year -old gentleman who developed torsades de pointes, Retrospective analysis of the clinical picture pointed out the fact that he was found to be persistently hypokalemic and bradycardic solely triggered as a result of COVID-19. Conclusion Although initially thought to be a pulmonary disease but along with time extra-pulmonary manifestations of Covid-19 has demonstrated significant consequences. Electrolyte abnormalities and cardiac dysfunction are examples of such extra-pulmonary pathologies. Therefore, it is important to keep close monitoring for such abnormalities otherwise could lead into life threatening arrythmias.","Navid Siddiqui, Saquib Memon Muhammad Tshering Sonam Hasan Tanveer Jawed Asheer Kumar Jha Pranav Jayasekhar Roland",Annals of Medicine and Surgery,,132

In addition to fever, cough and shortness of breath, it was confirmed that the patients also have manifestations towards the central nervous system (CNS), especially those critically ill ones. In this review, we will discuss how SARS-CoV-2 gain access to the CNS and the possible consequences. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in 2002 share the same receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which can be found in the brain and mediate the disease process. Both direct attack of SARS-CoV-2 and the abnormal immune response in the CNS would contribute to the disease. Also, there is a relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and the occurrence of acute cerebrovascular diseases.","Hu, Jingman; Jolkkonen, Jukka; Zhao, Chuansheng",Neurosci Biobehav Rev,,132

Researchers, technologists, doctors and other healthcare workers are working day and night on the development of vaccine and medicinesto control and treat this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is the name of the virus responsible for causing COVID-19 disease, which is highly infectious and lethal.With exponentially increasing infections, proportionate fatalities are being reported both from developed and under developed countries. As of today, more than one million people across the world have been reported infected with this virus, and more than 65,000 people have died of this disease. Hence, there is an urgent requirement for conducting academic research on several aspects of this highly contagious disease, to find effective means of containment and treatment of the disease, for now, and in future.

However, animal immunization is inherently slow, not always accessible and poorly compatible with many antigens. Here, we describe 'autonomous hypermutation yeast surface display' (AHEAD), a synthetic recombinant antibody generation technology that imitates somatic hypermutation inside engineered yeast. By encoding antibody fragments on an error-prone orthogonal DNA replication system, surface-displayed antibody repertoires continuously mutate through simple cycles of yeast culturing and enrichment for antigen binding to produce high-affinity clones in as little as two weeks. We applied AHEAD to generate potent nanobodies against the SARS-CoV-2 S glycoprotein, a G-protein-coupled receptor and other targets, offering a template for streamlined antibody generation at large.","Wellner, Alon; McMahon, Conor; Gilman, Morgan S A; Clements, Jonathan R; Clark, Sarah; Nguyen, Kianna M; Ho, Ming H; Hu, Vincent J; Shin, Jung-Eun; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M; Caradonna, Timothy M; Wingler, Laura M; Schmidt, Aaron G; Marks, Debora S; Abraham, Jonathan; Kruse, Andrew C; Liu, Chang C",Nat. chem. biol,,132

309992,Imaging Utilization and Outcomes in Vulnerable Populations during COVID-19 in New York City,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recent health care policy making has highlighted the necessity for understanding factors that influence readmission. To elucidate the rate, reason, and predictors of readmissions in neurosurgical patients, we analyzed unscheduled readmissions to our neurosurgical department after treatment for cranial or cerebral lesions. METHODS: From 2015 to 2017, all adult patients who had been discharged from our Department of Neurosurgery and were readmitted within 30 days were included into the study cohort. The patients were divided into a surgical and a non-surgical group. The main outcome measure was unplanned inpatient admission within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS: During the observation period, 183 (7.4%) of 2486 patients had to be readmitted unexpectedly within 30 days after discharge. The main readmission causes were surgical site infection (34.4 %) and seizure (16.4%) in the surgical group, compared to natural progression of the original diagnosis (38.2%) in the non-surgical group. Most important predictors for an unplanned readmission were younger age, presence of malignoma (OR: 2.44), and presence of cardiovascular side diagnoses in the surgical group. In the non-surgical group, predictors were length of stay (OR: 1.07) and the need for intensive care (OR: 5.79). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that reasons for readmission vary between operated and non-operated patients and are preventable in large numbers. In addition, we identified treatment-related partly modifiable factors as predictors of unplanned readmission in the non-surgical group, while unmodifiable patient-related factors predominated in the surgical group. Further patient-related risk adjustment models are needed to establish an individualized preventive strategy in order to reduce unplanned readmissions.","Sander, Caroline; Oppermann, Henry; Nestler, Ulf; Sander, Katharina; von Dercks, Nikolaus; Meixensberger, Jürgen",Acta neurochir,,132

The COVID-19 pandemic directly impacted both demand and supply of US beef and pork products for a prolonged period, resulting in a myriad of economic impacts. The complex disruptions create significant challenges in isolating and inferring consumer-demand changes from lagged secondary data. Thus, we turn to novel household-level data from a continuous consumer tracking survey, the Meat Demand Monitor, launched in February 2020, just before the US pandemic. We find diverse impacts across US households related to ""hoarding"" behavior and financial confidence over the course of the pandemic. Combined, these insights extend our understanding of pandemic impacts on US consumers and provide a timely example of knowledge enabled by ongoing and targeted household-level data collection and analysis.","Tonsor, G.

The emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has become a global issue with raising dire concerns. Patients with severe Covid-19 may progress toward ARDS. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be derived from bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue and so on. The easy accessibility and low immunogenicity enable MSCs for allogeneic administration, and thus they were widely used in animal and clinical studies. Accumulating evidence suggests that mesenchymal stem cell infusion can ameliorate ARDS. However, the underlying mechanisms of MSCs need to be discussed. Recent studies showed MSCs can modulate immune/inflammatory cells, attenuate endoplasmic reticulum stress, and inhibit pulmonary fibrosis. The paracrine cytokines and exosomes may account for these beneficial effects. In this review, we summarize the therapeutic mechanisms of MSCs in ARDS, analyzed the most recent animal experiments and Covid-19 clinical trial results, discussed the adverse effects and prospects in the recent studies, and highlight the potential roles of MSC therapy for Covid-19 patients with ARDS.","Wang, Wendi; Lei, Wei; Jiang, Lina; Gao, Siqi; Hu, Shijun; Zhao, Zi-Gang; Niu, Chun-Yu; Zhao, Zhen-Ao",J Transl Med,,132

To reduce the effect of this pandemic on the education sector, most of the educational institutions are already conducting online classes. However, to make these digital learning sessions interactive and comparable to the traditional offline classrooms, it is essential to ensure that students are properly engaged during online classes. In this paper, we have presented novel deep learning based algorithms that monitor the student’s emotions in real-time such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. This is done by the proposed novel state-of-the-art algorithms which compute the Mean Engagement Score (MES) by analyzing the obtained results from facial landmark detection, emotional recognition and the weights from a survey conducted on students over an hour-long class.

It addresses a gap in the literature by making a connection between internationalization and employability, concepts that are mainly framed as separate discursive realms. The literature on internationalization is focused around international student recruitment and the benefits to the host institution;the employability discourse is oriented towards national policies on the development of human capital through home students in the domestic market. The reflective thinking demonstrated by the international students illustrates the challenges they faced in seeking opportunities to enhance their employability within and outside the university;and to (re)assess learning opportunities that are integrated with work experience. The findings suggest that there is scope for embedding employment development opportunities (EDOs) at a systemic level in order to enhance the experience of international students.","Fakunle, Omolabake Pirrie Anne",Journal of International Students,,132

We utilize an integrated dataset of mobile device location data for the contiguous United States plus Alaska and Hawaii over a 100-day period from January 1, 2020 to April 9, 2020. The major findings are: 1) the declaration of the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak greatly encouraged social distancing and the mandatory stay-at-home orders in most states further strengthened the practice; 2) the states with more confirmed cases have taken more active and timely responses in practicing social distancing; 3) people in the states with fewer confirmed cases did not pay much attention to maintaining social distancing and some states, e.g., Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana, already began to practice less social distancing despite the high increasing speed of confirmed cases; 4) some counties with the highest infection rates are not performing much social distancing, e.g., Randolph County and Dougherty County in Georgia, and some counties began to practice less social distancing right after the increasing speed of confirmed cases went down, e.g., in Blaine County, Idaho, which may be dangerous as well.","Pan, Yixuan; Darzi, Aref; Kabiri, Aliakbar; Zhao, Guangchen; Luo, Weiyu; Xiong, Chenfeng; Zhang, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01224v1.pdf,132

METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study (11 hospitals), we included 64 patients with confirmed COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations who underwent a brain MRI. RESULTS: The cohort included 43 men (67%) and 21 women (33%); their median age was 66 (range 20-92) years. Thirty-six (56%) brain MRIs were considered abnormal, possibly related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Ischemic strokes (27%), leptomeningeal enhancement (17%), and encephalitis (13%) were the most frequent neuroimaging findings. Confusion (53%) was the most common neurologic manifestation, followed by impaired consciousness (39%), presence of clinical signs of corticospinal tract involvement (31%), agitation (31%), and headache (16%). The profile of patients experiencing ischemic stroke was different from that of other patients with abnormal brain imaging: the former less frequently had acute respiratory distress syndrome (p = 0.006) and more frequently had corticospinal tract signs (p = 0.02). Patients with encephalitis were younger (p = 0.007), whereas agitation was more frequent for patients with leptomeningeal enhancement (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 may develop a wide range of neurologic symptoms, which can be associated with severe and fatal complications such as ischemic stroke or encephalitis. In terms of meningoencephalitis involvement, even if a direct effect of the virus cannot be excluded, the pathophysiology seems to involve an immune or inflammatory process given the presence of signs of inflammation in both CSF and neuroimaging but the lack of virus in CSF.

As it is a novel disease, we have less experience in its possible appearances. Predominantly affecting the respiratory tract, about 20-43% patients also present with extrapulmonary manifestations such as coagulation disorders with thrombotic angiopathy. CASE PRESENTATION: In our institution, a patient presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain which was caused by portal vein thrombosis. As a COVID-19 nasopharyngeal antigen swab few days earlier was negative, we performed several tests to find out its etiology. After all tests were inconclusive and the patient suffered flu-like symptoms 2 weeks before, we repeated COVID-19 molecular testing and received a positive test result. The patient was treated symptomatically and received therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: A COVID-19 infection can also be present without typical pulmonary symptoms. In patients with severe abdominal pain and new diagnosed portal vein thrombosis, it is important to think of a COVID-19 infection. Also, the reliability of antigen nasopharyngeal swab should be considered critically, especially if performed wrongly. We recommended to perform molecular tests when in doubt. After the diagnosis of portal vein thrombosis, immediate anticoagulation is recommended to reduce the risk of further complications like intestinal infarction.","Sinz, Stefanie; Glaser-Gallion, Florian; Steffen, Thomas",Surg Case Rep,,132

ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) that may develop in these patients may cause more complicated results with the effect of thrombosis burden. Our aim in this study is to determine the frequency of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients with STEMI and to determine the factors that predict this complication. METHODS: In this study, which is a single-centre, retrospective and observational, a total of 126 patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) in our centre due to STEMI between 11 March 2020 and 10 January 2021 were evaluated. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: While 62 patients were in the COVID-19 (+) group, 64 patients were evaluated in the COVID-19 (-) group. When the two groups are compared, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, ferritin and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were significantly higher, and the lymphocyte count was significantly lower in the COVID-19 (+) group. No-reflow was numerically higher in patients with COVID-19. In multivariable analysis, D-dimer and NLR were found to be independent predictors of no-reflow phenomenon in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the no-reflow phenomenon was numerically higher in COVID-19 patients who underwent pPCI due to STEMI compared to the non-COVID group, no statistical difference was found in our study. However, NLR and D-dimer have been identified as independent predictors of no-reflow development risk in COVID-19 patients.","Güler, Arda; Gürbak, Ismail; Panç, Cafer; Güner, Ahmet; Ertürk, Mehmet",Acta Cardiol,,132

A prospective observational study was performed between March 30, 2020, and June 30, 2020, at a large District General Hospital in England. The primary outcome was perioperative COVID-19-related complications, and secondary outcome measures included incidence of COVID-19 infections among the acute surgical patients, doctors, and healthcare workers. A total of 584 patients admitted through the emergency surgical pathway and 43% (n = 253) underwent surgical intervention. Approximately 5% (n = 30) patients contracted COVID-19 during the perioperative period and 6 of them died. Eight surgical doctors and 11 theater staff were confirmed for COVID-19 by swab test. Acute surgical emergencies and perioperative management of the urgent surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge, but adequate preparedness and strategic plan to adjust the surgical services can reduce the exposures to this highly contagious virus. © The Author(s) 2021.","Nahid, M.

317887,COVID-19 Outcomes in Patients Undergoing B Cell Depletion Therapy and Those with Humoral Immunodeficiency States: A Scoping Review,2021,"The novel coronavirus, SARs-CoV-2, causes a clinical disease known as COVID-19. Since being declared a global pandemic, a significant amount of literature has been produced and guidelines are rapidly changing as more light is shed on this subject. Decisions regarding disposition must be made with attention to comorbidities. Multiple comorbidities portend a worse prognosis. Many clinical decision tools have been postulated; however, as of now, none have been validated. Laboratory testing available to the emergency physician is nonspecific but does show promise in helping prognosticate and risk stratify. Radiographic testing can also aid in the process. Escalating oxygen therapy seems to be a safe and effective therapy; delaying intubation for only the most severe cases in which respiratory muscle fatigue or mental status demands this. Despite thrombotic concerns in COVID-19, the benefit of anticoagulation in the emergency department (ED) seems to be minimal. Data regarding adjunctive therapies such as steroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories are variable with no concrete recommendations, although steroids may decrease mortality in those patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. With current guidelines in mind, we propose a succinct flow sheet for both the escalation of oxygen therapy as well as ED management and disposition of these patients.","McManus, Nicholas M; Offman, Ryan; Oetman, Jason D",West J Emerg Med,,132

318316,Concerns about the interpretation of OCT and fundus findings in COVID-19 patients in recent Lancet publication,2020,"There is concern that digital public health initiatives used in the management of COVID-19 may marginalise certain population groups. There is an overlap between the demographics of groups at risk of digital exclusion (older, lower social grade, low educational attainment and ethnic minorities) and those who are vulnerable to poorer health outcomes from SARS-CoV-2. In this national survey study (n = 2040), we assessed how the UK population; particularly these overlapping groups, reported their preparedness for digital health strategies. We report, with respect to using digital information to make health decisions, that those over 60 are less comfortable (net comfort: 57%) than those between 18 and 39 (net comfort: 78%) and lower social grades are less comfortable (net comfort: 63%) than higher social grades (net comfort: 75%). With respect to a preference for digital over non-digital sources in seeking COVID-19 health information, those over 60 (net preference: 21%) are less inclined than those between 18 and 39 (net preference: 60%) and those of low educational attainment (net preference: 30%) are less inclined than those of high educational attainment (net preference: 52%). Lastly, with respect to distinguishing reliable digital COVID-19 information, lower social grades (net confidence: 55%) are less confident than higher social grades (net confidence: 68%) and those of low educational attainment (net confidence: 51%) are less confident than those of high educational attainment (net confidence: 71%). All reported differences are statistically significant (p < 0.01) following multivariate regression modelling. This study suggests that digital public health approaches to COVID-19 have the potential to marginalise groups who are concurrently at risk of digital exclusion and poor health outcomes from SARS-CoV-2.","Sounderajah, Viknesh; Clarke, Jonathan; Yalamanchili, Seema; Acharya, Amish; Markar, Sheraz R; Ashrafian, Hutan; Darzi, Ara",Sci Rep,,132

A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and EMBASE was performed up to July 25, 2020. The pooled prevalence of the GI presentations was estimated using the random-effects model. Pairwise comparison for the outcomes was performed according to the GI manifestations' presentation and the pandemic wave of infection. Data were reported as relative risk (RR), or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval. Of 125 articles with 25,252 patients, 20.3% presented with GI manifestations. Anorexia (19.9%), dysgeusia/ageusia (15.4%), diarrhea (13.2%), nausea (10.3%), and hematemesis (9.1%) were the most common. About 26.7% had confirmed positive fecal RNA, with persistent viral shedding for an average time of 19.2 days before being negative. Patients presenting with GI symptoms on admission showed a higher risk of complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (RR = 8.16), acute cardiac injury (RR = 5.36), and acute kidney injury (RR = 5.52), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (RR = 2.56), and mortality (RR = 2.01). Although not reach significant levels, subgroup-analysis revealed that affected cohorts in the first wave had a higher risk of being hospitalized, ventilated, ICU admitted, and expired. This meta-analysis suggests an association between GI symptoms in COVID-19 patients and unfavorable outcomes. The analysis also showed improved overall outcomes for COVID-19 patients during the second wave compared to the first wave of the outbreak.","Elshazli, Rami M; Kline, Adam; Elgaml, Abdelaziz; Aboutaleb, Mohamed H; Salim, Mohamed M; Omar, Mahmoud; Munshi, Ruhul; Mankowski, Nicholas; Hussein, Mohammad H; Attia, Abdallah S; Toraih, Eman A; Settin, Ahmad; Killackey, Mary; Fawzy, Manal S; Kandil, Emad",J Med Virol,,132
319500,"Regarding ""Increased Risk of COVID-19"" in Patients Taking Proton Pump Inhibitors",2020,"We propose a novel testing and containment strategy in order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV2 while permitting large parts of the population to resume social and economic activity. Our approach recognises the fact that testing capacities are severely constrained in many countries. In this setting, we show that finding the best way to utilise this limited number of tests during a pandemic can be formulated concisely as an allocation problem. Our problem formulation takes into account the heterogeneity of the population and uses pooled testing to identify and isolate individuals while prioritising key workers and individuals with a higher risk of spreading the disease. In order to demonstrate the efficacy of our testing and containment mechanism, we perform simulations using a network-based SIR model. Our simulations indicate that applying our mechanism on a population of $100,000$ individuals with only $16$ tests per day reduces the peak number of infected individuals by approximately $20\%$, when compared to the scenario where no intervention is implemented.","Jonnerby, Jakob; Lazos, Philip; Lock, Edwin; Marmolejo-Coss'io, Francisco; Ramsey, C.

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study involving 142 patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia and moderate inflammation divided into three treatment groups (pulses of methylprednisolone alone [groupI], tocilizumab alone [groupII] and methylprednisolone plus tocilizumab [groupIII]). The aim was to assess intergroups differences in the clinical course with a 60-day follow-up and related analytical factors. RESULTS: 14 patients (9,8%) died: 8 (10%) in groupI and 6 (9,5%) in groupsII andIII. 15 (10,6%) were admitted to ICU: 2 (2,5%) from groupI, 4 (28,5%) from groupII and 9 (18,4%) from groupIII. The mean hospital stay was longer in groupII and clinical outcome was not associated with treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Tocilizumab seems to be not associated with better clinical outcomes and should be reserved for clinical trial scenario, since its widespread use may result in higher rate of ICU admission and longer mean hospital stay without differences in mortality rate and potentially adverse events.","Aomar-Millán, Ismael Francisco; Salvatierra, Juan; Torres-Parejo, Úrsula; Nuñez-Nuñez, María; Hernández-Quero, José; Anguita-Santos, Francisco",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,132

Due to the relatively recent identification of this novel virus, very little is understood about the long-term effects of COVID-19 infection on the cardiac and respiratory systems. Due to the rapid return of athletics, there is unfortunately limited research available regarding how athletes respond to COVID-19 and how it may affect their ability to return to play.

322948,"Impact of COVID-19 on a Pragmatic, Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial for Fibromyalgia",2021,"Since the discovery of manifest Zn deficiency in 1961, the increasing number of studies demonstrated the association between altered Zn status and multiple diseases. In this chapter, we provide a review of the most recent advances on the role of Zn in health and disease (2010-20), with a special focus on the role of Zn in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, diabetes and obesity, male and female reproduction, as well as COVID-19. In parallel with the revealed tight association between ASD risk and severity and Zn status, the particular mechanisms linking Zn2+ and ASD pathogenesis like modulation of synaptic plasticity through ProSAP/Shank scaffold, neurotransmitter metabolism, and gut microbiota, have been elucidated. The increasing body of data indicate the potential involvement of Zn2+ metabolism in neurodegeneration. Systemic Zn levels in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease were found to be reduced, whereas its sequestration in brain may result in modulation of amyloid ß and &#945;-synuclein processing with subsequent toxic effects. Zn2+ was shown to possess adipotropic effects through the role of zinc transporters, zinc finger proteins, and Zn-&#945;2-glycoprotein in adipose tissue physiology, underlying its particular role in pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes mellitus type 2. Recent findings also contribute to further understanding of the role of Zn2+ in spermatogenesis and sperm functioning, as well as oocyte development and fertilization. Finally, Zn2+ was shown to be the potential adjuvant therapy in management of novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19), underlining the perspectives of zinc in management of old and new threats.","Skalny, Anatoly V; Aschner, Michael; Tinkov, Alexey A",Adv Food Nutr Res,,132

One of the risk factors for ovarian cancer development are the alterations in the breast cancer gene 1 (BRCA1). Among these alterations, the most frequent is the germline mutation 185delAG and the frameshift mutation 4153delA. The frequencies of these mutations were identified earlier (Tsip et al., 2019) in ovarian cancer patients from Ukraine. Objective The present study aimed to evaluate the frequency of the mutations 185delAG and 4153delA in the BRCA1 gene in an unselected ovarian cancer patient's cohort from Ukraine. Materials and methods We screened 910 ovarian cancer patients diagnosed at different ages by routine allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR. Results 22 cases of two BRCA1 mutations were detected (10 cases of 185delAG and 12 cases of 4153delA). Conclusions Out of 910 ovarian cancer patients, 10 cases with 185delAG and 12 cases of 4153delA in the BRCA1 gene were identified, giving a frequency of 2.4 ± 0.5%.

Five common transport media (four commercial and one in-house) were evaluated for their suitability in the collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens for subsequent molecular detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results suggest that these transport media provide dependable temporal stability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus without significant analytical interference of molecular assays. These findings are important for addressing critical laboratory supply chain shortages of transport media in the current COVID-19 health crisis but also for future pandemic planning, when again supplies of choice commercially-available transport media likely will be depleted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 155 patients with a single thyroid nodule classified as B IV. Immediate molecular testing and/or thyroid surgery was offered, except when the patient (i) could not afford molecular testing/rejected the surgery, (ii) had a high surgical risk, (iii) had other disorders/comorbidities which needed to be addressed with higher priority, and (iv) had undetectable serum calcitonin levels, in whom active surveillance (AS) was performed. RESULTS: From 155 patients, only two patients could afford molecular testing; 84% (n = 130) underwent immediate thyroid surgery: lobectomy was performed in only 8% (n = 10). AS was the initial management for 15% (n = 23) of the patients. The frequency of tumor enlargement was 14% (n = 3), after a median of 42 months (range, 7-72) of follow-up, without any evidence of lymph node or clinical distant metastases development. Deferred surgery was performed in 4 patients (17%) after a median of 24 months (range, 12-48) of AS. Follicular adenoma was diagnosed in three and a follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma in one patient, all of them without evidence of disease after 12 months of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Despite current guidelines does not support AS for indeterminate Bethesda IV nodules, our findings showed that most of these patients had excellent outcomes, in a setting where lobectomy was not the preference and the access to molecular testing was limited. Probably AS could be a valid alternative in these low-risk tumors in selected patients.","Smulever, Anabella; Pitoia, Fabián",Endocrine,,132

Given the compelling need to develop a therapeutic strategy, hydroxychloroquine has been advocated as an effective drug for the infection. However, multiple clinical trials conducted using hydroxychloroquine have yielded contrasting results. An electronic search using the primary databases from WHO, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed that yielded 21 studies eligible for inclusion. Among a total of 1,350 patients who received hydroxychloroquine, 689 (51.04%) were females. The most commonly reported comorbidities include hypertension (15.18%), diabetes mellitus (8.44%) and pulmonary disease (8.96%). Of the hydroxychloroquine-treated patients, 70% were virologically cured compared to 12.5% of the control group (p = 0.001). A good clinical outcome with virological cure was reported in 973 patients (91%) within 10 days out of 1,061 hydroxychloroquine-treated patients. A total of 29 (65%) renal transplant recipients achieved complete recovery following hydroxychloroquine administration. A total of 37 (2.7%) patients reported QT prolongation. Hydroxychloroquine was found to reduce mortality in healthy, SARS-Cov-2 positive patients and improve clinical recovery in renal transplant recipients. However, a definitive conclusion regarding its effect on viral clearance can only be reached by conducting more clinical trials involving bigger and diverse samples.","Karia, R.

326243,Vitamin D deficiency and co-morbidities in COVID-19 patients – A fatal relationship?,2020,"COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV virus. It stands for severe acute respiratory syndrome, which affects the lungs. The process of replication and progression of the COVID-19 virus causes the formation of an excessive amount of reactive oxygen species and inflammation. Many studies have been carried out that have demonstrated that hydrogen has strong anti-inflammatory properties. It reduces hypotension and other symptoms by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxygen mixture, enriched with Hydrogen, - helps to reduce the resistance of the respiratory tract and frees up access to the pulmonary alveolus, which improves the penetration of oxygen into the lungs. Since hydrogen is an antioxidant, it helps to reduce the burden on the immune system, helps to maintain the body's health and its ability to quickly recover. When electrolysers are used to produce an oxygen-hydrogen mixture, alkaline mist and other impurities can enter the patient's lungs and cause poisoning and chemical burns. For this reason, the use of atomic hydrogen obtained from metal hydride sources for ventilation of the lungs will be more effective for treating COVID-19 than a molecular hydrogen-oxygen mixture from an electrolyzer. A functional diagram of a metal hydride source of atomic hydrogen to an artificial lung ventilator is shown. It is possible to create a series of hydrogen storage tanks of various capacities.","Zolotarenko, An D; Zolotarenko, Al D; Veziroglu, A; Veziroglu, T N; Shvachko, N A; Pomytkin, A P; Gavrylyuk, N A; Schur, D V; Ramazanov, T S; Gabdullin, M T",International journal of hydrogen energy,,132
326313,Outcomes and Laboratory and Clinical Findings of Asthma and Allergic Patients Admitted With Covid-19 in a Spanish University Hospital,2020,"Purpose: This thinking piece examines, from the viewpoint of two Canadian pracademics in the pandemic, the role of pedagogy and professionalism in crisis teaching and learning. The purpose of the paper is to highlight some of the tensions that have emerged and offer possible considerations to disrupt the status quo and catalyze transformation in public education during the pandemic and beyond. Design/methodology/approach: This paper considers the current context of COVID-19 and education and uses the professional capital framework (Hargreaves and Fullan, 2012) to examine pandemic pedagogies and professionalism. Findings: The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted educational systems into emergency remote teaching and learning. This rapid shift to crisis schooling has massive implications for pedagogy and professionalism during the pandemic and beyond. Despite the significant challenges for educators, policymakers, school leaders, students and families, the pandemic is a critical opportunity to rethink the future of schooling. A key to transformational change will be for schools and school systems to focus on their professional capital and find ways to develop teachers' individual knowledge and skills, support effective collaborative networks that include parents and the larger school community and, ultimately, trust and include educators in the decision-making and communication process. Originality/value: This thinking piece offers the perspective of two Canadian pracademics who do not wish for a return to “normal” public education, which has never serve all children well or equitably. Instead, they believe the pandemic is an opportunity to disrupt the status quo and build the education system back better. Using the professional capital framework, they argue that it will be educators' professionalism and pandemic pedagogies that will be required to catalyze meaningful transformational change.","Hollweck, Trista; Doucet, Armand",J.

327425,IoT Based Wearable Device to Monitor the Signs of Quarantined remote patients of COVID-19,2021,"We present the case of the outbreak and containment of COVID-19 in its early stage and analyze the causes for conservative judgment of the disease control experts who are blamed for delayed action and inadequate response by the government. We find that the disease control experts have a clear tendency and preference to make conservative judgment about the epidemic risk of a low probability and high impact new disease. This conservative preference may have been a major factor in the judging and communicating the risk of COVID-19 epidemic. The experts’ perception of the epidemic risk is affected by their habitual thinking facing a low probability event with uncertain progression. Their conservative preference is augmented by political concerns due to the high social and political impact of the event and the potential political consequence of a false judgment. Balancing personal payoffs of decision options, the experts’ rational choice would lean towards a conservative decision. We propose a three-factor decision model that integrates habitual thinking, political concerns and rational choice to explain the experts’ conservative judgment, and corroborate the model with evidences from the case. We conclude the paper with policy implications for improving experts’ role in public health emergency response.","Qi, Ye; Du, Coco Dijia; Liu, Tianle; Zhao, Xiaofan; Dong, Changgui",J.

Adequate supplies of remdesivir are highly warranted to cope with this global public health crisis. Herein, we report a Weinreb amide approach for preparing the key intermediate of remdesivir in the glycosylation step where overaddition side reactions are eliminated. Starting from 2,3,5-tri-O-benzyl-d-ribonolactone, the preferred route consisting of three sequential steps (Weinreb amidation, O-TMS protection, and Grignard addition) enables a high-yield (65%) synthesis of this intermediate at a kilogram scale. In particular, the undesirable PhMgCl used in previous methods was successfully replaced by MeMgBr. This approach proved to be suitable for the scalable production of the key remdesivir intermediate.","Xie, Yuanchao; Hu, Tianwen; Zhang, Yan; Wei, Daibao; Zheng, Wei; Zhu, Fuqiang; Tian, Guanghui; Aisa, Haji A; Shen, Jingshan",J Org Chem,,132

329132,'It's not worse than eating them': the limits of analogy in bioethics,2020,"ABSTRACT: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and liver injury in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and analyze the differences between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients, this retrospective study was performed on 157 COVID-19 patients and 93 suspected patients who were ultimately excluded from COVID-19 (control patients). Differences in clinical characteristics and liver injury between suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients were analyzed. Age, male sex, fever, chest tightness and dyspnea were related to the severity of COVID-19. C-reactive protein (CRP) and D-dimer may be predictors of the severity of COVID-19. Computed tomography (CT) played an important role in the screening of COVID-19 and the evaluation of disease severity. Multiple factors may cause liver injury in COVID-19 patients. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may be more likely to cause liver injury than common respiratory infectious diseases. Age, temperature (T), white blood cell (WBC), lymphocytes (LY), hematocrit (HCT), CRP, and finger pulse oxygen saturation (SpO2) may correlate with liver function impairment and may predict the occurrence and severity of liver function impairment. Some therapeutic drugs (like glucocorticoid) may be involved in the liver function impairment of COVID-19 patients. Most liver function indices improved significantly after active treatment. Although COVID-19 and other common respiratory infectious diseases share some clinical characteristics, COVID-19 has its own characteristics.","Zhang, Qing; Li, Jie; Zhang, Yan; Gao, Jie; Wang, Peixue; Ai, Minghua; Ding, Wen; Tan, Xiaoping",Medicine (Baltimore),,132

The study seeks to ensure that their unheard voices are reached to both national and international academic discourse, which has so far been uninhabited. It adopted qualitative interpretative methods of social research through content analysis. The study found that the pandemic did not affect all groups of society uniformly, rather the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as economic status and family institutions. The lower socioeconomic class is the worst affected as the pandemic made them unemployed, leading them to an uncertain future. Despite such variations, the general population has experienced a subsequent increase in workload, and challenges in using routine health facilities that increased behavioural changes, higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and suicides.","Ahmed, Faria; Sifat, Ridwan Islam",Int. j. health plann. manage,,132

Direct DILI is dose-related, predictable with short latency (hour to days) and is generally associated with transient and reversible transaminitis without jaundice. Antimetabolites including methotrexate are a common cause for direct DILI. Hepatotoxicity associated with high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) is generally transient and includes reversible elevation of transaminase in up to 60% and associated hyperbilirubinaemia (&#8804;grade 2) in 25% of courses and therefore is of no clinical significance. Severe grades of DILI with HD-MTX (grade &#8805;4) are extremely rare. We describe an adolescent with Burkitt leukaemia who had reversible grade 4 DILI including hyperbilirubinaemia postfirst course of HD-MTX.

E-587-E588",2021,"Big Events are periods during which abnormal large-scale events like war, economic collapse, revolts, or pandemics disrupt daily life and expectations about the future. They can lead to rapid change in health-related norms, beliefs, social networks and behavioural practices. The world is undergoing such Big Events through the interaction of COVID-19, a large economic downturn, massive social unrest in many countries, and ever-worsening effects of global climate change. Previous research, mainly on HIV/AIDS, suggests that the health effects of Big Events can be profound, but are contingent: Sometimes Big Events led to enormous outbreaks of HIV and associated diseases and conditions such as injection drug use, sex trading, and tuberculosis, but in other circumstances, Big Events did not do so. This paper discusses and presents hypotheses about pathways through which the current Big Events might lead to better or worse short and long term outcomes for various health conditions and diseases; considers how pre-existing societal conditions and changing 'pathway' variables can influence the impact of Big Events; discusses how to measure these pathways; and suggests ways in which research and surveillance might be conducted to improve human capacity to prevent or mitigate the effects of Big Events on human health.","Friedman, Samuel R; Mateu-Gelabert, Pedro; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K; Cerdá, Magdalena; Rossi, Diana; Jordan, Ashly E; Townsend, Tarlise; Khan, Maria R; Perlman, David C",Glob Public Health,,132

331034,The Relationship Between Blood Groups and COVID-19 Patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Although mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines report &#8805;90% efficacy, breakthrough infections occur. Little is known about the effectiveness of these vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the highly-prevalent B.1.427/B.1.429 variant in California.. METHODS: In this quality improvement project, we collected demographic and clinical information from post-vaccine SARS-CoV-2 cases (PVSCs), defined as health care personnel (HCP) with positive SARS-CoV-2 NAAT after receiving &#8805;1 vaccine dose. Available specimens were tested for L452R, N501Y and E484K mutations by RT-PCR. Mutation prevalence was compared among unvaccinated, early post-vaccinated (<=14 days after dose 1), partially vaccinated (positive test >14 days after dose 1 and &#8804;14 days after dose 2) and fully vaccinated (>14 days after dose 2) PVSCs. RESULTS: From December 2020-April 2021, >=23,090 HCPS received at least1 dose of an mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and 660 HCP cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurred of which 189 were PVSCs. Among the PVSCs, 114 (60.3%), 49 (25.9%) and 26 (13.8%) were early post-vaccination, partially vaccinated, and fully vaccinated, respectively. Of 261 available samples from vaccinated and unvaccinated HCP, 103 (39.5%), including 42 PVSCs (36.5%), had L452R mutation presumed to be B.1.427/B.1.429,. When adjusted for community prevalence of B.1.427/B.1.429, PVSCs did not have significantly elevated risk for infection with B.1.427/B.1.429 compared with unvaccinated HCP. CONCLUSIONS: Most PVSCs occurred prior to expected onset of full, vaccine-derived immunity. Presumptive B.1.427/B.1.429 was not more prevalent in post-vaccine cases than in unvaccinated SARS-CoV-2 HCP. Continued infection control measures, particularly &#8804;14 days post-vaccination, and continued variant surveillance in PVSCs is imperative to control future SARS-CoV-2 surges.","Jacobson, Karen B; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Montez Rath, Maria E; Wang, Hannah; Miller, Jacob A; Skhiri, Mehdi; Shepard, John; Mathew, Roshni; Lee, Grace; Bohman, Bryan; Parsonnet, Julie; Holubar, Marisa",Clin. infect. dis,,132

334801,"How to reorganize the access of children in a radiotherapy department in the era of COVID19, in order to protect themselves and elderly patients",2020,"This paper aimed to support the rational crop expansion in agricultural-growing regions. MODIS satellite images are used together with gridded weather data to model biometeorological parameters at the Fruit Circuit region, state of São Paulo, Southeast Brazil. This region has experienced some cases of drought, while arising rainfall water excess in some periods, demanding large-scale water and energy balance studies to subsidize water resource policies. The SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm was applied together with the radiation-use efficiency (RUE) model for biometeorological index assessments. The highest latent heat fluxes (&#955;E), above 8.0 MJ m-2 d-1, at the end of the year, coincide with the progressive increases on both rainfall and global solar radiation (RG) levels, and drop to below 5.0 MJ m-2 d-1 in the middle of the year, during the driest conditions. The same tendencies along the year are verified for sensible heat fluxes (H), for which mean pixel values are above 3.5 MJ m-2 d-1 at the end of the year. On the one hand, the highest values for water productivity (WP), which is considered the ratio of actual evapotranspiration (ET) to biomass production (BIO), above 4.0 kg m-3, are verified in April, period under increasing BIO and low ET rates. On the other hand, the lowest WP values (below 2.0 kg m-3) occur between August and October, when BIO is low, and ET is high. Although the area featuring good WP levels under high precipitation (P), with rainfalls generally above ET, supplementary irrigation may benefit agriculture in some periods of the year. The results of the large-scale modeling showed applicability of the models for monitoring water and vegetation dynamics over 16-day timescale and at a 250-m spatial resolution in areas experiencing climate and land-use changes by combining climate data and MODIS images. Application of these tools enables to indicate the best options for expanding the agriculture activities, being of great potential for rational natural resources management, in regions under environmental vulnerability conditions.","de Castro Teixeira, Antônio Heriberto; Leivas, Janice Freitas; Garçon, Edlene Aparecida Monteiro; Takemura, Celina Maki; Quartaroli, Carlos Fernando; Alvarez, Ivan André",Int. j. biometeorol,,132

Humic acid urea (HAU) and polyaspartic acid urea (PAU) are two similar synergistic nitrogen fertilizers. METHODS: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance (13 CNMR) were used to determine the loading of urea-N into the humic acid (HA) and polyaspartic acid (PA). Thermal stability and physical adsorption properties of HAU and PAU were assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) surface measurement. The soil incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of HAU and PAU on nitrogen transformation and gaseous nitrogen loss compared with commercial urea. RESULTS: Nitrogen transformation from FAU and PAU was slowed down compared with urea. After 90 days of incubation, HAU and PAU reduced the cumulative NH3 volatilization (by 9.70% and 6.30%, respectively) and N2 O emission (by 40.48% and 43.00%, respectively) from soil compared with the urea-alone treatment.

336719,Risk of COVID-19 mortality among patients with preexisting cerebrovascular disease,2021,"Simple SummaryA cancer diagnosis during adolescence or young adulthood presents unique medical and psychosocial challenges which must be addressed in the provision of quality, comprehensive cancer care. Tailoring services to the needs of this population requires careful work to identify, monitor and evaluate areas of care;however, published work in this area to guide service priorities is limited. This paper presents work done by the Australian Youth Cancer Services to operationalise and deliver quality care to adolescents and young adults with cancer, focusing on nationally coordinated service improvement initiatives and activity data collection in four areas that are of particular concern to young people diagnosed with cancer: clinical trial enrolment, oncofertility, psychosocial care and survivorship. This account may be instructive for health services seeking to improve the delivery and monitoring of cancer care provided to adolescents and young adults. AbstractAdolescents and young adults (aged 15–25 years) diagnosed with cancer have unique medical and psychosocial experiences and care needs, distinct from those of paediatric and older adult patients. Since 2011, the Australian Youth Cancer Services have provided developmentally appropriate, multidisciplinary and comprehensive care to these young patients, facilitated by national service coordination and activity data collection and monitoring. This paper reports on how the Youth Cancer Services have conceptualised and delivered quality youth cancer care in four priority areas: clinical trial participation, oncofertility, psychosocial care and survivorship. National activity data collected by the Youth Cancer Services between 2016–17 and 2019–20 are used to illustrate how service monitoring processes have facilitated improvements in coordination and accountability across multiple indicators of quality youth cancer care, including clinical trial participation, access to fertility information and preservation, psychosocial screening and care and the transition from active treatment to survivorship. Accounts of both service delivery and monitoring and evaluation processes within the Australian Youth Cancer Services provide an exemplar of how coordinated initiatives may be employed to deliver, monitor and improve quality cancer care for adolescents and young adults.","Patterson, Pandora Allison Kimberley R.; Bibby, Helen Thompson Kate Lewin Jeremy Briggs Taia Walker Rick Osborn Michael Plaster Meg Hayward Allan Henney Roslyn Shannyn George Keuskamp Dominic Anazodo Antoinette",Cancers,,132

The proposed method produces nonwoven polypropylene fabric material with filtering efficiency of up to 96% for particles 0.30-0.49 {\mu}m in diameter. We additionally demonstrate a scalable means to test for filtration efficiency and pressure drop to ensure a standardized degree of quality in the output material. We perform preliminary optimization of relevant parameters for scale-up and propose that this is a viable method to rapidly produce up to one million N95 FFRs per day in distributed manner with just six machines per site operating across 200 locations. We share this work as a starting point for others to rapidly construct, replicate and develop their own affordable modular processes aimed at producing high quality filtration material to address the current FFR shortage globally.","Molina, Anton; Vyas, Pranav; Khlystov, Nikita; Kumar, Shailabh; Kothari, Anesta; Deriso, Dave; Liu, Zhiru; Banavar, Samhita; Flaum, Eliott; Prakash, Manu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13494v1.pdf,132

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected the clinical data of patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital, by using logistic regression analysis and AUC curves, explored the relationship between biochemical indicators and nucleic acid positive duration, the severity of COVID-19, and hospital stay respectively. RESULTS: A total of two hundred and thirty-three patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. We found patients whose nucleic acid turned negative within 14 days had lower LDH, CRP and higher ALB (P < 0.05). ROC curve results indicated that lower LDH, TP, CRP and higher ALB predicted the nucleic acid of patients turned negative within 14 days with statistical significance(P < 0.05), AST, LDH, CRP and PCT predicted the severe COVID-19 with statistical significance, and CRP predicted hospital stay >31days with statistical significance (P < 0.05). After verification, the probability of nucleic acid turning negative within 14 days in patients with low LDH (<256 U/L), CRP (<44.5 mg/L) and high ALB (>35.8 g/L) was about 4 times higher than that in patients with high LDH, CRP and low ALB (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: LDH, CRP and ALB are useful prognostic marker for predicting nucleic acid turn negative within 14 days in symptomatic patients with COVID-19.","Liu, Gaoli; Zhang, Bicheng; Zhang, Shaowen; Hu, Haifeng; Liu, TingTing",Scott Med J,,132

In this regard, the safe and effective management of medical wastes has become a serious health and safety issue. This research aims to determine the safest and shortest transportation routes for medical waste vehicles. The safety scores used in this study were obtained in our previous study. The resulting safety scores were used in a multi-objective traveling salesman problem for deriving two objective functions, which are based on safety scores and total transportation distance. A conciliating solution was obtained by solving this linear programming model. The proposed model faced by health institutions in Istanbul has been applied for a specific district.

Objective: The study examined the impact of population density on the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in two sociodemographic divergent countries. Methods: The study conducted a scoping review of published and unpublished articles including blogs on incidences and fatalities of COVID-19. The analysis followed qualitative description and quantitative presentation of the findings using only frequency distribution, percentages, and graphs. Results: The two countries shared similar experience of ""importation"" of COVID-19, but while different states ordered partial lockdown in Nigeria, it was an immediate total lockdown in Italy. The physician/patient ratio is high in Italy (1 : 328) but low in Nigeria (1 : 2500), while population density is 221 in Nigeria and 206 in Italy. Daily change in incidence rate reduced to below 20% after 51 and 30 days of COVID-19 first incidence in Italy and Nigeria, respectively. Fatality rate has plummeted to below 10% after the 66th day in Italy but has not been stabilised in Nigeria. Conclusion: The authors upheld both governments' recommending measures that tilted towards personal hand-hygienic practices and social distancing. Authors suggested that if Italy with its high physician/patient ratio and lower population density compared to Nigeria could suffer high fatality from COVID-19 pandemic under four weeks, then Nigeria with its low physician/patient ratio and higher population density should prepare to face harder time if the pandemic persists.","Amoo, Emmanuel O; Adekeye, Olujide; Olawole-Isaac, Adebanke; Fasina, Fagbeminiyi; Adekola, Paul O; Samuel, Gbemisola W; Akanbi, Moses A; Oladosun, Muyiwa; Azuh, Dominic E",ScientificWorldJournal,,132

Recommendations from the WHO COVID Emergency Committee continue to support strengthening COVID surveillance systems, including timely access to effective diagnostics. Questions were raised about the validity of considering the RT-PCR as the gold standard in COVID-19 diagnosis. It has been suggested that a variety of methods should be used to evaluate advocated tests. Dogs had been successfully trained and employed to detect diseases in humans. Here we show that upon training explosives detection dogs on sniffing COVID-19 odor in patients' sweat, those dogs were able to successfully screen out 3249 individuals who tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2, from a cohort of 3290 individuals. Additionally, using Bayesian analysis, the sensitivity of the K9 test was found to be superior to the RT-PCR test performed on nasal swabs from a cohort of 3134 persons. Given its high sensitivity, short turn-around-time, low cost, less invasiveness, and ease of application, the detection dogs test lends itself as a better alternative to the RT-PCR in screening for SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic individuals.","Hag-Ali, Mohammed; AlShamsi, Abdul Salam; Boeijen, Linda; Mahmmod, Yasser; Manzoor, Rashid; Rutten, Harry; Mweu, Marshal M; El-Tholoth, Mohamed; AlShamsi, Abdullatif Alteraifi",Commun Biol,,132

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the state of transition between the normal aging process and cognitive changes of unformed dementia. Diagnosis and treatment of MCI are the keys to prevent dementia, and hypertension is one of the important influencing factors of MCI. Our preclinical experiment found that Yizhi Qingxin Decoction (YQD) could effectively reduce the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), improve their spatial learning and memory abilities in Morris water maze, and play a neuroprotective role. The objective is to estimate the safety and efficacy of YQD (capsules) in the treatment of hypertension in the elderly with MCI (deficiency of kidney essence syndrome) through this study. METHODS: According to the random number generated by the block random method, 100 participants will be randomly and equally divided into the treatment group (YQD) or the control group (Ginkgo biloba extract tablets). The conversion rate of dementia will be used as the main evaluating indicator by the CDR scale. The MoCA scale, MMSE scale, ADCS-MCI-ADL-24 scale, CGIC-KDS scale, and 24-h ambulatory blood pressure will be used as the secondary evaluating indicator. Safety will be evaluated based on specific manifestations of adverse reactions and the incidence of adverse events. OBJECTIVE: The objective is to estimate the curative effect of YQD (capsules) on hypertension in the elderly with MCI (deficiency of kidney essence syndrome), and to evaluate the safety of its clinical application.

However, training focused on only one profession ignores the value realized through collaborations among multiple professions for solving health-related problems. This is at the core of inter-professional education (IPE). Effective IPE programs can result in inter-professional collaboration and translation science endeavors across the health sciences and beyond. Recent events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the opioid crisis highlight the importance of veterinary medicine in advancing One Health through IPE. The prevalence of IPE programs in veterinary curricula, and the process by which these have been established, has not been widely described in the literature. Through an 18-question survey sent to associate deans (ADs) of 50 veterinary schools, we sought to determine the status of IPE in the veterinary curriculum. Thirty-nine schools agreed to participate, representing primarily United States (US) DVM public and private programs with some representation from Canadian, United Kingdom (UK), and Australasian programs. Schools that provide IPE courses developed their programs in collaboration with other health sciences programs across the 4-year curriculum. The perceived barriers for IPE offerings were no different between schools with or without opportunities; however, a lack of faculty and student-perceived value and lack of adequate space in the academic schedule were common threads. Our findings provide a snapshot of the current state of IPE in veterinary medical curricula, with a particular emphasis on the United States, and point to areas of programmatic need for the field.","Estrada, Amara H; Samper, Juan; Stefanou, Candice; Blue, Amy",J Vet Med Educ,,132

Many of our technologies stunt sensuous engagement, collapse psychic space, diminish our capacity to tolerate frustration, and blind us to our dependence on worlds beyond the human. In short, our technologies trouble our relationship to our bodies and other bodies.

Golden Syrian hamsters immunized intramuscularly with two injections of 1 µg or 5 µg of S-2P adjuvanted with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) were challenged intranasally with SARS-CoV-2. Prior to virus challenge, the vaccine induced high levels of neutralizing antibodies with 10,000-fold higher IgG level and an average of 50-fold higher pseudovirus neutralizing titers in either dose groups than vehicle or adjuvant control groups. Six days after infection, vaccinated hamsters did not display any weight loss associated with infection and had significantly reduced lung pathology and most importantly, lung viral load levels were reduced to lower than detection limit compared to unvaccinated animals. Vaccination with either 1 µg or 5 µg of adjuvanted S-2P produced comparable immunogenicity and protection from infection.

This study was conducted to investigate knowledge, attitude, precautionary practices and degree of fear related to COVID-19 in a sample of Iranian population. This study was conducted among 457 residents of Kurdistan Province, Iran, through social networks and social media (WhatsApp and Telegram). Knowledge, attitude and practice and fear of COVID-19 were collected using valid tools. Multiple logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with binary outcome attitudes, practices and continuous variables knowledge and fear of COVID-19, respectively. The mean (SD) age of participants was 37.86 (10.42); of them, 252 (55.1%) were men, and more than two-thirds were married (74.8%). About 10% of the respondents were in believed that COVID-19 could create a type of social stigma. Level of knowledge about COVID-19 in 77.8% of the study attendees was acceptable, and 352 of them (70%) were confident that the virus would eventually be successfully controlled in the world, but only 252 of the attendants (50%) had confidence about successful control of COVID-19 in Iran. Applying multiple logistic regression, knowledge (OR: 1.18, p = 0.028) and fear (OR: 1.04, p = 0.028) of COVID-19 were associated with positive attitude towards controllability of COVID-19.

In this backdrop, there is wide interest in looking for ways to support multiple patients from a single ventilator. Various solutions, based upon simple mechanical division of the ventilator tubings are described. However, recently warnings have been issued by multiple international professional societies against these plumbing solutions as it can seriously harm the patients. Methods: We have bifurcated the inspiratory and expiratory conduits from a single ventilator with addition of one way valves, pressure and flow sensors along with volume and PEEP control. A purpose-built software and a low-cost microcontroller based control system integrates and displays the data in the familiar ventilatory graphic and numerical format onto a generic screen. The system is calibrated with simulated lungs with varying compliance. In addition to the standard microbial, heat and moisture exchanger filters we design to add UV-C lights at 254-260 nanometre wavelength in the expiratory channel for its virucidal effect. Results: The dynamic ventilatory divider system is capable of providing and controlling individual flow, tidal volume (TV) and Positive End-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for individual patients. Furthermore, it would also display the ventilatory parameters of both the patients, on a single split screen, in a familiar format. FiO2 and rate are still controlled by the mother ventilator. Conclusions: The prototype system has a potential to provide safe ventilation to at least two individuals from a single ventilator, while maintaining the unique requirements of each patient.","Mazhar, Rashid; Chowdhury, Muhammad E.

Factors independently associated with in-hospital survival at 28 days after tocilizumab administration were assessed. Epidemiologic, demographic, laboratory, prognostic scores, treatment, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. Clinical response was collected and defined as a decline of two levels on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status or discharged alive from the hospital. Of the 81 patients included, the median age was 64 (58-71) years and 56 (69.1%) were male. The 28 day in-hospital mortality was 43.2%. There were 46 (56.8%) patients in the survivors and 35 (43.2%) in the non-survivors group. On study day 0 no differences were noted in demographics, clinical characteristics, severity of illness scores, or treatments received between survivors and non-survivors. C-reactive protein was significantly higher in the non-survivors compared to survivors. Compared to non-survivors, recipients of tocilizumab within 12 days of symptom onset was independently associated with survival (adjusted OR: 0.296, 95% CI: 0.098-0.889). SOFA score &#8805;8 on day 0 was independently associated with mortality (adjusted OR: 2.842, 95% CI: 1.042-7.753). Clinical response occurred more commonly in survivors than non-survivors (80.4% vs. 5.7%; p < 0.001). Improvements in the six-point ordinal scale and SOFA score were observed in survivors after tocilizumab. Early receipt of tocilizumab in patients with severe COVID-19 was an independent predictor for in-hospital survival at 28 days.","Morrison, Austin R; Johnson, Joseph M; Griebe, Kristin M; Jones, Mathew C; Stine, John J; Hencken, Laura N; To, Long; Bianchini, Monica L; Vahia, Amit T; Swiderek, Jennifer; Ramesh, Mayur S; Peters, Michael A; Smith, Zachary R",J Autoimmun,,132

However, the SEIR model prototype is generic and not able to capture the unique nature of a novel viral pandemic such as SARS-CoV-2. We have developed and tested a specialized version of the SEIR model, called SEAHIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Hospitalized-Isolated-Removed) model. This proposed model is able to capture the unique dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak including further dividing the Infected compartment into: (1) ""Asymptomatic"", (2) ""Isolated"" and (3) ""Hospitalized"" to delineate the transmission specifics of each compartment and forecast healthcare requirements. The model also takes into consideration the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing and different testing strategies on the number of confirmed cases. We used a publicly available dataset from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a case study to optimize the main parameters of the model and benchmarked it against the historical number of cases. The SEAHIR model was used by decision-makers in Dubai's COVID-19 Command and Control Center to make timely decisions on developing testing strategies, increasing healthcare capacity, and implementing interventions to contain the spread of the virus. The novel six-compartment SEAHIR model could be utilized by decision-makers and researchers in other countries for current or future pandemics.","Leontitsis, Alexandros; Senok, Abiola; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi; Al Nasser, Younus; Loney, Tom; Alshamsi, Aamena",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,132

352801,Nutritional Management Of Individuals With Obesity And Covid-19: Espen Expert Statements And Practical Guidance,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: COVID-19 infection predisposes to diabetic ketoacidosis(DKA); whether glucocorticoids enhances this risk is unknown.We aimed to study the occurrence of DKA after initiating glucocorticoids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM) and moderate-to-severe COVID-19, and identify predictors for it. METHODS: Patients with T2DM and moderate or severe COVID-19 infection were prospectively observed for development of new-onset DKA for one week following initiation of parenteral dexamethasone. Clinical and biochemical parameters were compared between those who developed DKA (Group A) and those who didnot (Group B). Logistic regression was done to identify independent risk-factors predicting DKA; ROC-curve analysis to determine cut-offs for the parameters in predicting DKA. RESULTS: Amongst 302 patients screened, n = 196 were finally included, of whom 13.2% (n = 26,Group A) developed DKA. Patients in Group A were younger, had lower BMI, increased severity of COVID-19 infection, higher HbA1c%, CRP, IL-6, D-dimer and procalcitonin at admission (pall < 0.02). Further, admission BMI (OR: 0.43, CI: 0.27-0.69), HbA1c % (OR: 1.68, CI: 1.16-2.43) and serum IL-6 (OR: 1.02, CI: 1.01-1.03) emerged as independent predictors for DKA. Out of these, IL-6 levels had the highest AUROC (0.93, CI: 0.89-0.98) with a cut-off of 50.95 pg/ml yielding a sensitivity of 88% and specificity of 85.2% in predicting DKA. CONCLUSION: There is significant incidence of new-onset DKA following parenteral glucocorticoids in T2DM patients with COVID-19, especially in those with BMI <25.56 kg/m2, HbA1c% >8.35% and IL-6 levels >50.95 pg/ml at admission.","Mondal, Sunetra; DasGupta, Riddhi; Lodh, Moushumi; Gorai, Ramprasad; Choudhury, Brojen; Hazra, Arindam Kumar; Ganguly, Arunangshu",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,132

In the United States, health care systems and governmental agencies have relied on several models, such as the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Youyang Gu (YYG), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ensemble, to predict short- and long-term trends in disease activity. The Mayo Clinic Bayesian SIR model, recently made publicly available, has informed Mayo Clinic practice leadership at all sites across the United States and has been shared with Minnesota governmental leadership to help inform critical decisions during the past year. One key to the accuracy of the Mayo Clinic model is its ability to adapt to the constantly changing dynamics of the pandemic and uncertainties of human behavior, such as changes in the rate of contact among the population over time and by geographic location and now new virus variants. The Mayo Clinic model can also be used to forecast COVID-19 trends in different hypothetical worlds in which no vaccine is available, vaccinations are no longer being accepted from this point forward, and 75% of the population is already vaccinated. Surveys indicate that half of American adults are hesitant to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and lack of understanding of the benefits of vaccination is an important barrier to use. The focus of this paper is to illustrate the stark contrast between these 3 scenarios and to demonstrate, mathematically, the benefit of high vaccine uptake on the future course of the pandemic.","Storlie, Curtis B; Pollock, Benjamin D; Rojas, Ricardo L; Demuth, Gabriel O; Johnson, Patrick W; Wilson, Patrick M; Heinzen, Ethan P; Liu, Hongfang; Carter, Rickey E; Habermann, Elizabeth B; Kor, Daryl J; Neville, Matthew R; Limper, Andrew H; Noe, Katherine H; Bydon, Mohamad; Franco, Pablo Moreno; Sampathkumar, Priya; Shah, Nilay D; Dunlay, Shannon M; Dowdy, Sean C",Mayo Clin Proc,,132

BACKGROUND: Concern exists that mild coronavirus disease 2019 may cause myocardial and vascular disease. METHODS: Participants were recruited from COVIDsortium, a 3-hospital prospective study of 731 health care workers who underwent first-wave weekly symptom, polymerase chain reaction, and serology assessment over 4 months, with seroconversion in 21.5% (n = 157). At 6 months post-infection, 74 seropositive and 75 age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched seronegative control subjects were recruited for cardiovascular phenotyping (comprehensive phantom-calibrated cardiovascular magnetic resonance and blood biomarkers). Analysis was blinded, using objective artificial intelligence analytics where available. RESULTS: A total of 149 subjects (mean age 37 years, range 18 to 63 years, 58% women) were recruited. Seropositive infections had been mild with case definition, noncase definition, and asymptomatic disease in 45 (61%), 18 (24%), and 11 (15%), respectively, with 1 person hospitalized (for 2 days). Between seropositive and seronegative groups, there were no differences in cardiac structure (left ventricular volumes, mass, atrial area), function (ejection fraction, global longitudinal shortening, aortic distensibility), tissue characterization (T1, T2, extracellular volume fraction mapping, late gadolinium enhancement) or biomarkers (troponin, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide). With abnormal defined by the 75 seronegatives (2 SDs from mean, e.g., ejection fraction <54%, septal T1 >1,072 ms, septal T2 >52.4 ms), individuals had abnormalities including reduced ejection fraction (n = 2, minimum 50%), T1 elevation (n = 6), T2 elevation (n = 9), late gadolinium enhancement (n = 13, median 1%, max 5% of myocardium), biomarker elevation (borderline troponin elevation in 4; all N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide normal). These were distributed equally between seropositive and seronegative individuals.

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical information from 1968 patients admitted to a hospital. We built a predictive score based on a logistic regression model in which explicative variables were discretized using classification trees that facilitated the identification of the optimal sections in order to predict inpatient mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19. These sections were translated into a score indicating the probability of a patient's death, thus making the results easy to interpret. RESULTS: Median age was 67 years, 1104 patients (56.4%) were male, and 325 (16.5%) died during hospitalization. Our final model identified nine key features: age, oxygen saturation, smoking, serum creatinine, lymphocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, C-reactive protein, and sodium at admission. The discrimination of the model was excellent in the training, validation, and test samples (AUC: 0.865, 0.808, and 0.883, respectively).

In Experiment 1,765 calved multiparous Nellore cows were subjected to the same fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) protocol and rebred. Ultrasound pregnancy diagnosis was performed 30 and 90 days post-FTAI (DPI). Rates of pregnancy and pregnancy loss were determined for three periods: from 30 to 90 DPI, from 30 DPI to calving, and from 90 DPI to calving. The cows were assigned to three groups with different vaccination protocols - namely, Group VACMULT (n=250): vaccine against bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and leptospirosis; Group VACL (n=245): vaccine against leptospirosis alone; Group NOVAC (n=270): no vaccination. Serum antibody titers for BoHV-1, BVDV, and leptospirosis, measured in 57 cows from each group indicated active infection, suggesting circulation of these pathogens in the herd. No differences in pregnancy rates were observed across groups. Pregnancy loss rates did not differ significantly across groups within any of the periods investigated (30 to 90 DPI, 30 DPI to calving, or 90 DPI to calving). In Experiment 2, two vaccination protocols for each vaccine were investigated. Group VACGEST was vaccinated on day zero of FTAI (D0) and again 30 days post-FTAI (30 DPI). Group VACPREV was vaccinated on D0 and again on the day of insemination (D11). No significant difference was observed between groups, or significant gestational loss in the group that received the second vaccine on the day of insemination. The results revealed that neither vaccine interfered with the reproductive performance of multiparous cows. No differences were observed between vaccination carried out on both D0 and D11 and that performed on both D0 and D30... (AU)","Ferreira, Luiz C.

357342,An unresponsive COVID-19 patient,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This paper describes a methodology for gathering requirements and early design of remote monitoring technology (RMT) for enhancing patient safety during pandemics using virtual care technologies. As pandemics such as COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) progress there is an increasing need for effective virtual care and RMT to support patient care while they are at home. METHODS: The authors describe their work in conducting literature reviews by searching PubMed.gov and the grey literature for articles, and government websites with guidelines describing the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the progression of the disease. The reviews focused on identifying gaps where RMT could be applied in novel ways and formed the basis for the subsequent modelling of use cases for applying RMT described in this paper. RESULTS: The work was conducted in the context of a new Home of the Future laboratory which has been set up at the University of Victoria. The literature review led to the development of a number of object-oriented models for deploying RMT. This modeling is being used for a number of purposes, including for education of students in health infomatics as well as testing of new use cases for RMT with industrial collaborators and projects within the smart home of the future laboratory. CONCLUSIONS: Object-oriented modeling, based on analysis of gaps in the literature, was found to be a useful approach for describing, communicating and teaching about potential new uses of RMT.","Borycki, Elizabeth M; Kushniruk, Andre W; Kletke, Ryan; Vimarlund, Vivian; Senathirajah, Yalini; Quintana, Yuri",Yearb. med. inform.

359054,COVID-19 and arterial thrombosis: A potentially fatal combination,2021,"Defective IFN production and exacerbated inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses are hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19. Based on these hallmarks, and considering the pivotal role of macrophages in COVID-19 pathogenesis, we hypothesize that the transcription factors MAFB and MAF critically contribute to COVID-19 progression by shaping the response of macrophages to SARS-CoV-2. Our proposal stems from the recent identification of pathogenic lung macrophage subsets in severe COVID-19, and takes into consideration the previously reported ability of MAFB to dampen IFN type I production, as well as the critical role of MAFB and MAF in the acquisition and maintenance of the transcriptional signature of M-CSF-conditioned human macrophages. Solid evidences are presented that link overexpression of MAFB and silencing of MAF expression with clinical and biological features of severe COVID-19. As a whole, we propose that a high MAFB/MAF expression ratio in lung macrophages could serve as an accurate diagnostic tool for COVID-19 progression. Indeed, reversing the macrophage MAFB/MAF expression ratio might impair the exacerbated inflammatory and profibrotic responses, and restore the defective IFN type I production, thus becoming a potential strategy to limit severity of COVID-19.","Vega, Miguel A; Simón-Fuentes, Miriam; González de la Aleja, Arturo; Nieto, Concha; Colmenares, María; Herrero, Cristina; Domínguez-Soto, Ángeles; Corbí, Ángel L",Front Immunol,,132

However, response to therapy is variable, and biomarkers that can guide treatment selection and response evaluation are lacking. Circulating RNAs are a promising source of biomarkers. We explored messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers in liquid biopsies of patients with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide. METHODS: Forty patients were included in this prospective multicenter observational study. Whole blood was drawn at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after start of therapy. Four mRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 5 lncRNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR. RNA levels in 30 healthy individuals were used as controls. RNA expression data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, and the primary end point was progression-free survival. Clinical factors were included in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Levels of 2 miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-3687, and 1 lncRNA, N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase like 2 antisense RNA 2 (NAALADL2-AS2), were more than 2-fold higher in patients with mCRPC compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with higher levels of miR-375 or miR-3687 showed a shorter time to progression. Patients with higher levels of NAALADL2-AS2 showed a longer time to progression. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, higher miR-375, miR-3687 and serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations were shown to be independent predictors for shorter time to progression. CONCLUSIONS: We identified miR-3687 as a novel prognostic marker for response in patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide, and we confirmed the prognostic value of miR-375.","Benoist, Guillemette E; van Oort, Inge M; Boerrigter, Emmy; Verhaegh, Gerald W; van Hooij, Onno; Groen, Levi; Smit, Frank; de Mol, Pieter; Hamberg, Paul; Dezentjé, Vincent O; Mehra, Niven; Gerritsen, Winald; Somford, Diederik M; van Erp, Nielka P H; Schalken, Jack A",Clin. chem,,132

METHODS: From March 4th to April 9th 2020, during the peak of the Italian COVID-19 epidemic, we enrolled a series of 773 patients that performed both non-contrast chest CT and RT-PCR with a time interval no longer than a week due to suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diagnostic performance of CT was evaluated according to sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy, considering RT-PCR as the reference standard. An analysis on the patients with discrepant CT scan and RT-PCR result and on the patient with both negative tests was performed. RESULTS: RT-PCR testing showed an overall positive rate of 59.8 %. CT sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy for SARS-CoV-2 infection were 90.7 % [95 % IC, 87.7%-93.2%], 78.8 % [95 % IC, 73.8-83.2%], 86.4 % [95 % IC, 76.1 %-88.9 %], 85.1 % [95 % IC, 81.0 %-88.4] and 85.9 % [95 % IC 83.2-88.3%], respectively. Twenty-five/66 (37.6 %) patients with positive CT and negative RT-PCR results and 12/245 (4.9 %) patients with both negative tests were nevertheless judged as positive cases by the clinicians based on clinical and epidemiological criteria and consequently treated. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, in a context of high pre-test probability, CT scan shows good sensitivity and a consistently higher specificity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia than what reported by previous studies, especially when clinical and epidemiological features are taken into account.","Falaschi, Zeno; Danna, Pietro S C; Arioli, Roberto; Pasché, Alessio; Zagaria, Domenico; Percivale, Ilaria; Tricca, Stefano; Barini, Michela; Aquilini, Ferruccio; Andreoni, Stefano; Carriero, Alessandro",Eur J Radiol,,132

While there are complex models to inform both potential health and macro-economic impact, there are few tools available to rapidly assess potential equity impacts of interventions. METHODS: We created an economic model to simulate the impact of lockdown measures in Pakistan, Georgia, Chile, UK, the Philippines and South Africa. We consider impact of lockdown in terms of ability to socially distance, and income loss during lockdown, and tested the impact of assumptions on social protection coverage in a scenario analysis. RESULTS: In all examined countries, socioeconomic status (SES) quintiles 1-3 were disproportionately more likely to experience income loss (70% of people) and inability to socially distance (68% of people) than higher SES quintiles. Improving social protection increased the percentage of the workforce able to socially distance from 48% (33%-60%) to 66% (44%-71%). We estimate the cost of this social protection would be equivalent to an average of 0.6% gross domestic product (0.1% Pakistan-1.1% Chile).

This capacity rests upon abstract verbal reference: the appreciation that words are linked to mental representations that can be established, retrieved and modified, even when the entities to which a word refers is perceptually unavailable. Although establishing verbal reference is a pivotal achievement, questions concerning its developmental origins remain. To address this gap, we investigate infants' ability to establish a representation of an object, hidden from view, from language input alone. In two experiments, 15-month-olds (N = 72) and 12-month-olds (N = 72) watch as an actor names three familiar, visible objects; she then provides a novel name for a fourth, hidden fully from infants' view. In the Semantic Priming condition, the visible familiar objects all belong to the same semantic neighborhood (e.g., apple, banana, orange). In the No Priming condition, the objects are drawn from different semantic neighborhoods (e.g., apple, shoe, car). At test infants view two objects. If infants can use the naming information alone to identify the likely referent, then infants in the Semantic Priming, but not in the No Priming condition, will successfully infer the referent of the fourth (hidden) object. Brief summary of results here. Implications for the development of abstract verbal reference will be discussed.","Luchkina, Elena; Waxman, Sandra R",PLoS One,,132

METHODS: A cross-sectional study among urological HCWs was performed. HCWs were surveyed for anxiety about the pandemic, stress level and current workload, fear of coronavirus infection, current perception of safety at work, and attitude towards protective equipment and tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Sixty-three HCWs filled in the questionnaire. Overall anxiety of infection with CO-VID-19 is at a median of 4.7 with no statistically significant difference between nurses and physicians (p = 0.0749). Safety at work reaches a median of 6 out of 10. In fact, the highest fear in 56.7% (31/63) of the personnel is to get infected by a colleague tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing surgical face masks. A proportion of 55.7 and 74.6% highly favor swabs for SARS-CoV-2 on a regular basis in HCWs and patients, respectively (p = 0.0001). Workload in the urology department is clearly reduced during the pandemic (physicians 39.3% vs. nurses 32.2%, p = 0.0001) and 57.4% do not feel distress at all; only 27.9% express mental distress. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, urology HCWs perceive lower burden by workload and deem themselves at low risk of infection.

The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, common misconceptions, barriers, and the compliance of the community with the use of face masks for the prevention of COVID-19. A validated questionnaire was administered to the participants through a web link by using various social media. The collected data were statistically analyzed for significant differences according to demographic variables. The average knowledge of face masks and their role in preventing COVID-19 transmission was 95.64%, with no differences among most of the demographical factors. Older groups and females demonstrated a better attitude towards wearing face masks than other groups did (p<0.001). Another significant difference in the participant's attitude was noticed between the various educational levels, employment, and nationality (p<0.001). Of the total respondents, 88.2% encouraged wearing face masks. Misconceptions about wearing face masks were very low. The frequency of wearing face masks at public places, workplaces, or social gatherings was 87.2%, 80.5%, and 47.5% respectively. There was a significant variation in the compliance with wearing face masks between the various groups based on age, gender, nationality, and employment status (p<0.001). The inconvenience in wearing face masks was reported by 36.3%. Face irritation and ear pain were reported by 70.2% and 43.5%, respectively. The inconvenience of wearing face masks with eyeglasses was reported by 44.3% of those wearing eyeglasses. In general, the study demonstrated a good attitude among participants towards wearing face masks. Although the respondents in the study were aware of the benefits of wearing face masks, the barriers may have decreased their desire to do so. These barriers include difficulty in breathing, discomfort, face irritation, and ear pain.","Al Naam, Yaser A; Elsafi, Salah H; Alkharraz, Zeyad S; Alfahad, Othman A; Al-Jubran, Khalid M; Al Zahrani, Eidan M",PLoS One,,132
368537,Prolonged QT predicts prognosis in COVID-19,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 originated from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread to other areas worldwide. Since then, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached pandemic proportions with >570 000 deaths globally by mid-July 2020. The magnitude of the outbreak and the potentially severe clinical course of COVID-19 has led to a burst of scientific research on this novel coronavirus and its host receptor ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme)-2. ACE2 is a homolog of the ACE that acts on several substrates in the renin-Ang (angiotensin) system. With unprecedented speed, scientific research has solved the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and imaged its binding with the ACE2 receptor. In SARS-CoV-2 infection, the viral S (spike) protein receptor-binding domain binds to ACE2 to enter the host cell. ACE2 expression in the lungs is relatively low, but it is present in type II pneumocytes-a cell type also endowed with TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease serine 2). This protease is critical for priming the SARS-CoV-2 S protein to complex with ACE2 and enter the cells. Herein, we review the current understanding of the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 with ACE2 as it has rapidly unfolded over the last months. While it should not be assumed that we have a complete picture of SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of infection and its interaction with ACE2, much has been learned with clear therapeutic implications. Potential therapies aimed at intercepting SARS-CoV-2 from reaching the full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor using soluble ACE2 protein and other potential approaches are briefly discussed as well.","Davidson, Anne M; Wysocki, Jan; Batlle, Daniel",Hypertension,,132

This virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although much effort has been spent on clarifying the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2, but, very little evidence is available regarding the relationship between human body fluids and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considerable evidence from hospital in Wuhan indicates that strict rules to avoid occupational exposure to patients' body fluids in healthcare settings, particularly among every medical staff, limited person-to-person transmission of nosocomial infections by direct or indirect contact. Conclusion: We tried to provide important information for understanding the possible transmission routes of SARS-CoV-2 via body fluids including bronchoalveolar-lavage, saliva, blood, urine, feces, sputum, tears, and semen in order to control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurrences.","Mohseni, Amir Hossein; Taghinezhad-S, Sedigheh; Xu, Zhigang; Fu, Xiangsheng",Chin.

375403,"Comment on Bendavid E, Oh Ch, Battacharya J, Ioannidis JPA Assessing mandatory stay-at-home and business closure effects on the spread of COVID-19",2021,"BACKGROUND: Exposure of respiratory therapists (RTs) during aerosol-generating procedures such as endotracheal intubation is an occupational hazard. Depending on the hospital, RTs may serve as laryngoscopist or in a role providing ventilation support and initiating mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to evaluate the potential exposure of RTs serving in either of these roles. METHODS: We set up a simulated patient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in an ICU setting requiring endotracheal intubation involving a laryngoscopist, a nurse, and an RT supporting the laryngoscopist. All participants wore appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). A fluorescent marker was sprayed by an atomizer during the procedure using 3 different methods for endotracheal intubation. The 3 techniques included PPE alone, a polycarbonate intubating box, or a coronavirus flexible enclosure, which consisted of a Mayo stand with plastic covering. The laryngoscopist and the supporting RT were assessed with a black light for contamination with the fluorescent marker. All simulations were recorded. RESULTS: When using only PPE, both the laryngoscopist and the RT were grossly contaminated. When using the intubating box, the laryngoscopist's contamination was detectable only on the gloves: the gown and face shield remained uncontaminated; the RT was still grossly contaminated on the gloves, gown, neck, and face shield. When using the coronavirus flexible enclosure system, both the laryngoscopist and the RT were better protected, with contamination detected only on the gloves of the laryngoscopist and the RT. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 3 techniques, the coronavirus flexible enclosure contained the fluorescent marker more effectively during endotracheal intubation than PPE alone or the intubating box based on exposure of the laryngoscopist and supporting RT. Optimizing containment during aerosol-generating procedures like endotracheal intubation is a critical component of minimizing occupational and nosocomial spread of SARS-CoV-2 to RTs who may serve as either the laryngoscopist or a support role.","Smith, Cameron R; Gravenstein, Nikolaus; LeMaster, Thomas E; Borde, Ceri M; Fahy, Brenda G",Respir Care,,132

Early and fast detection of COVID-19 from infected individuals is critical to limit its spreading. Here, we report an innovative approach to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleocapsid (N) protein by combining DNA/RNA oligomers as aptamers and a graphene oxide (GO) coated optical microfiber as a sensor system. The DNA/RNA aptamers can effectively capture the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in vitro, with the GO coated optical microfiber aptasensor for real-time monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein. Due to the extremely high surface-to-volume ratio and excellent optical and biochemical properties of the GO surface layer, the fixing effect of the microfiber surface is significantly improved and the lowest limit of detection (LOD) is 6.25 × 10-19 M. Furthermore, in order to prove the feasibility of this sensing method in clinical applications, we use this sensor to detect the N protein mixed in fetal bovine serum (FBS) samples. The experimental results show that the biosensor can quickly and effectively detect the N protein (1 × 10-9 M) in a complex sample matrix within 3 minutes. These findings suggest that this approach can be utilized for quantitative monitoring of coronavirus particles due to its high sensitivity, which can help to quickly exclude patients who do not have the infection. Collectively, the optical microfiber sensor system could be expected to become an important platform for the diagnosis of coronavirus due to its simple detection scheme and easy miniaturization.","Jia, Hao; Zhang, Ao; Yang, Yuquan; Cui, Yaqi; Xu, Jianrong; Jiang, Hewei; Tao, Shengce; Zhang, Dawei; Zeng, Heping; Hou, Zhaoyuan; Feng, Jijun",Lab chip (Online),,132

376065,Reply: What Happened to Electrocardiogram as a Screening Test to Recognize Cardiovascular Complications in COVID-19 Patients?,2020,"Before the 20th century many deaths in England, and most likely a majority, were caused by infectious diseases. The focus here is on the biggest killers, plague, typhus, smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, typhoid, dysentery, childhood infections, pneumonia, and influenza. Many other infectious diseases including puerperal fever, relapsing fever, malaria, syphilis, meningitis, tetanus and gangrene caused thousands of deaths. This review of preventive measures, public health interventions and changes in behavior that reduced the risk of severe infections puts the response to recent epidemic challenges in historical perspective. Two new respiratory viruses have recently caused pandemics: an H1N1 influenza virus genetically related to pig viruses, and a bat-derived coronavirus causing COVID-19. Studies of infectious diseases emerging in human populations in recent decades indicate that the majority were zoonotic, and many of the causal pathogens had a wildlife origin. As hunter-gatherers, humans contracted pathogens from other species, and then from domesticated animals and rodents when they began to live in settled communities based on agriculture. In the modern world of large inter-connected urban populations and rapid transport, the risk of global transmission of new infectious diseases is high. Past and recent experience indicates that surveillance, prevention and control of infectious diseases are critical for global health. Effective interventions are required to control activities that risk dangerous pathogens transferring to humans from wild animals and those reared for food.","Mercer, Alexander",Pathog Glob Health,,132

An observational study examining current published literature including three new unpublished cases,2020,"A cursory inquest into the effects of SARS-CoV-2 exposes how easily the ramification of the pandemic has moved over from the physio-social to the psychosocial state of humans all over the world. Derogatory nomenclatures such as ‘Chinese-virus’ or ‘Corona-jihad’ can be seen as a part of a disjunctive politics of ‘representation’ as opposed to ‘representing’ with a metonymic effect. Such politics violates the protocol on naming new human infectious diseases set by World Health Organization. It also insinuates a long-term socio-political impression on the mental state of an individual or a social group, which may have an emasculating effect on the global solidarity to fight the virus. This calls for a nuanced psychosocial investigation with a specific analysis of how the ensuing stigmatization and fear can aggravate the contagion. With specific reference to the Indian sub-continent, this paper explains the socio-political orientation behind the essentialisation of a religious group that has led to the indictment of the minority community. By using Wagner’s theory of essentialisation and Critical Race Theory, this article shall endeavor to explore how media may play a crucial role in stigmatizing communities. Secondly, the paper also argues that the spiraling effect of such ostracisation leads to stigma and fear within the group which is not only dehumanizing but also detrimental to the concerted effort to contain the pandemic.","Biswas, Debajyoti Chatterjee Sanjukta Sultana Parvin",Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Communications,,132
377353,[Interferon gamma in the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19],2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic has reached direct and indirect medical and social consequences with a subset of patients who rapidly worsen and die from severe-critical manifestations. As a result, there is still an urgent need to identify prognostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic approaches. Severe-critical manifestations of COVID-19 are caused by a dysregulated immune response. Immune checkpoint molecules such as Programmed death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) play an important role in regulating the host immune response and several lines of evidence underly the role of PD-1 modulation in COVID-19. Here, by analyzing blood sample collection from both hospitalized COVID-19 patients and healthy donors, as well as levels of PD-L1 RNA expression in a variety of model systems of SARS-CoV-2, including in vitro tissue cultures, ex-vivo infections of primary epithelial cells and biological samples obtained from tissue biopsies and blood sample collection of COVID-19 and healthy individuals, we demonstrate that serum levels of PD-L1 have a prognostic role in COVID-19 patients and that PD-L1 dysregulation is associated to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Specifically, PD-L1 upregulation is induced by SARS-CoV-2 in infected epithelial cells and is dysregulated in several types of immune cells of COVID-19 patients including monocytes, neutrophils, gamma delta T cells and CD4+ T cells. These results have clinical significance since highlighted the potential role of PD-1/PD-L1 axis in COVID-19, suggest a prognostic role of PD-L1 and provide a further rationale to implement novel clinical studies in COVID-19 patients with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.","Sabbatino, Francesco; Conti, Valeria; Franci, Gianluigi; Sellitto, Carmine; Manzo, Valentina; Pagliano, Pasquale; De Bellis, Emanuela; Masullo, Alfonso; Salzano, Francesco Antonio; Caputo, Alessandro; Peluso, Ilaria; Zeppa, Pio; Scognamiglio, Giosuè; Greco, Giuseppe; Zannella, Carla; Ciccarelli, Michele; Cicala, Claudia; Vecchione, Carmine; Filippelli, Amelia; Pepe, Stefano",Front Immunol,,132

379746,Estimation of the onset rate and the number of asymptomatic patients of COVID-19 from the proportion of untraceable patients,2021,"Falls are one of the leading causes of permanent injury and/or disability among the elderly. When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system's feasibility.","Luna-Perejón, Francisco; Muñoz-Saavedra, Luis; Civit-Masot, Javier; Civit, Anton; Domínguez-Morales, Manuel",Sensors (Basel),,132
379990,Impact of COVID-19 on the Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative Arterial Procedure Registry,2021,"This study aimed to investigate the perceived work stress and its influencing factors among hospital staff during the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Taiwan. A web-based survey was conducted at one medical center and two regional hospitals in southern Taiwan, targeting physicians, nurses, medical examiners, and administrators. The questionnaire included items on the demographic characteristics of hospital staff and a scale to assess stress among healthcare workers caring for patients with a highly infectious disease. A total of 752 valid questionnaires were collected. The hospital staff reported a moderate level of stress and nurses had a highest level of stress compared to staff in the other three occupational categories. The five highest stress scores were observed for the items ""rough and cracked hands due to frequent hand washing and disinfectant use,"" ""inconvenience in using the toilet at work,"" ""restrictions on eating and drinking at work,"" ""fear of transmitting the disease to relatives and friends,"" and ""fear of being infected with COVID-19."" Discomfort caused by protective equipment was the major stressor for the participants, followed by burden of caring for patients. Among participants who experienced severe stress (n = 129), work stress was higher among those with rather than without minor children. The present findings may serve as a reference for future monitoring of hospital staff's workload, and may aid the provision of support and interventions.","Kuo, Fang-Li; Yang, Pei-Hsuan; Hsu, Hsin-Tien; Su, Che-Yu; Chen, Chun-Hsien; Yeh, I-Jeng; Wu, Yen-Hung; Chen, Li-Chin",Kaohsiung J Med Sci,,132
380305,Hydroxychloroquine use in the COVID-19 patient,2020,"A COVID-19 outbreak emerged in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and developed into a global pandemic during March 2020. The effects of temperature on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in China are unknown. Data on COVID-19 daily confirmed cases and daily mean temperatures were collected from 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China between Jan. 20 and Feb. 29, 2020. Locally weighted regression and smoothing scatterplot (LOESS), distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs), and random-effects meta-analysis were used to examine the relationship between daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 and temperature conditions. The daily number of new cases peaked on Feb. 12, and then decreased. The daily confirmed cases rate of COVID-19 had a biphasic relationship with temperature (with a peak at 10 °C), and the daily incidence of COVID-19 decreased at values below and above these values. The overall epidemic intensity of COVID-19 reduced slightly following days with higher temperatures with a relative risk (RR) was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). A random-effect meta-analysis including 28 provinces in mainland China, we confirmed the statistically significant association between temperature and RR during the study period (Coefficient = -0.0100, 95% CI: -0.0125, -0.0074). The DLNMs in Hubei Province (outside of Wuhan) and Wuhan showed similar patterns of temperature. Additionally, a modified susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (M-SEIR) model, with adjustment for climatic factors, was used to provide a complete characterization of the impact of climate on the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Shi, Peng; Dong, Yinqiao; Yan, Huanchang; Zhao, Chenkai; Li, Xiaoyang; Liu, Wei; He, Miao; Tang, Shixing; Xi, Shuhua",Sci Total Environ,,132
380368,Assessment of Small Pulmonary Blood Vessels in COVID-19 Patients Using HRCT,2020,"Physical activity would bring in plenty of health benefits, especially recreational physical activity (RPA). Previous studies have suggested that built environment would affect older people's recreational walking (RW) and RPA, but how the effects exist in a small-scale Chinese city remains unclear. Two hundred and fifty-two older participants were recruited in the city of Yiwu using cross-sectional survey of random samples in 2019. RW and RPA level of participants and perceived scores of built environments were collected using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and Neighborhood Environment Walkability Scale, respectively. Linear regression analysis was conducted to investigate the association of built environment with older people's RW and RPA. The results showed that two main factors affecting older people's RW and RPA were residential density and aesthetics. Additionally, access to services was related to RW, and street connectivity was correlated with RPA. The associations of RW with built environment varied slightly with demographic variables included in the regression model. All the results suggested that lower residential density, better aesthetics environment, and higher street connectivity would motivate older people to engage more in RW and RPA. The better access to services encourages only RW, not RPA, in older people. These findings would be helpful for policy decision makers in the urban construction process in Yiwu. More studies are needed to enlarge the scientific evidence base about small-scale cities in China.","Yu, Jiabin; Yang, Chen; Zhao, Xiaoguang; Zhou, Zhexiao; Zhang, Shen; Zhai, Diankai; Li, Jianshe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,132

380915,Cardiac surgery in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection: Early experience,2020,"ABSTRACT: There are conflicting data regarding the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 hospitalized patients. The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of HCQ in increasing SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance.Hospitalized adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were retrospectively included in the study. The primary outcome was the time from a confirmed positive nasopharyngeal swab to turn negative. A negative nasopharyngeal swab conversion was defined as a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 case followed by 2 negative results using RT-PCR assay with samples obtained 24âhours apart. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to adjust for potential confounders.Thirty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients completed the study. Nineteen (55.9%) patients presented with symptoms, and 14 (41.2%) had pneumonia. Only 21 (61.8%) patients received HCQ. The time to SARS-CoV-2 negativity nasopharyngeal test was significantly longer in patients who received HCQ than those who did not receive HCQ [17 (13-21) vs 10 (4-13) days, Pâ=â.023]. HCQ was independently associated with time to negativity test after adjustment for potential confounders (symptoms, comorbidities, antiviral drugs, pneumonia, or oxygen therapy) in multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (hazard ratioâ=â0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.13-0.9, Pâ=â.024). On day 14, 47.8% (14/23) patients tested negative in the HCQ group compared with 90.9% (10/11) patients who did not receive HCQ (Pâ=â.016).HCQ was associated with a slower viral clearance in COVID-19 patients with mild to moderate disease. Data from ongoing randomized clinical trials with HCQ should provide a definitive answer regarding the efficacy and safety of this treatment.","Mallat, Jihad; Hamed, Fadi; Balkis, Maher; Mohamed, Mohamed A; Mooty, Mohamad; Malik, Asim; Nusair, Ahmad; Bonilla, Maria-Fernanda",Medicine (Baltimore),,132

383069,Age Related Morbidity and Mortality among Patients with COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: The operational and financial impact of the widespread coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) curtailment of imaging services on radiology practices is unknown. We aimed to characterize recent COVID-19-related community practice noninvasive diagnostic imaging professional work declines. METHODS: Using imaging metadata from nine community radiology practices across the United States between January 2019 and May 2020, we mapped work relative value unit (wRVU)-weighted stand-alone noninvasive diagnostic imaging service codes to both modality and body region. Weekly 2020 versus 2019 wRVU changes were analyzed by modality, body region, and site of service. Practice share &#967;2 testing was performed. RESULTS: Aggregate weekly wRVUs ranged from a high of 120,450 (February 2020) to a low of 55,188 (April 2020). During that -52% wRVU nadir, outpatient declines were greatest (-66%). All practices followed similar aggregate trends in the distribution of wRVUs between each 2020 versus 2019 week (P = .96-.98). As a percentage of total all-practice wRVUs, declines in CT (20,046 of 63,992; 31%) and radiography and fluoroscopy (19,196; 30%) were greatest. By body region, declines in abdomen and pelvis (16,203; 25%) and breast (12,032; 19%) imaging were greatest. Mammography (-17%) and abdominal and pelvic CT (-14%) accounted for the largest shares of total all-practice wRVU reductions. Across modality-region groups, declines were far greatest for mammography (-92%). CONCLUSIONS: Substantial COVID-19-related diagnostic imaging work declines were similar across community practices and disproportionately impacted mammography. Decline patterns could facilitate pandemic second wave planning. Overall implications for practice workflows, practice finances, patient access, and payment policy are manifold.","Duszak, Richard; Maze, Jeff; Sessa, Candice; Fleishon, Howard B; Golding, Lauren P; Nicola, Gregory N; Hughes, Danny R",J Am Coll Radiol,,132
383128,"Absence of COVID-19 Infection in Patients Accessing IBD Unit at Humanitas, Milan: Implications for Postlockdown Measures",2020,"AIM: Patients with acute infectious diseases are at an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Clinicians should be aware of the VTE risk in patients with COVID-19, many of whom present with severe coagulation disorders. METHOD: We used an online platform to conduct a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among doctors in mainland China in March 2020. The questionnaire was designed to figure out the clinician's current awareness of VTE prevention and detection rates, as well as the current status of VTE prophylaxis in patients with COVID-19. RESULTS: We collected 1,636 replies, of which 1,579 were valid. Among these, 991 (63%) clinicians were involved directly in frontline treatment. Most of the clinicians (1,492, or 94%) thought it was necessary to assess the VTE risk in patients with COVID-19. However, only 234 (24%) clinicians performed appropriate assessment during the COVID-19 outbreak. For patients with mild/moderate COVID-19, 752 (76%) clinicians would prescribe exercise and water to prevent VTE. For patients with severe COVID-19, 448 (45%) clinicians would prescribe mechanical devices if the patient had a high bleeding risk, and 648 (65%) clinicians would choose LMWH as prophylaxis if the patient had a low bleeding risk. The VTE detection rate was not that high in both mild/moderate and severe patients. CONCLUSION: Although most clinicians recommended prescribing VTE prophylaxis to patients with COVID-19, the practice still needs to be improved. A real-world registry to investigate the true incidence of VTE, and the effect of prescribing appropriate prophylaxis for patients with COVID-19, is necessary in the future.","Zhang, Zhu; Xi, Linfeng; Zhang, Shuai; Zhang, Yunxia; Pang, Wenyi; Wang, Yimin; Li, Chenghong; Zhai, Zhenguo; Wang, Chen",J Atheroscler Thromb,,132

We compared characteristics and severe outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States between early and later in the pandemic categorized by groups at higher risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study of sampled patients aged &#8805;18 years who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and admitted to one of 14 academic hospitals in the United States during March-June and October-December 2020. Demographic and clinical information were gathered from electronic health record data. RESULTS: Among 647 patients, 91% met &#8805;1 of the following risk factors for severe COVID-19 [91% March-June (nâ =â 434); 90% October-December (nâ =â 213)]; 19% were LTCF residents, 45% were aged &#8805;65-years, and 84% had &#8805;1 high-risk condition. The proportion of patients who resided in a LTCF declined significantly (25% vs 6%) from early to later pandemic periods. Compared with patients at lower risk for severe COVID-19, in-hospital mortality was higher among patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 (20% vs 7%); these differences were consistently observed between March-June and October-December. CONCLUSIONS: Most adults hospitalized with COVID-19 were those recommended to be prioritized for vaccination based on risk for developing severe COVID-19. These findings highlight the continued urgency to vaccinate patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 and monitor vaccination impact on hospitalizations and outcomes.","Sami, Samira; Tenforde, Mark W; Talbot, H Keipp; Lindsell, Christopher J; Steingrub, Jay S; Shapiro, Nathan I; Ginde, Adit A; Douin, David J; Prekker, Matthew E; Erickson, Heidi L; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Gong, Michelle N; Khan, Akram; Exline, Matthew C; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Rice, Todd W; Casey, Jonathan D; Grijalva, Carlos G; Stubblefield, William B; Womack, Kelsey N; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Chang, Steven Y; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Self, Wesley H; Patel, Manish M",Clin Infect Dis,,132

This study examines changes in smell sensitivity in COVID-19–positive (COVID+) and COVID-19–negative (COVID–) viral illness during the initial weeks after infection. Study Design: Cross-sectional cohort comparison. Setting: National anonymous surveys. Methods: Survey participants were queried about smell sensitivity and general health status at the time of COVID-19 testing and in the weeks that followed. Results: In total, 375 (174 COVID+, 201 COVID–) participants completed the survey and 132 (62 COVID+, 70 COVID–) participants completed the 2-week follow-up survey. Normal smell in the COVID+ cohort was less frequent at the time of testing and at follow up (P &lt;.05). Dynamic changes in smell sensitivity in the COVID+ cohort were more frequent in the initial weeks (P &lt;.001). In those with normosmia at the start of infection, 38% of the COVID+ cohort reported worsening smell compared to only 8% in the COVID– cohort (P &lt;.05). Recovery of overall health was associated with normosmia at the time of infection and improvement of smell sensitivity within weeks of infection. Conclusion: The COVID+ cohort showed greater dynamic change in smell sensitivity and a higher rate of persistent olfactory dysfunction in the weeks after infection. Normal smell at the time of COVID-19 infection may still worsen before recovery. Overall health recovery after viral illness is associated with improvement in smell sensitivity and the absence of initial anosmia or hyposmia. © The Authors 2020.","Loftus, P. A.; Roland, L.

Herein, the potential mechanisms of occurrence and development of COVID-19-related psychological problems and mental disorders have been discussed from two angles: the pandemic as a public health emergency itself and the extensive quarantine situation during the pandemic.","Shaw, Alfred",Adv Exp Med Biol,,132
386474,In Reply: May Cooler Heads Prevail During a Pandemic: Stroke in COVID-19 Patients or COVID-19 in Stroke Patients?,2020,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects intestinal cells, and might affect the intestinal microbiota. We investigated changes in the fecal fungal microbiomes (mycobiome) of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization and on recovery. METHODS: We performed deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of fecal samples from 30 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hong Kong, from February 5 through May 12, 2020. Fecal samples were collected 2 to 3 times per week from time of hospitalization until discharge. We compared fecal mycobiome compositions of patients with COVID-19 with those from 9 subjects with community-acquired pneumonia and 30 healthy individuals (controls). We assessed fecal mycobiome profiles throughout time of hospitalization until clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 had significant alterations in their fecal mycobiomes compared with controls, characterized by enrichment of Candia albicans and a highly heterogeneous mycobiome configuration, at time of hospitalization. Although fecal mycobiomes of 22 patients with COVID-19 did not differ significantly from those of controls during times of hospitalization, 8 of 30 patients with COVID-19 had continued significant differences in fecal mycobiome composition, through the last sample collected. The diversity of the fecal mycobiome of the last sample collected from patients with COVID-19 was 2.5-fold higher than that of controls (P < .05). Samples collected at all timepoints from patients with COVID-19 had increased proportions of opportunistic fungal pathogens, Candida albicans, Candida auris, and Aspergillus flavus compared with controls. Two respiratory-associated fungal pathogens, A. flavus and Aspergillus niger, were detected in fecal samples from a subset of patients with COVID-19, even after clearance of SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples and resolution of respiratory symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In a pilot study, we found heterogeneous configurations of the fecal mycobiome, with enrichment of fungal pathogens from the genera Candida and Aspergillus, during hospitalization of 30 patients with COVID-19 compared with controls. Unstable gut mycobiomes and prolonged dysbiosis persisted in a subset of patients with COVID-19 up to 12 days after nasopharyngeal clearance of SARS-CoV-2. Studies are needed to determine whether alterations in intestinal fungi contribute to or result from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the effects of these changes in disease progression.","Zuo, Tao; Zhan, Hui; Zhang, Fen; Liu, Qin; Tso, Eugene Y K; Lui, Grace C Y; Chen, Nan; Li, Amy; Lu, Wenqi; Chan, Francis K L; Chan, Paul K S; Ng, Siew C",Gastroenterology,,132
386772,Hyperthrombotic Milieu in COVID-19 Patients,2020,"Since the first outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019, it is now recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) as more than 200 countries and territories worldwide are affected with an increasing incidence. The SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a spectrum of non-specific signs and symptoms, ranging from asymptomatic infection, to flu-like illness such as fever, cough, dry cough and fatigue, to pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and even multi-organ failures with high morbidity and mortality. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets that infected people exhale during incubation and onset period. By 12 June 2020, over 7.5 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with more than 421,000 deaths in the world have been reported to the WHO. No specific medication is approved to treat COVID-19, raising the urgent need for antiviral drug development. By 12 June 2020, there are over 1000 clinical trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov for treatment of COVID-19. This review summarizes the epidemiology, virology, clinical presentation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and particularly the antiviral drugs currently under clinical trials for treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the challenges and perspectives of this disease are also discussed.","Peng, Minhua",Biomed Pharmacother,,132

METHODS: All patients underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), lung ultrasound (LUS) and clinical evaluation on the same day. In each of the 12 areas evaluated in the LUS, the LUS signs were scored to generate the aeration score. RESULTS: A total of 409 participants had positive PCR, with a median age of 41 (35-51) years. All participants had clinical symptoms, with cough in 84.1%, fever in 69.7%, and dyspnea in 36.2% of cases. In the LUS, 72.6% of participants had B-lines >2, 36.2% had coalescent B-lines, and 8.06% had subpleural consolidations. The median aeration score was 3 (2-7). The aeration score differed significantly regarding the presence of cough (P = .002), fever (P = .001), and dyspnea (P < .0001). The finding of subpleural consolidations in the LUS showed significant differences between participants with or without dyspnea (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: In healthcare professionals with COVID-19, LUS plays a key role in the characterization of lung involvement. Although B-lines are the most common ultrasound sign, subpleural consolidations are those that most impact the respiratory condition.","Mafort, Thiago Thomaz; Lopes, Agnaldo José; da Costa, Cláudia Henrique; da Cal, Mariana Soares; Lopes, Mariana Carneiro; da Silva, Bruno Rangel Antunes; Faria, Luana Fortes; Faria, Anamelia Costa; Costa, Walter; Salles, Raquel Esteves Brandão; de Castro, Marcos César Santos; Rufino, Rogério",J Clin Ultrasound,,132

It is involved in the development and maintenance of both innate and systemic immunity of the body. Emerging evidence has shown its role in liver diseases through the immune system cross-talk. We review herein literature data regarding the triangular interaction between gut microbiota, immune system and liver in health and disease. Methods: We conducted a search on the main medical databases for original articles, reviews, meta-analyses, randomized clinical trials and case series using the following keywords and acronyms and their associations: gut microbiota, microbiome, gut virome, immunity, gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis (NASH), alcoholic liver disease, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma. Results: The gut microbiota consists of microorganisms that educate our systemic immunity through GALT and non-GALT interactions. The latter maintain health but are also involved in the pathophysiology and in the outcome of several liver diseases, particularly those with metabolic, toxic or immune-mediated etiology. In this context, gut virome has an emerging role in liver diseases and needs to be further investigated, especially due to the link reported between severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and hepatic dysfunctions. Conclusions: Changes in gut microbiota composition and alterations in the immune system response are involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic and immune-mediated liver diseases.","Scarpellini, Emidio; Fagoonee, Sharmila; Rinninella, Emanuele; Rasetti, Carlo; Aquila, Isabella; Larussa, Tiziana; Ricci, Pietrantonio; Luzza, Francesco; Abenavoli, Ludovico",J.

387608,The effect of sniffing Turkish coffee on olfactory disorders in COVID-19 patients: An experimental clinical study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Recent data demonstrated that socioeconomic, environmental, demographic, and health factors can contribute to vulnerability for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). The goal of this study was to assess association between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV-2) infection and demographic and socioeconomic factors in patients from a large academic family medicine practice to support practice operations. METHODS: Patients referred for SARS CoV-2 testing by practice providers were identified using shared patient lists in the electronic health records (Epic). The Health Information Exchange (CRISP) was used to identify additional practice-attributed patients receiving testing elsewhere. RESULTS: Compared with white non-Hispanic patients, the odds of COVID-19 detection were higher in black non-Hispanic (odds ratio [OR] = 1.75; 95% CI, 1.18-2.59, P = .0052) and Hispanic patients (OR = 5.40; 95% CI, 3.11-9.38, P < .0001). The latent class analysis revealed additional patterns in health disparities. Patients living in the areas with Area Deprivation Index 8-10 who were predominantly black had higher risk for SARS CoV-2 infection compared with patients living in less socioeconomically deprived areas who were predominantly white (OR = 1.68; 95% CI, 1.25-2.28; P = .0007). CONCLUSION: Our data provide insight into the association of COVID-19 with race/ethnic minority patients residing in highly socioeconomically deprived areas. These data could impact outreach and management of ambulatory COVID-19 in the future.","Khanna, Niharika; Klyushnenkova, Elena N; Kaysin, Alexander",J Am Board Fam Med,,132

389103,Use of 1-MNA to Improve Exercise Tolerance and Fatigue in Patients After COVID-19,2021,"In this paper we consider the problem of transmission across a graph and how to effectively control/restrict it with limited resources. Transmission can represent information transfer across a social network, spread of a malicious virus across a computer network, or spread of an infectious disease across communities. The key insight is to assign proper weights to bottleneck edges of the graph based on their role in reducing the connection between two or more strongly-connected clusters within the graph. Selectively reducing the weights (implying reduced transmission rate) on the critical edges helps limit the transmission from one cluster to another. We refer to these as barrier weights and their computation is based on the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. Unlike other work on graph partitioning and clustering, we completely circumvent the associated computational complexities by assigning weights to edges instead of performing discrete graph cuts. This allows us to provide strong theoretical results on our proposed methods. We also develop approximations that allow low complexity distributed computation of the barrier weights using only neighborhood communication on the graph.","Zhang, Leiming; Sadler, Brian M.; Blum, Rick S.; Bhattacharya, Subhrajit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.04790v1.pdf,132

OBJECTIVE: To compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition and factors associated with changes. METHODS: Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data from April 2020. Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and &#8805; 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID) change for anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; MCID = 4.0) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; MCID = 3.0) symptoms, controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels. RESULTS: Mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2).

389930,A simple method to prevent aerosol dispersion during Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation using supraglottic airway devices,2021,"Emergency admissions due to acute metabolic crisis in patients with diabetes remain some of the most common and challenging conditions. DKA (Diabetic Ketoacidosis), HHS (Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar State) and recently focused EDKA (Euglycaemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis) are life-threatening different entities. DKA and HHS have distinctly different pathophysiology but basic management protocols are the same. EDKA is just like DKA but without hyperglycaemia. T1D, particularly children are vulnerable to DKA and T2D, particularly elderly with comorbidities are vulnerable to HHS. But these are not always the rule, these acute conditions are often occur in different age groups with diabetes. It is essential to have a coordinated care from the multidisciplinary team to ensure the timely delivery of right treatment. DKA and HHS, in many instances can present as a mixed entity as well. Mortality rate is higher for HHS than DKA but incidences of DKA are much higher than HHS. The prevalence of HHS in children and young adults are increasing due to exponential growth of obesity and increasing T2D cases in this age group. Following introduction of SGLT2i (Sodium-GLucose co-Transporter-2 inhibitor) for T2D and off-label use in T1D, some incidences of EDKA has been reported. Healthcare professionals should be more vigilant during acute illness in diabetes patients on SGLT2i without hyperglycaemia to rule out EDKA. Middle aged, mildly obese and antibody negative patients who apparently resemble as T2D without any precipitating causes sometime end up with DKA which is classified as KPD (Ketosis-prone diabetes). Many cases can be prevented by following 'Sick day rules'. Better access to medical care, structured diabetes education to patients and caregivers are key measures to prevent acute metabolic crisis.","Muneer, Muhammad; Akbar, Ijaz",Adv Exp Med Biol,,132

391420,Severe bleeding in a patient with factor XIII deficiency and COVID-19,2020,"The retrieval and transport of patients from peripheral hospitals to high volume extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) centers aims to reduce complications and improve survival. In Sicily (Italy), our institute houses a mobile ECMO team that serves a population of around 10 million people for a vast area in southern Italy and Malta. This observational, descriptive study includes all patients that required veno-venous (V-V) ECMO and transport by a mobile team between October 2009 and May 2020. Linear and multiple logistic regressions were applied to explore the risk factors for mortality in the ICU. Kaplan-Meier estimates were generated to predict the survival in patients transported by helicopter or ambulance, and the two cohorts were compared according to their baseline characteristics. Of 122 patients transported, 89 (73%) survived to ICU discharge (50 (41%) patients were transported by ambulance, and 72 (59%) were transported by helicopter). Independent predictive factors associated with mortality in a stepwise multiple regression model were prone positioning, acute kidney injury, and the number of days spent on mechanical ventilation (MV). Kaplan-Meier estimates for survival favored the helicopter cohort (79%) rather than the ambulance cohort (64%). Patients transported by helicopter had better pre-ECMO profiles, with shorter hospital and ICU stays, a shorter duration of MV use, and higher RESP scores, which indicate better survival probabilities. ECMO transport can be carried out safely over long distances; in rural areas with underdeveloped roads, transportation via helicopter or ambulance can extend the arm of the hospital to remote areas. Early ECMO initiation can be crucial in improving survival outcomes, and when transportation is the limiting factor to starting ECMO support, it should be attempted at the earliest logistical stage possible.","Hildreth, Brianna A; Panarello, Giovanna; Martucci, Gennaro; Tuzzolino, Fabio; Piacentini, Alberto; Occhipinti, Giovanna; Giunta, Andrea; Genco, Fabio; Raffa, Giuseppe M; Pilato, Michele; Capitanio, Guido; Arcadipane, Antonio",,,132

391468,Innovative trial designs and analyses for vaccine clinical development,2020,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life threatening respiratory disease associated with pulmonary edema, alveolar dysfunction, hypoxia, and inflammatory cell accumulation. The most contagious form of COVID-19 associated with ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 majorly produces the cytokine storm and severe lung inflammation and ultimately leads to respiratory failure. ARDS is a complex disease and there is no proper therapeutics for effective therapy. Still, there is a huge scope to identify novel targets to combat respiratory illness. In the current study, we have identified the epigenetic regulating protein BRD4 and developed siRNA based nanomedicine to treat the ARDS. The liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration method, where BRD4 siRNA complexed with cationic lipid and exhibited 96.24 ± 18.01 nm size and stable even in the presence of RNase. BRD4 siRNA lipoplexes (BRD4-siRNA-LP) inhibited inflammatory cells in lungs and suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced the neutrophil infiltration and mast cell accumulation. Also, BRD4 siRNA based nanomedicine significantly reduced the LPS induced cytokine storm followed by inflammatory signaling pathways. Interestingly, BRD4-siRNA-LP suppressed the LPS-induced p65 and STAT3 nuclear translocation and ameliorated the lung inflammation. Thus, BRD4-siRNA-LP could be a plausible therapeutic option for treating ARDS and might be useful for combating the COVID-19 associated respiratory illness.","Pooladanda, Venkatesh; Thatikonda, Sowjanya; Muvvala, Sai Priya; Devabattula, Geetanjali; Godugu, Chandraiah",Int J Pharm,,132
391843,Venous thromboembolism in COVID-19 patients/ Tromboembolismo venoso em pacientes COVID-19,2020,"AIM: To examine in a laboratory setting the efficacy of moderate to high strength magnetic fields, as a potential bacteriostatic stimulus, against Enterococcus faecalis, one of the causative agents for infection during root canal treatments. METHODOLOGY: Four different strengths (1T, 2T, 3T and 4T) of the pulsed magnetic field (PMF) were applied in thirty repetitions to bacterial suspension. A pickup coil setup was used to measure the electromotive force induced inside the bacterial suspensions. The optical density (OD) was monitored over time (for 16 h 40 min) during the post-treatment period to assess bacterial growth. Along with the change in OD-values, live/dead assay, membrane depolarization study, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay on selected samples were studied to evaluate the effect of PMFs. All results were analysed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey test and considered significant at p < 0.05. Regression analysis (at a confidence of 95%, &#945; = 0.05) was performed on the bacterial growth and membrane depolarization studies to determine progressive changes of the outcomes. RESULTS: The peak value of the induced electromotive force was recorded as 0.25 V, for the 4 T magnetic field pulse with a pulse-width of 16 ms. There was a significant arrest of bacterial cell growth after an exposure to PMFs of 1 T, 3 T, 4 T (ANOVA score: F (4, 495) = 395.180 at p = 0.05). The image-based qualitative results of the live/dead assay using fluorescence microscopy techniques indicated that an exposure to higher PMFs (3 T/ 4 T) induced a bacteriostatic effect in a longer post-exposure timescale. Evidence of altered membrane-potential within the 2 h of exposure to 4 T PMF were supported by the incidence of elevated ROS. For the ROS assay, a significant difference occurred for 4 T exposed samples (ANOVA score: calculated F (1, 3) = 20.2749 at p = 0.05). SEM and AFM observations corroborated with the outcomes, by portraying significant membrane damage. CONCLUSION: In a laboratory setting, PMFs with higher magnitudes (3 T and 4 T) were capable of inducing bacteriostatic effects on E. faecalis.","Naskar, Sharmistha; Baskaran, Divya; Roy Choudhury, Aditya N; Chatterjee, Subhomoy; Karunakaran, Subbaraj; Murthy, B V Sreenivasa; Basu, Bikramjit",Int. endod. j,,132

392876,The influence of migration of the exeter V40 stem on patient reported outcome measures: a 2-year follow-up of 112 total hip arthroplasties using radiostereometric analysis,2021,"Importance: Provisional records from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through July 2020 indicate that overdose deaths spiked during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet more recent trends are not available, and the data are not disaggregated by month of occurrence, race/ethnicity, or other social categories. In contrast, data from emergency medical services (EMS) provide a source of information nearly in real time that may be useful for rapid and more granular surveillance of overdose mortality. Objective: To describe racial/ethnic, social, and geographic trends in EMS-observed overdose-associated cardiac arrests during the COVID-19 pandemic through December 2020 and assess the concordance with CDC-reported provisional total overdose mortality through May 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included more than 11â¯000 EMS agencies in 49 US states that participate in the National EMS Information System and 83.7 million EMS activations in which patient contact was made. Exposures: Year and month of occurrence of overdose-associated cardiac arrest; patient race/ethnicity; census region and division; county-level urbanicity; and zip code-level racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and educational attainment. Main Outcomes and Measures: Overdose-associated cardiac arrests per 100â¯000 EMS activations with patient contact in 2020 were compared with a baseline of values from 2018 and 2019. Aggregate numbers of overdose-associated cardiac arrests and percentage increases were compared with provisional total mortality in CDC records from rolling 12-month windows with end months spanning January 2018 through July 2020. Results: Among 33.4 million EMS activations in 2020, 16.8 million (50.2%) involved female patients and 16.3 million (48.8%) involved non-Hispanic White individuals. Overdose-associated cardiac arrests were elevated by 42.1% nationally in 2020 (42.3 per 100â¯000 EMS activations at baseline vs 60.1 per 100â¯000 EMS activations in 2020). The highest percentage increases were seen among Latinx individuals (49.7%; 38.8 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 58.1 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020) and Black or African American individuals (50.3%; 21.5 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 32.3 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020), people living in more impoverished neighborhoods (46.4%; 42.0 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 61.5 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020), and the Pacific states (63.8%; 33.1 per 100â¯000 activations at baseline vs 54.2 per 100â¯000 activations in 2020), despite lower rates at baseline for these groups. The EMS records were available 6 to 12 months ahead of CDC mortality figures and showed a high concordance (r = 0.98) for months in which both data sets were available. If the historical association between EMS-observed and total overdose mortality holds true, an expected total of approximately 90â¯632 (95% CI, 85â¯737-95â¯525) overdose deaths may eventually be reported by the CDC for 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, records from EMS agencies provided an effective manner to rapidly surveil shifts in US overdose mortality. Unprecedented overdose deaths during the pandemic necessitate investments in overdose prevention as an essential aspect of the COVID-19 response and postpandemic recovery. This is particularly urgent for more socioeconomically disadvantaged and racial/ethnic minority communities subjected to the compounded burden of disproportionate COVID-19 mortality and rising overdose deaths.","Friedman, Joseph; Mann, N Clay; Hansen, Helena; Bourgois, Philippe; Braslow, Joel; Bui, Alex A T; Beletsky, Leo; Schriger, David L","JAMA psychiatry (Chic.

394234,HIV infection and COVID-19: risk factors for severe disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 entry in human cells depends on angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which can be upregulated by inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). We aimed to test our hypothesis that discontinuation of chronic treatment with ACE-inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) mitigates the course o\f recent-onset COVID-19. METHODS: ACEI-COVID was a parallel group, randomised, controlled, open-label trial done at 35 centres in Austria and Germany. Patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled if they presented with recent symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and were chronically treated with ACEIs or ARBs. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to discontinuation or continuation of RAS inhibition for 30 days. Primary outcome was the maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score within 30 days, where death was scored with the maximum achievable SOFA score. Secondary endpoints were area under the death-adjusted SOFA score (AUCSOFA), mean SOFA score, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation, and death. Analyses were done on a modified intention-to-treat basis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04353596. FINDINGS: Between April 20, 2020, and Jan 20, 2021, 204 patients (median age 75 years [IQR 66-80], 37% females) were randomly assigned to discontinue (n=104) or continue (n=100) RAS inhibition. Within 30 days, eight (8%) of 104 died in the discontinuation group and 12 (12%) of 100 patients died in the continuation group (p=0·42). There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between the discontinuation and continuation group (median [IQR] maximum SOFA score 0·00 (0·00-2·00) vs 1·00 (0·00-3·00); p=0·12). Discontinuation was associated with a significantly lower AUCSOFA (0·00 [0·00-9·25] vs 3·50 [0·00-23·50]; p=0·040), mean SOFA score (0·00 [0·00-0·31] vs 0·12 [0·00-0·78]; p=0·040), and 30-day SOFA score (0·00 [10-90th percentile, 0·00-1·20] vs 0·00 [0·00-24·00]; p=0·023). At 30 days, 11 (11%) in the discontinuation group and 23 (23%) in the continuation group had signs of organ dysfunction (SOFA score &#8805;1) or were dead (p=0·017). There were no significant differences for mechanical ventilation (10 (10%) vs 8 (8%), p=0·87) and admission to intensive care unit (20 [19%] vs 18 [18%], p=0·96) between the discontinuation and continuation group. INTERPRETATION: Discontinuation of RAS-inhibition in COVID-19 had no significant effect on the maximum severity of COVID-19 but may lead to a faster and better recovery. The decision to continue or discontinue should be made on an individual basis, considering the risk profile, the indication for RAS inhibition, and the availability of alternative therapies and outpatient monitoring options.

394235,HIV infection and COVID-19: risk factors for severe disease,2020,"BackgroundConsidering the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants and low vaccine access and uptake, minimizing human interactions remains an effective strategy to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to create a novel multidimensional mobility index to capture the complexity of human interaction and evaluate its utility as an early indicator of surges in COVID-19 cases. MethodsWe used publicly available anonymous cell phone data compiled by SafeGraph, from all counties in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Indiana between January 1st to December 8, 2020. Six metrics of mobility were extracted for each county. Changes in mobility were defined as a time-updated 7-day rolling average. We used an unsupervised machine learning method known as functional principal component analysis (fPCA) to construct the latent mobility index (MI) using the six metrics of mobility. Associations between our MI and COVID-19 cases were estimated using a quasi-Poisson hierarchical generalized additive model adjusted for population density and the COVID-19 community vulnerability index. ResultsIndividual mobility metrics varied significantly by counties and by calendar time. More than 50% of the variability in the data was explained by the first principal component by each state, indicating good dimension reduction. Following the expiration of stay-at-home orders, mobility increased across all counties and this was particularly evident on weekends. While an individual metric of mobility was not associated with surges of COVID-19, our MI was independently associated with COVID-19 cases in all four states given varying time-lags. ConclusionFollowing the expiration of stay-at-home orders, a single metric of mobility was not sensitive enough to capture the complexity of human interactions. Monitoring mobility can be an important public health tool, however, it should be modelled as a multidimensional construct.","Her, Peter Hyunwuk; Saeed, Sahar; Tram, Khai Hoan; Bhatnagar, Sahir Rai",,,132

Whilst an enormous number of special issues and articles are devoted on the topic, there are few fundamental reflections on how the current pandemic will affect science and work and organisational psychology in the long run. Research purpose: The current overview, written by a group of members of the Future of Work and Organisational Psychology (FOWOP) Movement, focuses on the central issues relating to work and organisational psychology that have emerged as a result of the COVID-19 crisis. Motivation for the study: The study discusses the inability of dominant theories in work and organisational psychology to understand contemporary problems and the need to advance the theoretical realm of work psychology. We also discuss the need for pluralism in methodologies to understand the post-COVID-19 workplace, the urgency of attending to neglected voices and populations during the COVID-19 crisis and teaching during COVID-19. Research approach/design and method: This article uses conceptual argumentation. Main findings: The COVID-19 crisis forces work psychology to address at least its theorising, methods, unheard voices and teaching in the COVID-19 crisis. Practical/managerial implications: On the basis of this article, researchers and practitioners may be better aware of the neglected perspectives in the current pandemic. Contribution/value-add: This article adds to the understanding of the future directions for a sustainable Work and Organisational Psychology as an applied scientific discipline during and beyond the COVID-19 crisis.","Pérez-Nebra, Amalia Sklaveniti Chrysavgi Islam Gazi Petrović Ivana Pickett Jennifer Alija Makfire Matthijs Bal P.; Tekeste, Milena Vukelić Milica Bazana Sandiso Sanderson Zoe",SA Journal of Industrial Psychology,,132
395757,Approach to patients with COVID-19 disease: the procedure in Udine,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical pictures, laboratory tests and imaging of patients with lung involvement, either from severe COVID-19 or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), in order to assess how similar these two diseases are. METHODS: The present work has been designed as a cross-sectional single-centre study to compare characteristics of patients with lung involvement either from MAS or severe COVID-19. Chest CT scans were assessed by using an artificial intelligence (AI)-based software. RESULTS: Ten patients with MAS and 47 patients with severe COVID-19 with lung involvement were assessed. Although all patients showed fever and dyspnoea, patients with MAS were characterised by thrombocytopaenia, whereas patients with severe COVID-19 were characterised by lymphopaenia and neutrophilia. Higher values of H-score characterised patients with MAS when compared with severe COVID-19. AI-reconstructed images of chest CT scan showed that apical, basal, peripheral and bilateral distributions of ground-glass opacities (GGOs), as well as apical consolidations, were more represented in severe COVID-19 than in MAS. C reactive protein directly correlated with GGOs extension in both diseases. Furthermore, lymphopaenia inversely correlated with GGOs extension in severe COVID-19.

397515,COVID-19 management in a cancer center: the ICU storm,2020,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (EC:3.4.17.23) is a transmembrane protein which is considered as a receptor for spike protein binding of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2). Since no specific medication is available to treat COVID-19, designing of new drug is important and essential. In this regard, in silico method plays an important role, as it is rapid and cost effective compared to the trial and error methods using experimental studies. Natural products are safe and easily available to treat coronavirus affected patients, in the present alarming situation. In this paper five phytochemicals, which belong to flavonoid and anthraquinone subclass, have been selected as small molecules in molecular docking study of spike protein of SARS-CoV2 with its human receptor ACE2 molecule. Their molecular binding sites on spike protein bound structure with its receptor have been analyzed. From this analysis, hesperidin, emodin and chrysin are selected as competent natural products from both Indian and Chinese medicinal plants, to treat COVID-19. Among them, the phytochemical hesperidin can bind with ACE2 protein and bound structure of ACE2 protein and spike protein of SARS-CoV2 noncompetitively. The binding sites of ACE2 protein for spike protein and hesperidin, are located in different parts of ACE2 protein. Ligand spike protein causes conformational change in three-dimensional structure of protein ACE2, which is confirmed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics studies. This compound modulates the binding energy of bound structure of ACE2 and spike protein.

As a result, this natural product can impart antiviral activity in SARS CoV2 infection.

There is no clear date yet on when it will end. By now, more than 31 million people have been infected worldwide. Predicting the Covid-19 trend has become a challenging issue. In this study, data of COVID-19 between 20/01/2020 and 18/09/2020 for USA, Germany and Global was obtained from World Health Organization. Dataset consist of weekly confirmed cases and weekly cumulative confirmed cases for 35 weeks. Then the distribution of the data was examined using the most up-to-date Covid-19 weekly case data and its parameters were obtained according to the statistical distributions. Furthermore, time series prediction model using machine learning was proposed to obtain the curve of disease and forecast the epidemic tendency. Linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, random forest and support vector machines (SVM) machine learning methods were used. The performances of the methods were compared according to the RMSE, APE, MAPE metrics and it was seen that SVM achieved the best trend. According to estimates, the global pandemic will peak at the end of January 2021 and estimated approximately 80 million people will be cumulatively infected.","Balli, Serkan",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,132
398083,"Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19: Not Novel, but Necessary",2020,"Excessive monocyte activation with the development of excessive or uncontrolled release of proinflammatory cytokines often results in host tissue injury and even death in patients with pneumonia caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus. However, the changes of cytokine profiles of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, as well as the underlying mechanisms that are involved, remain unknown. Using a cytokine array containing 174 inflammation-related cytokines, we found significantly altered cytokine profiles in severe COVID-19 patients compared with those in mild patients or healthy controls, and identified leptin, CXCL-10, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-&#945; as the top differentially expressed cytokines. Notably, leptin showed high consistency with CXCL-10 and TNF-&#945; in predicting disease severity, and correlated with body mass index, decreased lymphocyte counts, and disease progression. Further analysis demonstrated that monocytes in severe patients with higher leptin levels were inclined toward M1 polarization. Mechanistic studies revealed that leptin synergistically up-regulated expression levels of inflammatory cytokines and surface markers with IL-6 in monocytes through STAT3 and NF-&#954;B signaling pathways. Collectively, our results suggest that overweight COVID-19 patients were prone to have higher leptin levels, which further activated monocytes, resulting in amplified or dysregulated immune responses. Taken together, our findings argue that leptin correlates severity of COVID-19 and may indicate a possible mechanism by which overweight patients have a greater tendency to develop severe conditions.","Wang, Jingya; Xu, Yinyin; Zhang, Xiaoli; Wang, Sheng; Peng, Ziyi; Guo, Jing; Jiang, Hongmei; Liu, Jing; Xie, Ying; Wang, Jingjing; Li, Xin; Liao, Juan; Wan, Chao; Yu, Lihua; Hu, Jinsong; Liu, Beizhong; Liu, Zhiqiang",J. leukoc. biol,,132

Here, abundant natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages help the uterine vasculature adapt to fetal demands for gas and nutrients, thereby supporting fetal growth. Fetal trophoblast cells budding off the forming placenta and invading deep into maternal tissues come into contact with these and other immune cells. Besides their homeostatic functions, decidual NK cells can respond to pathogens during infection, but in doing so, they may become conflicted between destroying the invader and sustaining fetoplacental growth. We review how maternal NK cells balance their double duty both in the local microenvironment of the uterus and systemically, during toxoplasmosis, influenza, cytomegalovirus, malaria and other infections that threat pregnancy. We also discuss recent developments in the understanding of NK-cell responses to SARS-Cov-2 infection and the possible dangers of COVID-19 during pregnancy.","Shmeleva, Evgeniya V; Colucci, Francesco",Mucosal immunology (Online),,132

402776,In-hospital Routes of Acute Heart Failure Admissions During COVID-19,2020,"Pulmonary surfactant is considered to be one of the soaps. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the other enveloped viruses become very weak against surfactant. The SARS virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor and causes pneumonia. In the lung, the ACE2 receptor sits on the top of lung cells known as alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells. These cells play an important role in producing surfactant. Pulmonary surfactant is believed to regulate the alveolar surface tension in mammalian lungs. To our knowledge, AE2 cells are believed to act as immunoregulatory cells; however, pulmonary surfactant itself has not been believed to act as a defender against the enveloped viruses. This study hypothesises that pulmonary surfactant may be a strong defender of enveloped viruses. Therefore, old coronaviruses merely cause pneumonia. On the contrary, new SARS-CoV-2 can suppress the production of surfactant that binds to the ACE2 of AE2 cells. The coronavirus can survive in the lung tissue because of the exhaustion of pulmonary surfactant.","Takano, Hideyuki",Med Hypotheses,,132
403093,Hyperlipasemia in absence of acute pancreatitis is associated with elevated D-dimer and adverse outcomes in COVID 19 disease,2021,"This paper investigates the impact of human activity and mobility (HAM) in the spreading dynamics of an epidemic. Specifically, it explores the interconnections between HAM and its effect on the early spread of the COVID-19 virus. During the early stages of the pandemic, effective reproduction numbers exhibited a high correlation with human mobility patterns, leading to a hypothesis that the HAM system can be studied as a coupled system with disease spread dynamics. This study applies the generalized Koopman framework with control inputs to determine the nonlinear disease spread dynamics and the input-output characteristics as a locally linear controlled dynamical system. The approach solely relies on the snapshots of spatiotemporal data and does not require any knowledge of the system's physical laws. We exploit the Koopman operator framework by utilizing the Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (HDMDc) algorithm to obtain a linear disease spread model incorporating human mobility as a control input. The study demonstrated that the proposed methodology could capture the impact of local mobility on the early dynamics of the ongoing global pandemic. The obtained locally linear model can accurately forecast the number of new infections for various prediction windows ranging from two to four weeks. The study corroborates a leader-follower relationship between mobility and disease spread dynamics. In addition, the effect of delay embedding in the HDMDc algorithm is also investigated and reported. A case study was performed using COVID infection data from Florida, US, and HAM data extracted from Google community mobility data report.","Mustavee, Shakib; Agarwal, Shaurya; Enyioha, Chinwendu; Das, Suddhasattwa",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.07380v2.pdf,132

DALDIS is pilot testing a digital assessment for learning solution focused on Science and Modern Foreign Language Learning in years 5–9. Underpinned by the Study Quest technology, which is designed to drive students’ learning progression using well-designed question-sets and student feedback, DALDIS is built on the principle that formative assessment is one of the best methods to encourage student achievement. Although Assessment for Learning (AFL) using technology has great potential for learning, it is not widely used in Europe. As the project lead Ireland was responsible for the first adaptation of StudyQuest, known as JCQuest for its Junior Cycle science and French curriculum. Unexpectedly, the commencement of DALDIS coincided with school closures due to Covid-19 and this appears to have influenced the uptake in student usage of JCQuest to support online learning and exam preparation. This paper provides an insight into how students engaged with JCQuest, key usage patterns and types of devices used based on Google Analytics data during two crucial school closure periods during Ireland’s pandemic.

404575,Altered Vascular Endothelium-Dependent Responsiveness in Frail Elderly Patients Recovering from COVID-19 Pneumonia: Preliminary Evidence,2021,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although about 80% of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases are reported to be mild, the remaining 20% of cases often result in severe disease with the potential of crushing already overstrained health care services. There has been sustainable growth of COVID-19 cases worldwide since mid-May 2020. To keep tabs on community transmission of COVID-19 infection screening of the samples from a large population is needed which includes asymptomatic/symptomatic individuals along with the migrant population. This requires extra resources, man power, and time for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In the current scenario, the pooled sample testing strategy advocated by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi is a new approach that is very promising in resource-limited settings. In this study, we have evaluated the pooled strategy in terms of accurate testing results, utilization of consumables, and identification of borderline positive cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April and June 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR from areas with varying prevalence of population referred to COVID laboratory, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow. In the first step, the samples are collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools are tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 are then deconvoluted and each sample is tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 4620 samples in 462 pools of 10 and 14 940 samples in 2990 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 61 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 61 pools (610 samples) deconvoluted strategy was followed in which 72 individual samples came positive. The pooled-sample testing strategy helps saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76% to 93% fewer tests done in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSIONS: Pooled-sample PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the resulting outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled-sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early coming stages of COVID-19 outbreaks, especially in low- and middle-income settings, and control the spread by meticulous testing of all risk groups.","Garg, Jaya; Singh, Vikramjeet; Pandey, Pranshu; Verma, Ashish; Sen, Manodeep; Das, Anupam; Agarwal, Jyotsna",J. med. virol,,132

METHODS: The sample included 204 patients with chronic pain attending nine primary care centres. The CAF-P was developed and validated using standard methodology, which included developing items, cognitive debriefing and psychometric validation. RESULTS: CAF-P has excellent internal consistency, with Cronbach's &#945; of 0.91 and an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.87. We propose a structure of two factors that explain 55.80 % of the variance. The convergent validity showed a moderate positive correlation with the probability of recommending treatment and with the level of satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The CAF-P appears to be a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the therapeutic alliance perceived by patients in physiotherapy.

Various microfluidic-based approaches for digital NAA have been developed, but most methods require complex auxiliary control instruments, cumbersome device fabrication, or inconvenient preparation processes. A SlipChip is a microfluidic device that can generate and manipulate liquid partitions through simple movements of two microfluidic plates in close contact. However, the traditional SlipChip requires accurate alignment of microfeatures on different plates; therefore, the dimensions of the microwells and density of partitions can be constrained. Here, we developed a droplet array SlipChip (da-SlipChip) that can form droplets of various sizes at high density in a single slipping step. This process does not require precise overlapping microfeatures on different plates; therefore, the design flexibility and partition density can be significantly increased. We quantified SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids extracted from the COVID-19 pseudovirus by digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) on a da-SlipChip with 21 696 of 0.25 nL droplets, and the results were in good agreement with those of the commercial digital PCR method of Stilla. Furthermore, we demonstrated a random-access system with a single-throughput fluorescence imager and a stackable thermal control instrument with nine independent heating modules. This random-access system with the da-SlipChip can greatly improve the total throughput and flexibility for digital isothermal nucleic acid quantification and significantly reduce the total waiting time.","Lyu, Weiyuan; Zhang, Jiajie; Yu, Yan; Xu, Lei; Shen, Feng",Lab Chip,,132
409428,Incidence and factors associated with COVID-19 in 13 hemodialysis units,2021,"The development of highly efficacious COVID-19 vaccines has brought a feeling of hope to many in the US (United States) and across the globe. However, it is estimated that approximately one-third of the US and international population are hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. For most Western countries with the economic means to purchase sufficient vaccine for their citizens, the medical community now has the opportunity to lead the vaccination communication campaign. Because frontline clinicians were the first to be vaccinated in the United States (US), they are uniquely positioned to be the most trusted source of vaccine information. Primary care clinicians, more than other groups of clinicians, scientists, government officials, media, etc. have the greatest chance for instilling confidence about the vaccine to their patients, including the most vulnerable and the most distrusting. They are considered credible and trustworthy allies for their patients in the US, however, clinicians receive little to no formal training in communication related to controversial topics, such as vaccine hesitancy. With the increasing worry about highly transmissible COVID-19 viral mutations and possible related vaccine resistance, it becomes even more critical to accelerate vaccination efforts across every community. Educating primary care clinicians regarding the importance of talking to their patients regarding their COVID-19 vaccination plans is essential.","Katzman, Joanna G; Katzman, Jeffrey W",J Prim Care Community Health,,132

However, the relatively low external quantum efficiencies (mostly lower than 10%) strongly restrict their wider or even potential applications, which have been known related to the intrinsic properties of high Al-content AlGaN semiconductor materials and especially their quantum structures. Here, we review recent progress in the development of novel concepts and techniques in AlGaN-based LEDs and summarize the multiple physical fields as a toolkit for effectively controlling and tailoring the crucial properties of nitride quantum structures. In addition, we describe the key challenges for further increasing the efficiency of DUV LEDs and provide an outlook for future developments.","Li, Jinchai Gao Na Cai Duanjun Lin Wei Huang Kai Li Shuping Kang Junyong",Light: Science &amp; Applications,,132
412104,Outcomes for Patients Following Hospitalization for COVID-19,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Breastfeeding is beneficial to both the newborn and the mother. During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns have been raised on whether the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be transmitted from COVID-19 positive mother to the newborn through breastmilk. The purpose of this review is to examine the available evidence on the risks of transmission of infection from COVID-19 mothers to their newborns through breastfeeding. RECENT FINDINGS: Data is very limited in this regard, with only a few smaller case series, and case reports have been published so far. In most of the studies, breastmilk samples from COVID-19 mothers tested negative for the virus. In the case reports where the virus was detected in breastmilk and the infants were diagnosed with COVID-19, it remained unclear whether the disease was transmitted through breastmilk or direct contact or through delivery. Another hypothesis is that the viral antibodies could pass to the newborn passively through breastmilk of COVID-19 positive mothers and give immunity to the child, but data is minimal. Based on the currently available limited evidence and recognizing the benefits of breastfeeding, it may be concluded that if the health of the mother and her newborn allows, direct breastfeeding or extracted breastmilk should be encouraged by the healthcare providers after a careful discussion of the risks of vertical transmission to the mother and her family. Preventive measures should be taken by COVID-19 mothers to prevent droplet transmission of infection to the infants while breastfeeding.","Bhatt, Harshil",Curr. nutr. rep,,132
412460,[Imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia],2021,"Background: COVID-19 was first recognized in late 2019 in China, at which time school closures forced most students to isolate at home or maintain social distance, both of which increased smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and post traumatic disorder (PTSD) risks. However, to date, no research has fully explored these behavioral risks or the consequences. Methods: Two thousand and ninety home-confined students from two Chinese high schools participated in an online-based questionnaire battery that assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related exposures, daytime sleepiness, problematic smartphone use, and PTSD. The subsequent data were subjected to mediation analysis, and structural equation models (SEM) were employed to explore the variable relationships. Results: The problematic smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and PTSD prevalence were respectively 16.4%, 20.2% and 6.9%. The number of COVID-19 related exposure was directly associated with problematic smartphone use and PTSD symptoms. Problematic smartphone use was found to be a mediator between COVID-19 related exposure and PTSD symptoms, and daytime sleepiness was found to partially mediate the associations between problematic smartphone use and PTSD. Conclusions: The more exposure associated with the pandemic, the more psychological and behavioral problems the adolescents had. The relatively high rate of problematic smartphone use in home isolated adolescents possibly increased the risk of daytime sleepiness and psychological problems. Therefore, targeted improvements are needed to reduce the risk of psychological problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents.","Hu, Tao; Wang, Ying; Lin, Ling; Tang, Wanjie",Child Youth Serv Rev,,132

OBJECTIVES: We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. RESULTS: Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.","Janati Idrissi, Abdelkrim; Lamkaddem, Abdelaziz; Benouajjit, Abdelilah; Ben El Bouaazzaoui, Manar; El Houari, Farah; Alami, Mohammed; Labyad, Sanae; Chahidi, Abderrahman; Benjelloun, Meryem; Rabhi, Samira; Kissani, Najib; Zarhbouch, Benaissa; Ouazzani, Reda; Kadiri, Fouzia; Alouane, Rachid; Elbiaze, Mohamed; Boujraf, Said; El Fakir, Samira; Souirti, Zouhayr",Sleep Med,,132
414033,Cardiovascular and Logistic Issues Associated With COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The global COVID-19 spread has forced countries to implement non-pharmacological interventions (NPI) (i.e., mobility restrictions and testing campaigns) to preserve health systems. Spain is one of the most severely impacted countries, both clinically and economically. In an effort to support policy decision-making, we aimed to assess the impacts of different NPI on COVID-19 epidemiology, healthcare costs and Gross Domestic Product (GDP). A modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed epidemiological model was created to simulate the pandemic evolution. Its output was used to populate an economic model to quantify healthcare costs and GDP variation through a regression model which correlates NPI and GDP change from 42 countries. Thirteen scenarios combining different NPI were consecutively simulated in the epidemiological and economic models. Both increased testing and stringency could reduce cases, hospitalizations and deaths. While policies based on increased testing rates lead to higher healthcare costs, increased stringency is correlated with greater GDP declines, with differences of up to 4.4% points. Increased test sensitivity may lead to a reduction of cases, hospitalizations and deaths and to the implementation of pooling techniques that can increase throughput testing capacity. Alternative strategies to control COVID-19 spread entail differing economic outcomes. Decision-makers may utilize this tool to identify the most suitable strategy considering epidemiological and economic outcomes.","Candel, Francisco Javier; Viayna, Elisabet; Callejo, Daniel; Ramos, Raul; San-Roman-Montero, Jesús; Barreiro, Pablo; Carretero, María Del Mar; Kolipinski, Adam; Canora, Jesus; Zapatero, Antonio; Runken, Michael Chris",Viruses,,132
414102,Male genital damage in COVID-19 patients: Are available data relevant?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study examined characteristics and planned expenses of U.S. adults who received the economic impact payment (EIP) during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a nationally representative sample of 6,607 middle- and low-income U.S. adults, the authors examined the proportion and correlates of EIP receipt among eligible adults and the associations among planned EIP-financed expenses, challenges with paying expenses, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Of the sample, 78.8% reported that they received the EIP, and 82.3% of EIP recipients reported that it had a positive impact on their life. Being a veteran (odds ratio [OR]=2.59), being married (OR=1.82), having a history of schizophrenia spectrum disorder (OR=1.74) or posttraumatic stress disorder (OR=1.51), and screening negative for recent suicidal ideation (OR=0.49) were associated with EIP receipt. Planned expenses with the EIP were savings, paying debt, and rent and accounted for 63.4% of the total amount. Screening positive for mental health or drug use problems was positively associated with greater planned expenses for substances and gambling. EIP receipt also was associated with fewer problems paying daily expenses, but participants who screened positive for mental health or alcohol use problems were more likely to report problems paying past-month daily expenses. CONCLUSIONS: Unconditional cash transfers such as the EIP may be important for sustaining the living situation of middle- and low-income populations. The management of funds is important to consider, especially among adults experiencing mental health and substance abuse problems, and such cash transfers may represent opportunities for financial literacy and money management interventions.","Tsai, Jack; Huang, Minda; Montgomery, Ann Elizabeth; Elbogen, Eric B",Psychiatr Serv,,132

These masks are intended for single use but their sterilization and subsequent reuse has the potential to substantially mitigate shortages. Here we investigate PPE sterilization using ionized hydrogen peroxide (iHP), generated by SteraMist equipment (TOMI; Frederick, MD), in a sealed environment chamber. The efficacy of sterilization by iHP was assessed using bacterial spores in biological indicator assemblies. After one or more iHP treatments, five models of N95 masks from three manufacturers were assessed for retention of function based on their ability to form an airtight seal (measured using a quantitative fit test) and filter aerosolized particles. Filtration testing was performed at a university lab and at a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pre-certification laboratory. The data demonstrate that N95 masks sterilized using SteraMist iHP technology retain filtration efficiency up to ten cycles, the maximum number tested to date. A typical iHP environment chamber with a volume of ~ 80 m3 can treat ~ 7000 masks and other items (e.g. other PPE, iPADs), making this an effective approach for a busy medical center.","Cramer, Avilash K; Plana, Deborah; Yang, Helen; Carmack, Mary M; Tian, Enze; Sinha, Michael S; Krikorian, David; Turner, David; Mo, Jinhan; Li, Ju; Gupta, Rajiv; Manning, Heather; Bourgeois, Florence T; Yu, Sherry H; Sorger, Peter K; LeBoeuf, Nicole R",Sci Rep,,132
417488,Gastrointestinal Manifestations in COVID-19 Infection and Its Practical Applications,2020,"BACKGROUND: To suppress the transmission of coronavirus, many governments, including that of the island of Ireland, implemented a societal lockdown, which included school closures, limits on social gatherings, and time outdoors. This study aimed to evaluate changes in physical activity (PA), mental health, sleep, and social media use among adolescent girls during lockdown. METHODS: 281 female pupils (12-14 y) taking part in the ongoing Walking In Schools study on the island of Ireland self-reported PA, mental health, sleep, and social media use before (September-October 2019) and during lockdown (May-June 2020), via questionnaires. These were supplemented with open-ended structured interviews conducted with 16 girls during lockdown. RESULTS: During the period of lockdown and school closures, pupils tried new forms of PA and undertook PA with family, but there was no significant change in self-reported PA. There was a decline in health-related quality of life and motivation for exercise; however, self-efficacy for walking and happiness with appearance increased. There was no change in sleep quality or social media usage. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the many challenges that schools face as they reopen, there is a need to continue to prioritize PA and motivation for exercise to support health and well-being in adolescent girls.","O039,; Kane, S Maria; Lahart, Ian M; Gallagher, Alison M; Carlin, Angela; Faulkner, Maria; Jago, Russell; Murphy, Marie H",J Phys Act Health,,132

418825,Ribonucleic acid COVID-19 vaccine-associated cutaneous adverse drug events: a case series of two patients,2021,"Previous research warned that internet and social media use could have a negative effect on the social lives of excessive users. Based on the social compensation hypothesis, however, factors related to social fears could lead to problematic social networking site (SNS) use because individuals try to compensate for their offline popularity. It was shown that individuals with higher levels of social fears tend to prefer computer-mediated (CMC) instead of face to face (FTF) communication. Here, we aimed to create a model that shows the direct and indirect effects of social anxiety and self-esteem on problematic SNS use. A total of 215 participants filled out our survey including measures of social anxiety, self-esteem, fear of negative evaluation, social media and Internet addiction. Using structural equation modeling we tested the indirect and direct effects between the variables. Our results indicated that social anxiety and lower self-esteem could lead to favoring CMC over FTF communication, which may result in problematic internet (PIU) and SNS use as a compensatory behavior to cope with fear of negative evaluation. The indirect pathways might highlight relevant differences behind the motivation of PIU - anonymity - and problematic SNS use - control. Theoretical as well as practical implications are discussed.","Zsido, Andras N; Arato, Nikolett; Lang, Andras; Labadi, Beatrix; Stecina, Diana; Bandi, Szabolcs A",Psychiatry Res,,132

This paper develops a method for detecting moving targets. We propose a novel strategy based on weight function W(Z), W(Z)=λH(Z)+(1-λ)L(Z), where H(Z),L(Z)are the total probabilities of un-detecting, and total effort respectively, is searching for moving novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cells among finite set of different states. The total search effort will be presented in a more flexible way, so it will be presented as a random variable with a given distribution. The objective is searching for COVID-19 which hidden in one of n cells in each fixed number of time intervals m and the detection functions are supposed to be known to the searcher or robot. We look in depth for the optimal distribution of the total effort which minimizes the probability of undetected the target over the set of possible different states. The effectiveness of this model is illustrated by presenting a numerical example.","Almalki, Saad J.; Afifi, W. A.; Al-Aziz Hosni El-Bagoury, Abd Abd-Elmougod Gamal A.",Results in Physics,,132

Objective: To quantify SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal and neonatal biofluids, transplacental passage of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody, and incidence of fetoplacental infection. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study was conducted among pregnant women presenting for care at 3 tertiary care centers in Boston, Massachusetts. Women with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results positive for SARS-CoV-2 were recruited from April 2 to June 13, 2020, and follow-up occurred through July 10, 2020. Contemporaneous participants without SARS-CoV-2 infection were enrolled as a convenience sample from pregnant women with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, defined by nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 viral load in maternal plasma or respiratory fluids and umbilical cord plasma, quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in maternal and cord plasma, and presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the placenta. Results: Among 127 pregnant women enrolled, 64 with RT-PCR results positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 31.6 [5.6] years) and 63 with RT-PCR results negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 33.9 [5.4] years) provided samples for analysis. Of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 23 (36%) were asymptomatic, 22 (34%) had mild disease, 7 (11%) had moderate disease, 10 (16%) had severe disease, and 2 (3%) had critical disease. In viral load analyses among 107 women, there was no detectable viremia in maternal or cord blood and no evidence of vertical transmission. Among 77 neonates tested in whom SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were quantified in cord blood, 1 had detectable immunoglobuilin M to nucleocapsid. Among 88 placentas tested, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any. In antibody analyses among 37 women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G was detected in 24 women (65%) and anti-nucleocapsid was detected in 26 women (70%). Mother-to-neonate transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was significantly lower than transfer of anti-influenza hemagglutinin A antibodies (mean [SD] cord-to-maternal ratio: anti-receptor binding domain immunoglobin G, 0.72 [0.57]; anti-nucleocapsid, 0.74 [0.44]; anti-influenza, 1.44 [0.80]; P < .001). Nonoverlapping placental expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 was noted. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, there was no evidence of placental infection or definitive vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Transplacental transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was inefficient. Lack of viremia and reduced coexpression and colocalization of placental angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane serine protease 2 may serve as protective mechanisms against vertical transmission.","Edlow, Andrea G; Li, Jonathan Z; Collier, Ai-Ris Y; Atyeo, Caroline; James, Kaitlyn E; Boatin, Adeline A; Gray, Kathryn J; Bordt, Evan A; Shook, Lydia L; Yonker, Lael M; Fasano, Alessio; Diouf, Khady; Croul, Natalie; Devane, Samantha; Yockey, Laura J; Lima, Rosiane; Shui, Jessica; Matute, Juan D; Lerou, Paul H; Akinwunmi, Babatunde O; Schmidt, Aaron; Feldman, Jared; Hauser, Blake M; Caradonna, Timothy M; De la Flor, Denis; D039,; Avino, Paolo; Regan, James; Corry, Heather; Coxen, Kendyll; Fajnzylber, Jesse; Pepin, David; Seaman, Michael S; Barouch, Dan H; Walker, Bruce D; Yu, Xu G; Kaimal, Anjali J; Roberts, Drucilla J; Alter, Galit",JAMA Netw Open,,132

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess: (a) circulating sex steroids levels in a cohort of 286 symptomatic men with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 at hospital admission compared to a cohort of 281 healthy men; and (b) the association between serum testosterone levels (tT), COVID-19, and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic, clinical, and hormonal values were collected for all patients. Hypogonadism was defined as tT &#8804;9.2 nmol/l. The Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was used to score health-significant comorbidities. Severe clinical outcomes were defined as patients either transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) or death. Descriptive statistics and multivariable linear and logistic regression models tested the association between clinical and laboratory variables and tT levels. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models tested the association between tT and severe clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, a significantly lower levels of LH and tT were found in patients with COVID-19 compared to healthy controls (all p < 0.0001); conversely, healthy controls depicted lower values of circulating E2 (p < 0.001). Testosterone levels suggestive for hypogonadism were observed in 257 (89.8%) patients at hospital admission. In as many as 243 (85%) cases, hypogonadism was secondary. SARS-CoV-2 infection status was independently associated with lower tT levels (p < 0.0001) and greater risk of hypogonadism (p < 0.0001), after accounting for age, BMI, CCI, and IL-6 values. Lower tT levels were associated with higher risk of ICU admission and death outcomes (all p &#8804; 0.05), after accounting for clinical and laboratory parameters. CONCLUSIONS: We unveil an independent association between SARS-CoV-2 infection status and secondary hypogonadism already at hospital admission, with lower testosterone levels predicting the most severe clinical outcomes.","Salonia, Andrea; Pontillo, Marina; Capogrosso, Paolo; Gregori, Silvia; Tassara, Michela; Boeri, Luca; Carenzi, Cristina; Abbate, Costantino; Cignoli, Daniele; Ferrara, Anna Maria; Cazzaniga, Walter; Rowe, Isaline; Ramirez, Giuseppe A; Tresoldi, Cristina; Mushtaq, Junaid; Locatelli, Massimo; Santoleri, Luca; Castagna, Antonella; Zangrillo, Alberto; De Cobelli, Francesco; Tresoldi, Moreno; Landoni, Giovanni; Rovere-Querini, Patrizia; Ciceri, Fabio; Montorsi, Francesco",Androl.

Methods: The daily number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases detected by nucleic acid was collected from the National Health Commission from January 16, 2020 to February 14, 2020. The analysis included the epidemic curve of the new confirmed cases, multiple of the new confirmed cases for period-over-period, multiple of the new confirmed cases for fixed-base, and the period-over-period growth rate of the new confirmed cases. Results: From January 16 to February 14, 2020, the cumulative number of new confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Chinese mainland was 50 031, including 37 930 in Hubei Province, 22 883 in Wuhan city and 12 101 in other provinces outside Hubei. The peak of new confirmed cases in other provinces outside Hubei was from January 31 to February 4, 2020, and the peak of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city and Hubei Province was from February 5 to February 9, 2020. The number of new confirmed cases in other provinces outside Hubei showed a significant decline (23% compared with the peak) from February 5 to February 9, 2020, while the number of new confirmed cases in Wuhan city (30% compared with the peak) and Hubei Province (37% compared with the peak) decreased significantly from February 10 to February 14, 2020.

420837,Integrated management is effective in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in the blood purification center: joint efforts from multiple departments,2021,"The petrochemical industry has made the economic development of many local communities possible, increasing employment opportunities and generating a complex network of closely-related secondary industries. However, it is known that petrochemical industries emit air pollutants, which have been related to different negative effects on mental health. In addition, many people around the world are being exposed to highly stressful situations deriving from the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns adopted by national and regional governments. The present study aims to analyse the possible differential effects on various psychological outcomes (stress, anxiety, depression and emotional regulation strategies) stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent lockdown experienced by individuals living near an important petrochemical complex and subjects living in other areas, nonexposed to the characteristic environmental pollutants emitted by these kinds of complex. The sample consisted of 1607 subjects who answered an ad hoc questionnaire on lockdown conditions, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS) and the Emotional Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ). The results indicate that people living closer to petrochemical complexes reported greater risk perception [K = 73.42, p < 0.001, with a medium size effect (Î·2 = 0.061)]. However, no significant relationship between psychological variables and proximity to the focus was detected when comparing people living near to or far away from a chemical/petrochemical complex. Regarding the adverse psychological effects of the first lockdown due to COVID-19 on the general population in Catalonia, we can conclude that the conditions included in this survey were mainly related to changes in the participants' impulsivity levels, with different total impulsivity scores being obtained if they had minors in their care (p<0.001), if they had lost their jobs, if they were working (p<0.001), if they were not telecommuting (p<0.001), if they went out to work (p<0.001) or if they established routines (p = 0.009). However, we can also be fairly certain that the economic effects are going to be worse than those initially detected in this study. More research will be necessary to corroborate our results.","Vicens, Paloma; Heredia, Luis; Bustamante, Edgar; Pérez, Yolanda; Domingo, José L; Torrente, Margarita",PLoS One,,132

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme leveraging extreme learning machine (ELM) to achieve high-precision timing and frequency synchronization. Specifically, two ELMs are incorporated into a traditional MIMO-OFDM system to estimate both the residual symbol timing offset (RSTO) and the residual carrier frequency offset (RCFO). The simulation results show that the performance of an ELM-based synchronization scheme is superior to the traditional method under both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and frequency selective fading channels. Finally, the proposed method is robust in terms of choice of channel parameters (e.g., number of paths) and also in terms of""generalization ability""from a machine learning standpoint.","Liu, Jun; Mei, Kai; Zhang, Xiaochen; McLernon, Des; Ma, Dongtang; Wei, Jibo; Zaidi, Syed Ali Raza",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.09248v1.pdf,132

422160,Obesity and Higher Risk for Severe Complications of Covid-19: What to do when the two pandemics meet,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus infectious disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in significant morbidities, severe acute respiratory failures and subsequently emergency departments' (EDs) overcrowding in a context of insufficient laboratory testing capacities. The development of decision support tools for real-time clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 is of prime importance to assist patients' triage and allocate resources for patients at risk. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: From March 2 to June 15, 2020, clinical patterns of COVID-19 suspected patients at admission to the EDs of Liège University Hospital, consisting in the recording of eleven symptoms (i.e. dyspnoea, chest pain, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, dry cough, wet cough, diarrhoea, headache, myalgia, fever and anosmia) plus age and gender, were investigated during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave. Indeed, 573 SARS-CoV-2 cases confirmed by qRT-PCR before mid-June 2020, and 1579 suspected cases that were subsequently determined to be qRT-PCR negative for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in this study. Using multivariate binary logistic regression, two most relevant symptoms of COVID-19 were identified in addition of the age of the patient, i.e. fever (odds ratio [OR] = 3.66; 95% CI: 2.97-4.50), dry cough (OR = 1.71; 95% CI: 1.39-2.12), and patients older than 56.5 y (OR = 2.07; 95% CI: 1.67-2.58). Two additional symptoms (chest pain and sore throat) appeared significantly less associated to the confirmed COVID-19 cases with the same OR = 0.73 (95% CI: 0.56-0.94). An overall pondered (by OR) score (OPS) was calculated using all significant predictors. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated and the area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.68-0.73) rendering the use of the OPS to discriminate COVID-19 confirmed and unconfirmed patients. The main predictors were confirmed using both sensitivity analysis and classification tree analysis. Interestingly, a significant negative correlation was observed between the OPS and the cycle threshold (Ct values) of the qRT-PCR. CONCLUSION AND MAIN SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed approach allows for the use of an interactive and adaptive clinical decision support tool. Using the clinical algorithm developed, a web-based user-interface was created to help nurses and clinicians from EDs with the triage of patients during the second COVID-19 wave.","Saegerman, Claude; Gilbert, Allison; Donneau, Anne-Françoise; Gangolf, Marjorie; Diep, Anh Nguvet; Meex, Cécile; Bontems, Sébastien; Hayette, Marie-Pierre; D039,; Orio, Vincent; Ghuysen, Alexandre",PLoS One,,132
422626,Orthodox Judaism as a Risk Factor of Covid-19 in Israel,2020,"BACKGROUND: There was much evidence suggesting that the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels reflect the extent of various pathophysiological processes. However, the current information about dynamic change of LDH in COVID-19 pneumonia has not been well investigated. METHODS: Study was performed in 87 cases confirmed by COVID-19 infection. The serum LDH levels were determined at diagnosis and follow-up visits. The evaluation of clinical response to therapy was based on chest CT scan. We selected the value of LDH around the data of chest CT scan (- 1 ~ + 1 day). RESULTS: At diagnosis, significant differences in LDH levels were found between non-severe and severe group (P < 0.05). It was demonstrated that increase or decrease of LDH was indicative of radiographic progress or improvement (P < 0.05). The time to LDH normalization (5.67 ± 0.55, days) was positively correlated with the time to radiographic absorption (5.57 ± 0.65 days, r = 0.53, P < 0.05). Applying the cut-off value of the increase in LDH has good specificity to predict disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: Serum LDH was validated for its potential usefulness as markers for evaluating clinical severity and monitoring treatment response in COVID-19 pneumonia.","Wu, Mei-Ying; Yao, Lin; Wang, Yi; Zhu, Xin-Yun; Wang, Xia-Fang; Tang, Pei-Jun; Chen, Cheng",Respir Res,,132

The relationship of viral infections, reactive species production, oxidative stress, and the antiviral response is relevant. Therefore, the aim of this review is to report studies showing how reactive oxygen species may positively or negatively affect the pathophysiology of viral infection. We focus on known respiratory viral infections, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs), in an attempt to provide important information on the challenges posed by the current COVID-19 pandemic. Because antiviral therapies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) are rare, knowledge about relevant antioxidant compounds and oxidative pathways may be important for understanding viral pathogenesis and identifying possible therapeutic targets.","Fernandes, Iara Grigoletto; de Brito, Cyro Alves; Dos Reis, Vitor Manoel Silva; Sato, Maria Notomi; Pereira, Nátalli Zanete",Oxid Med Cell Longev,,132

Design: Research Study. Setting: Clinical IVF treatment center. Patients: IVF patients treated at the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine. Interventions: Oocytes (GV, MII) and embryos (1 cell (1C); blastocyst (BL)) were donated to research at disposition by IVF patients. Follicular cells (cumulus (CC); granulosa (GC)) were collected from women undergoing egg retrieval after ovarian stimulation without an ovulatory trigger for IVM/IVF treatment cycles. Main Outcome Measures: The presence or absence of ACE2, CD147, TMPRSS2, and CTSL mRNA using RT-qPCR and protein using capillary Western blotting in human oocytes, embryos and ovarian follicular cells. Result s: RT- q-PCR analysis revealed high abundance of ACE2 gene transcripts in GV and MII oocytes compared to CC, GC, and BL. ACE2 protein was only present in MII oocytes, 1C, and BL embryos, but other ACE2 protein variants were observed in all the samples. TMPRSS2 protein was present in all samples while mRNA was observed only at the blastocyst stage. All the samples were positive for CD147 and CTSL mRNA expression. However, cumulus and granulosa cells were the only samples that showed co-expression of both CD147 and CTSL proteins in low abundance. Conclusions: Cumulus and granulosa cells are least susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the lack of required receptors and proteases combination (ACE2/TMPRSS2 or CD147/CTSL) in high abundance. Co-expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 proteins in MII oocytes, zygotes, and blastocysts demonstrate that these gametes and embryos have the cellular machinery required and thus are potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection if exposed to the virus. However, we do not yet know if infection occurs in vivo, or in vitro in an ART setting.","Rajput, Sandeep K; Logsdon, Deirdre M; Kile, Becca; Engelhorn, Heidi J; Goheen, Ben; Khan, Shaihla; Swain, Jason; McCormick, Sue; Schoolcraft, William B; Yuan, Ye; Krisher, Rebecca L",,,132

METHODS: This was a retrospective study in patients younger than 18 years of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and cancer diagnoses between April and September 2020. Demographic variables, laboratory, and radiologic findings and complications of each case were identified. A descriptive analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients were identified; the median age was 10 years. Fifteen patients (42%) were in chemotherapy at the time of the infection diagnosis, in two patients the chemotherapy protocol was permanently suspended. The most common symptom was fever in 20 patients (60%). Seven patients (21.2%) showed mild pneumonia, four patients (12.1%) severe pneumonia, and three cases (9.0%) were classified as critical. In the evaluated cohort, five patients (15.1%) died, and in two of those, death was caused by COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Children with an oncologic disease, the search for COVID cases should be oriented to patients with fever, including febrile neutropenia, the presence of respiratory symptoms, and the search for epidemiologic contact.

427083,Pulmonary Function and Radiologic Features in Survivors of Critical COVID-19: A 3-Month Prospective Cohort,2021,"In late 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. Rapidly escalated into a worldwide pandemic, it has caused an unprecedented and devastating situation on the global public health and society economy. The severity of recent coronavirus disease, abbreviated to COVID-19, seems to be mostly associated with the patients' immune response. In this vein, mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) have been suggested as a worth-considering option against COVID-19 as their therapeutic properties are mainly displayed in immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory effects. Indeed, administration of MSCs can attenuate cytokine storm and enhance alveolar fluid clearance, endothelial recovery, and anti-fibrotic regeneration. Despite advantages attributed to MSCs application in lung injuries, there are still several issues __foremost probability of malignant transformation and incidence of MSCs-related coagulopathy__ which should be resolved for the successful application of MSC therapy in COVID-19. In the present study, we review the historical evidence of successful use of MSCs and MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We also take a look at MSCs mechanisms of action in the treatment of viral infections, and then through studying both the dark and bright sides of this approach, we provide a thorough discussion if MSC therapy might be a promising therapeutic approach in COVID-19 patients.","Moradinasab, Susan; Pourbagheri-Sigaroodi, Atieh; Zafari, Parisa; Ghaffari, Seyed H; Bashash, Davood",Int Immunopharmacol,,132
427582,Self-Assessment Questionnaire for Efficient and Safe Evaluation of Patients with Mild COVID-19,2020,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well known as a novel member of the coronavirus family which caused a sudden outbreak of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in China that quickly developed into a global pandemic. No effective approaches are found as yet for the therapy and epidemiological control of this new virus. We searched the literature in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and MeSH, for articles and abstracts describing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pneumonia, clinical trials, drug, treatment, and medicine. Areas covered: The present study aimed to comprehensively overview the current literature on effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs. Expert opinion: Since the beginning of this pandemic disease, many studies have been conducted to find effective drugs to prevent COVID-19, because there are no specific drugs for the treatment of this disease. Most of these drugs with the antiviral potential effect toward COVID-19 are already used as the treatment of other infectious diseases. Some drugs that show the promising therapeutic potential in the initial clinical studies include remdesivir as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and favipiravir as an inhibitor of virus replication. Currently, remdesivir received the FDA authorizes to use as an experimental drug for emergency use in COVID-19 patients.","Yaghoubi, Atieh; Amel Jamehdar, Saeid; Movaqar, Aref; Milani, Nasrin; Soleimanpour, Saman",Expert Rev Respir Med,,132

427997,Prediction of leg length change (LLC) after correcting varus and flexion deformity in patients undergoing TKA,2021,"Introduction: coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have mild disease with non-specific symptoms, although a few becoming critically ill with septic shock and multiple organ failure. There is an unknown proportion of infected individuals who remain asymptomatic and infectious. Universal screening for COVID-19 infections to detect individuals who are infected before they present clinically could therefore be an important measure to contain the spread of the disease. We highlight a Cochrane rapid review which assessed the effectiveness and accuracy of universal screening for COVID-19 infection. Methods: the authors of the Cochrane review searched multiple electronic databases to identify studies reporting on the effectiveness of universal screening and reporting on screening test accuracy. Eligible participants for the review included people who had not sought care for potential COVID-19 symptoms. Results: the authors included 22 publications, with none of them conducted in Africa. Two modelling studies reported on the beneficial and negative effects of screening; and 20 studies (cohort and modelling) reported data on the accuracy of screening tests. The included studies had wide variability in the baseline prevalence of COVID-19 infection as well as study settings and methods. All cohort studies compared screening strategies to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the gold standard. The rapid review suggests that there is low certainty of evidence that screening at travel hubs may slow the importation of infected cases. Furthermore, the review highlights the uncertainty and variation in the accuracy of screening. Conclusion: given the low accuracy of the tests included in this review, a high proportion of COVID-19 infected individuals may be missed and go on to infect others. In addition, some healthy individuals may be falsely identified as positive, requiring confirmatory testing and potentially leading to the unnecessary isolation of these individuals.","Ndwandwe, Duduzile; Mathebula, Lindi; Adetokunboh, Olatunji; Kamadjeu, Raoul; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,,132

428810,Transient Cold Agglutinins in a Patient With COVID-19,2021,"Reports from various countries suggest that tobacco smoking might protect from SARS-CoV-2 infection, since the prevalence of smoking in COVID-19 hospitalized patients is lower than in the respective general population. Apart from nicotine or other chemicals contained in tobacco smoke, we propose that a single-stranded RNA virus that infects tobacco leaves, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), might be implicated in this effect. TMV, though non-pathogenic, is found in smokers' airways, and stimulates adaptive and innate immunity, with release of specific antibodies and interferons. The latter may have preventive and/or therapeutic effects against COVID-19. If confirmed by epidemiological and interventional studies, this might lead to the use of TMV as an immunological adjuvant against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease.","de Bernardis, E; Busà, L",Med Hypotheses,,132
428842,Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: with emphasis on Iranian patients,2021,"Online learning is becoming increasingly popular, whether for convenience, to accommodate work hours, or simply to have the freedom to study from anywhere. Especially, during the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become the only viable option for learning. The effectiveness of teaching various hard-core programming courses with a mix of theoretical content is determined by the student interaction and responses. In contrast to a digital lecture through Zoom or Teams, a lecturer may rapidly acquire such responses from students' facial expressions, behavior, and attitude in a physical session, even if the listener is largely idle and non-interactive. However, student assessment in virtual learning is a challenging task. Despite the challenges, different technologies are progressively being integrated into teaching environments to boost student engagement and motivation. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of various in-class feedback assessment methods such as Kahoot!, Mentimeter, Padlet, and polling to assist a lecturer in obtaining real-time feedback from students throughout a session and adapting the teaching style accordingly. Furthermore, some of the topics covered by student suggestions include tutor suggestions, enhancing teaching style, course content, and other subjects. Any input gives the instructor valuable insight into how to improve the student's learning experience, however, manually going through all of the qualitative comments and extracting the ideas is tedious. Thus, in this paper, we propose a sentiment analysis model for extracting the explicit suggestions from the students' qualitative feedback comments.","Aryal, Himali",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07904v1.pdf,132

429865,Vascular thromboembolic events following COVID-19 hospital discharge: incidence and risk factors,2021,"PURPOSE: Cohort study to evaluate the presence of objective signs and subjective symptoms of dry eye disease (DED) in post-COVID-19 patients compared to control. METHODS: Prospective, observational, single-center, cohort study. Sixty-four post-COVID-19 patients and fifty control were recruited. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmological examination including: Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire (OSDI), Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA), slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus examination, Schirmer test type 1, Tear Break Up Time test (tBUT), evaluation of conjunctival hyperemia, corneal staining and tear film osmolarity test. RESULTS: OSDI score was higher in the post-COVID19 group in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (respectively p<0.001 and p =0.012). Mean tBUT in post-COVID-19 patients was 6.95 ± 4.07 sec compared to a mean tBUT of 10.12 ± 3.90 sec in the control group. The post-COVID-19 group showed a higher number of patients with a simultaneous impairment of OSDI score and tBUT (p = 0.019). The Schirmer test results were strikingly significant both in the quantitative and qualitative analysis (p <0.001 and p = 0.0014 respectively). Both quantitative and qualitative analysis revealed a significant difference in terms of tear osmolarity in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the ocular surface assessment of post-COVID-19 patients with heathy control a statistically significant increase of DED has emerged both in subjective and objective evaluations. Our clinical results support the findings that suggested a susceptibility of the ocular surface to the virus and it underlines the importance of the ocular surface assessment in post-COVID-19 patients for a correct diagnosis and therapy.","Gambini, Gloria; Savastano, Maria Cristina; Savastano, Alfonso; De Vico, Umberto; Crincoli, Emanuele; Cozzupoli, Maria Grazia; Culiersi, Carola; Rizzo, Stanislao",Cornea,,132

The cytokine storm also occurs in the recently emerged novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Therefore, cytokines which usually help the immune system to fight infections are potentially harmful in the course of COVID-19 infections. Therefore, avoiding or mitigating the cytokine storm may be a key treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).","Rokni, Mohsen; Hamblin, Michael R; Rezaei, Nima",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,132

430834,Testing for COVID-19 in patients with cancer,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Passive surveillance is recommended globally for the detection of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI) but this has significant challenges. Use of Mobile health for vaccine safety surveillance enables a consumer-centred approach to reporting. The Stimulated Telephone Assisted Rapid Safety Surveillance (STARSS) a randomised control trial (RCT) sought to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of SMS for AEFI surveillance. METHODS: Multi-centre RCT, participants were adult vaccinees or parents of children receiving any vaccine at a trial site. At enrolment randomisation occurred to one of two SMS groups or a control group. Prompts on days 2, 7 and 14 post-immunisation, were sent to the SMS group, to ascertain if a medical event following immunisation (MEFI) had occurred. No SMS's were sent to the control participants. Those in the SMS who notified an MEFI were pre-randomised to complete a computer assisted telephone interview or a web based report to determine if an AEFI had occurred whilst an AEFI in the controls was determined by a search for passive reports. The primary outcome was the AEFI detection rate in the SMS group compared to controls. RESULTS: We enrolled 6,338 participants, who were equally distributed across groups and who received 11,675 vaccines. The SMS group (4,225) received 12,675 surveillance prompts with 9.8% being non-compliant and not responding. In those that responded 90% indicated that no MEFI had been experienced and 184 had a verified AEFI. 6 control subjects had a reported AEFI. The AEFI detection rate was 13 fold greater in the SMS group when compared with controls (4.3 vs 0.3%). CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the STARSS methodology improves AEFI detection. Our findings should inform the wider use of SMS-based surveillance which is particularly relevant since establishing robust and novel pharmacovigilance systems is critical to monitoring novel vaccines which includes potential COVID vaccines.","Gold, M S; Lincoln, G; Cashman, P; Braunack-Mayer, A; Stocks, N",Vaccine,,132

METHODS: This was a community-based cross-sectional study assessing 254 Portuguese adults (82.7% women; 35.82 ± 11.82 years) 1 week after the end of the first mandatory COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. An online survey was conducted to evaluate psychological distress, disordered eating, and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations and Structural Equation Modeling were performed. RESULTS: Participants reported the presence of meal skipping (52.8%), grazing eating behavior (80.9%), overeating (81.0%), loss of control over eating (47.2%), and binge eating episodes (39.2%) during lockdown. Structural equation modeling analyses, controlling for age and sex, indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of the experienced psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors mediated through psychological distress. CONCLUSION: The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis may lead to disordered eating, and this relation may occur through the elevation of psychological distress. These findings can be used to inform interventions, to enhance mental health and manage disordered eating during similar future situations.

432504,New dimensions in airway management: risks for healthcare staff,2020,"Acute lung injury (ALI), a devastating illness induced by systemic inflammation e.g., sepsis or local lung inflammation e.g., COVID-19 mediated severe pneumonia, has an unacceptably high mortality and has no effective therapy. ALI is associated with increased pulmonary microvascular hyperpermeability and alveolar flooding. The small Rho GTPases, RhoA and Rac1 are central regulators of vascular permeability through cytoskeleton rearrangements. RhoA and Rac1 have opposing functional outcome: RhoA induces an endothelial contractile phenotype and barrier disruption, while Rac1 stabilizes endothelial junctions and increases barrier integrity. In ALI, RhoA activity is increased while Rac1 activity is reduced. We have shown that the activation of RhoA in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated ALI, is dependent, at least in part, on a single nitration event at tyrosine (Y)34. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if the inhibition of Rac1 is also dependent on its nitration. Our data show that Rac1 inhibition by LPS is associated with its nitration that mass spectrometry identified as Y32, within the switch I region adjacent to the nucleotide-binding site. Using a molecular modeling approach, we designed a nitration shielding peptide for Rac1, designated NipR2 (nitration inhibitor peptide for the Rho GTPases 2), which attenuated the LPS-induced nitration of Rac1 at Y32, preserves Rac1 activity and attenuates the LPS-mediated disruption of the endothelial barrier in human lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVEC). Using a murine model of ALI induced by intratracheal installation of LPS we found that NipR2 successfully prevented Rac1 nitration and Rac1 inhibition, and more importantly attenuated pulmonary inflammation, reduced lung injury and prevented the loss of lung function.

Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and combinatorial group testing with a novel noise model for PCR. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the input is a quantitative readout from each test, and the output is a list of viral loads for each sample. While other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay, Tapestry obtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing. When testing $n$ samples with $t$ tests, as many as $k= O(t / \log n)$ infected samples can be identified at clinically-acceptable false positive and false negative rates. This makes Tapestry viable even at prevalence rates as high as 10\%. Tapestry has been validated in simulations as well as in wet lab experiments with oligomers. Clinical trials with Covid-19 samples are underway. An accompanying Android application Byom Smart Testing which makes the Tapestry protocol straightforward to implement in testing centres is available for free download.","Ghosh, Sabyasachi; Agarwal, Rishi; Rehan, Mohammad Ali; Pathak, Shreya; Agrawal, Pratyush; Gupta, Yash; Consul, Sarthak; Gupta, Nimay; Goyal, Ritika; Rajwade, Ajit; Gopalkrishnan, Manoj",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07895v1.pdf,132

This has resulted in the use of higher doses of thromboprophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy even in the absence of thrombotic events. However, after their hospital discharge, authors and current guidelines are not unanimous about extended anticoagulant therapy in patients with COVID-19. Here, we report two pulmonary embolism cases following hospitalization for COVID-19, despite intermediate doses of thromboprophylaxis. These rare cases suggest that there may be a residual thrombotic risk following hospitalization for COVID-19 and highlight questions about extended prophylactic-anticoagulation therapy after hospital discharge of patients with COVID-19.","Brem, Falmata Laouan; Missaoui, Zakariae; Arghal, Mohammed; Rasras, Hammam; Aichouni, Narjisse; Skiker, Imane; Ouafi, Noha El; Zakaria, Bazid",Pan Afr Med J,,132

They are mostly cutaneous; however, extracutaneous lesions are possible, and occur in very rare cases in the central nervous system. A European multicentre observational retrospective study was conducted in the last 5 years. Seven patients with intracranial or intraspinal infantile haemangiomas were selected and treated with oral propranolol. Propranolol was interrupted after complete or almost complete resolution of infantile haemangiomas. All patients tolerated the treatment well without side-effects. Central nervous system infantile haemangiomas are probably underestimated due to the frequent absence of symptoms and their spontaneous involution. However, they should be investigated in case of segmental cutaneous infantile haemangiomas, particularly on the head, neck, upper trunk, lumbar or sacral area in order to diagnosis intra-central nervous system involvement at an early stage.","Diociaiuti, Andrea; Carnevale, Claudia; Torres, Eulalia Baselga; Léauté-Labrèze, Christine; Neri, Iria; Rotunno, Roberta; Figà-Talamanca, Lorenzo; El Hachem, May",Acta derm. venereol,,132
435228,Comment on Williamson et al. (OpenSAFELY): The Table 2 Fallacy in a Study of COVID-19 Mortality Risk Factors,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the status of the implementation and development of telepharmacy as applied to the pharmaceutical care of outpatients treated at hospital pharmacy services in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Six weeks after the beginning of the confinement period, an online 10- question survey was sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacists. A single response per hospital was requested. The survey included questions on the provision of remote pharmaceutical care prior to the onset of the health crisis, patient selection criteria, procedures for home delivery of medications and the means used to deliver them, the number of patients who benefited from telepharmacy, and the number of referrals made. Finally, respondents were asked whether a teleconsultation was carried out before sending patients their medication and whether these deliveries were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 39.3% (n = 185) of all the hospitals in the National Health System (covering all of Spain's autonomous regions) responded to the survey. Before the beginning of the crisis, 83.2% (n = 154) of hospital pharmacy services did not carry out remote pharmaceutical care activities that included telepharmacy with remote delivery of medication. During the study period, 119,972 patients were treated, with 134,142 deliveries of medication being completed. Most hospitals did not use patient selection criteria. A total of 30.2% of hospitals selected patients based on their personal circumstances. Home delivery and informed delivery (87%; 116,129 deliveries) was the option used in most cases. The means used to deliver the medication mainly included the use of external courier services (47.0%; 87 hospitals) or the hospital's own transport services (38.4%; 71 hospitals). As many as 87.6% of hospitals carried out teleconsultations prior to sending out medications and 59.6% recorded their telepharmacy activities in the hospital pharmacy appointments record. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of implementation of telepharmacy in outpatient care in Spain during the study period in the pandemic was high. This made it possible to guarantee the continuity of care for a large number of patients.","Tortajada-Goitia, Begoña; Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón; Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Marcos, José Antonio; Fernández-Llamazares, Cecilia M",Farm Hosp,,132

We studied the relationship among anti-spike ectodomain (anti-ECD), anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) IgG titers, and SARS-CoV-2 virus neutralization (VN) titers generated by 2 in vitro assays using convalescent plasma samples from 68 patients with COVID-19. We report a strong positive correlation between both plasma anti-RBD and anti-ECD IgG titers and in vitro VN titers. The probability of a VN titer of &#8805;160, the FDA-recommended level for convalescent plasma used for COVID-19 treatment, was &#8805;80% when anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers were &#8805;1:1350. Of all donors, 37% lacked VN titers of &#8805;160. Dyspnea, hospitalization, and disease severity were significantly associated with higher VN titer. Frequent donation of convalescent plasma did not significantly decrease VN or IgG titers. Analysis of 2814 asymptomatic adults found 73 individuals with anti-ECD IgG titers of &#8805;1:50 and strong positive correlation with anti-RBD and VN titers. Fourteen of these individuals had VN titers of &#8805;1:160, and all of them had anti-RBD titers of &#8805;1:1350. We conclude that anti-RBD or anti-ECD IgG titers can serve as a surrogate for VN titers to identify suitable plasma donors. Plasma anti-RBD or anti-ECD titers of &#8805;1:1350 may provide critical information about protection against COVID-19 disease.","Salazar, Eric; Kuchipudi, Suresh V; Christensen, Paul A; Eagar, Todd; Yi, Xin; Zhao, Picheng; Jin, Zhicheng; Long, S Wesley; Olsen, Randall J; Chen, Jian; Castillo, Brian; Leveque, Christopher; Towers, Dalton; Lavinder, Jason; Gollihar, Jimmy; Cardona, Jose; Ippolito, Gregory; Nissly, Ruth; Bird, Ian; Greenawalt, Denver; Rossi, Randall M; Gontu, Abhinay; Srinivasan, Sreenidhi; Poojary, Indira; Cattadori, Isabella M; Hudson, Peter J; Josleyn, Nicole M; Prugar, Laura; Huie, Kathleen; Herbert, Andrew; Bernard, David W; Dye, John M; Kapur, Vivek; Musser, James M",J Clin Invest,,132

436595,SPACES implementation sticker,2020,"Coronavirus virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), actually considered as a global pandemic. The entry-point for SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), which are highly expressed in the lung. Among other complications, COVID-19leads to fatal pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to development of cytokine storm (CS). The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on the viral load and human innate/adaptive immune response that are required for viral elimination in the first phase of COVID-19. However, an exaggerated immune response in the second phase of COVID-19 results in immune overreaction and CS-induced ALI and ARDS. Thus, in view of these considerations, we report here a series of five patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who developed ALI. In addition to the supportive therapy, the patients received doxycycline in the first week and doxycycline plus colchicine in the second week. Following sequential therapy with doxycycline and/or colchicine in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the patients had reduction of disease severity and symptoms with better clinical and radiological outcomes. However, it is tough to confirm the link between this therapeutic combination and recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia, as it is a small case-series report. Nevertheless, this study gives a rational for large-scale prospective studies to evaluate the dual sequential effect of doxycycline and colchicine on the COVID-19 severity. This case-series illustrated that use of colchicine: doxycycline combination is linked with marked improvements in the clinical, laboratory and radiological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. However, we cannot sketch any definitive conclusion from our observation, despite we hypothesize that this combination therapeutic regimen may attenuate and treat COVID-19. Further, namely prospective, randomized, and controlled clinical studies are recommended in this regard.","Al-Kuraishy, Hayder M; Al-Gareeb, Ali I; Qusty, Naeem; Cruz-Martins, Natália; El-Saber Batiha, Gaber",Pulm Pharmacol Ther,,132

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, consecutive inpatients with laboratory confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China). Patients without diabetes were matched to those with diabetes based on age, sex, and comorbidities. All patients were followed up to a clinical endpoint (discharge, worsening including transferring to ICU or immediate death). Data and outcomes were extracted from medical records and analyzed. RESULTS: 64 patients with pre-existing diabetes were included in this study, with 128 matched patients without diabetes included as a control group. Patients with diabetes had a higher rate of worsening (18.8% versus 7.8%, p = 0.025). Multivariable regression showed increased odds of worsening associated with previous glycemic control reflected by HbA1c (odds ratio 3.29, 95% CI 1.19-9.13, p = 0.022) and receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve identified HbA1c of 8.6% (70 mmol/mol) as the optimal cut-off value. Univariate analysis demonstrated the in-hospital use of antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs were not associated with a higher risk of worsening. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had a higher risk of worsening, especially those with poorly-controlled HbA1c, with an optimal cut-off value of 8.6%. The in-hospital use of antidiabetic/antihypertensive drugs were not associated with increased odds of worsening in patients with diabetes.","Liu, Zhelong; Bai, Xi; Han, Xia; Jiang, Wangyan; Qiu, Lin; Chen, Shi; Yu, Xuefeng",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,132

However, the clinical relevance of &#945;-L-fucosidase, the enzyme for defucosylation has not been discovered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 585 COVID-19 patients were included to analyze the correlations of &#945;-L-fucosidase activity with the nucleic acid test, IgM/IgG, comorbidities, and disease progression. RESULTS: Among the COVID-19 patients, 5.75% were double-negative for nucleic acid and antibodies. All of them had increased &#945;-L-fucosidase, while only one had abnormal serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The abnormal rate of &#945;-L-fucosidase was 81.82% before the presence of IgM, 100% in the presence of IgM, and 66.2% in the presence of IgG. 73.42% of patients with glucometabolic disorders had increased &#945;-L-fucosidase activity and had the highest mortality of 6.33%. The increased &#945;-L-fucosidase was observed in 55.8% of non-severe cases and 72.9% of severe cases, with an odds ratio of 2.118. The &#945;-L-fucosidase mRNA was irrelevant to its serum activity. CONCLUSION: The change in &#945;-L-fucosidase activity in COVID-19 preceded the IgM and SAA and showed a preferable relation with glucometabolic disorders, which may be conducive to virus invasion or invoke an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.","Liang, En-Yu; Li, Guo-Hua; Wang, Wen-Gong; Qiu, Xin-Min; Ke, Pei-Feng; He, Min; Huang, Xian-Zhang",Clin. chim. acta,,132

Spread of COVID19 around the world prevent hospital admission for long period,so many patients continue their treatment at home Objective: to detect the role of home-based interactive therapy in improving upper limb function post stroke. Data sources: Electronic databases of PubMed, Cochrane library and Google scholar were searched up to May 2021, in addition to manual search of reference lists of relevant studies and reviews. Methods: Randomized controlled trials were included if they involved any form of home-based interactive therapy. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality using the PEDro scale, with any conflict resolved by the third author. Modified Sackett's Scale was used to determine the level of evidence for each outcome. Because of the clinical heterogeneity between the included studies;only 2 studies were appropriate for meta-analysis. Results: Out of 583 records screened, 3studies with 286 participants met the inclusion criteria. The duration of treatment ranged from 30 to 60 min, 5-6 times a week and for 5–8weeks. The quality of studies was good for the 3 studies, with a mean PEDro score of 6.3out of 10. All included studies showed positive effects in the measured outcomes. The results showed level1a evidence for the effectiveness of home-based interactive therapy in improving upper extremity function post stroke. Meta-analysis of 2 included trials used the action research arm score test showed no significant difference (P=0.28) in the overall effect of (SMD= -0.14;95% CI) between intervention and control groups Conclusion: Findings of this review found a strong evidence that home-based interactive therapy for stroke patients can improve their upper limb function but its effect is not superior to conventional therapy. This evidence is based on a limited number of RCTs and more high-quality RCTs are needed to support this evidence.","Ibrahim, S. M.; Zakaria, H. M.; Aly, M. G.; Arafa, M.

Consequently, investors feel pressured to find safe-haven investments during the pandemic crisis. Numerous studies have evaluated bitcoin's safe-haven properties during the COVID-19; however, the present study considered gold as a potential safe-haven for investors of renowned stock markets of Asia, Europe, and the US. The present investigation computed the ratio of gold to bitcoin (Gold_Bitcoin) and compared the safe-haven properties of gold in contrast to bitcoin. The present study analysed the Morlet Wavelet approach and found that most of the time during the COVID-19, gold investments proved to be more beneficial than bitcoin. Remarkably, the findings highlighted that the Gold_Bitcoin ratio increased in higher and lower frequencies combined with CAC40. In the long run, the return on investments in gold increased in contrast to bitcoin returns pooled with DAX30. Also, the Gold_Bitcoin ratio of the US stock market increased during the one-week and one-month cycles of January and August. Likewise, the Hang Seng Index caused the Gold_Bitcoin ratio to rise at a much higher frequency (i.e., the second half of January, the first half of February and April, and the first half of June and August), whereas IBEX35 surged Gold_Bitcoin at a lower frequency (i.e., during January, February, and August). In higher frequency bands, LSE increased the Gold_Bitcoin ratio (i.e., in February and March); nevertheless, Gold_Bitcoin showed a positive connection with FTSEMIB in the one-to-two month's frequency band (i.e., throughout January, February, and August).

443714,"Clinical and Epidemiological Characteristics of Children with Pcr-confirmed Covid-19 in Volgograd Region, Russia",2021,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, US hospitals relied on static projections of future trends for long-term planning and were only beginning to consider forecasting methods for short-term planning of staffing and other resources. With the overwhelming burden imposed by COVID-19 on the health care system, an emergent need exists to accurately forecast hospitalization needs within an actionable timeframe. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to leverage an existing COVID-19 case and death forecasting tool to generate the expected number of concurrent hospitalizations, occupied intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and in-use ventilators 1 day to 4 weeks in the future for New Mexico and each of its five health regions. METHODS: We developed a probabilistic model that took as input the number of new COVID-19 cases for New Mexico from Los Alamos National Laboratory's COVID-19 Forecasts Using Fast Evaluations and Estimation tool, and we used the model to estimate the number of new daily hospital admissions 4 weeks into the future based on current statewide hospitalization rates. The model estimated the number of new admissions that would require an ICU bed or use of a ventilator and then projected the individual lengths of hospital stays based on the resource need. By tracking the lengths of stay through time, we captured the projected simultaneous need for inpatient beds, ICU beds, and ventilators. We used a postprocessing method to adjust the forecasts based on the differences between prior forecasts and the subsequent observed data. Thus, we ensured that our forecasts could reflect a dynamically changing situation on the ground. RESULTS: Forecasts made between September 1 and December 9, 2020, showed variable accuracy across time, health care resource needs, and forecast horizon. Forecasts made in October, when new COVID-19 cases were steadily increasing, had an average accuracy error of 20.0%, while the error in forecasts made in September, a month with low COVID-19 activity, was 39.7%. Across health care use categories, state-level forecasts were more accurate than those at the regional level. Although the accuracy declined as the forecast was projected further into the future, the stated uncertainty of the prediction improved. Forecasts were within 5% of their stated uncertainty at the 50% and 90% prediction intervals at the 3- to 4-week forecast horizon for state-level inpatient and ICU needs. However, uncertainty intervals were too narrow for forecasts of state-level ventilator need and all regional health care resource needs. CONCLUSIONS: Real-time forecasting of the burden imposed by a spreading infectious disease is a crucial component of decision support during a public health emergency. Our proposed methodology demonstrated utility in providing near-term forecasts, particularly at the state level. This tool can aid other stakeholders as they face COVID-19 population impacts now and in the future.","Castro, Lauren A; Shelley, Courtney D; Osthus, Dave; Michaud, Isaac; Mitchell, Jason; Manore, Carrie A; Del Valle, Sara Y",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,132
444436,Considerations for epidural blood patch and other postdural puncture headache treatments in patients with covid-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 occurred unexpectedly in China in December 2019. Tens of millions of confirmed cases and more than hundreds of thousands of confirmed deaths are reported worldwide according to the World Health Organisation. News about the virus is spreading all over social media websites. Consequently, these social media outlets are experiencing and presenting different views, opinions and emotions during various outbreak-related incidents. For computer scientists and researchers, big data are valuable assets for understanding people's sentiments regarding current events, especially those related to the pandemic. Therefore, analysing these sentiments will yield remarkable findings. To the best of our knowledge, previous related studies have focused on one kind of infectious disease. No previous study has examined multiple diseases via sentiment analysis. Accordingly, this research aimed to review and analyse articles about the occurrence of different types of infectious diseases, such as epidemics, pandemics, viruses or outbreaks, during the last 10 years, understand the application of sentiment analysis and obtain the most important literature findings. Articles on related topics were systematically searched in five major databases, namely, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore and Scopus, from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2020. These indices were considered sufficiently extensive and reliable to cover our scope of the literature. Articles were selected based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic review, with a total of n = 28 articles selected. All these articles were formed into a coherent taxonomy to describe the corresponding current standpoints in the literature in accordance with four main categories: lexicon-based models, machine learning-based models, hybrid-based models and individuals. The obtained articles were categorised into motivations related to disease mitigation, data analysis and challenges faced by researchers with respect to data, social media platforms and community. Other aspects, such as the protocol being followed by the systematic review and demographic statistics of the literature distribution, were included in the review. Interesting patterns were observed in the literature, and the identified articles were grouped accordingly. This study emphasised the current standpoint and opportunities for research in this area and promoted additional efforts towards the understanding of this research field.","Alamoodi, A H; Zaidan, B B; Zaidan, A A; Albahri, O S; Mohammed, K I; Malik, R Q; Almahdi, E M; Chyad, M A; Tareq, Z; Albahri, A S; Hameed, Hamsa; Alaa, Musaab",Expert Syst Appl,,132

Availability of testing is a bottleneck due to constrained resources and effective prioritization of individuals is necessary. Here, we discuss the impact of different prioritization policies on COVID-19 patient discovery and the ability of governments and health organizations to use the results for effective decision making. We suggest a framework for testing that balances the maximal discovery of positive individuals with the need for population-based surveillance aimed at understanding disease spread and characteristics. This framework draws from similar approaches to prioritization in the domain of cyber-security based on ranking individuals using a risk score and then reserving a portion of the capacity for random sampling. This approach is an application of Multi-Armed-Bandits maximizing exploration/exploitation of the underlying distribution. We find that individuals can be ranked for effective testing using a few simple features, and that ranking them using such models we can capture 65% (CI: 64.7%-68.3%) of the positive individuals using less than 20% of the testing capacity or 92.1% (CI: 91.1%-93.2%) of positives individuals using 70% of the capacity, allowing reserving a significant portion of the tests for population studies. Our approach allows experts and decision-makers to tailor the resulting policies as needed allowing transparency into the ranking policy and the ability to understand the disease spread in the population and react quickly and in an informed manner.","Grushka-Cohen, Hagit; Cohen, Raphael; Shapira, Bracha; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Rokach, Lior",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14805v1.pdf,132

Study subjects (N = 342) were retrospectively enrolled after being confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive, and their nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and sputum specimens were restored for SARS-CoV-2 retesting and respiratory pathogen detection. The majority of the subjects (96.5%, N = 330) were confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive using NPS/OPS specimens. Among the COVID-19 patients (N = 342), 7.9% (N = 27) and 0.9% (N = 3) were coinfected with respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, respectively, yielding an 8.8% (N = 30) overall respiratory pathogen coinfection rate. Of the respiratory virus coinfection cases (N = 27), 92.6% (N = 25) were coinfected with a single respiratory virus and 7.4% (N = 2) with two viruses (metapneumovirus/adenovirus and rhinovirus/bocavirus). No triple coinfections of other respiratory viruses or bacteria with SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Respiratory viruses coinfected in the patients with COVID-19 were as follows: rhinovirus (N = 7, 2.1%), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (N = 6, 1.8%), non-SARS-CoV-2 coronaviruses (229E, NL63, and OC43, N = 5, 1.5%), metapneumovirus (N = 4, 1.2%), influenza A (N = 3, 0.9%), adenovirus (N = 3, 0.9%), and bocavirus (N = 1, 0.3%). In conclusion, the diagnostic value of utilizing NPS/OPS specimens is excellent, and, as the first report in Korea, coinfection with respiratory pathogens was detected at a rate of 8.8% in patients with COVID-19.

The regional Emergency Medical System (EMS) founded itself facing an exponential increase in hospitalizations with a consequent organizational system crisis. Experts from Cina, UK and US suggested to reconsider thrombolysis as the best treatment in term of balance between time consumption and operators safety for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients respect to primary PCI (pPCI). The system reorganization consisted in a centralization of all the emergency nets: from 55 hospitals with cardiac catheterization laboratories distributed within our region offering a 24/7 service we passed to 13 Hub and 42 Spoke centres. Dedicated in-hospital paths for patients COVID positive or suspected (pCOV+) and COVID negative (pCOV-) were instituted. We analysed all consecutive patients undergoing emergency coronary angiogram from March 14 to April 14, 2020 at San Carlo Hospital in Milan comparing the two different in-hospital paths. We collected 30 STEMI patients. Eighteen patients (60%) were treated in pCOV-, while twelve patients (40%) in pCOV+. No significant differences were found among the two groups regarding key time points of STEMI care and interestingly we didn't find any treatment delay in pCOV+. In conclusion, a focused overhaul of the EMS may allow to maintain pPCI as the treatment of choice for patients and operators.","Tumminello, Gabriele; Barbieri, Lucia; Lucreziotti, Stefano; Gentile, Domitilla; Conconi, Barbara; Centola, Marco; Mafrici, Antonio; Carugo, Stefano",Int J Cardiol Heart Vasc,,132

There were 34,046 notifications, of which 4935 (14.49%) people were diagnosed with COVID-19. Of these, 282 (5.71%) required hospital care and 40 (0.81%) died. Age and presence of associated comorbidities were decisive in the variations of incidence and lethality rates. In general, young people were the most affected and the elderly people, the most exposed to the serious and lethal form (p < 0.0001). Comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiopathies increased 33.5 times the death risk. The dispersion of the virus was centrifugal, in the inter as well as in the intra-municipal level. The disorderly implementation of municipal decrees applied in a decentralized manner in the municipalities seems to have contributed for the incidence rates increasing in the EW 25 and 26.","Policarpo, Deborah Araujo; Lourenzatto, Eduarda Cristina Alves; Brito, Talita Costa E Silva; Rossi, Daise Aparecida; de Melo, Roberta Torres",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,132

The SARS-CoV-2 infection depends on ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CD147, which are expressed on host cells. Several studies suggest that some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ACE2 might be a risk factor of COVID-19 infection. Genotypes affect ACE2 structure, its serum concentration, and levels of circulating angiotensin (1-7). Moreover, there is evidence that ACE genotype affects the outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treatment, the most severe consequence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 morbidity, infection course, and mortality might depend on ACE D allele frequency. The aim of this narrative review was to analyze and identify the mechanisms of ACE-I and ARBs with particular emphasis on angiotensin receptors and their polymorphism in the light of COVID-19 pandemic as these medications are commonly prescribed to elderly patients. There is no direct evidence yet for ACE-I or ARBs in the treatment of COVID-19. However, for those already taking these medications, both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology recommend continuing the treatment, because at present, there is no clear clinical or scientific evidence to justify the discontinuation of ACE-I or ARBs. Individualized treatment decisions should be based on the clinical condition and co-morbidities of each patient.","Sienko, Jerzy; Kotowski, Maciej; Bogacz, Anna; Lechowicz, Kacper; Drozdzal, Sylwester; Rosik, Jakub; Sietnicki, Marek; Sienko, Magdalena; Kotfis, Katarzyna",Clin Interv Aging,,132

METHODS: Participants were 273 [M (SD) age = 22 (2.1) years, 55% female, 32% from minoritized groups] EA completed an online survey of adherence to 11 preventative health behaviors recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during summer 2020. Participants rated adherence via a visual analog scale. Participants also reported demographic information and completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA). RESULTS: Median levels of adherence to preventative recommendations ranged from 66% to 100%. Highest adherence levels (Mdn > 90%) were reported for quarantining if exposed to COVID-19; covering mouth when sneezing; avoiding the elderly/those at high risk; and avoiding large gatherings. Median adherence was <80% for mask wearing; maintaining a 6-foot distance; avoiding in-person visits with romantic partners or friends; and disinfecting surfaces. Female gender was the only variable significantly associated with overall adherence, and it explained 4% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: Following guidelines related to social distancing practices may be particularly challenging for EA, possibly because of unique developmental needs of this group, and males may be at greater risk for non-adherence to CDC recommendations. Therefore, public health messaging and adherence intervention development should be designed with males and social distancing practices in mind.","Feldman, Estée C H; Balistreri, Kathryn A; Lampert, Sara; Durkin, Lindsay K; Bugno, Lindsey T; Davies, W Hobart; Greenley, Rachel Neff",J Pediatr Psychol,,132

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic social distancing restrictions, performing virtual site visits was piloted. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to describe the first pilot ACS pediatric trauma center virtual reverification visit performed in the United States. METHODS: This is a descriptive review of a 2020 pilot virtual Level I pediatric trauma center reverification visit. In-person site visit checklists were altered to adjust to the virtual format. All documents, prereview questionnaire, patient charts, and resource documents were prepared electronically. Collaboration with the departments of information technology, clinical education and informatics, and the general counsel's office prepared the infrastructure to allow reviewers access to protected health information. RESULTS: Multiple hospital departments collaborated to facilitate the transition to an electronic format. Organized virtual meeting room scheduling, communications, and coordination between the ACS staff, the reviewers, and the various hospital departments resulted in a successful virtual visit. CONCLUSION: Lessons learned and opportunities for improvement were identified for this first-ever pilot virtual pediatric trauma center reverification site visit. Once the information technology logistic questions were answered, allowing reviewers protected health information access, the general program and document preparation for a virtual trauma reverification site visit was similar to an in-person site visit. Although the review day agenda was similar, execution challenges were identified.","McMahon, Maria F",J Trauma Nurs,,132

456414,Diabetes Apps: Information about COVID-19 and Risk Factors?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Train is a common mode of public transport across the globe; however, the risk of COVID-19 transmission among individual train passengers remains unclear. METHODS: We quantified the transmission risk of COVID-19 on high-speed train passengers using data from 2,334 index patients and 72,093 close contacts who had co-travel times of 0-8 hours from 19 December 2019 through 6 March 2020 in China. We analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of COVID-19 transmission among train passengers to elucidate the associations between infection, spatial distance, and co-travel time. RESULTS: The attack rate in train passengers on seats within a distance of 3 rows and 5 columns of the index patient varied from 0 to 10.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3% - 19.0%), with a mean of 0.32% (95%CI 0.29% - 0.37%). Passengers in seats on the same row as the index patient had an average attack rate of 1.5% (95%CI 1.3% - 1.8%), higher than that in other rows (0.14%, 95%CI 0.11% - 0.17%), with a relative risk (RR) of 11.2 (95%CI 8.6 -14.6). Travellers adjacent to the index patient had the highest attack rate (3.5%, 95%CI 2.9% - 4.3%) of COVID-19 infections (RR 18.0, 95%CI 13.9 - 23.4) among all seats. The attack rate decreased with increasing distance, but it increased with increasing co-travel time. The attack rate increased on average by 0.15% (p = 0.005) per hour of co-travel; for passengers at adjacent seats, this increase was 1.3% (p = 0.008), the highest among all seats considered. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has a high transmission risk among train passengers, but this risk shows significant differences with co-travel time and seat location. During disease outbreaks, when travelling on public transportation in confined spaces such as trains, measures should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, including increasing seat distance, reducing passenger density, and use of personal hygiene protection.","Hu, Maogui; Lin, Hui; Wang, Jinfeng; Xu, Chengdong; Tatem, Andrew J; Meng, Bin; Zhang, Xin; Liu, Yifeng; Wang, Pengda; Wu, Guizhen; Xie, Haiyong; Lai, Shengjie",Clin. infect. dis,,132

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be the key legal framework with regard to using and sharing European digital health data for research purposes. However, concerns persist that the GDPR has made many organizations very risk-averse in terms of data sharing, even if the regulation permits such sharing. Health care organizations focusing on individual risk minimization threaten to undermine COVID-19 research efforts. In our opinion, there is an ethical obligation to use the research exemption clause of the GDPR during the COVID-19 pandemic to support global collaborative health research efforts.

The molecular determinants underlying the neutralization of the virus remain, however, incompletely understood. Here, we show that the ability of antibodies to disrupt the binding of the viral spike protein to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor on the cell, the key molecular event initiating SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, is controlled by the affinity of these antibodies to the viral antigen. By using microfluidic antibody-affinity profiling, we were able to quantify the serum-antibody mediated inhibition of ACE2-spike binding in two SARS-CoV-2 seropositive individuals. Measurements to determine the affinity, concentration, and neutralization potential of antibodies were performed directly in human serum. Using this approach, we demonstrate that the level of inhibition in both samples can be quantitatively described using the dissociation constants (KD) of the binary interactions between the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein as well as the spike protein and the neutralizing antibody. These experiments represent a new type of in-solution receptor binding competition assay, which has further potential applications, ranging from decisions on donor selection for convalescent plasma therapy, to identification of lead candidates in therapeutic antibody development, and vaccine development.","Fiedler, Sebastian; Piziorska, Monika A; Denninger, Viola; Morgunov, Alexey S; Ilsley, Alison; Malik, Anisa Y; Schneider, Matthias M; Devenish, Sean R A; Meisl, Georg; Kosmoliaptsis, Vasilis; Aguzzi, Adriano; Fiegler, Heike; Knowles, Tuomas P J",ACS infect. dis,,132

Finally, we longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that â¼20% of these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins.

We assume that the concentration of infectious particles is governed by an advection-diffusion-reaction equation with the particles advected by airflow, diffused due to turbulence, emitted by infected people and removed due to the room ventilation, inactivation of the virus and gravitational settling. We consider one asymptomatic or presymptomatic infectious person who breathes or talks, with or without a mask and model a quasi-3D setup that incorporates a recirculating air-conditioning flow. A semi-analytic solution is available and this enables fast simulations. We quantify the effect of ventilation and particle emission rate on the particle concentration, infection risk and the `time to probable infection' (TTPI). Good agreement with CFD models is achieved. Furthermore, we derive power laws that quantify the effect of ventilation, emission rate and infectiousness of the virus on the TTPI. The model can be easily updated to take into account modified parameter values.

The pathological process of OA is complex and characterized by the imbalance between the synthesis and catabolism of chondrocytes and extracellular matrix, leading to the progressive destruction of articular cartilage damage. Because of the self-renewal and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), various exogenous MSC-based cell therapies have been developed to treat OA. Moreover, the efficacy of MSC- based therapy is mainly attributed to the paracrine of cytokines, growth factors, and exosomes. Exosomes derived from MSCs can deliver various DNAs, RNAs, proteins and lipids, thus promoting MSCs migration and cartilage repair. Therefore, MSC-derived exosomes are considered as a promising alternative therapy for OA.

People are the primary asset of any organization and help achieve their goals. Accordingly, to manage human resources sustainably, the organizational strategy review is an appropriate retort. Objective: The purpose of this comprehensive review study is to identify unknown challenges, strategies, and unusual decisions related to human resource management other than clinical organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The study applied a narrative review approach dissection based on organizations' human resource management strategies to combat the COVID-19 impacts. The review study conducted published literature research through the electronic databases at Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and LISTA. The study extracted 1281 articles from the mentioned databases from November 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. This study reviewed selected papers, included 15 relevant articles, and removed duplicates according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the study developed a conceptual framework of human resource management strategies based on the literature findings to fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic posed numerous adverse consequences, such as economic shock, global health crisis, change in social behaviors, and challenges at the organization level to continue business operations. Besides, the strategies included flexibility, strengthening internal efficiency, talent acquisition, and making innovative changes based on organizational assessment and needs for smooth business activities. Conclusion: The appropriate human resource management strategies implementations would increase employees' mental well-being, satisfaction, productivity, motivation, and health safety at the workplace.","Azizi, Mohammad Reza; Atlasi, Rasha; Ziapour, Arash; Abbas, Jaffar; Naemi, Roya",Heliyon,,132

465292,Post-intubation tracheal stenosis after severe COVID-19 infection: A report of two cases,2021,"The tribal belt of the Hindu Kush mountains is famous for its unique culture, ethnography, wild food plants, food systems, and traditional knowledge. People in this region gather wild plants and plant parts using them directly or in traditional cuisine, or sell them in local markets. However, there is a huge lack of documentation of the food system, particularly that related to wild food plants (WFP). In the current study, we focus on the uses and contributions of WFPs in the traditional tribal food system of the Hindu Kush valleys along the Pakistan–Afghanistan border. Ethnobotanical data were gathered through questionnaire surveys of 84 informants, including 69 men and 15 women, belonging to 21 different villages of the chosen area. In tribal societies men and women rarely mix and thus very few women took part in the surveys. We documented 63 WFP species belonging to 34 botanical families, of which 27 were used as vegetables, 24 as fruits, six in different kinds of chutneys (starters), and six as fresh food species. Fruits were the most used part (41%), followed by leaves (24%), aerial parts (24%), seeds (7%), stems (3%), and young inflorescences (1%). The reported uses of Carthamus oxyacantha, Pinus roxburghii seeds, and Marsilea quadrifolia leaves are novel for the gastronomy of Pakistan. The results reveal that WFPs provide a significant contribution to local food systems and play a role in addressing human nutritional needs, which are usually not met through farming practices. The tribal peoples of the Hindu Kush use WFPs for their nutritional value, but also as a cultural practice—an inseparable component of the tribal community’s lifestyle. This important traditional knowledge about the gathering and consumption of WFPs, however, is eroding at an alarming rate among younger generations due to the introduction of fast-food, modernization, and globalization. Therefore, appropriate strategies are imperative not only to safeguard traditional plants and food knowledge and practices, as well as the cultural heritage attached to them, but also to foster food security and thus public healthcare via local wild foods in the region.","Abdullah, Abdullah Khan Shujaul Mulk Pieroni Andrea Haq Aminul Zahoor Ul Haq Ahmad Zeeshan Sakhi Shazia Hashem Abeer Al-Bandari Fahad Al-Arjani Alqarawi Abdulaziz A.; Elsayed Fathi, Abd Allah",Sustainability,,132

Simple mathematical modelling is used in the context of a single, relatively closed workplace such as a factory or back-office where, in normal operation, each worker has lengthy interactions with a fixed set of colleagues. A discrete-time SEIR model on a fixed interaction graph is simulated with parameters that are motivated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic in the UK during a post-peak phase, including a small risk of viral infection from outside the working environment. Two kinds of worker are assumed, transparents who regularly test, share their results with colleagues and isolate as soon as a contact tests positive for the disease, and opaques who do none of these. Moreover, the simulations are constructed as a 'playable model' in which the transparency level, disease parameters and mean interaction degree can be varied by the user. The model is also analysed in the continuum limit. All simulations point to the double benefit of transparency in both maximizing productivity and minimizing overall infection rates. Based on these findings, public policy implications are discussed for how to incentivise this mutually beneficial behaviour in different kinds of workplace, and simple recommendations are made.","Wey, Arkady; Champneys, Alan; Dyson, Rosemary J; Alwan, Nisreen A; Barker, Mary",J R Soc Interface,,132

METHODS: This study analyzed a retrospective cohort of 103 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Demographic data, past medical history, and hospital course were collected and analyzed. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was implemented to examine associations. RESULTS: From February 17 to April 5, 103 consecutive patients were hospitalized with COVID-19. Among them, 44 patients (42.7%) were admitted to the ICU, and 29 (65.9%) required IMV. The prevalence of obesity was 47.5% (49 of 103). In a multivariate analysis, severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2 ) was associated with ICU admission (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.13-25.64). Moreover, patients who required IMV were more likely to have had heart disease (aOR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.05-11.06), obesity (BMI = 30-34.9 kg/m2 ; aOR: 6.85, 95% CI: 1.05-44.82), or severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2 ; aOR: 9.99, 95% CI: 1.39-71.69). CONCLUSIONS: In our analysis, severe obesity (BMI &#8805; 35 kg/m2 ) was associated with ICU admission, whereas history of heart disease and obesity (BMI &#8805; 30 kg/m2 ) were independently associated with the use of IMV. Increased vigilance and aggressive treatment of patients with obesity and COVID-19 are warranted.","Kalligeros, Markos; Shehadeh, Fadi; Mylona, Evangelia K; Benitez, Gregorio; Beckwith, Curt G; Chan, Philip A; Mylonakis, Eleftherios",Obesity (Silver Spring),,132

However, most implemented SARS-CoV-2 wastewater surveillance projects were relying on qPCR measurement of virus titers and did not address the mutational spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 circulating in the population. MethodsWe have implemented a nanopore RNA sequencing monitoring system in the city of Nice (France, 550,000 inhabitants). Between October 2020 and March 2021, we monthly analyzed the SARS-CoV-2 variants in 113 wastewater samples collected in the main wastewater treatment plant and 20 neighborhoods. FindingsWe initially detected the lineages predominant in Europe at the end of 2020 (B.1.160, B.1.177, B.1.367, B.1.474, and B.1.221). In January, a localized emergence of a variant (Spike:A522S) of the B.1.1.7 lineage occurred in one neighborhood. It rapidly spread and became dominant all over the city. Other variants of concern (B.1.351, P.1) were also detected in some neighborhoods, but at low frequency. Comparison with individual clinical samples collected during the same week showed that wastewater sequencing correctly identified the same lineages as those found in COVID-19 patients. InterpretationWastewater sequencing allowed to document the diversity of SARS-CoV-2 sequences within the different neighborhoods of the city of Nice. Our results illustrate how sequencing of sewage samples can be used to track pathogen sequence diversity in the current pandemics and in future infectious disease outbreaks.","Rios, Geraldine; Lacoux, Caroline; Leclercq, Vianney; Diamant, Anna; Lebrigand, Kevin; Lazuka, Adele; Soyeux, Emmanuel; Lacroix, Sebastien; Fassy, Julien; Couesnon, Aurelie; Thiery, Richard; Mari, Bernard; Pradier, Christian; Waldmann, Rainer; Barbry, Pascal",,,132

We utilized confirmed cases outside Hubei Province to analyze epidemiologic characteristics and evaluate the effect of traffic restrictions implemented in Hubei beginning on 23 January 2020. METHODS: Information on 7015 confirmed cases from 19 January to 8 February 2020 in all provinces outside Hubei was collected from the national and local health commissions in China. Incubation period and interval times were calculated using dates of the following events: contact with an infected person, onset, first visit, and diagnosis. We evaluated changes in incubation period and interval times. RESULTS: The average age of all cases was 44.24 years. The median incubation period was 5 days and extended from 2 days on 23 January to 15 days on 8 February. The proportion of imported cases decreased from 85.71% to 33.19% after 23 January. In addition, lengths of intervals between onset and diagnosis, onset and first visit, and first visit and diagnosis decreased over time.

Currently, global health is facing its devastating outbreak. However, there is no vaccine available against this virus up to now. In this study, a novel multi-epitope vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was designed to provoke both innate and adaptive immune responses. The immunodominant regions of six non-structural proteins (nsp7, nsp8, nsp9, nsp10, nsp12 and nsp14) of SARS-CoV-2 were selected by multiple immunoinformatic tools to provoke T cell immune response. Also, immunodominant fragment of the functional region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (400-510 residues) protein was selected for inducing neutralizing antibodies production. The selected regions' sequences were connected to each other by furin-sensitive linker (RVRR). Moreover, the functional region of ß-defensin as a well-known agonist for the TLR-4/MD complex was added at the N-terminus of the vaccine using (EAAAK)3 linker. Also, a CD4 + T-helper epitope, PADRE, was used at the C-terminal of the vaccine by GPGPG and A(EAAAK)2A linkers to form the final vaccine construct. The physicochemical properties, allergenicity, antigenicity, functionality and population coverage of the final vaccine construct were analyzed. The final vaccine construct was an immunogenic, non-allergen and unfunctional protein which contained multiple CD8 + and CD4 + overlapping epitopes, IFN-Î³ inducing epitopes, linear and conformational B cell epitopes. It could form stable and significant interactions with TLR-4/MD according to molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Global population coverage of the vaccine for HLA-I and II were estimated 96.2% and 97.1%, respectively. At last, the final vaccine construct was reverse translated to design the DNA vaccine. Although the designed vaccine exhibited high efficacy in silico, further experimental validation is necessary.","Safavi, Ashkan; Kefayat, Amirhosein; Mahdevar, Elham; Abiri, Ardavan; Ghahremani, Fatemeh",Vaccine,,132

478742,COVID-19: Impact of obesity and diabetes on disease severity,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To define the epidemiological curve of COVID-19 in Qatar and determine factors associated with severe or critical illness. DESIGN: Case series of first 5685 COVID-19 cases in Qatar. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: All confirmed COVID-19 cases in the State of Qatar between 28 February and 18 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of total and daily new COVID-19 infections; demographic characteristics and comorbidity burden and severity of infection; factors associated with severe or critical illness. RESULTS: Between 28 February and 18 April 2020, 5685 cases of COVID-19 were identified. Median age was 34 (IQR 28-43) years, 88.9% were male and 8.7% were Qatari nationals. Overall, 83.6% had no concomitant comorbidity, and 3.0% had three or more comorbidities. The overwhelming majority (90.9%) were asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms, with 2.0% having severe or critical illness. Seven deaths were observed during the time interval studied. Presence of hypertension or diabetes was associated with a higher risk of severe or critical illness, but age was not. The epidemiological curve indicated two distinct patterns of infection, a larger cluster among expatriate craft and manual workers and a smaller one among Qatari nationals returning from abroad during the epidemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 infections in Qatar started in two distinct clusters, but then became more widespread in the population through community transmission. Infections were mostly asymptomatic or with minimal symptoms and associated with very low mortality. Severe/critical illness was associated with presence of hypertension or diabetes but not with increasing age.","Al Kuwari, Hanan M; Abdul Rahim, Hanan F; Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Abou-Samra, Abdul-Badi; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Al Marri, Salih; Al Masalmani, Muna; Al Romaihi, Hamad E; Al Thani, Mohamed H; Coyle, Peter V; Latif, Ali N; Owen, Robert; Bertollini, Roberto; Butt, Adeel Ajwad",BMJ Open,,132

481299,Nutritional status is closely related to the severity of COVID-19: a multi-center retrospective study,2021,"Importance: During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer therapy may put patients at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality. The impacts of proposed alternatives on reducing infection risk are unknown. Objective: To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with the risks and benefits of standard radiation therapy (RT). Design, Setting, and Participants: This comparative effectiveness study used estimated individual patient-level data extracted from published Kaplan-Meier survival figures from 8 randomized clinical trials across oncology from 1993 to 2014 that evaluated the inclusion of RT or compared different RT fractionation regimens. Included trials were Dutch TME and TROG 01.04 examining rectal cancer; CALGB 9343, OCOG hypofractionation trial, FAST-Forward, and NSABP B-39 examining early stage breast cancer, and CHHiP and HYPO-RT-PC examining prostate cancer. Risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mortality associated with receipt of RT in the treatment arms were simulated and trials were reanalyzed. Data were analyzed between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Exposures: COVID-19 risk associated with treatment was simulated across different pandemic scenarios, varying infection risk per fractions (IRFs) and case fatality rates (CFRs). Main Outcomes and Measures: Overall survival was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards modeling under different pandemic scenarios. Results: Estimated IPLD from a total of 14â¯170 patients were included in the simulations. In scenarios with low COVID-19-associated risks (IRF, 0.5%; CFR, 5%), fractionation was not significantly associated with outcomes. In locally advanced rectal cancer, short-course RT was associated with better outcomes than long-course chemoradiation (TROG 01.04) and was associated with similar outcomes as RT omission (Dutch TME) in most settings (eg, TROG 01.04 median HR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.46-0.96]; Dutch TME median HR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.80-1.03] in a scenario with IRF 5% and CFR 20%). Moderate hypofractionation in early stage breast cancer (OCOG hypofractionation trial) and prostate cancer (CHHiP) was not associated with survival benefits in the setting of COVID-19 (eg, OCOG hypofractionation trial median HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.74-1.06]; CHHiP median HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.75-1.01] under high-risk scenario with IRF 10% and CFR 30%). More aggressive hypofractionation (FAST-Forward, HYPO-RT-PC) and accelerated partial breast irradiation (NSABP B-39) were associated with improved survival in higher risk scenarios (eg, FAST-Forward median HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.68]; HYPO-RT-PC median HR, 0.60 [95% CI, 0.48-0.75] under scenario with IRF 10% and CFR 30%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this comparative effectiveness study of data from 8 clinical trials of patients receiving radiation therapy to simulate COVID-19 risk and mortality rates, treatment modification was not associated with altered risk from COVID-19 in lower-risk scenarios and was only associated with decreased mortality in very high COVID-19-risk scenarios. This model, which can be adapted to dynamic changes in COVID-19 risk, provides a flexible, quantitative approach to assess the potential impact of treatment modifications and supports the continued delivery of standard evidence-based care with appropriate precautions against COVID-19.","Tabrizi, Shervin; Trippa, Lorenzo; Cagney, Daniel; Aizer, Ayal A; Tanguturi, Shyam; Ventz, Steffen; Fell, Geoffrey; Bellon, Jennifer R; Mamon, Harvey; Nguyen, Paul L; D039,; Amico, Anthony V; Haas-Kogan, Daphne; Alexander, Brian M; Rahman, Rifaquat",JAMA Netw Open,,132

Therefore, this study aimed to characterize them using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: A total of 90 patients with intact cerebellar hemispheres and intracranial dural sinuses underwent thin-sliced, contrast-enhanced MRI. RESULTS: The BVs were classified into six routes based on the draining pattern into the dural sinuses. The superior vermian vein emptying into the straight sinus was delineated in 100% of the patients. The inferior vermian vein emptying into the confluence of the sinuses was identified in 66.7% of the patients. The inferior hemispheric and cerebellar cortical veins emptying into the transverse sinus were identified in 54.4% and 26.7% of the patients, respectively. The inferior vermian and cerebellar cortical veins emptying into the straight sinus were identified in 77.8% and 12.2% of the patients, respectively. The cerebellar cortical vein emptying into the tentorial sinus was identified in 83.3% of the patients; it was delineated on 54 sides with an average number per right hemisphere of 1.9 and 63 sides with an average number per left hemisphere of 2. The pontine-trigeminal and anterior hemispheric veins emptying into the superior petrosal sinus were identified in 42.2% of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: The BVs of the cerebellum can be classified into six distinct routes. Radiological classification may be useful for understanding the drainage pattern of the cerebellum.","Tsutsumi, Satoshi; Ono, Hideo; Ishii, Hisato",,,132

DTMs have been used to advantage for multi-locus species tree estimation, enabling highly accurate species trees at reduced computational effort, compared to leading species tree estimation methods. Here, we evaluate the feasibility of using DTMs to improve the scalability of maximum likelihood (ML) gene tree estimation to large numbers of input sequences.

483026,The Limitations of Social Behaviour Imposed by CoVid-19 Impacted the Perception and the Evolution of Peripheral Arterial Disease Negatively,2021,"MOTIVATION: Integration of viruses into infected host cell DNA can cause DNA damage and disrupt genes. Recent cost reductions and growth of whole genome sequencing has produced a wealth of data in which viral presence and integration detection is possible. While key research and clinically relevant insights can be uncovered, existing software has not achieved widespread adoption, limited in part due to high computational costs, the inability to detect a wide range of viruses, as well as precision and sensitivity. RESULTS: Here, we describe VIRUSBreakend, a high-speed tool that identifies viral DNA presence and genomic integration. It utilizes single breakends, breakpoints in which only one side can be unambiguously placed, in a novel virus-centric variant calling and assembly approach to identify viral integrations with high sensitivity and a near-zero false discovery rate. VIRUSBreakend detects viral integrations anywhere in the host genome including regions such as centromeres and telomeres unable to be called by existing tools. Applying VIRUSBreakend to a large metastatic cancer cohort, we demonstrate that it can reliably detect clinically relevant viral presence and integration including HPV, HBV, MCPyV, EBV, and HHV-8.

This review first summarizes the developing research on sleep during the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic on sleep is then examined through the lens of the 3P model of insomnia by proposing pandemic-specific predisposing, precipitating, and perpetuating factors. The potential consequences of sleep disturbance on physical and mental health conditions most relevant to the pandemic are also reviewed. Finally, recommendations for reducing or eliminating pandemic-specific perpetuating factors are detailed, highlighting the potential utility of behavioral sleep medicine interventions in the integration of behavioral health responses and public health initiatives during and after the pandemic.

The decision to choose specific equipment should be based on the protection factors and also on the overall analysis of given conditions. International scientific databases, such as Web of Science, PubMed and MedLine, were searched on May 5, 2020, with the following key words: COVID-19, respiratory protection, surgical masks, filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) and disposable respirators. The differences between various respiratory protective equipment, i.e., surgical masks, respirators such as FFRs, elastomeric half-facepiece respirators, elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs), were compared. Reusable elastomeric respirators (RERs) may provide a better adaptation to the face and may be more stable when used by healthcare providers (HCPs). Protection factors were found to be higher in FFRs compared to surgical masks. While FFRs provide a one-tenth decrease in the inhaled aerosol concentration, PAPRs diminish the inhaled aerosol up to one-twenty-fifth. Even with some full-face PAPRs and helmets, the protection factor assigned by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration can reach a value up to 1000. For HCPs, the evidence shown in this article provides an additional support for the utilization of RERs. Such equipment might be less prone to leakages, can provide a better fit, and indicates a better stability compared to disposable FFRs (N95 and similar). By providing higher protection factors, reusable elastomeric respirators are recommended to be used by HCPs under controlled cleaning and disinfection protocols.","Sozkes, Sarkis; Sozkes, Serda",Int. j. occup. med. environ. health,,132

484921,Should we ventilate elderly patients with COVID-19?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The prone position (PP) is increasingly used in mechanically ventilated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients. However, studies investigating the influence of the PP are currently lacking in these patients. This is the first study to investigate the influence of the PP on the oxygenation and decarboxylation in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A prospective bicentric study design was used, and in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, PP was indicated from a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) ratio of <200. Patients were left prone for 16 h each. Pressure levels, FIO2, were adjusted to ensure a PaO2 greater than 60 mmHg. Blood gas analyses were performed before (baseline 0.5 h), during (1/2/5.5/9.5/13 h), and after being in the PP (1 h), the circulatory/ventilation parameters were continuously monitored, and lung compliance (LC) was roughly calculated. Responders were defined compared to the baseline value (PaO2/FIO2 ratio increase of &#8805;15%; partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) decrease of &#8805;2%). RESULTS: 13 patients were included and 36 PP sessions were conducted. Overall, PaO2/FIO2 increased significantly in the PP (p < 0.001). Most PaO2/FIO2 responders (29/36 PP sessions, 77%) were identified 9.5 h after turning prone (14% slow responders), while most PaCO2 responders (15/36 PP sessions, 42%) were identified 13 h after turning prone. A subgroup of patients (interval intubation to PP &#8805;3 days) showed less PaO2/FIO2 responders (16% vs. 77%). An increase in PaCO2 and minute ventilation in the PP showed a significant negative correlation (p < 0.001). LC (median before the PP = 38 mL/cm H2O; two patients with LC >80 mL/cm H2O) showed a significant positive correlation with the 28 day survival of patients (p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The PP significantly improves oxygenation in COVID-19 ARDS patients. The data suggest that they also benefit most from an early PP. A decrease in minute ventilation may result in fewer PaCO2 responders. LC may be a predictive outcome parameter in COVID-19 patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Retrospectively registered.","Vollenberg, Richard; Matern, Philipp; Nowacki, Tobias; Fuhrmann, Valentin; Padberg, Jan-Sören; Ochs, Kevin; Schütte-Nütgen, Katharina; Strauß, Markus; Schmidt, Hartmut; Tepasse, Phil-Robin",,,132

This study aimed at probing how the media would affect the public's preventive behavior and excessive preventive intention accordingly. Data were collected from 653 respondents in the Chinese mainland through online questionnaires and further analyzed by using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Taking risk perception, negative emotions, and subjective norms as mediators, this study explored the impact of mass media exposure and social networking services involvement on preventive behavior and excessive preventive intention. Based on differences in the severity of the pandemic, the samples were divided into the Wuhan group and other regions group for multi-group comparison. The results showed that mass media exposure had a significant positive impact on subjective norms; moreover, mass media exposure could significantly enhance preventive behavior through subjective norms, and social networking services involvement had a significant positive impact on negative emotions; meanwhile, social networking services involvement promoted excessive preventive intention through negative emotions.","Liu, Liqun; Xie, Jingzhong; Li, Ke; Ji, Suhe",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,132

486467,Supportive treatment of COVID 19 patients with mild respiratory failure in a primary hospital,2020,"PURPOSE: To understand readiness measures taken by oncologists to protect patients and health care workers from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and how their clinical decision making was influenced by the pandemic. METHODS: An online survey was conducted between March 24 and April 29, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 343 oncologists from 28 countries participated. The median age was 43 years (range, 29-68 years), and the majority were male (62%). At the time of the survey, nearly all participants self-reported an outbreak in their country (99.7%). Personal protective equipment was available to all participants, of which surgical mask was the most common (n = 308; 90%). Telemedicine, in the form of phone or video encounters, was common and implemented by 80% (n = 273). Testing patients with cancer for COVID-19 via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction before systemic treatment was not routinely implemented: 58% reported no routine testing, 39% performed testing in selected patients, and 3% performed systematic testing in all patients. The most significant factors influencing an oncologist's decision making regarding choice of systemic therapy included patient age and comorbidities (81% and 92%, respectively). Although hormonal treatments and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were considered to be relatively safe, cytotoxic chemotherapy and immune therapies were perceived as being less safe or unsafe by participants. The vast majority of participants stated that during the pandemic they would use less chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and steroids. Although treatment in neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and first-line metastatic disease was less affected, most of the participants stated that they would be more hesitant to recommend second- or third-line therapies in metastatic disease. CONCLUSION: Decision making by oncologists has been significantly influenced by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Ürün, Yüksel; Hussain, Syed A; Bakouny, Ziad; Castellano, Daniel; Kiliçkap, Saadettin; Morgan, Gilberto; Mckay, Rana R; Pels, Kevin; Schmidt, Andrew; Doroshow, Deborah B; Schütz, Fábio; Albiges, Laurence; Lopes, Gilberto; Catto, James W F; Peters, Solange; Choueiri, Toni K",JCO Glob Oncol,,132

Seventy-six patients recovered from COVID-19, including 66 cases of moderate pneumonia and 10 cases of severe pneumonia were enrolled in the observation group. The control group consisted of 55 age-matched healthy subjects. The thickness and length of spleen were measured by using B-ultrasound and the levels of T lymphocytes were detected by flow cytometry. Results showed that the mean length of spleen in the observation group was 89.57 ± 11.49 mm, which was significantly reduced compared with that in the control group (103.82 ± 11.29 mm, p < 0.001). The mean thicknesses of spleen between observation group and control group were 29.97 ± 4.04 mm and 32.45 ± 4.49 mm, respectively, and the difference was significant (p < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in the size of spleen between common pneumonia and severe pneumonia (p > 0.05). In addition, the decreased count of T lymphocyte was observed in part of recovered patients. The counts of T suppressor lymphocytes in patients with severe pneumonia were significantly decreased compared with those with moderate pneumonia (p = 0.005).

Although venous thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients have been well described, data on arterial thrombosis (AT) in these patients is still limited. We, therefore, conducted a rapid systematic review of current scientific literature to identify and consolidate evidence of AT in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of literature was conducted between November 1, 2019, and June 9, 2020, on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure to identify potentially eligible studies. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies (5 cohort, 5 case series, and 17 case reports) describing arterial thrombotic events in 90 COVID-19 patients were included. The pooled incidence of AT in severe/critically ill intensive care unit-admitted COVID-19 patients across the 5 cohort studies was 4.4% (95% confidence interval 2.8-6.4). Most of the patients were male, elderly, and had comorbidities. AT was symptomatic in >95% of these patients and involved multiple arteries in approximately 18% of patients. The anatomical distribution of arterial thrombotic events was wide, occurring in limb arteries (39%), cerebral arteries (24%), great vessels (aorta, common iliac, common carotid, and brachiocephalic trunk; 19%), coronary arteries (9%), and superior mesenteric artery (8%). The mortality rate in these patients is approximately 20%. CONCLUSIONS: AT occurs in approximately 4% of critically ill COVID-19 patients. It often presents symptomatically and can affect multiple arteries. Further investigation of the underlying mechanism of AT in COVID-19 would be needed to clarify possible therapeutic targets.","Cheruiyot, Isaac; Kipkorir, Vincent; Ngure, Brian; Misiani, Musa; Munguti, Jeremiah; Ogeng039,; o, Julius",Ann. vasc. surg,,132

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the management of patients suddenly changed and telemedicine has been proven to be as effective as outpatient care. We elaborate the experience with Telemedicine of a Tertiary ALS Center from an Italian geographical area with high infectious risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: 19 patients were evaluated in telemedicine by a multidisciplinary team including a neurologist (clinical evaluation, intercurrent events, and drug prescriptions); a dietician (diet and weight monitoring); a psychologist (psychological assessment and support); and a physiotherapist (physiotherapy treatment and device prescription). Telemedicine was performed using the online platform ""IoMT Connected Care Platform (Ticuro Reply)."" RESULTS: All patients reported a positive perception of talking face to face with healthcare professionals and were satisfied with how the team understood their problems. During video televisits, there was a change in the patient's medication regimen in 11/19; 2/19 required pneumological evaluation and started NIV; and 9/16 patients required prescription of devices.

The uncontrollable spread and poor progression of COVID-19 have attracted much attention from all over the world. We designed this study to develop a prognostic nomogram incorporating Prognostic nutritional index (PNI) in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Patients confirmed with COVID-19 and treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January to February 2020 were included in this study. We used logistic regression analysis to find risk factors of mortality in these patients. A prognostic nomogram was constructed and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of PNI and this prognostic model. RESULTS: Comparison of baseline characteristics showed non-survivors had higher age (P < .001), male ratio (P = .038), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (P < .001), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P < .001), and PNI (P < .001) than survivors. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent risk factors of mortality in COVID-19 patients included white blood cell (WBC) (OR 1.285, P = .039), PNI (OR 0.790, P = .029), LDH (OR 1.011, P < .015). These three factors were combined to build the prognostic model. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) of only PNI and the prognostic model was 0.849 (95%Cl 0.811-0.888) and 0.950 (95%Cl 0.922-0.978), respectively. And calibration plot showed good stability of the prognostic model. CONCLUSION: This research indicates PNI is independently associated with the mortality of COVID-19 patients. Prognostic model incorporating PNI is beneficial for clinicians to evaluate progression and strengthen monitoring for COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Ruoran; He, Min; Yin, Wanhong; Liao, Xuelian; Wang, Bo; Jin, Xiaodong; Ma, Yao; Yue, Jirong; Bai, Lang; Liu, Dan; Zhu, Ting; Huang, Zhixin; Kang, Yan",J Clin Lab Anal,,132

490378,Hemodynamic Profiles of Shock in Patients With COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Since the beginning of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic there have been contradictions and speculations about the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19. Given that there is an association between vitamin D deficiency and some diseases - including cancer, autoimmune disease and some infectious diseases - a higher incidence and mortality rate in the vitamin-D-deficient COVID-19 population was not a surprise; conversely, some research would argue this relationship. Considering these contradictions, this study aimed to determine the relationship between prognosis and vitamin D level in cases with COVID-19. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 329 confirmed cases of COVID-19 - who were admitted to Kamkar-ArabNia Hospital in Qom city, Iran from March-July 2020 - were categorized into three groups according to vitamin D serum levels (ng/ml): sufficient (>30), insufficient (20-30) and deficient (<20). Prognosis was determined across the groups. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in hospital stay between patients with sufficient and insufficient vitamin D levels (P = 0.007). Adjusting vitamin D levels for confounding variables, linear regression underscored significant differences in the association between length of hospitalization and lower vitamin D levels, with a longer stay noted in insufficient groups (P = 0.002). However, there was no significant difference in the time interval to return to normal oxygen level (from SpO2 < 93%) or death rate between groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was a significant association between hospital stay and lower serum vitamin D levels. However, the relationship between vitamin D status and death rate or the time interval to return to normal oxygen levels was not significant.","Nasiri, Maryam; Khodadadi, Javad; Molaei, Sedigheh",Int J Infect Dis,,132

The spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 mediates entry into host cells, and thus is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here, we show that adjuvanted protein immunization with soluble SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers, stabilized in prefusion conformation1, results in potent antibody responses in mice and rhesus macaques, with neutralizing antibody titers exceeding those typically measured in SARS-CoV-2 seropositive humans by more than one order of magnitude. Neutralizing antibody responses were observed after a single dose, with exceptionally high titers achieved after boosting. A follow-up to monitor waning of the neutralizing antibody responses in rhesus macaques demonstrated durable responses that were maintained at high and stable levels at least 4 months after boosting. Taken together, these data support the development of adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 prefusion-stabilized spike protein subunit vaccines.","Mandolesi, Marco; Sheward, Daniel J; Hanke, Leo; Ma, Junjie; Pushparaj, Pradeepa; Vidakovics, Laura Perez; Kim, Changil; Adori, Monika; Lenart, Klara; Loré, Karin; Dopico, Xaquin Castro; Coquet, Jonathan M; McInerney, Gerald M; Karlsson Hedestam, Gunilla B; Murrell, Ben",Cell Rep Med,,132

Data were collected between 8 and 14 December 2020. A logistic regression analysis was employed to examine and identify the variables associated with vaccination intentions for COVID-19, with the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) also calculated. A total of 2137 respondents completed the questionnaire. Overall, about 48% of Saudi adults were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants had stronger intentions to receive a vaccination if they resided in the southern region (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.21-3.14), received the seasonal influenza vaccination in the past (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.17-1.97), believed in mandatory COVID-19 vaccination (OR: 45.07; 95% CI: 31.91-63.65), or reported high levels of concern about contracting COVID-19 (OR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.29-2.81). Participants were less likely to have an intention to be vaccinated if they had a history of vaccine refusal (OR: 0.28; 95% CI: 0.19-0.40). The low acceptance rate among the Saudi population should be targeted with multifaceted interventions aimed at raising awareness and emphasizing the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine.","Alfageeh, Eman Ibrahim; Alshareef, Noor; Angawi, Khadijah; Alhazmi, Fahad; Chirwa, Gowokani Chijere",,,132

We aimed to understand how physicians adapted to the sudden need for telehealth and if their perception of telehealth changed due to their experience during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed-methods study. We interviewed five Lebanese physicians and thematically analyzed the interviews. We developed a questionnaire based on the analysis results and administered it online to physicians in Lebanon. In total, 140 responses were collected. We found that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians engaged in more telehealth activities in the realms of telemedicine, public awareness, continuing medical education, research, administration, and teaching. They also expanded their repertoire of information-technology tools. Our results also show that there was a significant shift in the physicians' perceptions, indicating greater openness and willingness to adopt telehealth services. However, a significant amount of skepticism and uncertainty regarding telemedicine remains, especially concerning its efficiency, safety, and the adequacy of existing regulations. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for health IT policy makers, developers, and researchers, to sustain the continuity of telehealth activities beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Helou, Samar; El Helou, Elie; Abou-Khalil, Victoria; Wakim, Jad; El Helou, Jeanine; Daher, Alain; El Hachem, Charline",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,132

METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from King's College Hospital, London, reported to the National Heart Failure Audit for England and Wales, between 2 March-19 April 2020 were compared both to a pre-COVID cohort and the corresponding time periods in 2017 to 2019 with respect to absolute hospitalization rates. Furthermore, we performed detailed comparison of patients hospitalized during the COVID-19 pandemic and patients presenting in the same period in 2019 with respect to clinical characteristics and management during the index admission. A significantly lower admission rate for AHF was observed during the study period compared to all other included time periods. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 pandemic had higher rates of New York Heart Association III or IV symptoms (96% vs. 77%, P = 0.03) and severe peripheral oedema (39% vs. 14%, P = 0.01). We did not observe any differences in inpatient management, including place of care and pharmacological management of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. CONCLUSION: Incident AHF hospitalization significantly declined in our centre during the COVID-19 pandemic, but hospitalized patients had more severe symptoms at admission. Further studies are needed to investigate whether the incidence of AHF declined or patients did not present to hospital while the national lockdown and social distancing restrictions were in place. From a public health perspective, it is imperative to ascertain whether this will be associated with worse long-term outcomes.","Bromage, Daniel I; Cannatà, Antonio; Rind, Irfan A; Gregorio, Caterina; Piper, Susan; Shah, Ajay M; McDonagh, Theresa A",Eur J Heart Fail,,132

Little is known about the cardiovascular implications of COVID-19. The goal herein, was to evaluate the prognostic impact of having heart disease (HD) and taking cardiovascular medications in a population diagnosed of COVID-19 who required hospitalization. Also, we studied the development of cardiovascular events during hospitalization. METHODS: Consecutive patients with definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 made by a positive real time- -polymerase chain reaction of nasopharyngeal swabs who were admitted to the hospital from March 15 to April 14 were included in a retrospective registry. The association of HD with mortality and with mortality or respiratory failure were the primary and secondary objectives, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 859 patients were included in the present analysis. Cardiovascular risk factors were related to death, particularly diabetes mellitus (hazard ratio in the multivariate analysis: 1.810 [1.159- -2.827], p = 0.009). A total of 113 (13.1%) patients had HD. The presence of HD identified a group of patients with higher mortality (35.4% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001) but HD was not independently related to prognosis; renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and beta-blockers did not worsen prognosis. Statins were independently associated with decreased mortality (0.551 [0.329-0.921], p = 0.023). Cardiovascular events during hospitalization identified a group of patients with poor outcome (mortality 31.8% vs. 19.3% without cardiovascular events, p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of HD is related to higher mortality. Cardiovascular medications taken before admission are not harmful, statins being protective.

METHODS: Retrospective case series of all patients aged <22 years hospitalized at our institution with a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction test result between May 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Three distinct presentations were associated with acute SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Patients had incidental infection (40%), were potentially symptomatic (47%), or were significantly symptomatic (14%). The average length of stay differed between the significantly symptomatic group and the incidental and potentially symptomatic groups (P =.002). Average age differed among these groups, with significantly symptomatic patients older by >2 years. Fifty-five percent of incidental and 47% of potentially symptomatic patients had at least 1 identified comorbidity, whereas 90% of significantly symptomatic patients had at least 1 (P = .01). There was a significant relationship between obesity (P = .001) and asthma (P = .004) and severe disease. Additionally, there was a statistically significant difference between groups with respect to fever, hypoxia, supplemXental oxygen use, duration of supplemental oxygen, and ICU admission, with a significantly higher percentage of patients in the significantly symptomatic group meeting each of these criteria (P < .001 for all categories). CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 fall into distinct categories, which are critical to understanding the true pathology of SARS-Cov-2 as it relates to hospitalized pediatric patients.

In South Africa, the pandemic and the resultant national lockdown have highlighted the shortcomings in the protection and care of children. Children in alternative care are particularly at risk as a result of disrupted and uncoordinated service delivery. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and impact of the pandemic and the resulting social isolation on the wellbeing and protection of children living in a residential care facility. METHODS AND PARTICIPANTS: We used qualitative, participatory approaches - specifically draw-and-write methods - to engage with 32 children (average age = 13.5 years) living in a residential care facility in Gauteng. FINDINGS: Children in care demonstrated an awareness of the socio-economic difficulties facing communities in South Africa, and shared deep concerns about the safety, well-being and welfare of parents and siblings. Although they expressed frustration at the lack of contact with family members, they acknowledged the resources they had access to in a residential care facility, which enabled them to cope and which ensured their safety. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: We focus our discussion on the necessity of a systemic response to child welfare, including a coordinated approach by policy makers, government departments and child welfare systems to address the structural factors at the root of inequality and inadequate, unacceptable care. This response is essential not only during COVID-19 but also in pre- and post-pandemic context.","Haffejee, Sadiyya; Levine, Diane Thembekile",Child Abuse Negl,,132

Aim of the study is evaluating the management of severe ARF due to COVID-19 pneumonia using non-invasive ventilatory support (NIVS), studing safety and effectiveness of non-invasive ventilatory support (NIVS). METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter study. Primary outcomes were NIVS failure with intubation rate and hospital mortality . Secondary outcomes were: hospital stay and factors related to NIVS failure and mortality. These outcomes were compared with patients intubated and admitted to ICU. RESULTS: 162 patients were hospitalized because of severe respiratory failure ( PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 250 ). 138 patients were admitted to Respiratory Intermediate Care Unit (RICU) for a NIVS trial. One hundred patients were treated successfully with NIVS (74.5%); 38 failed NIVS trial (27.5%). In-hospital mortality was 23.18% in RICU group and 30.55% in ICU group. Patients with NIVS failure were older, had a lower number of lymphocytes, a higher IL-6 , lower PaO2, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, higher respiratory rate (RR) and heart rate at admission and lower PaO2 and PaO2/FiO2 ratio and higher RR after 1-6 hours . Multivariate analysis identified higher age, C-reactive protein as well as RR after 1-6 hours and PaO2/FiO2 ratio after 1-6 hours as an independent predictor mortality. CONCLUSIONS: NIVS is a safe and effective strategy in the treatment of severe ARF due to COVID 19 related pneumonia, that reduces mortality and length of hospital stay in the carefully selected patient.","Diaz de Teran, Teresa; Gonzales Martinez, Monica; Banfi, Paolo; Garuti, Giancarlo; Ferraioli, Gianluca; Russo, Giuseppe; Casu, Francesco; Vivarelli, Michela; Bonfiglio, Monica; Perazzo, Alessandro; Barlascini, Cornelius; Bauleo, Armando; Nicolini, Antonello; Solidoro, Paolo",Minerva med,,132

The current focus has been developing novel therapeutics, including antivirals, protease inhibitors, vaccines, and targeting the overactive cytokine response with anti-cytokine therapy. The overproduction of early response proinflammatory cytokines results in what has been described as a ""cytokine storm"" is leading eventually to death when the cells fail to terminate the inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence shows that inflammatory cytokines induce selectin ligands that play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases by mediating leukocyte migration from the blood into the tissue. Thus, the selectins and selectin ligands represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. In this paper, potential pan-selectin inhibitors were identified employing a virtual screening using a docking procedure. For this purpose, the Asinex and ZINC databases of ligands, including approved drugs, biogenic compounds, and glycomimetics, altogether 923 602 compounds, were screened against the P-, L-, and E-selectin. At first, the experimentally confirmed inhibitors were docked into all three selectins' carbohydrate recognition domains to assess the suitability of the screening procedure. Finally, based on the evaluation of ligands binding, we propose ten purchasable pan-selectin inhibitors to develop COVID-19 therapeutics.","Smak, Pavel; Chandrabose, Selvaraj; Tvaroska, Igor; Koca, Jaroslav",Glycobiology,,132
497111,COVID-19 and melanoma surgery in a dermo-oncology centre in Italy,2021,"Fact-checking verifies a multitude of claims and remains a promising solution to fight fake news. The spread of rumors, hoaxes, and conspiracy theories online is evident in times of crisis, when fake news ramped up across platforms, increasing fear and confusion among the population as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. This article explores fact-checking initiatives in Latin America, using an original Markov-based computational method to cluster topics on tweets and identify their diffusion between different datasets. Drawing on a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods, including time-series analysis, network analysis and in-depth close reading, our article proposes an in-depth tracing of COVID-related false information across the region, comparing if there is a pattern of behavior through the countries. We rely on the open Twitter application programming interface connection to gather data from public accounts of the six major fact-checking agencies in Latin America, namely Argentina (Chequeado), Brazil (Agência Lupa), Chile (Mala Espina Check), Colombia (Colombia Check from Consejo de Redacciín), Mexico (El Sabueso from Animal Polótico) and Venezuela (Efecto Cocuyo). In total, these profiles account for 102,379 tweets that were collected between January and July 2020. Our study offers insights into the dynamics of online information dissemination beyond the national level and demonstrates how politics intertwine with the health crisis in this period. Our method is capable of clustering topics in a period of overabundance of information, as we fight not only a pandemic but also an infodemic, evidentiating opportunities to understand and slow the spread of false information.","Wilson, Ceron Gruszynski Sanseverino Gabriela de-Lima-Santos Mathias-Felipe Quiles Marcos G.",Social Network Analysis and Mining,,132

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Subacute unit of a Rehabilitation Institute. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with COVID-19 (N=184; aged 18 years or older) who were admitted to a subacute unit to stabilize their condition and recover from acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At admission patients underwent the SPPB test, represented by the sum of 3 functional tests, standing balance, 4-meter gait speed, and 5-repetition sit-to-stand motion. Comparisons between 2 SPPB score groups were performed by an unpaired t test; multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis was employed to detect predictors of the SPPB score considering several clinical parameters. RESULTS: Participants were 74±12 years old, 52% were men and with more than 2 comorbidities in 43% of cases. SPPB score was 3.02±3.87 denoting patients' profound physical dysfunction. Normal physical function was detected in only 12% of patients, whereas low, intermediate, and severe impairment was found in 65%, 13%, and 10%, respectively. Age, both invasive and noninvasive ventilation use, and the presence of previous disability were significant predictors of SPPB. Patients without any comorbidities (8%) also exhibited low function (SPPB: 5.67±1.12). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of survivors after COVID-19 experienced acute respiratory failure due to pneumonia and exhibited substantial physical dysfunction influenced by age, mechanical ventilation need, and previous disability. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of rehabilitation to promote recovery and community reintegration in this population.","Paneroni, Mara; Vogiatzis, Ioannis; Bertacchini, Laura; Simonelli, Carla; Vitacca, Michele",Arch. phys. med. rehabil,,132

Among various non-pharmacological interventions, community infection control is considered to be a quite promising approach. However, there is a lack of research on improving community-level interventions based on a community's real conditions and characteristics using real-world observations. Our paper aims to investigate the different responses to mobility interventions between communities in the United States with a specific focus on different income levels. We produced six daily mobility metrics for all communities using the mobility location data from over 100 million anonymous devices on a monthly basis. Each metric is tabulated by three performance indicators:""best performance,""""effort,""and""consistency.""We found that being high-income improves social distancing behavior after controlling multiple confounding variables in each of the eighteen scenarios. In addition to the reality that it is more difficult for low-income communities to comply with social distancing, the comparisons between scenarios raise concerns on the employment status, working condition, accessibility to life supplies, and exposure to the virus of low-income communities.","Sun, Qianqian; Zhou, Weiyi; Kabiri, Aliakbar; Darzi, Aref; Hu, Songhua; Younes, Hannah; Zhang, Lei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02160v1.pdf,132

This study aimed to detect and explain the efficacy of reusing of these drugs in treating COVID-19. METHODS: The study was divided into two parts; clinical and computational parts. In the clinical part, 80 (30 females) subject with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 with mild and moderate symptoms were enrolled in the study. Subjects were treated with azithromycin or doxycycline, and nitazoxanide were added to the treatment if the subject had diarrhea. Subjects were divided into 4 groups: Group 1: subjects treated with azithromycin (20 subjects); Group 2: subjects treated with doxycycline (20 subjects); Group 3: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and doxycycline (20 subjects); and Group 4: subjects treated with a combination of nitazoxanide and azithromycin (20 subjects). In the computational part, we docked the three drugs against all currently available COVID-19 related protein targets (viral and non-viral). Subsequently, top hits were subjected to molecular dynamic simulations (50 ns) and binding free energy calculations to further validate the docking experiments and to investigate the binding modes of the potential inhibitors. RESULTS: The symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was seen on the 5th day after starting treatment in Group 3 and Group 4 and on the 7th day in Group 2. However, for Group 1, the symptomatic improvement of mild to moderate subjects was not seen on the 5th day and required replacement by doxycycline to get the symptomatic improvement. None of the subjects needed intensive care admission and no deaths were reported. In silico, results were in good accordance with the clinical outcomes, where both nitazoxanide and doxycycline achieved the best docking scores against the viral ADP-ribose phosphatase (ADPRP) and the human Adaptor-Associated Kinase 1 (AAK1). Molecular dynamic simulations revealed that both drugs were stable in their bindings indicating that they can be considered as lead molecules for targeting ADPRP and AAK1. CONCLUSION: The clinical and computational studies applied on three FDA-approved antimicrobials together with their recent clinical findings revealed that both nitazoxanide and doxycycline have great therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The future in-vitro mechanistic investigation may confirm our primary computational outcomes, and in turn, these classes of compounds provide a promising starting point for further anti-COVID-19 therapeutics.","Sayed, Ahmed M; Khalaf, Ahmed M; Abdelrahim, Mohamed E A; Elgendy, Marwa O",Int J Clin Pract,,132
504036,COVID-19 and myocardial injury,2020,"BACKGROUND: Data from the UK COVID-19 outbreak are emerging, and there are ongoing concerns about a disproportionate effect on ethnic minorities. There is very limited information on COVID-19 in the over-80s, and the rates of hospital-onset infections are unknown. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study from electronic case records of the first 450 patients admitted to our hospital with PCR-confirmed COVID-19, 77% of the total inpatient caseload to date. Demographic, clinical and biochemical data were extracted. The primary endpoint was death during the index hospital admission. The characteristics of all patients, those over 80 years of age and those with hospital-onset COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: The median (IQR) age was 72 (56, 83), with 150 (33%) over 80 years old and 60% male. Presenting clinical and biochemical features were consistent with those reported elsewhere. The ethnic breakdown of patients admitted was similar to that of our underlying local population. Inpatient mortality was high at 38%. Patients over 80 presented earlier in their disease course and were significantly less likely to present with the typical features of cough, breathlessness and fever. Cardiac co-morbidity and markers of cardiac dysfunction were more common, but not those of bacterial infection. Mortality was significantly higher in this group (60% vs 28%, p < 0.001). Thirty-one (7%) patients acquired COVID-19 having continuously been in hospital for a median of 20 (14, 36) days. The peak of hospital-onset infections occurred at the same time as the overall peak of admitted infections. Despite being older and more frail than those with community-onset infection, their outcomes were no worse. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient mortality was high, especially among the over-80s, who are more likely to present atypically. The ethnic composition of our caseload was similar to the underlying population. While a significant number of patients acquired COVID-19 while already in hospital, their outcomes were no worse.","Brill, Simon E; Jarvis, Hannah C; Ozcan, Ezgi; Burns, Thomas L P; Warraich, Rabia A; Amani, Lisa J; Jaffer, Amina; Paget, Stephanie; Sivaramakrishnan, Anand; Creer, Dean D",BMC Med,,132

While far from a complete solution, PPE Portraits (disposable portrait picture stickers - 4"" × 5"") have the potential to humanize care. Preparing for a larger effectiveness evaluation on patient and provider experience, we collected initial qualitative implementation insights during Spring 2020's chaotic surge preparation. Front-line providers reported more comfort with patient interactions while wearing PPE Portraits: ""It makes it feel less like a disaster zone [for the patient]."" A brief pilot showed signs of significant adoption: a participating physician requested PPE Portraits at their clinic, shift nurses had taken PPE Portraits with them to inpatient services, and masked medical assistant team-members requested PPE Portraits to wear over scrubs. We believe PPE Portraits may support patient care and health, and even potentially healthcare team function and provider wellness. While we await data on these effects, we hope hospitals can use our findings to speed their own implementation testing.","Brown-Johnson, Cati; Vilendrer, Stacie; Heffernan, Mary Beth; Winter, Shira; Khong, Thanh; Reidy, Jennifer; Asch, Steven M",J Gen Intern Med,,132

Novel molecular tools, such as high-throughput DNA sequencing for genome discovery and transcriptomics, have revolutionized our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and disease ecology (Güimil et al. 2005; Rosenblum et al. 2012). For example, epidemiologists are using genomic data to track the spread of the emergent SARS-CoV-2 in real time, both locally and globally. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is routinely employed to study response to disease in humans, improving disease diagnostics, profiling and development of intervention strategies. Transcriptomic profiles may be particularly informative for emergent diseases, whose pathologies and effect on host phenotype are poorly known. Fungal pathogens increasingly threaten a variety of wild and domesticated organisms (Fisher et al. 2012), and two chytrid fungi attacking amphibians are causing one of the worst losses of vertebrate biodiversity ever recorded (Scheele et al. 2019).","Shepack, Alexander; Catenazzi, Alessandro",Mol Ecol,,132

The sample period is split into pre COVID-19 and COVID-19 phases. In order to test the overconfidence fallacy in the chosen stock markets, bivariate market-wide vector auto regression (VAR) models and impulse response functions (IRFs) have been employed in both phases. Findings: A highly significant contemporaneous relationship between market return and volume appears to be more pronounced in the Japanese, US, Chinese and Vietnamese stock markets in the pre COVID-19 era for the relevant coefficients are positive and highly significant for most lags. Coming to the period of turbulence, the present study discovers strong overconfident behavior in the Chinese, Taiwanese, Turkish, Jordanian and Vietnamese stock markets during COVID-19 phase. Practical implications: A stark finding is that none of the developed stock markets reveal strong overconfidence bias during pandemic, suggesting a loss or decline in the investors' confidence. Therefore, the regulators should try to regain the investors' trust and confidence in the markets by ensuring honest, fair and transparent practices. The money managers should reduce the transaction cost to encourage trading and educate investors to hold a well-diversified portfolio to mitigate risk in the long run. The governments may launch recovery packages focusing on sustaining and improving economic activities. Finally, a better investment culture may be built by the corporate houses through good corporate governance practices to regain lost trust.

Mask fit-testing of respiratory protective equipment is essential to protect healthcare workers from aerosolized particles. AIM: To analyse the outcome of mask fit-testing across National Health Service (NHS) hospitals in the UK during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Using the Freedom of Information Act, 137 NHS hospitals were approached on May 26th, 2020 by an independent researcher to provide data on the outcome of fit-testing at each site. FINDINGS: Ninety-six hospitals responded to the request between May 26th, 2020 to October 29th, 2020. There was a total of 86 mask types used across 56 hospitals, 13 of which were used in at least 10% of these hospitals; the most frequently used was the FFP3M1863, used by 92.86% of hospitals. Overall fit-testing pass rates were provided by 32 hospitals with mean pass rate of 80.74%. The most successful masks, in terms of fit-test failure rates, were the Alpha Solway 3030V and the Alpha Solway S-3V (both reporting mean fit-test failures of 2%). Male- and female-specific pass and failure rates were provided by seven hospitals. Across the seven hospitals, 20.1% of men tested failed the fit-test for all masks used, whereas 19.9% of women tested failed the fit-test for all masks used. Failure rates were significantly higher in staff from Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds 644/2507 (25.69%) across four hospitals. CONCLUSION: Twenty percent of healthcare workers tested during the first response to the pandemic failed fit-testing for masks. A small sample revealed that this was most prominent in staff from BAME backgrounds.","Green, S; Gani, A; Bailey, M; Brown, O; Hing, C B",J Hosp Infect,,132
507728,"COVID-19 mortality prediction model, 3C-M, built for use in resource limited settings - understanding the relevance of neutrophilic leukocytosis in predicting disease severity and mortality",2021,"OBJECTIVES: In an attempt to control the new coronavirus pandemic, many countries have taken unprecedented measures, such as extensive social distancing and total lockdowns of cities. Kidney transplant recipients have an increased risk for infectious diseases, including viral infections. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of population-wide infection control measures on the mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an electronic survey tool to collect demographic and sociocultural data. Additionally, in the same survey, we used 2 questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) to measure mood statuses of kidney transplant recipients. We also examined a control group and selected eligible participants according to age- and sex-based propensity score matching. RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 308 participants: 154 kidney transplant recipients (mean age of 39.9 ± 10.6 years; 57.1% male) and 154 control participants (mean age of 39.1 ± 10.5; 57.1% male). With regard to the Profile of Mood States questionnaire, total scores and all subscale scores, excluding vigor, were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients than in the control group, a finding consistent with a better mood status. We found similar findings in anxiety and depression scores for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Kidney transplant recipients seem to be resilient to the psychological stress induced by social distancing and lockdown periods. Strict adherence to infection control measures is purposefully suggested in this infection-prone population.","Ozcan, Seyda Gul; Poyraz, Burc Cagri; Bakir, Alev; Trabulus, Sinan; Pekmezci, Salih; Seyahi, Nurhan",Exp. clin. transplant,,132

508424,Immuno-Inflammatory Characteristics in Low Severity COVID-19 Patients with Digestive Symptoms. LID - 1063254,2020,"PURPOSE: The U.S. response to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has been hampered by early and ongoing delays in testing for infection; without data on where infections were occurring and the magnitude of the epidemic, early public health responses were not data-driven. Understanding the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections and immune response is critical to developing and implementing effective public health responses. Most serological surveys have been limited to localities that opted to conduct them and/or were based on convenience samples. Moreover, results of antibody testing might be subject to high false positive rates in the setting of low prevalence of immune response and imperfect test specificity. METHODS: We will conduct a national serosurvey for SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity and immune experience. A probability sample of U.S. addresses will be mailed invitations and kits for the self-collection of anterior nares swab and finger prick dried blood spot specimens. Within each sampled household, one adult 18 years or older will be randomly selected and asked to complete a questionnaire and to collect and return biological specimens to a central laboratory. Nasal swab specimens will be tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RNA PCR; dried blood spot specimens will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., immune experience) by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Positive screening tests for antibodies will be confirmed by a second antibody test with different antigenic basis to improve predictive value of positive (PPV) antibody test results. All persons returning specimens in the baseline phase will be enrolled into a follow-up cohort and mailed additional specimen collection kits 3 months after baseline. A subset of 10% of selected households will be invited to participate in full household testing, with tests offered for all household members aged &#8805;3 years. The main study outcomes will be period prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and immune experience, and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody responses. RESULTS: Power calculations indicate that a national sample of 4000 households will facilitate estimation of national SARS-CoV-2 infection and antibody prevalence with acceptably narrow 95% confidence intervals across several possible scenarios of prevalence levels. Oversampling in up to seven populous states will allow for prevalence estimation among subpopulations. Our 2-stage algorithm for antibody testing produces acceptable PPV at prevalence levels &#8805;1.0%. Including oversamples in states, we expect to receive data from as many as 9156 participants in 7495 U.S. households. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to providing robust estimates of prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune experience, we anticipate this study will establish a replicable methodology for home-based SARS-CoV-2 testing surveys, address concerns about selection bias, and improve positive predictive value of serology results. Prevalence estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and immune experience produced by this study will greatly improve our understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19 disease, its current penetration in various demographic, geographic, and occupational groups, and inform the range of symptoms associated with infection. These data will inform resource needs for control of the ongoing epidemic and facilitate data-driven decisions for epidemic mitigation strategies.","Siegler, Aaron J; Sullivan, Patrick S; Sanchez, Travis; Lopman, Ben; Fahimi, Mansour; Sailey, Charles; Frankel, Martin; Rothenberg, Richard; Kelley, Colleen F; Bradley, Heather",Ann Epidemiol,,132

Public health officials need tools to assist with anticipating the healthcare resources required to confront the SARS-COV-2 pandemic. We built a modeling tool to aid practicing public health officials with estimating healthcare demand from the pandemic in their jurisdictions and to evaluate the potential impacts of population-wide social-distancing interventions. Methods. The tool uses a SEIR compartmental model to project the local spread of the pandemic. Users input case counts, healthcare resources, and select intervention strategies to evaluate. Outputs include the number of infections and deaths with and without intervention, and the demand for hospital and critical care beds and ventilators relative to existing capacity. We illustrate the tool using data from three regions of Chile. Results. Our scenarios indicate a surge in COVID-19 patients could overwhelm Chilean hospitals by June, peaking in July or August at 6 to 50 times the current supply of beds and ventilators. A lockdown strategy or combination of case isolation, home quarantine, social distancing of individuals greater than 70 years, and telework interventions may keep treatment demand below capacity. Conclusions. Aggressive interventions can avert substantial morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. Our tool permits rapid evaluation of locally-applicable policy scenarios and updating of results as new data become available.","Rainisch, Gabriel; Undurraga, Eduardo A.; Sciences, Gerardo Chowell Department of Population Health; Health, School of Public; University, Georgia State; Atlanta,; GA,; USA,; Gobierno, Escuela de; Chile, Pontificia Universidad Cat'olica de; RM,; Resistance, Chile Millennium Initiative for Collaborative Research i; Chile,",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13544v3.pdf,132

The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in stomatological institutions across the country. Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases. Through literature retrieving, this article reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to a patient's psychological status, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on. It was believed that the patients with these disorders might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and need be paid more attention by dental specialists. At the same time, this article analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with various oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists. From the perspective of social role, dentist plays not only the role of expert for professional guidance in dentistry, but also the role of helper in psychological counseling for patients.","Qu, X; Zhou, X D",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,132
512245,Follow-up study of the pulmonary function and related physiological characteristics of COVID-19 survivors three months after recovery,2020,"The number of studies published on COVID-19 in recent months is certainly impressive. However, there are still important gaps to know a great number of characteristics of this disease. Among these, some potential ways of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 and the different reasons for the severity of the disease in different people. Various studies have suggested that certain air pollutants could be increasing the transmission of the coronavirus, as well as the risks of COVID-19 incidence and mortality. In the present preliminary case-study conducted in Tarragona Province (Catalonia, Spain), we studied the potential association of COVID-19 with PM10, NO2 and O3, as well as the differences in the incidence and lethality of this disease. This Province is divided into two ""health regions"": Camp de Tarragona, with an important industrial complex, and Terres de l'Ebre, with a great agricultural component. In spite of the notable limitations of the current study, our preliminary findings indicate that the industrialized/urban areas of Tarragona Province show a higher incidence and mortality of COVID-19 than the agricultural/rural zones. These - and previous - results would highlight the importance of conducting specific investigations focused on directly assessing whether air pollutants such as particulate matter can act as carriers of the SARS-CoV-2. If confirmed, the recommendation on keeping the ""social distance"" (1.5-2 m) might need to be adapted to this situation.","Marquès, Montse; Rovira, Joaquim; Nadal, Martí; Domingo, José L",Environ Res,,132
512331,COVID-19 Pandemic and Cardiac Electrophysiology: Guidance Protocol From a UK Tertiary Cardiac Centre,2020,"Immunization with recombinant glycoprotein-based vaccines is a promising approach to induce protective immunity against viruses However, the complex biosynthetic maturation requirements of these glycoproteins typically necessitate their production in mammalian cells to support their folding and post-translational modification Despite these clear advantages, the incumbent costs and infrastructure requirements with this approach can be prohibitive in developing countries, and the production scales and timelines may prove limiting when applying these production systems to the control of pandemic viral outbreaks Plant molecular farming of viral glycoproteins has been suggested as a cheap and rapidly scalable alternative production system, with the potential to perform post-translational modifications that are comparable to mammalian cells Consequently, plant-produced glycoprotein vaccines for seasonal and pandemic influenza have shown promise in clinical trials, and vaccine candidates against the newly emergent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have entered into late stage preclinical and clinical testing However, many other viral glycoproteins accumulate poorly in plants, and are not appropriately processed along the secretory pathway due to differences in the host cellular machinery Furthermore, plant-derived glycoproteins often contain glycoforms that are antigenically distinct from those present on the native virus, and may also be under-glycosylated in some instances Recent advances in the field have increased the complexity and yields of biologics that can be produced in plants, and have now enabled the expression of many viral glycoproteins which could not previously be produced in plant systems In contrast to the empirical optimization that predominated during the early years of molecular farming, the next generation of plant-made products are being produced by developing rational, tailor-made approaches to support their production This has involved the elimination of plant-specific glycoforms and the introduction into plants of elements of the biosynthetic machinery from different expression hosts These approaches have resulted in the production of mammalian N-linked glycans and the formation of O-glycan moieties in planta More recently, plant molecular engineering approaches have also been applied to improve the glycan occupancy of proteins which are not appropriately glycosylated, and to support the folding and processing of viral glycoproteins where the cellular machinery differs from the usual expression host of the protein Here we highlight recent achievements and remaining challenges in glycoengineering and the engineering of glycosylation-directed folding pathways in plants, and discuss how these can be applied to produce recombinant viral glycoproteins vaccines","Margolin, E.; Crispin, M.; Meyers, A.; Chapman, R.; Rybicki, E.

Communication occurs at mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAM) and regulates lipid and calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, and the exchange of adenine nucleotides, among other things. Recent evidence suggests that MAMs contribute to organelle, cellular, and systemic metabolism. In obesity and IR models, metabolic tissues such as the liver, skeletal muscle, pancreas, and adipose tissue present alterations in MAM structure or function. The purpose of this mini-review is to highlight the MAM disruptions that occur in each tissue during obesity and IR and its relationship with glucose homeostasis and IR.

Increasing evidence shows that exosomes (Exos) secreted by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) can be used to deliver circular RNAs (circRNAs) to treat liver fibrosis. To explore the uses of circRNA, circRNA expression profiles of hepatic tissue from normal and CCl4-induced mice were analyzed using high-throughput circRNA microarrays. The result showed that mmu_circ_0000623 expression was downregulated in CCl4-induced mice. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferin reporter experiments showed that mmu_circ_0000623 interacted with and regulated miR-125/ATG4D. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that Exos from ADSCs, especially from mmu_circ_0000623-modified ADSCs, significantly suppressed CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by promoting autophagy activation. Autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly reversed the treatment effects of Exos. Proteins involved in autophagy and autophagy plaques positive for ATG4D expression were regulated by mmu_circ_0000623/miR-125.

The delay in the processing of PCR tests and the small number of tests available limits the ability of sanitary authorities to make meaningful data available as to the number of cases or the number of deaths due to COVID-19. Methodology: We use a time series analysis of deaths due to COVID-19 referenced to the date of deaths (as opposed to the date in which the test results were obtained). Results: We demonstrate that the SDS adopted in São Paulo City and State clearly brought meaningful results to delay the growth of COVID-19 cases. We also show that by using this type of time series it is possible to identify different trends for regions, allowing for targeted approaches. Additionally, by using a time series which is death-oriented makes it possible to identify, for São Paulo City, the effects of the SDS with the Social Isolation Index (SII) adopted in the state and to make a gross estimate for the SII, which prevents the growth of the disease. Conclusion: The use of a time series of deaths due to COVID-19 referenced to the date of the event allows a better understanding of the effects of the SDS on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic in São Paulo State, Brazil.","Cruz, Carlos Henrique de Brito",Rev. bras. epidemiol,,132

It is traced through the role of Asian Values which are believed to shape the leadership character in his administration as the 8th Prime Minister of Malaysia. The stance on values and dimensions was referred based on the highlights of past literatures which stated that Asian countries have their own set of unique ideologies. It was then developed through the observation of one hundred (100) days of Muhyiddin's administration. Content analysis was applied as a research design aimed at identifying and then describing his significant speech text passages. The analysis looks at Paternalistic Leadership in the tendencies of ""Work Ethics"", ""Society"", ""Power Orientation"", and ""Family"" value dimensions. These four dimensions are often discussed by scholars in underlying the leadership style of Asian leaders. Data encoding was performed using the ATLAS software. The results show that Muhyiddin has indeed applied paternal values in governing. He managed to incorporate these values indirectly in the local wisdom of the community by manipulating those values by adapting to current needs. Muhyiddin does so with the soothing values of paternalism while shaping the development of the country more pragmatically and effectively.

Thus, therapeutic options are urgently needed, and will be discussed in this review. Recent findings: Iron-containing enzymes are required for viruses most likely including coronaviruses (CoVs) to complete their replication process. Moreover, poor prognosis occurred in the conditions of iron overload for patients upon infections of viruses. Thus, limiting iron represents a promising adjuvant strategy in treating viral infection through oral uptake or venous injection of iron chelators, or through the manipulation of the key iron regulators. For example, treatment with iron chelator deferiprone has been shown to prolong the survival of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. Increasing intracellular iron efflux via increasing iron exporter ferroportin expression also exhibits antiviral effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The implications of other metals besides iron are also briefly discussed. Summary: For even though we know little about iron regulation in COVID-19 patients thus far, it could be deduced from other viral infections that iron chelation might be an alternative beneficial adjuvant in treating COVID-19.","Liu, Wei; Zhang, Shuping; Nekhai, Sergei; Liu, Sijin",Curr Clin Microbiol Rep,,132

Resultados:Evidencia-se que vivenciar os efeitos da pandemia de corona vírus (COVID-19) no setor educacional na formação em saúde, em especial no campo da enfermagem, vai além de uma reorganização estrutural dos cursos, pois implica em mudança atitudinal dos gestores, docentes e discentes para que reformulem as práticas de ensino (por vezes com ferramentas tradicionais), em práticas inovadoras preservando um ensino que propicie ao estudante a criticidade, reflexão, diálogo, vínculo e interação; elementos que fazem parte de uma formação que visa a transformação, o empoderamento e não apenas a transmissão do conhecimento. Nesse contexto, a pandemia do COVID-19 provocou mudanças de paradigmas talvez ainda não superados pelas instituições na área da saúde, pois ao se perceberem dentro de uma realidade em que gerou mudanças nos aspectos políticos, econômicos, culturais e sociais em nível mundial, estas tiveram que se reinventar e inserir no seu processo de trabalho as novas formas de ensinar; tiveram que discutir sobre as diferentes abordagens educacionais e diante das necessidades do readequar os métodos de ensino em saúde, inseriram as tecnologias remotas como ferramentas essenciais para atender a real necessidade da continuidade das aulas no formato não presencial. Para muitos um desafio, pois permeia atualmente uma reflexão sobre o cuidado do ensino à distância no campo da enfermagem e demais cursos da área da saúde. Entretanto, à medida que se abriu para discussões sobre novas formas de ensinar mediadas pela inovação, pode-se dizer que esse será o maior impacto da pandemia para o ensino: a contribuição das novas tecnologias de informação e comunicação no processo ensino aprendizagem para formação em saúde, assim como a reflexão sobre a educação à distância e seus conceitos, diferenciando-a dos conceitos de metodologia remota e o uso das tecnologias. Conclusão: No ensino da enfermagem, a discussão relacionada ao uso de tecnologias remotas em sala de aula sempre foi um ponto de debate. Entretanto, com a necessidade da inclusão dessas ferramentas para a continuidade de aulas no formato não presencial decorrente da estratégia do isolamento social motivada pela pandemia do COVID-19, pode oportunizar a se ter um novo olhar sobre o assunto e que talvez com esse momento vivido se haja oportunidade de ampliar o debate sobre uso dessas metodologias remotas no ensino em saúde, buscando uma reflexão sobre a interação destas com os demais métodos de ensino já implementados.(AU)","Bezerra, Italla Maria Pinheiro",Rev. bras. crescimento desenvolv. hum,,132
517831,Neurological Disorders Associated With COVID-19 Hospital Admissions: Experience of a Single Tertiary Healthcare Center,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus stigmatization may be disproportionately impacting ethnoracial minority groups in the US. We test three hypotheses: [H1] Asians in the US are more likely to report experiencing coronavirus stigmatization than non-Hispanic Whites; [H2] Coronavirus stigmatization is associated with psychological distress; [H3] Magnitude of association between coronavirus stigmatization and psychological distress is more pronounced among US-born Asians, compared to non-Hispanic Whites. DESIGN: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from the 10-31 March 2020 wave of the Understanding America Survey, a nationally representative survey of adults in the US. Psychological distress was assessed with the PHQ-4. Measures of association were estimated using multiple logistic regression and survey sampling weights. Predicted probabilities were calculated using marginal standardization ( n = 6707). RESULTS: [H1] The adjusted predicted probability of experiencing any coronavirus stigma among foreign-born Asians (11.2%, 95% CI: 5.5-17.0%; E-value = 4.52), US-born Asians (10.9%, 95% CI: 5.8-16.0%; E-value = 4.23), Blacks (8.0%, 95% CI: 5.3-10.7%; E-value = 2.92), and Hispanic Whites (7.3%, 95% CI: 4.6-9.9%; E-value = 2.58) was significantly greater than non-Hispanic Whites (4.5%, 95% CI: 3.7-5.4%). [H2] Individuals reporting any coronavirus stigma experience were significantly more likely to exhibit psychological distress (19.9%, 95% CI: 14.6-25.2% vs 10.6%, 9.6-11.6%; E-value = 3.16). [H3] The overall magnitude of association between experience of any coronavirus stigma and psychological distress was not significantly between US-born Asians and non-Hispanic Whites, though we found gender to mask this effect. US-born Asian females who experienced coronavirus stigmatization were more likely to exhibit psychological distress than non-Hispanic white females who experienced coronavirus stigmatization (relative risk (RR): 10.21, 95% CI: 2.69-38.74 vs 1.24, 95% CI: 0.76-2.01; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Comprehensive measures around care seeking, public awareness, and disaggregated data collection are needed to address ethnoracial coronavirus stigmatization and its impact on psychological health and well-being.","Pan, Stephen W; Shen, Gordon C; Liu, Chuncheng; Hsi, Jenny H",Ethn Health,,132
517848,A proposed scoring system for triage of patients who require vascular access creation in times of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Due to the increasing rise of C. difficile infection, stool banks and donor programs have been launched to grant access to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Our aim is to describe characteristics and outcomes of the donor program at our stool bank. METHODS: Donor candidates underwent a four-step selection process, including a clinical interview, blood and stool testing, a further questionnaire and a direct stool testing the day of each donation. From March 2020, specific changes to this process were introduced to avoid the potential transmission of COVID-19. We evaluated the rate of excluded candidates at each step of the screening, as well as the number of total fecal aliquots provided by qualified donors. RESULTS: Overall, 114 donor candidates were evaluated. Seventy-five candidates declined to join the program for logistic or personal issues, three were excluded after the questionnaire and seven for positive stool exams. Finally, 29 (25%) subjects qualified as stool donors, and provided 70 stool samples. Fifteen samples were excluded after direct molecular stool testing. A total of 127 aliquots was finally obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Donor recruitment for FMT is a challenging process, and only a small rate of candidates are eligible as donors.","Ianiro, Gianluca; Porcari, Serena; Bibbò, Stefano; Giambò, Federica; Quaranta, Gianluca; Masucci, Luca; Sanguinetti, Maurizio; Gasbarrini, Antonio; Cammarota, Giovanni",Dig. liver dis,,132
518159,Alterations in Respiratory Function Test Three Months after Hospitalisation for COVID-19 Pneumonia: Value of Determining Nitric Oxide Diffusion,2021,"Background: A major byproduct of the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been the accelerated adoption of telemedicine within orthopedic practices. Introduction: The purpose of the study is to evaluate satisfaction associated with telemedicine and to determine how telemedicine is used by orthopedic surgeons in response to social distancing efforts necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We developed a survey to evaluate surgeon's perception of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of four major sections focusing on (1) surgeon characteristics and current use of telemedicine, (2) telemedicine for new patients, (3) telemedicine for routine follow-up patients, and (4) telemedicine for postoperative patients. Results: We collected 268 survey responses. Overall, 84.8% of surgeons were using telemedicine, but only 20.5% of surgeons were using it before the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall satisfaction with telemedicine was 70.3% ± 20.9%. Of those who use telemedicine, 75% currently use it for new patients, 86.6% currently use it for routine follow-up patients, and 80.8% currently use it for postoperative patients (p = 0.01). Surgeons had higher satisfaction with building rapport and performing physical examination maneuvers for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001 for both). However, satisfaction with obtaining imaging did not differ among the cohorts (p = 0.36). Surgeons felt they are more likely to continue to use telemedicine after the COVID-19 pandemic for either routine follow-up or postoperative patients than for new patients (p < 0.0001). Discussion: Owing to challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine use has increased substantially among orthopedic surgeons in recent months. Conclusions: Our study established that physician implementation of telemedicine has increased significantly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of surgeons satisfied with its use in their practice, and plan on incorporating telemedicine in their practices beyond the pandemic.","Hurley, Eoghan T; Haskel, Jonathan D; Bloom, David A; Gonzalez-Lomas, Guillem; Jazrawi, Laith M; Bosco, Joseph A; Campbell, Kirk A",Telemed. j. e. health,,132

520314,Number of COVID-19 patients classified as cured: an imminent danger for the population,2020,"Parents of NICU infants are a vulnerable population from a psychological perspective, and often experience high levels of acute stress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. The added burden of the current SARS CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to exacerbate these issues, with potential implications for the wellbeing of infants and families in the short- and long-term. In this paper, we propose utilizing the stress contagion framework and consider how psychosocial stress can ""spill over"" into the parent-infant relationship domain, which can impact child development and family wellbeing longer term. As the effects of the pandemic will likely persist well beyond the acute stage, we offer advocacy points and general guidelines for healthcare professionals to consider in their quest to mitigate stress and build resilience in NICU families.","Erdei, Carmina; Liu, Cindy H",J Perinatol,,132
520390,COVID-19 and rheumatology: is shielding really necessary?,2020,"A precursor carboxy-silica support was introduced for grafting retentive ligands for use in HPLC. This support was prepared by sequentially reacting 5 µm silica particles with vinyltrimethoxysilane and then thioglycolic acid. The carboxy-silica thus obtained was subsequently functionalized with octadecylamine, 2-naphthylamine or 2-aminoanthracene by on-column reactions via a carbodiimide conjugation reaction. The carbodiimide with its zero-length carboxyl-to-amine coupling ability works by activating the surface carboxyl groups of the precursor support for direct reaction with the primary amines of octadecylamine, 2-naphthylamine or 2-aminoanthracene via amide bond formation. These reactions series, which are applied for the first time in HPLC column fabrication, yielded the octadecyl-, naphthyl- and anthracenyl-silica columns. The three columns were evaluated for their reversed-phase chromatography retention properties with alkylbenzenes, alkylphenyl ketones, nitroalkanes, benzene and toluene derivatives, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and nitro-substituted amino acids. The naphthyl- and anthracenyl-silica exhibited a good selectivity and efficiency towards most of the aromatic analytes when compared to the octadecyl-silica. Nitro-substituted amino acids containing electron withdrawing groups showed greater selectivity than other analytes on the aromatic-based columns than the C18 column. This is because of the ability of the &#960; electron system of the analyte to accept electrons from the aromatic-based stationary phase (a Lewis base). This article is protected by copyright.

On March 24, 2020, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) suspended all polio supplementary immunization activities and recommended the continuation of polio surveillance (2). In April 2020, GPEI shared revised polio surveillance guidelines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which focused on reducing the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to health care workers and communities by modifying activities that required person-to-person contact, improving hand hygiene and personal protective equipment use practices, and overcoming challenges related to movement restrictions, while continuing essential polio surveillance functions (3). GPEI assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on polio surveillance by comparing data from January to September 2019 to the same period in 2020. Globally, the number of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases reported declined 33% and the mean number of days between the second stool collected and receipt by the laboratory increased by 70%. Continued analysis of AFP case reporting and stool collection is critical to ensure timely detection and response to interruptions of polio surveillance.","Zomahoun, Delayo J; Burman, Ashley L; Snider, Cynthia J; Chauvin, Claire; Gardner, Tracie; Lickness, Jacquelyn S; Ahmed, Jamal A; Diop, Ousmane; Gerber, Sue; Anand, Abhijeet",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,132

590234,Hyperthrombotic Milieu in COVID-19 Patients,2020-10-31,"This study of 104 Chilean employees examines the process of WFF—recovery—general health on a daily basis. Drawing on the work–home resources (W-HR) model, we hypothesized that daily work-to-family facilitation and work engagement predict recovery experiences during off-job time in the evening (i.e., detachment from work and relaxation) and subsequent general health at night. Furthermore, we explored whether daily work engagement moderates the relationships between daily work-to-family facilitation and recovery experiences during off-job time in the evening and general health at night. In addition, we expected employees' detachment from work to have a lagged effect on next-day general health at night. Participants completed a survey and a diary booklet over 5 consecutive working days (N = 520 occasions). Multilevel analyses show that, as expected, daily work-to-family facilitation predicted recovery experiences during off-job time in the evening (i.e., detachment from work and relaxation). However, contrary to our expectations, daily work engagement only predicted general health at night. Moreover, as expected, a moderation effect of daily work engagement shows that on days that employees experience low levels of daily work engagement, daily work-to-family facilitation is strongly related to detachment from work and relaxation during off-job time in the evening and to general health at night. Unexpectedly, on days on which employees experienced high levels of daily work engagement, daily work-to-family facilitation was weakly related to these outcomes. Finally, in accordance with our expectations, detachment from work had a lagged effect on next-day general health at night. These findings offer support for the W-HR model and have theoretical and practical implications for research and organizations.","Carmona-Cobo, Isabel; Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Garrosa, Eva",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.661267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335371/,132

This required shuttering high risk areas which included outpatient offices; however, the ongoing acuity of heart failure (HF) pts concurrently mandated close follow up. To overcome this predicament, at our institution pts were asked to stay at home and engage in virtual HF visits (VHFVs) via telephone or video, in lieu of in-office visits (IOVs). The purpose of this abstract is to summarize and assess the feasibility of our initial 30 day experience with VHFVs. Methods The Montefiore- Einstein Heart Failure service cares for over 4,000 pts who predominantly reside within the Bronx borough, and represent a vulnerable, urban, low socioeconomic population. Our team includes 12 providers consisting of both NPs and MDs. On 3/17/20 all non-urgent IOVs were stopped and as a work around a virtual platform was created within our electronic medical record system (EPIC) to facilitate VHFVs. As of April 1st, all IOVs were converted to VHFVs. We retrospectively reviewed the HF clinical volume for the month of April 2020 and as a reference compared it to the same time period in 2019. In addition, we followed high risk pts (defined as those requiring multiple visits during the month for acute decompensated HF [ADHF] or renal failure) for clinical outcomes including hospital admission. Results Over the 30 day period from April 1-30th 2020, 510 HF pts had a total of 605 VHFVs and 17 IOVs. Seventy-five pts required ≥2 visits during this time period of which 26 pts (5%) were categorized as high risk as defined above. Providers reported that 7 (27%) of these pts would have been electively hospitalized under normal circumstances. In the 30 days following initial VHFV, 3 (12%) were urgently hospitalized, 2 of whom would have been electively admitted by provider as above, and none died. Interestingly, clinical volume and outcomes of high risk individuals was comparable in April 2019 (Table 1). Three of 12 (25%) patients with ADHF or renal failure were urgently hospitalized in the 30 day follow up period. At the time of this presentation we intend to report 90 day outcomes on all pts. Conclusion In this preliminary analysis of an experiment that was brought on by the COVID-19 epidemic, VHFVs were not associated with substantially worse clinical outcomes over the short term.

592056,The relationship of soluble neuropilin-1 to severe COVID-19 risk factors in polycystic ovary syndrome,2021-01-18,"There was a major outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affecting more than 300 patients occurring in a private housing estate in Hong Kong, in which an infected renal patient was suspected to be the primary source. It is unknown whether renal patients would represent a distinct group of patients who share some characteristics that could predispose them to have higher infectivity. In this context, we have encountered 4 dialysis patients contracting SARS in a minor outbreak, which involved 11 patients and 4 health care workers, in a medical ward of a regional hospital. Of these 4 dialysis patients, 1 patient was receiving hemodialysis while the other 3 patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Fever and radiological changes were their dominant presenting features. All were having positive results for SARS-associated coronavirus ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction performed on their nasopharyngeal aspirates or stool samples. It appeared that treatment with high-dose intravenous ribavirin and corticosteroids could only resolve the fever, but it could not stop the disease progression. All 4 patients developed respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation on days 9 through 12.

From this small case series, it appeared that dialysis patients might have an aggressive clinical course and poor outcome after contracting SARS.

592401,Clinical characteristics associated with persistent olfactory and taste alterations in COVID-19: A preliminary report on 121 patients,2020-05-26,"BACKGROUND: Careful selection and testing of plasma reduces the risk of blood‐borne viruses in the starting material for plasma‐derived products. Furthermore, effective measures such as pasteurization at 60°C for 10 hours have been implemented in the manufacturing process of therapeutic plasma proteins such as human albumin, coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, and enzyme inhibitors to inactivate blood‐borne viruses of concern. A comprehensive compilation of the virus reduction capacity of pasteurization is presented including the effect of stabilizers used to protect the therapeutic protein from modifications during heat treatment. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The virus inactivation kinetics of pasteurization for a broad range of viruses were evaluated in the relevant intermediates from more than 15 different plasma manufacturing processes. Studies were carried out under the routine manufacturing target variables, such as temperature and product‐specific stabilizer composition. Additional studies were also performed under robustness conditions, that is, outside production specifications. RESULTS: The data demonstrate that pasteurization inactivates a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses of diverse physicochemical characteristics. After a maximum of 6 hours' incubation, no residual infectivity could be detected for the majority of enveloped viruses. Effective inactivation of a range of nonenveloped viruses, with the exception of nonhuman parvoviruses, was documented. CONCLUSION: Pasteurization is a very robust and reliable virus inactivation method with a broad effectiveness against known blood‐borne pathogens and emerging or potentially emerging viruses. Pasteurization has proven itself to be a highly effective step, in combination with other complementary safety measures, toward assuring the virus safety of final product.","Gröner, Albrecht; Broumis, Connie; Fang, Randel; Nowak, Thomas; Popp, Birgit; Schäfer, Wolfram; Roth, Nathan J.",Transfusion,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29148053/; https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.14390,132
592772,QTc Prolongation in COVID-19 Patients Using Chloroquine,2021-01-02,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID‐19 pandemic is one of the greatest global health threats facing humanity in recent memory. This study aimed to explore influences on hygienic practices, a set of key transmission behaviours, in relation to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation‐Behaviour (COM‐B) model of behaviour change (Michie et al., 2011). DESIGN: Data from the first wave of a longitudinal survey study were used, launched in the early stages of the UK COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 2025 adults aged 18 and older, representative of the UK population, recruited by a survey company from a panel of research participants. Participants self‐reported motivation, capability, and opportunity to enact hygienic practices during the COVID‐19 outbreak. RESULTS: Using regression models, we found that all three COM‐B components significantly predicted good hygienic practices, with motivation having the greatest influence on behaviour. Breaking this down further, the subscales psychological capability, social opportunity, and reflective motivation positively influenced behaviour. Reflective motivation was largely driving behaviour, with those highest in reflective motivation scoring 51% more on the measure of hygienic practices compared with those with the lowest scores. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have clear implications for the design of behaviour change interventions to promote hygienic practices. Interventions should focus on increasing and maintaining motivation to act and include elements that promote and maintain social support and knowledge of COVID‐19 transmission. Groups in particular need of targeting for interventions to increase hygienic practices are males and those living in cities and suburbs.","Gibson Miller, Jilly; Hartman, Todd K.; Levita, Liat; Martinez, Anton P.; Mason, Liam; McBride, Orla; McKay, Ryan; Murphy, Jamie; Shevlin, Mark; Stocks, Thomas V.

593186,Herpes zoster might be an indicator for Latent COVID 19 infection,2020-05-23,"The adverse health effects of exposure to air pollutants, notably to particulate matter (PM), are well-known, as well as the association with measured or estimated concentration levels. The role of perception can be relevant in exploring effects and pollution control actions. The purpose of this study was to explore studies that analyse people’s perception, together with the measurement of air pollution, in order to elucidate the relationship between them. We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In March 2020, PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus databases were explored in an attempt to search for studies published from 2000 to 2020. The review included 38 studies, most of which were conducted in China (n = 13) and the United States (n = 11) and published over the last four years (n = 26). Three studies were multicenter investigations, while five articles were based on a national-level survey. The air quality (AQ) was assessed by monitoring stations (n = 24) or dispersion models (n = 7). Many studies were population questionnaire-based, air monitoring and time-series studies, and web-based investigations. A direct association between exposure and perception emerged in 20 studies. This systematic review has shown that most of the studies establish a relationship between risk perception measurement. A broad spectrum of concepts and notions related to perception also emerged, which is undoubtedly an indicator of the wealth of available knowledge and is promising for future research.","Cori, Liliana; Donzelli, Gabriele; Gorini, Francesca; Bianchi, Fabrizio; Curzio, Olivia",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899325/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176424,132

595595,Translating Research into Clinical Practice: Functional Recovery Post Total Hip Arthroplasty Using Outcomes Gathered in the Usual Physical Therapy Practice Setting,2011-04-23,"Abstract Background: The coronavirus pandemic's public health and economic impacts have led to much hope in the US regarding the prospect of a safe, effective vaccine to either prevent infection or minimize symptoms and reduce mortality risk. However, recent US polls indicate a concerning level of hesitancy that will likely lead to suboptimal uptake if such a vaccine becomes available. This study investigated demographic differences regarding US adults' intent, uncertainty, and refusal to receive a potential coronavirus vaccine and specific reasons for intention to receive it. Methods and findings: Multivariable analysis of Associated Press (AP)-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research cross-sectional survey data collected in May 2020 from a US nationally representative panel of adults (n=1000). Respondents were asked if they would receive a coronavirus vaccine (yes, unsure, no). Among those answering yes, the specific reasons were: to protect self, family, and community; chronic health condition; and having a doctor who recommends vaccines. Multinomial logistic regression models indicated numerous subgroup differences between participants who indicating (1) uncertainty versus refusal, (2) intent versus refusal, and (3) intent versus uncertainty, with the highest number of significant differences observed in the third comparison. Overall, higher likelihood of intention to receive the vaccine versus uncertainty and refusal were mostly observed among respondents with a college education or greater, White, non-Hispanic racial-ethnic identity, ages 60 or older, and more liberal (versus conservative) ideology. Despite variation in endorsement across the five reasons for wanting to receive the vaccine, subgroup differences were fairly consistent across these specific reasons when comparing respondents endorsing such intentions versus, respectively, refusal and uncertainty in separate analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the approval of a vaccine will potentially face problems with overall uptake due to uncertainty or refusal and contribute to creating significant demographic disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality risk. Ongoing assessment of such attitudes are needed as Phase III trials proceed, but the findings highlight need for measuring uncertainty and its underlying reasons, as well as multiple types of education and outreach efforts for those who are uncertain as well as avoidant.","Carpiano, R.

CASE PRESENTATION A 43-year-old female was brought to the emergency department with 4-5 days of confusion, disequilibrium resulting in several falls, and hallucinations. Further investigation revealed tachycardia, diaphoresis, mydriatic pupils, incomprehensible speech and she was seen picking at the air. Given multiple recent medication changes, there was initial concern for serotonin syndrome vs. an anticholinergic toxidrome. She then developed a fever, marked leukocytosis, and worsening encephalopathy. She underwent lumbar puncture and aspiration of an identified left ankle effusion. Methicillin sensitive staph aureus (MSSA) grew from blood, joint, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures within 18 h. She improved with antibiotics and incision, drainage, and washout of her ankle by orthopedic surgery. CONCLUSIONS Through integrated commentary on the diagnostic reasoning process from clinical reasoning experts, this case underscores how multiple cognitive biases can cascade sequentially, skewing clinical reasoning toward erroneous conclusions and driving potentially inappropriate testing and treatment. A fishbone diagram is provided to visually demonstrate the major factors that contributed to the diagnostic error. A case discussant describes the importance of structured reflection, a tool to promote metacognitive analysis, and the application of knowledge organization tools such as illness scripts to navigate these cognitive biases.","Magee, Charles D; Parsons, Andrew S; Millard, Alexander S; Torre, Dario",Diagnosis,https://doi.org/10.1515/dx-2020-0096; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34455730/,132

596370,A variable dimensional aerosol shield provides for perioperative COVID‐19 patients,2021-03-09,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 spread worldwide quickly. Exploring the epidemiological characteristics could provide a basis for responding to imported cases abroad and to formulate prevention and control strategies in areas where COVID-19 is still spreading rapidly. METHODS: The number of confirmed cases, daily growth, incidence and length of time from the first reported case to the end of the local cases (i.e., non-overseas imported cases) were compared by spatial (geographical) and temporal classification and visualization of the development and changes of the epidemic situation by layers through maps. RESULTS: In the first wave, a total of 539 cases were reported in Sichuan, with an incidence rate of 0.6462/100,000. The closer to Hubei the population centres were, the more pronounced the epidemic was. The peak in Sichuan Province occurred in the second week. Eight weeks after the Wuhan lockdown, the health crisis had eased. The longest epidemic length at the city level in China (except Wuhan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong) was 53 days, with a median of 23 days. Spatial autocorrelation analysis of China showed positive spatial correlation (Moran’s Index > 0, p < 0.05). Most countries outside China began to experience a rapid rise in infection rates 4 weeks after their first case. Some European countries experienced that rise earlier than the USA. The pandemic in Germany, Spain, Italy, and China took 28, 29, 34, and 18 days, respectively, to reach the peak of daily infections, after their daily increase of up to 20 cases. During this time, countries in the African region and Southeast Asian region were at an early stage of infections, those in the Eastern Mediterranean region and region of the Americas were in a rapid growth phase. CONCLUSIONS: After the closure of the outbreak city, appropriate isolation and control measures in the next 8 weeks were key to control the outbreak, which reduced the peak value and length of the outbreak. Some countries with improved epidemic situations need to develop a continuous “local strategy at entry checkpoints” to to fend off imported COVID-19.","Xu, Xinyin; Zeng, Jing; Liu, Runyou; Liu, Yang; Zhou, Xiaobo; Zhou, Lijun; Dong, Ting; Cha, Yuxin; Wang, Zhuo; Deng, Ying; Zhang, Yu; Feng, Liao; Pu, Chen; Wu, Xianping; Zhong, Bo",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153445/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-05494-6,132

This study was conducted to assess the acceptance of a 50 or 95% effective COVID-19 vaccine, when it becomes available in southeast Asia, among the general population in Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 25 and April 6, 2020. Participants were asked if they would accept a free vaccine which was 95 or 50% effective. Using a logistic regression model, we assessed the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to COVID-19 information, or perceived risk of infection with acceptance of a hypothetical COVID-19 vaccine. Results: Among 1,359 respondents, 93.3% of respondents (1,268/1,359) would like to be vaccinated for a 95% effective vaccine, but this acceptance decreased to 67.0% (911/1,359) for a vaccine with 50% effectiveness. For a 95% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker and having a higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection were associated with higher acceptance, adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.01; 95%CI: 1.01, 4.00 and aOR: 2.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 4.59, respectively; compared to civil servants, being retired was associated with less acceptance (aOR: 0.15; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.63). For a 50% effective vaccine, being a healthcare worker was also associated with greater acceptance, aOR: 1.57; 95%CI: 1.12, 2.20. Conclusion: Acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine was highly influenced by the baseline effectiveness of the vaccine. Preparing the general population to accept a vaccine with relatively low effectiveness may be difficult.","Harapan, Harapan; Wagner, Abram L.; Yufika, Amanda; Winardi, Wira; Anwar, Samsul; Gan, Alex Kurniawan; Setiawan, Abdul Malik; Rajamoorthy, Yogambigai; Sofyan, Hizir; Mudatsir, Mudatsir",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00381; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760691/,132

Methods: A total of n = 2827 medical professionals participated in an online survey between 27 March and 11 April. Results: While most participants stated that Germany was well prepared and rated the measures taken by their employer as positive, subgroup analyses revealed decisive differences. The preventive measures were rated significantly worse by nurses compared to doctors (p < 0.001) and by participants from ambulatory healthcare centres compared to participants from maximum-care hospitals (p < 0.001). Importantly, shortage of protective medical equipment was reported more commonly in the ambulatory sector (p < 0.001) and in East German federal states (p = 0.004). Moreover, the majority of health care professionals (72.4%) reported significant restrictions of daily work routine. Finally, over 60% of medical professionals had concerns regarding their own health, which were more pronounced among female participants (p = 0.024).

In the emergency department (ED), such measures have to be balanced with the requirement to treat patients urgently and transfer quickly to an acute hospital bed. We assessed, in a busy and overcrowded ED, the contribution made to a patient's stay by previous MRSA risk group identification and by selective rescreening of those patients who were previously documented in the research hospital as being MRSA positive. Patients with a previous diagnosis of MRSA colonisation were flagged automatically as ‘risk group’ (RG) on their arrival in the ED and were compared with ‘non-risk group’ (NRG), i.e. not previously demonstrated in the research hospital to be infected or colonised with MRSA. Over an 18 month period, there were 16 456 admissions via the ED, of which 985 (6%) were RG patients. The expected median times to be admitted following a request for a ward bed for NRG and RG patients were 10.4 and 12.9 h, respectively. Female sex, age >65 years, and RG status all independently predicted a statistically significantly longer stay in the ED following a request for a hospital bed. We consider that national and local policies for MRSA need to balance the welfare of patients in the ED with the need to comply with best practice, when there are inadequate ED and inpatient isolation facilities.

Role ambiguity has been conceptualized as one of the main impeding demands at work with negative consequences. The objective of the present study is to analyze the moderating effect of the support by the department head in the negative influence of the role ambiguity on the engagement and the extra-role performance behaviors of the employees. The hypothesis is proposed that the support of the department head will mean the transformation of role ambiguity into a challenging job demand with positive results. A total of 315 public employees with administrative staff have participated in this study. Results confirmed that the support of the leader moderates the effects of role ambiguity. The inclusion of this variable as a moderator transforms the influence of role ambiguity on the employees’ engagement into a positive one and reduces their negative effect on extra-role performance behaviors.

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective single-institution review of patients with known cardiac disease and positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RT-PCR from 1 March, 2020 to 30 November, 2020. Extracardiac comorbidities and cardiac risk factors were compared between those admitted for coronavirus disease 2019 illness and the rest of the cohort using univariate analysis. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with a mean age of 7.7 ± 6.7 years were identified. Six were 18 years of age or more with the oldest being 22 years of age. Seventy-six percent were Hispanic. The most common cardiac diagnoses were repaired cyanotic (n = 7, 16.6%) and palliated single ventricle (n = 7, 16.6%) congenital heart disease. Fourteen patients (33.3%) had underlying syndromes or chromosomal anomalies, nine (21%) had chronic pulmonary disease and eight (19%) were immunosuppressed. Nineteen patients (47.6%) reported no symptoms. Sixteen (38.1%) reported only mild symptoms. Six patients (14.3%) were admitted to the hospital for acute coronavirus disease 2019 illness.

In this study, a large-scale surveillance of parvoviruses in chickens and turkeys using conserved PCR assays was performed. We assessed the prevalence of ChPV/TuPV in commercial chicken and turkey farms in China between 2014 and 2019. Parvoviruses were prevalent in 51.73% (1,795/3,470) of commercial chicken and turkey farms in Guangxi, China. The highest frequency of ChPV positive samples tested by PCR occurred in chickens that were broiler chickens 64.18% (1,041/1,622) compared with breeder chickens 38.75% (572/1,476) and layer hens 38.89% (112/288), and TuPV was detected in 70/84 (83.33%). Native and exotic chicken species were both prevalent in commercial farms in southern China, and exotic broiler chickens had a higher positive rate with 88.10% (148/168), while native chickens were 50.00% (1,465/2,930). The environmental samples from poultry houses tested positive for ChPV and TuPV were 47.05% (415/874). Samples from open house flocks had higher prevalence rates of ChPV than those of closed house flocks (Table 5), among which those from the open house showed 84.16% (85/101) positivity, those from litter showed 62.86% (44/70) positivity, and those from drinking water showed 50.00% (56/112) positivity, whereas those from the closed house litter were 53.57% (60/112), those from swabs were 50.18% (138/275), and those from drinking water were 15.69% (32/204). Samples collected during spring were more frequently ChPV/ TuPV positive than those collected during other seasons. This study is the first report regarding the epidemiological surveillance of ChPV and TuPV in chicken/turkey flocks in Guangxi, China. Our results suggest that ChPV and TuPV are widely distributed in commercial fowl in Guangxi. These findings highlight the need for further epidemiological and genetic research on ChPV and TuPV in this area.","Zhang, Yanfang; Feng, Bin; Xie, Zhixun; Deng, Xianwen; Zhang, Minxiu; Xie, Zhiqin; Xie, Liji; Fan, Qing; Luo, Sisi; Zeng, Tingting; Huang, Jiaoling; Wang, Sheng",Front Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.561371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134348/,132

598992,Development and Validation of a Simple Risk Score for Diagnosing COVID-19 in the Emergency Room,2020-08-14,"The respiratory condition COVID-19 arises in a human host upon the infection with SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus that was first acknowledged in Wuhan, China, at the end of December 2019 after its outbreak of viral pneumonia. The full-blown COVID-19 can lead, in susceptible individuals, to premature death because of the massive viral proliferation, hypoxia, misdirected host immunoresponse, microthrombosis, and drug toxicities. Alike other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 has a neuroinvasive potential, which may be associated with early neurological symptoms. In the past, the nervous tissue of patients infected with other coronaviruses was shown to be heavily infiltrated. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 commonly report dysosmia, which has been related to the viral access in the olfactory bulb. However, this early symptom may reflect the nasal proliferation that should not be confused with the viral access in the central nervous system of the host, which can instead be allowed by means of other routes for spreading in most of the neuroanatomical districts. Axonal, trans-synaptic, perineural, blood, lymphatic, or Trojan routes can gain the virus multiples accesses from peripheral neuronal networks, thus ultimately invading the brain and brainstem. The death upon respiratory failure may be also associated with the local inflammation- and thrombi-derived damages to the respiratory reflexes in both the lung neuronal network and brainstem center. Beyond the infection-associated neurological symptoms, long-term neuropsychiatric consequences that could occur months after the host recovery are not to be excluded. While our article does not attempt to fully comprehend all accesses for host neuroinvasion, we aim at stimulating researchers and clinicians to fully consider the neuroinvasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which is likely to affect the peripheral nervous system targets first, such as the enteric and pulmonary nervous networks. This acknowledgment may shed some light on the disease understanding further guiding public health preventive efforts and medical therapies to fight the pandemic that directly or indirectly affects healthy isolated individuals, quarantined subjects, sick hospitalized, and healthcare workers.","Briguglio, Matteo; Bona, Alberto; Porta, Mauro; Dell'Osso, Bernardo; Pregliasco, Fabrizio Ernesto; Banfi, Giuseppe",Front Physiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2020.00671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581854/,132
599248,Incidence and factors associated with COVID-19 in 13 hemodialysis units,2021-06-18,"Although conventional antimicrobial drugs have been viewed as miraculous cure-alls for the past 80 years, increasing antimicrobial drug resistance requires a major and rapid intervention. However, the development of novel but still conventional systemic antimicrobial agents, having only a single mode or site of action, will not alleviate the situation because it is probably only a matter of time until any such agents will also become ineffective. To continue to produce new agents based on this notion is unacceptable, and there is an increasing need for alternative approaches to the problem. By contrast, light-activated molecules called photoantimicrobials act locally via the in-situ production of highly reactive oxygen species, which simultaneously attack various biomolecular sites in the pathogenic target and therefore offer both multiple and variable sites of action. This non-specificity at the target circumvents conventional mechanisms of resistance and inhibits the development of resistance to the agents themselves. Photoantimicrobial therapy is safe and easy to implement and, unlike conventional agents, the activity spectrum of photoantimicrobials covers bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa. However, clinical trials of these new, truly broad-spectrum, and minimally toxic agents have been few, and the funding for research and development is almost non-existent. Photoantimicrobials constitute one of the few ways forward through the morass of drug-resistant infectious disease and should be fully explored. In this Personal View, we raise awareness of the novel photoantimicrobial technologies that offer a viable alternative to conventional drugs in many relevant application fields, and could thus slow the pace of resistance development.","Wainwright, Mark; Maisch, Tim; Nonell, Santi; Plaetzer, Kristjan; Almeida, Adelaide; Tegos, George P; Hamblin, Michael R",The Lancet Infectious Diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27884621/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309916302687; https://doi.org/10.1016/s1473-3099(16)30268-7; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1473309916302687; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5280084?pdf=render,132

Objective To analyse the efficacy and safety of early anti-inflammatory treatment (AIT) with i.v anakinra with or without glucocorticoids (GC) in COVID19 pneumonia. Methods We performed a retrospective single-centre cohort study on patients admitted for COVID19 pneumonia from February 26th to April 29th, 2020 to assess the efficacy of early AIT with i.v. Anakinra (100mg every 8 hours for 3 days, with tapering) alone or in combination with GC (i.v. methylprednisolone, 1-2 mg/kg daily, with tapering). Standard of care (SOC) treatment was: hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin with or without antivirals and anticoagulants. Late rescue AIT with anakinra or tocilizumab was also evaluated. Treatment effect on Overall Survival (OS) was assessed by a Propensity Score adjusted Cox model. Results 128 patients were analyzed; 63 received early AIT (30 anakinra, 33 anakinra and CG) at admission; 65 patients (44 with SOC, 21 SOC plus late rescue AIT) did not and were used as controls. After adjusting for all the unbalanced baseline covariates, early AIT reduced the hazard of mortality by 74% (adjusted HR=0.26, p<0.001). The effect was similar in patients receiving anakinra alone (adjusted HR=0.28, p=0.04) and anakinra plus GC (adjusted HR=0.33, p=0.07). Late rescue treatment did not show a significant advantage over SOC alone (adjusted HR=0.82, p=0.70). Conclusions This study suggests, on a larger series of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, the potential efficacy and safety of the early use of high doses of i.v. anakinra with or without GC.","Pontali, Emanuele; Volpi, Stefano; Signori, Alessio; Antonucci, Giancarlo; Castellaneta, Marco; Buzzi, Davide; Montale, Amedeo; Bustaffa, Marta; Angelelli, Alessia; Caorsi, Roberta; Giambruno, Elisa; Bobbio, Nicoletta; Feasi, Marcello; Gueli, Ilaria; Tricerri, Francesca; Calautti, Francesca; Castagnola, Elio; Moscatelli, Andrea; Rollandi, Gian Andrea; Ravelli, Angelo; Cassola, Giovanni; Sormani, Maria Pia; Gattorno, Marco",J Allergy Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33556464/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.01.024; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674921001718?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674921001718,132

600704,Heterogeneity in COVID-19 severity patterns among age-gender groups: an analysis of 778 692 Mexican patients through a meta-clustering technique,2021-02-23,"Study Objectives: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the pandemic, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), with many of those infected now facing the burden of prolonged symptoms after they have cleared the infection. The most debilitating of these, called post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), known colloquially as long COVID, is thought to be linked to immune dysregulation due to harmful inflammation, with the exact causes being unknown. Given the oral-lung aspiration axis being a key factor to many respiratory infectious processes and the microbiome’s previous role in systemic inflammation, we aimed to examine the relationship between the oral microbiome and the duration of symptom, including development of long COIVD. Methods: Symptom duration was determined via follow-up among a cohort of emergency department patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection. Tongue swabs were collected from patients presenting with symptoms concerning for COVID-19 infection. Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection were followed until resolution of all symptoms. Bacterial composition of oral samples was determined by metagenomic sequencing. We used random forest classification modeling to identify microbiota and clinical covariates that associate with longer duration of symptoms. Results: Of the 31 patients followed, 17 developed ongoing symptomatic COVID-19 (symptoms > 4 weeks) and 10 went on to long COVID (symptoms>8 weeks). Patients with prolonged symptoms had higher abundances of microbiota that induce inflammation, such as members of the genera Prevotella and Veillonella. Notable is the increased abundances of species that produce inflammation causing lipopolysaccharides and the similarity of long COVID patients’ oral microbiome to those of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. Conclusion: This is the first study to describe the microbiome’s association with long COVID and explore the possibility that the oral microbiome may play a role in this disease.","Haran, J.

601055,Viral Replication and Antibody Kinetics in the Recognition of Asymptomatic COVID-19 Patients,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND: The improvements in genomics methods coupled with readily accessible high-throughput sequencing have contributed to our understanding of microbial species, metagenomes, infectious diseases and more. To maximize the impact of these genomics studies, it is important that data from biological samples will become publicly available with standardized metadata. The availability of data at public archives provides the hope that greater insights could be obtained through integration with multi-omics data, reproducibility of published studies, or meta-analyses of large diverse datasets. These datasets should include a description of the host, organism, environmental source of the specimen, spatial-temporal information and other relevant metadata, but unfortunately these attributes are often missing and when present, they show inconsistencies in the use of metadata standards and ontologies. RESULTS: METAGENOTE (https://metagenote.niaid.nih.gov) is a web portal that greatly facilitates the annotation of samples from genomic studies and streamlines the submission process of sequencing files and metadata to the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) (Leinonen R, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 39:D19-21, 2011) for public access. This platform offers a wide selection of packages for different types of biological and experimental studies with a special emphasis on the standardization of metadata reporting. These packages follow the guidelines from the MIxS standards developed by the Genomics Standard Consortium (GSC) and adopted by the three partners of the International Nucleotides Sequencing Database Collaboration (INSDC) (Cochrane G, et al, Nucleic Acids Res, 44:D48-50, 2016) - National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ). METAGENOTE then compiles, validates and manages the submission through an easy-to-use web interface minimizing submission errors and eliminating the need for submitting sequencing files via a separate file transfer mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: METAGENOTE is a public resource that focuses on simplifying the annotation and submission process of data with its corresponding metadata. Users of METAGENOTE will benefit from the easy to use annotation interface but most importantly will be encouraged to publish metadata following standards and ontologies that make the public data available for reuse.","Quiñones, Mariam; Liou, David T.; Shyu, Conrad; Kim, Wongyu; Vujkovic-Cvijin, Ivan; Belkaid, Yasmine; Hurt, Darrell E.",BMC Bioinformatics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03694-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32883210/,132

Here we describe the federal language policies that govern this type of e-commerce, and in particular, the language policies of the Federal Trade Commission, which dictate what can and cannot be communicated by MLM companies and their contractors. We then illustrate how these federal language policies are enacted, and at times subverted, for financial gain during the COVID-19 economic and health crisis which rendered many people vulnerable. We draw on the discourse analysis of public documents, MLM insider sources via the first author, and over 100,000 public Instagram posts published by MLM independent contractors collected with the third-party Instagram data extraction tool, Phantombuster. We find that MLM independent contractors, although varying widely with respect to their enactment of federal and corporate policy, frequently reference COVID-19 implicitly or explicitly, a practice prohibited by federal policy. We demonstrate that quantitative and qualitative discourse analysis of language policies and practices of MLM social media provides a productive lens for understanding both the communication challenges of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.

601535,Long-Term Respiratory and Neurological Sequelae of COVID-19,2020-11-01,"Bats can perceive the world by using a wide range of sensory systems, and some of the systems have become highly specialized, such as auditory sensory perception. Among bat species, the Old World leaf-nosed bats and horseshoe bats (rhinolophoid bats) possess the most sophisticated echolocation systems. Here, we reported the whole-genome sequencing and de novo assembles of two rhinolophoid bats – the great leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros armiger) and the Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus). Comparative genomic analyses revealed the adaptation of auditory sensory perception in the rhinolophoid bat lineages, probably resulting from the extreme selectivity used in the auditory processing by these bats. Pseudogenization of some vision-related genes in rhinolophoid bats was observed, suggesting that these genes have undergone relaxed natural selection. An extensive contraction of olfactory receptor gene repertoires was observed in the lineage leading to the common ancestor of bats. Further extensive gene contractions can be observed in the branch leading to the rhinolophoid bats. Such concordance suggested that molecular changes at one sensory gene might have direct consequences for genes controlling for other sensory modalities. To characterize the population genetic structure and patterns of evolution, we re-sequenced the genome of 20 great leaf-nosed bats from four different geographical locations of China. The result showed similar sequence diversity values and little differentiation among populations. Moreover, evidence of genetic adaptations to high altitudes in the great leaf-nosed bats was observed. Taken together, our work provided a useful resource for future research on the evolution of bats.","Dong, Dong; Lei, Ming; Hua, Panyu; Pan, Yi-Hsuan; Mu, Shuo; Zheng, Guantao; Pang, Erli; Lin, Kui; Zhang, Shuyi",Mol Biol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27803123/; https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msw231,132

Although considerable research has been conducted on source localization in steady-state indoor environments, very few studies have dealt with the more challenging source localization problems in dynamic indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive particle swarm optimization (CPSO) method to locate a contaminant source in dynamic indoor environments with mechanical ventilation and develops a multi-robot source localization system to experimentally validate the method. Three robots were used to test the presented method in a typical dynamic indoor environment with periodic swinging of the air supply louvers of a cabinet air conditioner. The presented method was validated with two typical source locations, DS (in the downwind zone) and RS (in the recirculation zone). For DS and RS, 15 and 14 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 100% and 93.3%, and each robot moved an average of 24.4 and 23.6 steps, respectively. The presented method was also compared with the standard particle swarm optimization (SPSO) and wind utilization II (WUII) methods for locating the source at DS. For the SPSO and WUII methods, only 3 and 6 experiments out of 15 experiments were successful, with success rates of 20% and 40% and averages of 33.0 and 38.0 steps, respectively. The experimental results show that the presented method not only has a much higher success rate than the SPSO and WUII methods but also has higher source localization efficiency.","Feng, Qilin; Cai, Hao; Chen, Zhilong; Yang, Yibin; Lu, Jingyu; Li, Fei; Xu, Jiheng; Li, Xianting",Energy Build,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0378778819303263; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288120/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778819303263; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2019.03.032,132

The aim of this study was to determine diagnostic accuracy of electrochemiluminescence based automated antigen detection immunoassay comparing with molecular based test RT-PCR (Covid-19). METHODS It was a cross-sectional study conducted in RMI Peshawar, from 1st April 2021 till 30th April 2021. The study comprised 170 individuals who were suspected of having Covid-19. Nasopharyngeal samples taken from suspected individuals were analyzed by RT-PCR and automated antigen test (Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen) simultaneously. The correlation of SARS-CoV-2 antigen with PCR positive and negative cases was analyzed for specificity, sensitivity respectively. RESULTS The ECLIA based Elecsys antigen test (Roche) revealed overall sensitivity 72%, specificity 95% and accuracy of 94.9%. Sensitivity of antigen test progressively declined from 94.3% in Ct <25 to 70.8% in Ct 26-29 and then to 47.2% in Ct 30-35. CONCLUSIONS Based on the findings of our study we conclude that automated antigen testing (Elecsys SARS-CoV-2 Antigen) cannot replace molecular based testing like RT PCR.

602242,A Meta-Analysis on the Effects of Hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19,2020-08-24,"INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE-2) was demonstrated to be the receptor for cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. ACE-2 mRNA was identified in several human tissues and recently also in thyroid cells in vitro. PURPOSE: Aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of pro-inflammatory cytokines on the ACE-2 mRNA levels in human thyroid cells in primary cultures. METHODS: Primary thyroid cell cultures were treated with IFN-γ and TNF-α alone or in combination for 24 h. ACE-2 mRNA levels were measured by RT-PCR. As a control, the levels of IFN-γ inducible chemokine (CXCL10) were measured in the respective cell culture supernatants. RESULTS: The mean levels of ACE-2 mRNA increased after treatment with IFN-γ and TNF-α in all the thyroid cell preparations, while the combination treatment did not consistently synergically increase ACE-2-mRNA. At difference, CXCL10 was consistently increased by IFN-γ and synergically further increased by the combination treatment with IFN-γ + TNF-α, with respect to IFN-γ alone. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study show that IFN-γ and, to a lesser extent TNF-α consistently increase ACE-2 mRNA levels in NHT primary cultures. More interestingly, the combined stimulation (proven to be effective according to the synergic effect registered for CXCL10) produces different responses in terms of ACE-2 mRNA modulation. These results would suggest that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines could facilitate the entering of the virus in cells by further increasing ACE-2 expression and/or account for the different degree of severity of SARS-COV-2 infection. This hypothesis deserves to be confirmed by further specific studies.","Coperchini, Francesca; Ricci, Gianluca; Croce, Laura; Denegri, Marco; Ruggiero, Rubina; Villani, Laura; Magri, Flavia; Chiovato, Luca; Rotondi, Mario",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-021-02807-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224085/,132

This paper gives a new approach to create and manage image-based EPR from actual patient records, and also presents a novel method to use Web technology and DICOM standard to build an open architecture for collaborative medical applications. The system can be used for both intranet and internet medical applications such as tele-diagnosis, teleconsultation, and distant learning.","Zhang, Jianguo; Sun, Jianyong; Yang, Yuanyuan; Chen, Xiaomeng; Meng, Lili; Lian, Ping",Comput Med Imaging Graph,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895611104001132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15755531/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0895611104001132,132
602627,Symmetrical drug‐related intertriginous and flexural exanthema like eruption associated with COVID‐19 vaccination,2021-08-31,"PURPOSE: Parents of infants admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) experience additional stress due to restrictions on their presence and visits by other family members during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study aims to describe how this impacted parents and how NICU staff could support them. DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 25 parents (16 mothers, 9 fathers) of infants admitted to our NICU during the first COVID-19 lockdown completed online questionnaires with socio-demographic questions, the Parental Stressor Scale:NICU (PSS:NICU) and questions related to COVID-19. RESULTS: Being separated from, and not being able to hold their infant at all times were among the most important PSS:NICU stressors. Parents experienced additional stress because other family members were not allowed to visit. They indicated that NICU staff could support them by clearly explaining the reasons for visitor restrictions and by ensuring that they felt heard. Most parents supported the restrictions, but also mentioned that less strict measures would really help them. CONCLUSIONS: Parents who participated in this study found it very stressful that they could not be with their infant together with their partner and other family members. Furthermore, parents recommended the hospital management to continuously reconsider whether particular restrictions could be lifted in case of a new lockdown. Together with clear communication, this would result in less parenteral stress. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Hospital management should be cautious on restricting the presence of parents and other family members and scale restrictions back whenever possible.","Meesters, Naomi; van Dijk, Monique; de Carvalho, Fernanda Sampaio; Haverman, Lotte; Reiss, Irwin K.M.; Simons, Sinno H.P.; van den Bosch, Gerbrich E.",J Pediatr Nurs,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S088259632100292X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34642075/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S088259632100292X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.09.024,132

603968,The Landscape of Humoral Immunity in the CSF of COVID-19 Patients With Neuropsychiatric Involvement,2021-05-01,"Background Widely available population testing is critical to public health efforts to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, COVID-19 testing has been low in underserved communities disproportionately affected by COVID-19. One approach to increase testing rates is through the secondary distribution of self-collection kits, where an individual distributes test kits to contacts in their social network and encourages them to self-collect test specimens. We outline a randomized clinical trial, COVID-19 Self-testing Through Rapid Network Distribution (C-STRAND), and a cohort study of individuals with COVID-19, to determine the impact of a secondary distribution strategy on COVID-19 testing among medically underserved populations. Methods The clinical trial will seek to enroll 1048 adult index participants from federally health qualified centers in Philadelphia, PA seeking COVID-19 testing. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive multiple self-collection test kits or multiple referrals for standard clinic-based tests to distribute to contacts within their social network. The primary outcome will be testing among at least two network contacts at 8 weeks. Index participants and network contacts who test positive for COVID-19 from C-STRAND will be eligible to join the COVID-19 Close Contact Self-testing Study (CloseST), assessing the secondary distribution of self-collection test kits among individuals with COVID-19. The primary outcome of this cohort will be the number of close contacts who test positive at 8 weeks. Conclusion Novel strategies to promote COVID-19 testing are necessary, particularly among underserved populations most affected by COVID-19. We will determine the efficacy of a self-testing secondary distribution strategy. The results may inform efforts to increase testing rates during the current pandemic.","Bien-Gund, Cedric H.; Shah, Jesal; Ho, Joshua I.; Stephens-Shields, Alisa; Shea, Kathleen; Fishman, Jessica; Thirumurthy, Harsha; Acri, Trisha; Dugosh, Karen; Gross, Robert",Contemp Clin Trials,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1551714421003219; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1551714421003219?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34606989/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2021.106585,132

IgM responses were either found earlier than IgG, or together with IgG, later than IgG or were missing. Therefore, clear distinctions between early, intermediate and past infections are obviously not possible merely on the basis of IgM and IgG determinations. The review of publications on the serology of other virus groups shows that variable IgM responses can be found as well and therefore are not specific for SARS CoV‐2 infections. A model to explain this variability is proposed. The inclusion of avidity determination into regular diagnostic procedures has allowed to resolve such “atypical” serological constellations. The potential use of avidity determination for the diagnosis of Covid‐19, for risk assessment, epidemiological studies, analysis of cross reactions, as well as for the control of vaccination programs is suggested and discussed.

This is a narrative review to gather information on all aspects of COVID-19 in elderly patients with cognitive impairment. First, the following three mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the neurological complications associated with COVID-19: 1) direct invasion, 2) immune and inflammatory reaction, and 3) hypoxic brain damage by COVID-19. Next, because the elderly dementia patient population is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, we discussed risk factors and difficulties associated with cognitive disorders in this vulnerable population. We also reviewed the effects of the patient living environment in COVID-19 cases that required intensive care unit (ICU) care. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of stringent social restrictions and COVID-19 pandemic-mediated policies on dementia patients and care providers. Finally, we provided the following strategies for working with elderly dementia patients: general preventive methods; dementia care at home and nursing facilities according to the activities of daily living and dementia characteristics; ICU care after COVID-19 infection; and public health care system and government response. We propose that longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to fully examine COVID-19 associated neurological complications, such as dementia, and the efficacy of telemedicine/telehealth care programs.","Ryoo, Nayoung; Pyun, Jung-Min; Baek, Min Jae; Suh, Jeewon; Kang, Min Ju; Wang, Min Jeong; Youn, Young Chul; Yang, Dong Won; Kim, Seong Yoon; Park, Young Ho; Kim, SangYun",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140593/,132

Treatment varies from topicals to systemic drugs and data on susceptibility to viral infections in psoriatic patients are scarce. The objectives of this study were to analyze psoriatic patients on different therapies who were at risk for COVID-19 for seroprevalence of SARS-COV-2, pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, comorbidities and outcomes in order to unveil the immunological mechanisms involved in the anti-viral response in patients with psoriasis. Seventy-five patients with psoriasis were divided according to treatment: immunobiologics, methotrexate, topicals and acitretin. Twenty healthy controls were included. Plasma samples were collected for: IgG SARS-COV-2 (ELISA); IL-27, IL-29 and IL-18 (ELISA); and IL-1β, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNF (cytometric array). Seropositivity for SARS-COV-2 was detected in 24 out of 75 psoriasis patients and did not relate to COVID-19 symptoms and/or hospitalization, despite associated comorbidities. Psoriasis patients who were asymptomatic for SARS-COV-2 exhibited immune imbalance with high levels of IL-18, IL-17A and IL-6, and low levels of IL-27 compared to healthy controls. Psoriasis groups showed significant increased cytokine levels only in the group with immunobiologics. Despite immune deviations and lower IL-27, which has a potential antiviral impact, psoriatic patients did not exhibit complications related to COVID-19. An understanding of this kind of proinflammatory profile of psoriatic patients and of the lack of severe outcomes for COVID-19 is essential to establish novel therapeutic approaches and preventive measures, including with regard to the concomitance of viral infections.","Yendo, Tatiana Mina; Sato, Maria Notomi; Branco, Anna Cláudia Calvielli Castelo; Pietrobon, Anna Julia; Teixeira, Franciane Mouradian Emidio; Ramos, Yasmim Álefe Leuzzi; Alberca, Ricardo Wesley; Valêncio, Cesar Giudice; Arruda, Vivian Nunes; Romiti, Ricardo; Arnone, Marcelo; Hirayama, André Luis da Silva; Duarte, Alberto Jose da Silva; Aoki, Valeria; Orfali, Raquel Leao",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34068473/,132
605713,Lung Function Sequelae In Covid-19 Patients 3 Months After Hospital Discharge,2021-02-24,"In mice, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) and natural killer (NK) cells both contribute to resistance to systemic infections with herpes viruses including mouse Cytomegalovirus (MCMV). pDCs are the major source of type I IFN (IFN-I) during MCMV infection. This response requires pDC-intrinsic MyD88-dependent signaling by Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9. Provided that they express appropriate recognition receptors such as Ly49H, NK cells can directly sense and kill MCMV-infected cells. The loss of any one of these responses increases susceptibility to infection. However, the relative importance of these antiviral immune responses and how they are related remain unclear. In humans, while IFN-I responses are essential, MyD88 is dispensable for antiviral immunity. Hence, a higher redundancy has been proposed in the mechanisms promoting protective immune responses against systemic infections by herpes viruses during natural infections in humans. It has been assumed, but not proven, that mice fail to mount protective MyD88-independent IFN-I responses. In humans, the mechanism that compensates MyD88 deficiency has not been elucidated. To address these issues, we compared resistance to MCMV infection and immune responses between mouse strains deficient for MyD88, the IFN-I receptor and/or Ly49H. We show that selective depletion of pDC or genetic deficiencies for MyD88 or TLR9 drastically decreased production of IFN-I, but not the protective antiviral responses. Moreover, MyD88, but not IFN-I receptor, deficiency could largely be compensated by Ly49H-mediated antiviral NK cell responses. Thus, contrary to the current dogma but consistent with the situation in humans, we conclude that, in mice, in our experimental settings, MyD88 is redundant for IFN-I responses and overall defense against a systemic herpes virus infection. Moreover, we identified direct NK cell sensing of infected cells as one mechanism able to compensate for MyD88 deficiency in mice. Similar mechanisms likely contribute to protect MyD88- or IRAK4-deficient patients from viral infections.","Cocita, Clément; Guiton, Rachel; Bessou, Gilles; Chasson, Lionel; Boyron, Marilyn; Crozat, Karine; Dalod, Marc",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25954804/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1004897,132

607350,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on an interdisciplinary endoscopy unit in a German “hotspot” area: a single center experience,2020-11-02,"Due to the virulence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the pathogen responsible for the respiratory disease termed COVID-19, there has been a significant increase in demand for surgical masks and N95 respirators in medical clinics as well as within communities operating during the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, community members, business owners, and even medical personnel have resorted to alternative methods for sterilizing face coverings and N95 respirators for reuse. While significant work has shown that vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) can be used to sterilize N95 respirators, the cost and installation time for these sterilization systems limit their accessibility. To this end, we have designed and constructed a novel, cost-effective, and scalable VHP system that can be used to sterilize N95 respirators and other face coverings for clinical and community applications. N95 respirators inoculated with P22 bacteriophage showed a greater than 6-log10 reduction in viral load when sterilized in the VHP system for one 60-minute cycle. Further, N95 respirators treated with 20 cycles in this VHP system showed comparable filtration efficiency to untreated N95 respirators in a 50 to 200 nanometer particulate challenge filtration test. While a 23% average increase in water droplet roll-off time was observed for N95 respirators treated with 5 cycles in the sterilization, no breakdown in fluid resistance was detected. These data suggest that our VHP system is effective in sterilizing N95 respirators and other polypropylene masks for reuse. Relating to the present epidemic, deployment of this system reduces the risk of COVID-19 community transmission while conserving monetary resources otherwise spent on the continuous purchase of disposable N95 respirators and other face coverings. In summary, this novel, scientifically validated sterilization system can be easily built at a low cost and implemented in a wide range of settings.","Dave, N.; Pascavis, K. S.; Patterson, J.

608351,Social support and clinical improvement in COVID-19 positive patients in China,2020-08-24,"BACKGROUND: During the period of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, strong intervention measures, such as lockdown, travel restriction, and suspension of work and production, may have curbed the spread of other infectious diseases, including natural focal diseases. In this study, we aimed to study the impact of COVID-19 prevention and control measures on the reported incidence of natural focal diseases (brucellosis, malaria, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], dengue, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS], rabies, tsutsugamushi and Japanese encephalitis [JE]). METHODS: The data on daily COVID-19 confirmed cases and natural focal disease cases were collected from Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Jiangsu Provincial CDC). We described and compared the difference between the incidence in 2020 and the incidence in 2015–2019 in four aspects: trend in reported incidence, age, sex, and urban and rural distribution. An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (p, d, q) × (P, D, Q)(s) model was adopted for natural focal diseases, malaria and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), and an ARIMA (p, d, q) model was adopted for dengue. Nonparametric tests were used to compare the reported and the predicted incidence in 2020, the incidence in 2020 and the previous 4 years, and the difference between the duration from illness onset date to diagnosed date (DID) in 2020 and in the previous 4 years. The determination coefficient (R(2)) was used to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model simulation. RESULTS: Natural focal diseases in Jiangsu Province showed a long-term seasonal trend. The reported incidence of natural focal diseases, malaria and dengue in 2020 was lower than the predicted incidence, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). The reported incidence of brucellosis in July, August, October and November 2020, and SFTS in May to November 2020 was higher than that in the same period in the previous 4 years (P < 0.05). The reported incidence of malaria in April to December 2020, HFRS in March, May and December 2020, and dengue in July to November 2020 was lower than that in the same period in the previous 4 years (P < 0.05). In males, the reported incidence of malaria in 2020 was lower than that in the previous 4 years, and the reported incidence of dengue in 2020 was lower than that in 2017–2019. The reported incidence of malaria in the 20–60-year age group was lower than that in the previous 4 years; the reported incidence of dengue in the 40–60-year age group was lower than that in 2016–2018. The reported cases of malaria in both urban and rural areas were lower than in the previous 4 years. The DID of brucellosis and SFTS in 2020 was shorter than that in 2015–2018; the DID of tsutsugamushi in 2020 was shorter than that in the previous 4 years. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions for COVID-19 may help control the epidemics of natural focal diseases in Jiangsu Province. The reported incidence of natural focal diseases, especially malaria and dengue, decreased during the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. COVID-19 prevention and control measures had the greatest impact on the reported incidence of natural focal diseases in males and people in the 20–60-year age group.

Although the number of ICU beds is crucial during the COVID-19 epidemic, there is no recognized early indicator to anticipate it. In the Ile-de-France region, from February 20 to May 5, 2020, emergency medical service (EMS) calls and the response provided (ambulances) together the percentage of positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests, general practitioner (GP) and emergency department (ED) visits, and hospital admissions of COVID-19 patients were recorded daily and compared to the number of ICU patients. Correlation curve analysis was performed to determine the best correlation coefficient, depending on the number of days the indicator has been shifted. Primary endpoint was the number of ICU patients. EMS calls, percentage of positive RT-PCR tests, ambulances used, ED and GP visits of COVID-19 patients were strongly associated (R(2) ranging between 0.79 to 0.99, all P<0.001) with COVID-19 ICU patients with an anticipation delay of 23, 15, 14, 13, and 12 days respectively. Hospitalization did not anticipate ICU bed requirement. A qualitative analysis of the onset of the second wave period of the epidemic (August 1 to September 15, 2020) in the same region provided similar results. The daily number of COVID19-related telephone calls received by the EMS and corresponding dispatch ambulances, and the proportion of positive RT-PCR tests were the earliest indicators of the number of COVID19 patients requiring ICU care during the epidemic crisis, rapidly followed by ED and GP visits. This information may help health authorities to anticipate a future epidemic, including a second wave of COVID19, or decide additional social measures.",,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241406; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33206660/,132

Here, we use a humanized mouse model to show that vascular colonization leads to the recruitment of neutrophils, which partially reduce bacterial burden and vascular damage. This partial effect is due to the ability of bacteria to colonize capillaries, venules and arterioles, as observed in human samples. In venules, potent neutrophil recruitment allows efficient bacterial phagocytosis. In contrast, in infected capillaries and arterioles, adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin are not expressed on the endothelium, and intravascular neutrophil recruitment is minimal. Our results indicate that the colonization of capillaries and arterioles by N. meningitidis creates an intravascular niche that precludes the action of neutrophils, resulting in immune escape and progression of the infection.","Manriquez, Valeria; Nivoit, Pierre; Urbina, Tomas; Echenique-Rivera, Hebert; Melican, Keira; Fernandez-Gerlinger, Marie-Paule; Flamant, Patricia; Schmitt, Taliah; Bruneval, Patrick; Obino, Dorian; Duménil, Guillaume",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315900/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24797-z,132

The specific characteristics of these viruses that led to such distinct outcomes remain unclear. Here, we apply proteome-wide comparative structural analysis aiming to identify the unique molecular elements in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome that may explain the differing consequences. By combining protein modeling and molecular dynamics simulations, we suggest non-conservative substitutions in functional regions of the spike glycoprotein (S), nsp1, and nsp3 that are contributing to differences in virulence. Particularly, we explain why the substitutions at the receptor-binding domain of S affect the structure-dynamics behavior in complexes with putative host receptors. Conservation of functional protein regions within the two taxa is also noteworthy. We suggest that the highly conserved main protease, nsp5, of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is part of their mechanism of circumventing the host interferon antiviral response. Overall, most substitutions occur on the protein surfaces and may be modulating their antigenic properties and interactions with other macromolecules. Our results imply that the striking difference in the pervasiveness of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV among humans seems to significantly derive from molecular features that modulate the efficiency of viral particles in entering the host cells and blocking the host immune response.","Prates, Erica T; Garvin, Michael R; Pavicic, Mirko; Jones, Piet; Shah, Manesh; Demerdash, Omar; Amos, B Kirtley; Geiger, Armin; Jacobson, Daniel",Mol Biol Evol,https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msaa231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941612/,132

610803,Examining the geographic distribution of six chronic disease risk factors for severe COVID-19: Veteran-nonveteran differences.,2021-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Inconsistencies regarding the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) have raised concerns for the safety of surgical staff during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic. This rapid review synthesises the literature that includes input from clinical experts to provide evidence‐based guidance for surgical services. METHODS: The rapid review comprised of targeted searches in PubMed and grey literature. Pertinent findings were discussed by a working group of clinical experts, and consensus recommendations, consistent with Australian and New Zealand Government guidelines, were formulated. RESULTS: There was a paucity of high‐quality primary studies specifically investigating appropriate surgical PPE for healthcare workers treating patients possibly infected with COVID‐19. SARS‐CoV‐2 is capable of aerosol, droplet and fomite transmission, making it essential to augment standard infection control measures with appropriate PPE, especially during surgical emergencies and aerosol‐generating procedures. All biological material should be treated a potential source of SARS‐COV‐2. Staff must have formal training in the use of PPE and should be supervised by a colleague during donning and doffing. Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 should wear a surgical mask during transfer to and from theatre. Potential solutions exist in the literature to extend the use of surgical P2/N95 respirators in situations of limited supply. CONCLUSION: PPE is advised for all high‐risk procedures and when a patient’s COVID‐19 status is unknown. Surgical departments should facilitate staggered rostering, remote meeting attendance, and self‐isolation of symptomatic staff. Vulnerable surgical staff should be identified and excluded from operations with a high risk of COVID‐19 infection.","Tan, Lorwai; Kovoor, Joshua G.; Williamson, Penny; Tivey, David R.; Babidge, Wendy J.; Collinson, Trevor G.; Hewett, Peter J.; Hugh, Thomas J.; Padbury, Robert T.

611081,Comparison of the clinical features and therapeutics of COVID-19 in cardio-cerebrovascular disease (CCVD) and non-CCVD patients,2021-04-28,"Background: Health care workers (HCWs) are at increased risk of acquiring and transmitting COVID-19 infection. Moreover, they present role models for communities with regards to attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Hence, hesitancy of HCWs towards vaccination can crucially affect the efforts aiming to contain the pandemic. Previously published studies paid little attention to HCWs in Arab countries, which have a population of over 440 million. Objectives: To assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside Arab countries, and their perceived barriers towards vaccination. Methods: A cross-sectional study based on an online survey was conducted from 14–29 January 2021, targeting Arabic-speaking HCWs from all around the world. Results: The survey recruited 5708 eligible participants (55.6% males, 44.4% females, age 30.6 ± 10 years) from 21 Arab countries (87.5%) and 54 other countries (12.5%). Our analysis showed a significant rate of vaccine hesitancy among Arabic-speaking HCWs residing in and outside of Arab countries (25.8% and 32.8%, respectively). The highest rates of hesitancy were among participants from the western regions of the Arab world (Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria). The most cited reasons for hesitancy were concerns about side effects and distrust of the expedited vaccine production and healthcare policies. Factors associated with higher hesitancy included age of 30–59, previous or current suspected or confirmed COVID-19, female gender, not knowing the vaccine type authorized in the participant’s country, and not regularly receiving the influenza vaccine. Conclusion: This is the first large-scale multinational post-vaccine-availability study on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among HCWs. It reveals high rates of hesitancy among Arab-speaking HCWs. Unless addressed properly, this hesitancy can impede the efforts for achieving widespread vaccination and collective immunity.","Qunaibi, Eyad; Basheti, Iman; Soudy, Mohamed; Sultan, Iyad",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34063313/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050446,132

This study aim at detetction of risk factors for AKI among patients admitted for SARI at our Center for COVID 19 screening. METHOD: Restrospective study by reviewing admission notes from March 2020 until December 2020 at our district center. Patient aged more than 18 year old who admitted for SARI as defined by World Health Organisation and AKI as defined by Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guideline were included. Chronic kidney disease and End stage Renal Failure as defined by KDIGO were excluded. RESULTS: A total 230 ( 56%) patients out of 410 patients with SARI had AKI during hospitalisation. The mean age was 72 years old (SD 13.8), 130 (56.5%) were male and 100 ( 43.5%) were female. SARI patients with AKI took mean 5 days ( SD 0.9) to be admitted at our center from the first day of illness. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 27.2 kg/m(2) . The mean arterial pressure was 52.1 ( SD 3.7) mmhg upon admission. The mean neutrophils lymphocytes ratio ( NLR ) was 22.4 (SD 2.4). The independant Risk factors for AKI in SARI are Male gender ( OR 0.95; 95% CI 0.35-2.6), smoking ( OR 0.72 ;95% CI 0.23- 2.3), ischaemic heart disease (OR 0.48; 95% CI 0.06-3.8), diabetes mellitus ( OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.39-3.38) and hypertension ( OR 1.58; 95% CI 0.58-4.25). CONCLUSION: Non modifiable risk factors for AKI in SARI include male gender and advance age. The modifiable risk factors for AKI in SARI are over weight, smoking, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. NLR play a role in predicting AKI among SARI patients. Delay hospitalisation and hypoperfusion predispose to AKI in SARI.

614125,Telemedicine in the era of coronavirus 19: Implications for postoperative care in cardiac surgery,2021-08-02,"Abstract Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed unprecedented challenges for nations worldwide, among which medication shortages can cause a devastatingly negative impact on global health. Using Taiwan as an example, this report was to describe the sources of potential medication shortages, discuss the preparedness and contingency strategies to address medication shortages, and outline the evidence-based recommendations on ensuring an stable medication supply and improving the quality and security of medicines. Summary Much of drug shortages have focused on shortfalls of overseas manufacturing, but the effect of the COVID-19 crisis on misallocation of medications within the nation’s internal supply chains is also a great concern. A wide range of stakeholders are involved in the pharmaceutical supply chains, including government regulators, healthcare insurers, pharmaceutical companies, frontline physicians and pharmacists, patients and families, professional and patient associations or unions, and even individuals who acquire medications from abroad. Collaborative inputs and efforts from all these interdependent stakeholders are critical for establishing transparent preparedness and contingency plans to address drug shortages affected by disruptions of overseas manufacturing or stock-outs in pharmacies due to medication misallocation. Strategies have been documented and recommended in Taiwan and the United States to mitigate drug shortages and ensure the long-term quality and security of medicines. Conclusion Barriers to accessing medicines are nothing new, but the COVID-19 pandemic poses urgent and even novel challenges to the stability and integrity of medication supply, which urges for a need to reconsider and reinforce effective management strategies for pharmaceuticals. Active management, transparent information, and timely communications are essential to ensure a stable supply of key therapeutic medications, especially during a pandemic.","Kuo, Shihchen; Ou, Huang-Tz; Wang, C.

614282,COVID‐19 and cardiovascular problems in elderly patients: Food for thought,2021-02-28,"Background. The threat of contagious infectious diseases is constantly evolving, as demographic explosion, travel globalization and changes in human lifestyle increase the risk of spreading pathogens, leading to accelerated changes in disease landscape. Of particular interest is the aftermath of superimposing viral epidemics (especially SARS-CoV-2) over long-standing diseases, such as tuberculosis (TB), which remains a significant disease for public health worldwide and especially in emerging economies. Methods and Results. PubMed electronic database was requested for relevant articles linking TB, influenza and SARS-CoV viruses and subsequently assessed eligibility according to inclusion criteria. Using a data mining approach, we also queried the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19). We aimed to answer the following questions: What can be learned from other coronavirus outbreaks (with a focus on TB patients)? Is coinfection (TB and SARS-CoV-2) more severe? Is there a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2? How does the TB vaccine affect COVID-19? How does one diagnosis affect the other? Discussions. Few essential elements about TB and SARS-CoV coinfections were discussed. First, lessons from the past outbreaks (other coronaviruses), as well as influenza pandemic / seasonal outbreaks have taught the importance of infection control to avoid the severe impact on TB patients. Second, although challenging due to data scarcity, investigating the pathological pathways linking TB and SARS-CoV-2 leads to the idea that their coexistence might yield a more severe clinical evolution. Finally, we addressed the issues of vaccination and diagnostic reliability in the context of coinfection. Conclusions. Because viral respiratory infections and TB impede the host's immune responses, it can be assumed that their harmful synergism may contribute to more severe clinical evolution. Despite the rapidly growing number of cases, the data needed to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with latent TB and TB sequelae still lies ahead.","Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Grigorescu, Cristina; Pavel, Cristina Alice; Artene, Bogdan; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Cernomaz, Andrei; Burlacu, Alexandru",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.28.20082917v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082917,132
614378,Chapter 8 Business Strategies and Risk Factors,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: A novel disease poses special challenges for informatics solutions. Biomedical informatics relies for the most part on structured data, which require a preexisting data or knowledge model; however, novel diseases do not have preexisting knowledge models. In an emergent epidemic, language processing can enable rapid conversion of unstructured text to a novel knowledge model. However, although this idea has often been suggested, no opportunity has arisen to actually test it in real time. The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents such an opportunity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the added value of information from clinical text in response to emergent diseases using natural language processing (NLP). METHODS: We explored the effects of long-term treatment by calcium channel blockers on the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with high blood pressure during in-patient hospital stays using two sources of information: data available strictly from structured electronic health records (EHRs) and data available through structured EHRs and text mining. RESULTS: In this multicenter study involving 39 hospitals, text mining increased the statistical power sufficiently to change a negative result for an adjusted hazard ratio to a positive one. Compared to the baseline structured data, the number of patients available for inclusion in the study increased by 2.95 times, the amount of available information on medications increased by 7.2 times, and the amount of additional phenotypic information increased by 11.9 times. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, use of calcium channel blockers was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. This finding was obtained by quickly adapting an NLP pipeline to the domain of the novel disease; the adapted pipeline still performed sufficiently to extract useful information. When that information was used to supplement existing structured data, the sample size could be increased sufficiently to see treatment effects that were not previously statistically detectable.","Neuraz, Antoine; Lerner, Ivan; Digan, William; Paris, Nicolas; Tsopra, Rosy; Rogier, Alice; Baudoin, David; Cohen, Kevin Bretonnel; Burgun, Anita; Garcelon, Nicolas; Rance, Bastien",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/20773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32759101/,132

U is the dot product of the proxy infection probabilities stratified per age group (F) and the population stratified per age group (P) divided by the total population, similar to calculating mathematical expectation. Proxies were taken from two data sets: Hubei, China with a calculated value of U_CHN=0.4447 and Quezon City, Philippines with U_QC=0.5074. When the majority age group, represented by the median age, is far from the age group with the highest number of infections the number of infected individuals decreases and produces a delayed peaking effect.

However, little is known about such issues given the inadequacy of indicators. In this research, with the illustration of the metropolitan city of Osaka, Japan, using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), impacts of road traffic noise and exhausts gas (nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and particulate matter (PM(2.5))) were quantified and compared with the risks of ischemic heart disease and high sleep disturbance; and respiratory disease as endpoints, respectively. Health risks due to automobile noise were 3102.1 and 97.8 DALYs under the condition of open and closed windows, respectively. The health risks were reduced by 96.8% under closed-window condition. On the other hand, the health risks caused by NO(2) and PM(2.5) from automobiles were 137.6 DALYs, which was lower than the health risks due to automobile noise. These results indicate the effectiveness of DALYs as an indicator to characterize different kinds of burden of health and environmental impacts from automobiles, and they were successfully used to evaluate the effectiveness of risk reduction options such as the difference between open and closed windows. Furthermore, most people were found to have been exposed to 55–60 dB noise level. Although they easily get used to and can tolerate this level, it is also the stage at which health risks begin to occur. Therefore, with continuous exposure, qualitative estimation showed that open windows under this noise level subsequently leads to high potential health risks.","Okazaki, Yuki; Ito, Lisa; Tokai, Akihiro",Environ Syst Decis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614393/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10669-021-09800-8,132

According to past studies, positive support within married couples reduces stress during diseases and disasters, but their mechanisms are unclear. To address this gap and help individuals better cope with COVID-19-related psychological distress, this study examined the relationships among daily positive support, daily gratitude, and daily stress within married couples. In this 14-day daily diary study, 54 heterosexually married couples (N = 108) aged 28 to 71 years participated. After reporting their demographic information at the start of the study, they reported their perceived positive support from their partner, daily stress, and feelings of gratitude at the end of each day of the study for 14 consecutive days. Using a multivariate outcome, multilevel cross-classification, we found that daily positive support was negatively associated with daily stress, mediated by daily feelings of gratitude. On a day when a person reported more perceived positive support than others, this person also reported a higher level of feelings of gratitude and a lower level of stress, regardless of age. We found only an actor effect, no partner effect. These findings show how greater daily positive support is linked to greater daily feelings of gratitude, which in turn is linked to less daily stress during an emergent public health crisis.

We model two viral diseases both of the SIRS type that have similar mechanism of transmission and for which a vaccine exists. The vaccine is characterized by its coverage, induced temporal immunity and efficacy. The population dynamics of both diseases considers infected individuals of each disease and hosts that are susceptible to one but have recovered from the other. We do not incorporate coinfection. We postulate two main transmission factors affecting the effective contact rates: i) that the virus with higher reproduction number can superinfect the one with lower reproduction number and ii) that there is some protection induced by vaccination against the weaker virus that reduces the probability of infection by the stronger virus. Our results indicate that coexistence of the viruses is possible in the long term. The time-dependent effective contact rate may induce either alternating outbreaks of each disease or synchronous outbreaks. We also found the existence of bi-stability triggered by a backward bifurcation, conducive to scenarios where, at the population level, vaccine application may promote persistence of both diseases provided the effective coverage and vaccine efficacy are low.","Acuna Zegarra, M.

616296,Oral manifestations of COVID‐19 patients: An online survey of the Egyptian population,2021-05-01,"In all of the clinical trials for COVID-19 conducted thus far and among those ongoing involving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, the drug substance used has invariably been chloroquine (CQ) diphosphate or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) sulfate, i.e., the phosphoric or sulfuric acid salt of a racemic mixture of R- and S-enantiomer (50/50), respectively. As a result, the clinical outcome from previous CQ or HCQ trials were, in fact, the collective manifestation of both R and S- enantiomers with inherent different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, and toxicity liabilities. Our data for the first time demonstrated the stereoselective difference of CQ and HCQ against live SARS-CoV-2 virus in a Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. S-chloroquine (S-CQ) and S-hydroxychloroquine (S-HCQ) significantly more active against SARS-CoV-2, as compared to R-CQ and R-HCQ, respectively. In addition, Mpro, as one of the critical enzymes for viral transcription and replication, also exhibited an enantioselective binding affinity toward the S-enantiomers. The most significant finding from this study is the pronounced difference of the two enantiomers of CQ and HCQ observed in hERG inhibition assay. The IC50 value of S-HCQ was higher than 20 μM against hERG channel, which was much less active over all tested CQ and HCQ compounds. Moreover, S-HCQ alone did not prolong QT interval in guinea pigs after 3 days and 6 days of administration, indicating a much lower cardiac toxicity potential. With these and previous findings on the enantio-differentiated metabolism, we recommend that future clinical studies should employ S-HCQ, substantially free of the R-enantiomer, to potentially improve the therapeutic index for the treatment of COVID-19 over the racemic CQ and HCQ.","Li, Guanguan; Sun, Jing; Huang, Yi-You; Li, Yingjun; Shi, Yongjie; Li, Zhe; Li, Xiang; Yang, Feng Hua; Zhao, Jincun; Luo, Hai-Bin; Zhang, Tony Y.; Zhang, Xumu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.26.114033,132
616526,A novel cohort analysis approach to determining the case fatality rate of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases,2020-06-15,"Recently, many countries have decided to reopen gradually and some of them have thought that social distancing has not had a significant effect. In our study, a new view of the importance of social distancing to prevent the spread of coronavirus has been presented in terms of the relationship between peak day and peak period and population density of nine countries. Data for nine different countries in different coronavirus situations have been analyzed. The analysis process was applied by using three programs, namely; WebPlotDigitizer, WSxM and Origin. The results provide evidence of the effectiveness of social distancing by calculation of the effect of population density on coronavirus infection. That was applied by two stages, the first one by determination of two different groups of countries depending on the rate and range of coronavirus spread. These two groups were countries with developed and developing COVID19 which lead to calculate the peak day and the period times of developed groups. Then, analysis of that data with population density was evaluated to indicate there are significant effects of population density on peak day and peak period times which explain the importance of social distancing between people to manage and control that. The results showed that there are increasing in peak day and peak period times with increasing the population density.","Jawad, A.J.",Ethics Med Public Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100556; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844108/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352552520300943; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352552520300943,132
617011,CD4+ T cell lymphopenia and dysfunction in severe COVID-19 disease is autocrine TNF-α/TNFRI-dependent,2021-06-03,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a global health problem that has affected millions of people. The fine host immune response and its association with the disease course have not yet been fully elucidated. Consequently, we analyze circulating B cell subsets and their possible relationship with COVID-19 features and severity. METHODS: Using a multiparametric flow cytometric approach, we determined B cell subsets frequencies from 52 COVID-19 patients, grouped them by hierarchical cluster analysis, and correlated their values with clinical data. RESULTS: The frequency of CD19(+) B cells is increased in severe COVID-19 compared to mild cases. Specific subset frequencies such as transitional B cell subsets increase in mild/moderate cases but decrease with the severity of the disease. Memory B compartment decreased in severe and critical cases, and antibody-secreting cells are increased according to the severity of the disease. Other non-typical subsets such as double-negative B cells also showed significant changes according to disease severity. Globally, these differences allow us to identify severity-associated patient clusters with specific altered subsets. Finally, respiratory parameters, biomarkers of inflammation, and clinical scores exhibited correlations with some of these subpopulations. CONCLUSIONS: The severity of COVID-19 is accompanied by changes in the B cell subpopulations, either immature or terminally differentiated. Furthermore, the existing relationship of B cell subset frequencies with clinical and laboratory parameters suggest that these lymphocytes could serve as potential biomarkers and even active participants in the adaptive antiviral response mounted against SARS-CoV-2.","Sosa-Hernández, Víctor A.; Torres-Ruíz, Jiram; Cervantes-Díaz, Rodrigo; Romero-Ramírez, Sandra; Páez-Franco, José C.; Meza-Sánchez, David E.; Juárez-Vega, Guillermo; Pérez-Fragoso, Alfredo; Ortiz-Navarrete, Vianney; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Llorente, Luis; Berrón-Ruiz, Laura; Mejía-Domínguez, Nancy R.; Gómez-Martín, Diana; Maravillas-Montero, José L.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33343585/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.611004,132
617539,Both high and low pre-infection glucose levels associated with increased risk for severe COVID-19: New insights from a population-based study,2021-07-22,"Introduction: The quantitative effect of underlying non-communicable diseases on acute kidney injury (AKI) incidence and the factors affecting the odds of death among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) AKI patients were unclear at population level. This study aimed to assess the association between AKI, mortality, underlying non-communicable diseases, and clinical risk factors. Methods: A systematic search of six databases was performed from January 1, 2020, until October 5, 2020. Peer-reviewed observational studies containing quantitative data on risk factors and incidence of renal manifestations of COVID-19 were included. Location, institution, and time period were matched to avoid duplicated data source. Incidence, prevalence, and odds ratio of outcomes were extracted and pooled by random-effects meta-analysis. History of renal replacement therapy (RRT) and age group were stratified for analysis. Univariable meta-regression models were built using AKI incidence as dependent variable, with underlying comorbidities and clinical presentations at admission as independent variables. Results: Global incidence rates of AKI and RRT in COVID-19 patients were 20.40% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 12.07–28.74] and 2.97% (95% CI = 1.91–4.04), respectively, among patients without RRT history. Patients who developed AKI during hospitalization were associated with 8 times (pooled OR = 9.03, 95% CI = 5.45–14.94) and 16.6 times (pooled OR = 17.58, 95% CI = 10.51–29.38) increased odds of death or being critical. At population level, each percentage increase in the underlying prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and tumor history was associated with 0.82% (95% CI = 0.40–1.24), 0.48% (95% CI = 0.18–0.78), 0.99% (95% CI = 0.18–1.79), and 2.85% (95% CI = 0.93–4.76) increased incidence of AKI across different settings, respectively. Although patients who had a kidney transplant presented with a higher incidence of AKI and RRT, their odds of mortality was lower. A positive trend of increased odds of death among AKI patients against the interval between symptom onset and hospital admission was observed. Conclusion: Underlying prevalence of non-communicable diseases partly explained the heterogeneity in the AKI incidence at population level. Delay in admission after symptom onset could be associated with higher mortality among patients who developed AKI and warrants further research.","Chan, Kam Wa; Yu, Kam Yan; Lee, Pak Wing; Lai, Kar Neng; Tang, Sydney Chi-Wai",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.678200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34113640/,132

The tournaments included 10 participating high schools from three counties. The host school (school A in county A) participated in the tournaments on both days; five high school teams from two counties participated the first day only; four additional high school teams from the three counties participated the second day. A total of 130 wrestlers, coaches, and referees attended the tournaments (Table). During December 8-9, 13 wrestlers from school A received positive SARS-CoV-2 test results (Figure), including nine who were symptomatic, two who were asymptomatic, and two for whom symptom status at time of specimen collection was unknown. Local public health officials in the three counties initiated an investigation† and tested specimens from an additional 40 attendees from nine of the 10 participating schools. A total of 54 (41.5%) of the 130 tournament attendees received testing, and 38 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified; the minimum attack rate was 30.2% (38 of 126§), and 70.4% (38 of 54) of tests had a positive result. Among contacts of the 38 COVID-19 patients, 446 were determined by investigators to meet the CDC definition of a close contact,¶ including 62 who were household contacts and 384 who were in-school contacts (classmates, teachers, noncompeting wrestling team members, and other school athletic team members). Among these 446 contacts, five had received a diagnosis of COVID-19 during June-November and were excluded from attack rate calculations. Among 95 (21.3%) contacts who received SARS-CoV-2 testing, 41 (43.2%) received a positive test result (minimum attack rate = 9.3% [41 of 441]); 21 (51.2%) persons with positive test results were symptomatic, eight (19.5%) were asymptomatic, and symptom status for 12 (29.3%) was unknown at the time of specimen collection. Among contacts, attack rates were highest among household members (30.0%) and wrestling team members who did not attend the tournament (20.3%), as were the percentages of positive test results (60.0% among household members and 54.2% among team members). Among all contacts, the odds of receiving a positive test result were highest among household contacts (odds ratio = 2.7; 95% confidence interval = 1.2-6.0).

Here, we present evidence for the transcriptional regulation of SARS-CoV-2 host cell receptor ACE2 and TMPRSS2 by androgen in mouse and human cells. Additionally, we demonstrate the endogenous interaction between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in human cells and validate ACE2 as a TMPRSS2 substrate. Further, Camostat – a TMPRSS2 inhibitor, blocked the cleavage of pseudotype SARS-CoV-2 surface Spike without disrupting TMPRSS2-ACE2 interaction. Thus providing evidence for the first time a direct role of TMPRSS2 in priming the SARS-CoV-2 Spike, required for viral fusion to the host cell. Importantly, androgen-deprivation, anti-androgens, or Camostat attenuated the SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cellular entry. Together, our data provide a strong rationale for clinical evaluations of TMPRSS2 inhibitors, androgen-deprivation therapy/androgen receptor antagonists alone or in combination with antiviral drugs as early as clinically possible to prevent COVID-19 progression.","Deng, Qu; Rasool, Reyaz ur; Russell, Ronnie M.; Natesan, Ramakrishnan; Asangani, Irfan A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.16.342782,132

Individuals' perceptions and attitudes as well as related health education measures may affect disease progression and prognosis during the COVID-19 outbreak. To promote and implement health education, research must focus on the perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 among Chinese people. The present study aimed to examine the profiles and predictive factors of the perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 in a sample of Chinese people. Methods: A sample of 2,663 Chinese people comprising medical staff and members of the general public completed an online survey on Wenjuanxing. The survey measured demographic variables (e.g., gender, age, education level, and place of residence) and perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19. Results: Two profiles of perceptions and attitudes towards COVID-19 (positive and negative perceptions and attitudes) were identified in the sample. Place of residence during the COVID-19 pandemic and first response to COVID-19 were found to be independent predictive factors for COVID-19 related perceptions and attitudes.

619865,Epilepsy and lockdown: A survey of patients normally attending a Spanish center,2020-09-29,"Introduction: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a strain of coronavirus that causes a respiratory illness known as COVID-19. COVID-19 is a pandemic affecting many countries globally.(1) As of 23rd July 2020, there have been 297,146 lab-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK and 45,554 people who tested positive for the virus have died.(2) Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and experiencing more severe outcomes.(3-6) The higher risk is driven by a compromised immune system, the use of immunosuppressive agents and patient characteristics aligning with key risk factors - patients with MM are often elderly and have multiple co-morbidities.(7) In light of the COVID-19 outbreak, NHS England and NICE have issued guidance to modify usual care to reduce patient exposure to COVID-19. For patients with cancer, NICE recommend delivering systemic anti-cancer treatment in different and less immunosuppressive regimens, different locations (ideally at home) or via another (less invasive and/or less resource intensive) route of administration where possible.(8)(9) The objective of this analysis is to explore the impact of switching patients from intravenous (IV) treatments requiring hospital administrations to subcutaneous (SC) or oral alternatives which can be administered at home or in an outpatient setting which reduces the patient's potential exposure to COVID-19. Methods: A decision tree model was developed in Microsoft Excel® (Figure 1). Patients enter the model and are assigned a probability of being treated; those that are treated are then assigned a probability of IV, SC or oral-based therapy. Based on the route of administration, patients are assigned a probability of contracting COVID-19 and, for those patients that do contract the virus, a probability of death from the virus is estimated. The model compares the outcomes from two identical decision trees: one informed by the pre-COVID-19 treatment pathway and one informed by the post-COVID-19 pathway. Model inputs, including COVID-19 inputs (e.g., number of active and diseased COVID-19 cases among patients with MM), have been informed by the literature and clinical opinion. Costs reflected in the model include: treatment of COVID-19, treatment for MM and administration of MM treatments. Scenario analyses explore lower and upper bounds for key inputs. Results are presented from a UK perspective and a 1-year time horizon (from model entry) is considered. Results: Per the model, treating patients with oral therapies is shown to reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and the number of COVID-19 deaths in patients with MM compared with IV- and SC-delivered therapies. These outcomes translate into cost savings driven by costs avoided in treating COVID-19. There was a limited difference in the costs of treating the underlying MM despite the switch. However, there were additional cost savings demonstrated through avoiding expensive and resource intensive administration appointments associated with IV therapies, and to a lesser extent SC therapies. The use of oral therapies has also aided the increase in telemedicine for routine appointments - scenarios exploring this demonstrate further savings. These results are driven by the perceived risk attached to each of the different routes of administration - scenario analyses demonstrated that assuming even the lower bound risk (an assumed additional risk of 10%) for IV therapies vs. oral therapies, a significant number of COVID-19 cases and deaths were avoided, and costs reduced. Conclusions: Changes to the treatment pathway for patients with MM in light of the COVID-19 pandemic aim to reduce the exposure to the virus for these patients. The model demonstrates that simply switching the route of administration can reduce the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths . This has important implications in avoiding severe outcomes, decreasing the spread of the virus and reducing the cost and resource use burden to the healthcare system. In addition, the model reflects potential efficiencies which may extend beyond the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. telemedicine) to optimize clinical practice for patients with MM in the longer-term.

It was aimed to assess the association of sex, age, and comorbidities with mortality in COVID-2019 patients. METHODS: Literatures were searched using different keywords in various databases. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated by RevMan software where statistical significance was set as p < 0.05. RESULTS: COVID-19 male patients were associated with significantly increased risk of mortality compared to females (RR 1.86: 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.67–2.07; p < 0.00001). Patients with age ≥50 years were associated with 15.4-folds significantly increased risk of mortality compared to patients with age <50 years (RR 15.44: 95% CI 13.02–18.31; p < 0.00001).

621029,Point of view: Should COVID-19 patients be supplemented with vitamin D?,2020-06-08,"Thirty years ago, a novel axis of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) was unveiled by the discovery of angiotensin-(1−7) [ANG-(1−7)] generation in vivo. Later, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was shown to be the main mediator of this reaction, and Mas was found to be the receptor for the heptapeptide. The functional analysis of this novel axis of the RAS that followed its discovery revealed numerous protective actions in particular for cardiovascular diseases. In parallel, similar protective actions were also described for one of the two receptors of ANG II, the ANG II type 2 receptor (AT(2)R), in contrast to the other, the ANG II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R), which mediates deleterious actions of this peptide, e.g., in the setting of cardiovascular disease. Very recently, another branch of the RAS was discovered, based on angiotensin peptides in which the amino-terminal aspartate was replaced by alanine, the alatensins. Ala-ANG-(1−7) or alamandine was shown to interact with Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor D, and the first functional data indicated that this peptide also exerts protective effects in the cardiovascular system. This review summarizes the presentations given at the International Union of Physiological Sciences Congress in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2017, during the symposium entitled “The Renin-Angiotensin System: Going Beyond the Classical Paradigms,” in which the signaling and physiological actions of ANG-(1−7), ACE2, AT(2)R, and alatensins were reported (with a focus on noncentral nervous system-related tissues) and the therapeutic opportunities based on these findings were discussed.","Santos, Robson Augusto Souza; Oudit, Gavin Y.; Verano-Braga, Thiago; Canta, Giovanni; Steckelings, Ulrike Muscha; Bader, Michael",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00723.2018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30707614/,132

Successful diagnostic strategies critically depend on the efficiency of biological sampling and timely analysis. However, current diagnostic techniques are invasive/intrusive and present a severe bottleneck by requiring specialist equipment and trained personnel. Moreover, centralised test facilities are poorly accessible and the requirement to travel may increase disease transmission. Self-administrable, point-of-care (PoC) microneedle diagnostic devices could provide a viable solution to these problems. These miniature needle arrays can detect biomarkers in/from the skin in a minimally invasive manner to provide (near-) real-time diagnosis. Few microneedle devices have been developed specifically for infectious disease diagnosis, though similar technologies are well established in other fields and generally adaptable for infectious disease diagnosis. These include microneedles for biofluid extraction, microneedle sensors and analyte-capturing microneedles, or combinations thereof. Analyte sampling/detection from both blood and dermal interstitial fluid is possible. These technologies are in their early stages of development for infectious disease diagnostics, and there is a vast scope for further development. In this review, we discuss the utility and future outlook of these microneedle technologies in infectious disease diagnosis.","Dixon, Rachael V.; Skaria, Eldhose; Lau, Wing Man; Manning, Philip; Birch-Machin, Mark A.; Moghimi, S.

Certain medications, for example, dexamethasone, antimalarials (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine), antiviral (remdesivir), and IL-6 receptor blocking monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab), are used in various combinations as off-label medications to treat COVID-19. Essential oils (EOs) have long been known to have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, and antiviral properties and are being proposed to have activity against SARC-CoV-2 virus. Owing to their lipophilic nature, EOs are advocated to penetrate viral membranes easily leading to membrane disruption. Moreover, EOs contain multiple active phytochemicals that can act synergistically on multiple stages of viral replication and also induce positive effects on host respiratory system including bronchodilation and mucus lysis. At present, only computer-aided docking and few in vitro studies are available which show anti-SARC-CoV-2 activities of EOs. In this review, role of EOs in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is discussed. A discussion on possible side effects associated with EOs as well as anti-corona virus claims made by EOs manufacturers are also highlighted. Based on the current knowledge a chemo-herbal (EOs) combination of the drugs could be a more feasible and effective approach to combat this viral pandemic.

Brazil, at that point, presented a total of 514,992 cases and 29,341 deaths caused by the COVID-19 disease. At that moment, Brazil appeared in the second position regarding number of cases, fourth in number of deaths, second in number of recovered patients (N = 206,555), second in number of follow-up cases (N = 279,096), third in number of active and serious cases (N = 8,318), 39(th) in number of cases per million inhabitants (N = 2,424), and 125(th) in number of SARS-CoV-2 real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) exams per million inhabitants (N = 4,378). To beat the pandemic, Brazil needs to optimize the COVID-19 diagnosis through the SARS-CoV-2 identification using RT-PCR tests and adjust its policies to save lives. Brazil is in a crucial moment to minimize the impact of the illness on society by reducing the number of new cases and thus, preventing deaths, mainly of the risk group populations. However, as widely announced, in Brazil the diagnosis using RT-PCR is still scarce and part of the material collected from COVID-19 patients was disposed of and many patients were not tested, regardless of the seriousness of the symptoms, due to errors of medical data records, improper conservation of the samples after collection and/or during transport, which compromised the quality of the material to be tested. Moreover, the federal government has supported the end of the quarantine, while the number of deaths has grown in thousands every day and the cases have been expanding to the interior of the country.","Marson, Fernando Augusto Lima",Diagn Microbiol Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32682217/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0732889320304909; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2020.115113; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732889320304909,132
622866,Catalyzing Childhood Cancer Care in Peru After One Year of the Global Initiative for Childhood Cancer,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) outbreak is evolving rapidly worldwide. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) by stratifying the comorbidity status. METHODS: We analysed the data from 1590 laboratory-confirmed hospitalised patients 575 hospitals in 31 province/autonomous regions/provincial municipalities across mainland China between December 11(th), 2019 and January 31(st), 2020. We analyse the composite endpoints, which consisted of admission to intensive care unit, or invasive ventilation, or death. The risk of reaching to the composite endpoints was compared according to the presence and number of comorbidities. RESULTS: The mean age was 48.9 years. 686 patients (42.7%) were females. Severe cases accounted for 16.0% of the study population. 131 (8.2%) patients reached to the composite endpoints. 399 (25.1%) reported having at least one comorbidity. The most prevalent comorbidity was hypertension (16.9%), followed by diabetes (8.2%). 130 (8.2%) patients reported having two or more comorbidities. After adjusting for age and smoking status, COPD [hazards ratio (HR) 2.681, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.424–5.048], diabetes (HR 1.59, 95%CI 1.03–2.45), hypertension (HR 1.58, 95%CI 1.07–2.32) and malignancy (HR 3.50, 95%CI 1.60–7.64) were risk factors of reaching to the composite endpoints. The HR was 1.79 (95%CI 1.16–2.77) among patients with at least one comorbidity and 2.59 (95%CI 1.61–4.17) among patients with two or more comorbidities. CONCLUSION: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19, patients with any comorbidity yielded poorer clinical outcomes than those without. A greater number of comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes.","Guan, Wei-jie; Liang, Wen-hua; Zhao, Yi; Liang, Heng-rui; Chen, Zi-sheng; Li, Yi-min; Liu, Xiao-qing; Chen, Ru-chong; Tang, Chun-li; Wang, Tao; Ou, Chun-quan; Li, Li; Chen, Ping-yan; Sang, Ling; Wang, Wei; Li, Jian-fu; Li, Cai-chen; Ou, Li-min; Cheng, Bo; Xiong, Shan; Ni, Zheng-yi; Xiang, Jie; Hu, Yu; Liu, Lei; Shan, Hong; Lei, Chun-liang; Peng, Yi-xiang; Wei, Li; Liu, Yong; Hu, Ya-hua; Peng, Peng; Wang, Jian-ming; Liu, Ji-yang; Chen, Zhong; Li, Gang; Zheng, Zhi-jian; Qiu, Shao-qin; Luo, Jie; Ye, Chang-jiang; Zhu, Shao-yong; Cheng, Lin-ling; Ye, Feng; Li, Shi-yue; Zheng, Jin-ping; Zhang, Nuo-fu; Zhong, Nan-shan; He, Jian-xing",Eur Respir J,https://doi.org/10.1183/13993003.00547-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32217650/,132

However, dental emergencies have not ceased during this pandemic. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze patient profiles and the offered management options to pediatric patients presenting with dental emergencies during a COVID-19 lockdown. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Retrospective analysis was performed of patient records of children seeking emergency dental treatment during a 7-week lockdown period in 2020 in a university pedodontic clinic in Germany, and compared to a similar cohort from 2019. Data on patient, tooth, and session level were collected. RESULTS: The 2020 cohort consisted of 83 patients, and the 2019 cohort included 46 patients, showing a 45% greater need for emergency treatment in 2020. The most common chief complaint was plaque-induced gingivitis/oral mucosal conditions in 2020 (26.4%), and irreversible pulpitis in 2019 (25.5%). Dental caries (without spontaneous pain) was the second most common chief complaint in both cohorts (20.7% and 23.4%, respectively). Most interventions in 2020 were minimally invasive treatments (eg, Hall Technique, silver diammine fluoride; 20.3%), which were in 2019 not considered at all; followed by pharmacologic treatment (16.9%), which was in 2019 also highly used (35.9%). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in emergency pediatric dental visits and shifted treatment options towards lessï»¿ invasive procedures.","Al Masri, Ahmad; Abudrya, Moham Ed H; Splieth, Christian H; Schmoeckel, Julian; Mourad, Mhd Said; Santamaría, Ruth M",Quintessence Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34269039/; https://doi.org/10.3290/j.qi.b1763637,132

Based on the multi-source data of COVID-19 in the context of a global pandemic, this paper analyzes the propagation rules of disasters in the coupling of the spatial dimension of geographic reality and the dimension of network public opinion, and constructs a new gravity model-complex network-based geographic propagation model of the evolution chain of typical public health events. The strength of the model is that it quantifies the extent of the impact of the epidemic area on the surrounding area and the spread of the epidemic, constructing an interaction between the geographical reality dimension and online public opinion dimension. The results show that: The heterogeneity in the direction of social media discussions before and after the “closure” of Wuhan is evident, with the center of gravity clearly shifting across the Yangtze River and the cyclical changing in public sentiment; the network model based on the evolutionary chain has a significant community structure in geographic space, divided into seven regions with a modularity of 0.793; there are multiple key infection trigger nodes in the network, with a spatially polycentric infection distribution.","Zhang, Yan; Chen, Nengcheng; Du, Wenying; Yao, Shuang; Zheng, Xiang",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33321897/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17249235,132

The Paediatric Asthma in Real Life (PeARL) Think Tank aspires to develop recommendations based on the best available evidence from studies in children. An overview of systematic reviews (SRs) on paediatric asthma maintenance management and an SR of treatments for acute asthma attacks in children, requiring an emergency presentation with/without hospital admission will be conducted. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Standard methodology recommended by Cochrane will be followed. Maintenance pharmacotherapy of childhood asthma will be evaluated in an overview of SRs published after 2005 and including clinical trials or real-life studies. For evaluating pharmacotherapy of acute asthma attacks leading to an emergency presentation with/without hospital admission, we opted to conduct de novo synthesis in the absence of adequate up-to-date published SRs. For the SR of acute asthma pharmacotherapy, we will consider eligible SRs, clinical trials or real-life studies without time restrictions. Our evidence updates will be based on broad searches of Pubmed/Medline and the Cochrane Library. We will use A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, V.2, Cochrane risk of bias 2 and REal Life EVidence AssessmeNt Tool to evaluate the methodological quality of SRs, controlled clinical trials and real-life studies, respectively. Next, we will further assess interventions for acute severe asthma attacks with positive clinical results in meta-analyses. We will include both controlled clinical trials and observational studies and will assess their quality using the previously mentioned tools. We will employ random effect models for conducting meta-analyses, and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess certainty in the body of evidence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval is not required for SRs. Our findings will be published in peer reviewed journals and will inform clinical recommendations being developed by the PeARL Think Tank.

625136,Quantitative Chest CT analysis in discriminating COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 patients,2020-10-12,"BACKGROUND: Several observational studies have suggested a worrying reduction in hospitalisations for acute coronary syndromes in the emergency cardiology department in the last few months all over the world. The aim of the present study is to assess the impact of the current COVID-19 health crisis on admission for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in the cardiology department of a tertiary general hospital in Germany with a COVID-19 ward. METHODS AND RESULTS: The authors retrieved clinical data evaluating consecutive patients with ACS admitted to their emergency cardiology department. Data from January to June 2020, as well as for a 5-week period corresponding to this yearʼs COVID-19 outbreak in south-west Germany (23rd March–26th April), were analysed and compared to data from equivalent weeks in the previous 2 years. A trend of reduction in admissions for ACS was observed from the beginning of the outbreak in the region at the end of March 2020. This trend continued and even intensified after a fall in COVID-19 cases in the area; the number of ACS patients in April 2020 was 25% and in June 29% lower than in January 2020 (p-value for linear trend <0.001). An even more consistent reduction was observed as compared with the equivalent weeks in the previous 2 years (38% and 30% lower than in 2019 and 2018, respectively; p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 health and social crisis has caused a worrying trend of reduced cardiological admissions for ACS, without evidence of a decrease in its incidence. Understanding and counteracting the causes appears to be crucial to avoiding major long-term consequences for healthcare systems worldwide.","Vacanti, Gaetano; Bramlage, Peter; Schymik, Gerhard; Schmitt, Claus; Luik, Armin; Swojanowsky, Patrick; Tzamalis, Panagiotis",Herz,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026483/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00059-020-04991-3,132
625470,An optimized stepwise algorithm combining rapid antigen and RT-qPCR for screening of COVID-19 patients,2021-09-23,"Growing evidence suggests that ABO blood group may play a role in the immunopathogenesis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, with group O individuals less likely to test positive and group A conferring a higher susceptibility to infection and propensity to severe disease. The level of evidence supporting an association between ABO type and SARS‐CoV‐2/COVID‐19 ranges from small observational studies, to genome‐wide‐association‐analyses and country‐level meta‐regression analyses. ABO blood group antigens are oligosaccharides expressed on red cells and other tissues (notably endothelium). There are several hypotheses to explain the differences in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection by ABO type. For example, anti‐A and/or anti‐B antibodies (e.g. present in group O individuals) could bind to corresponding antigens on the viral envelope and contribute to viral neutralization, thereby preventing target cell infection. The SARS‐CoV‐2 virus and SARS‐CoV spike (S) proteins may be bound by anti‐A isoagglutinins (e.g. present in group O and group B individuals), which may block interactions between virus and angiotensin‐converting‐enzyme‐2‐receptor, thereby preventing entry into lung epithelial cells. ABO type‐associated variations in angiotensin‐converting enzyme‐1 activity and levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII could also influence adverse outcomes, notably in group A individuals who express high VWF levels. In conclusion, group O may be associated with a lower risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and group A may be associated with a higher risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection along with severe disease. However, prospective and mechanistic studies are needed to verify several of the proposed associations. Based on the strength of available studies, there are insufficient data for guiding policy in this regard.","Goel, Ruchika; Bloch, Evan M.; Pirenne, France; Al‐Riyami, Arwa Z.; Crowe, Elizabeth; Dau, Laetitia; Land, Kevin; Townsend, Mary; Jecko, Thachil; Rahimi‐Levene, Naomi; Patidar, Gopal; Josephson, Cassandra D.; Arora, Satyam; Vermeulen, Marion; Vrielink, Hans; Montemayor, Celina; Oreh, Adaeze; Hindawi, Salwa; van den Berg, Karin; Serrano, Katherine; So – Osman, Cynthia; Wood, Erica; Devine, Dana V.; Spitalnik, Steven L.",Vox Sang,https://doi.org/10.1111/vox.13076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33578447/,132

It is well-recognized that as a ‘social animal’, most humans are deeply embedded both in their cultural milieu and in broader society that extends well beyond close family, including neighborhoods, communities and workplaces. In this article, we study this embeddedness by leveraging urban dwellers’ social media footprint. Specifically, we define and empirically study the issue of spatio-textual affinity by collecting many millions of geotagged tweets collected from two diverse metropolises within the United States: the Boroughs of New York City, and the County of Los Angeles. Spatio-textual affinity is the intuitive hypothesis that tweets coming from similar locations (spatial affinity) will tend to be topically similar (textual affinity). This simple definition of the problem belies the complexity of measuring it, since (re-tweets notwithstanding) two tweets are never truly identical either spatially or textually. Workable definitions of affinity along both dimensions are required, as are appropriate experimental designs, visualizations and measurements. In addition to providing such definitions and a viable framework for conducting spatio-textual affinity experiments on Twitter data, we provide detailed results illustrating how our framework can be used to compare and contrast two important metropolitan areas from multiple perspectives and granularities.","Hu, Minda; Kejriwal, Mayank",J Comput Soc Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-021-00129-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34095601/,132

In humans, IAV is a respiratory pathogen that causes seasonal infections associated with significant morbidity in young and elderly populations, and has a large economic impact. Moreover, IAV has the potential to cause both zoonotic spillover infection and global pandemics, which have significantly greater morbidity and mortality across all ages. The pathology associated with these pandemic and spillover infections appear to be the result of an excessive inflammatory response leading to severe lung damage, which likely predisposes the lungs for secondary bacterial infections. The lung is protected from pathogens by alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, tissue resident alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells, and mast cells. The importance of mast cells during bacterial and parasitic infections has been extensively studied; yet, the role of these hematopoietic cells during viral infections is only beginning to emerge. Recently, it has been shown that mast cells can be directly activated in response to IAV, releasing mediators such histamine, proteases, leukotrienes, inflammatory cytokines, and antiviral chemokines, which participate in the excessive inflammatory and pathological response observed during IAV infections. In this review, we will examine the relationship between mast cells and IAV, and discuss the role of mast cells as a potential drug target during highly pathological IAV infections. Finally, we proposed an emerging role for mast cells in other viral infections associated with significant host pathology.","Graham, Amy C.; Temple, Rachel M.; Obar, Joshua J.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26042121/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2015.00238,132

627818,COVID-19 and assisted reproductive technology services: repercussions for patients and proposal for individualized clinical management,2020-05-13,"Background: Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have anti-inflammatory effects. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses the membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is increased by ARB/ACEI treatment, as a cell entry receptor. Therefore, the use of ARBs/ACEIs for COVID-19 remains controversial. Methods: A retrospective case-control study was conducted using COVID-19 patients previously diagnosed with hypertension before COVID-19 onset. The primary outcome was severe infection or all-cause mortality. Cases included ARB/ACEI use for 30 days or longer during the 6 months before COVID-19 onset. Primary controls included antihypertensive use other than ARBs/ACEIs (narrow control); secondary controls included all other hypertension patients (broad control). We investigated ARB/ACEI association with outcomes in general and by subgroups (age, sex, and presence of diabetes) using logistic regression models with propensity score matching. Findings: Of 234427 suspected COVID-19 patients we screened, 1585 hypertension patients were analyzed. In the 892 cases, 428 narrow controls, and 693 broad controls, severe infection or death occurred in 8.6%, 22.2%, and 16.7%, respectively. ARB/ACEI use was associated with a reduced risk of severe infection or death relative to the narrow control group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.65) and broad control group (aOR 0.49, 95% CI 0.33-0.71). The association was smaller for newly diagnosed hypertension patients (aOR 0.11, 95% CI 0.03-0.42 compared to narrow control group). ARB/ACEI protective effects against severe infection or death were significantly observed in male and diabetic patients. Interpretation: ARB/ACEI use was associated with a lower risk of severe infection or mortality compared to other antihypertensives or ARB/ACEI nonuse.","Choi, H. K.; Koo, H.-J.; Seok, H.; Jeon, J.

The predictive ability of a composite model of seven biomarkers was superior to that of any single biomarker based on area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis, indicating an excellent prediction efficacy (AUC:0.892; 95% CI:0.732-1.0). We also found that the highest significant trends and lower levels of CRP and IP-10 were observed in the two-month treated tuberculosis (TB) patients. We believe that our study may be valuable in providing preliminary results for an additional strategy in monitoring and management of the clinical outcome of pulmonary tuberculosis. Using a panel of predictors added a superior value in predicting culture status after anti-TB therapy.","Stefanescu, Simona; Cocoș, Relu; Turcu-Stiolica, Adina; Shelby, Elena-Silvia; Matei, Marius; Subtirelu, Mihaela-Simona; Meca, Andreea-Daniela; Stanciulescu, Elena Camelia; Popescu, Stefana Oana; Biciusca, Viorel; Pisoschi, Catalina-Gabriela",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206598/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10070789,132
627926,Acute pancreatitis and COVID-19: A literature review,2021-06-27,"Envelope glycoprotein (g)B is conserved throughout the Herpesviridae and mediates fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes for infectious entry and spread. Like all viral envelope fusion proteins, gB is modified by asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation. Glycans can contribute to protein function, intracellular transport, trafficking, structure and immune evasion. gB of the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PrV) contains six consensus sites for N-linked glycosylation, but their functional relevance is unknown. Here, we investigated the occupancy and functional relevance of N-glycosylation sites in PrV gB. To this end, all predicted N-glycosylation sites were inactivated either singly or in combination by the introduction of conservative mutations (N➔Q). The resulting proteins were tested for expression, fusion activity in cell–cell fusion assays and complementation of a gB-deficient PrV mutant. Our results indicate that all six sites are indeed modified. However, while glycosylation at most sites was dispensable for gB expression and fusogenicity, inactivation of N154 and N700 affected gB processing by furin cleavage and surface localization. Although all single mutants were functional in cell–cell fusion and viral entry, simultaneous inactivation of all six N-glycosylation sites severely impaired fusion activity and viral entry, suggesting a critical role of N-glycans for maintaining gB structure and function.","Vallbracht, Melina; Klupp, Barbara G.; Mettenleiter, Thomas C.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33445487/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10010061,132

However, there might be in vitro and early clinical data as well as evidence from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome that could inform clinicians and researchers. This systematic review aims to create priorities for future research of drugs repurposed for COVID-19. METHODS: This systematic review will include in vitro, animal, and clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of a list of 34 specific compounds and four groups of drugs identified in a previous scoping review. Studies will be identified both from traditional literature databases and pre-print servers. Outcomes assessed will include time to clinical improvement, time to viral clearance, mortality, length of hospital stay, and proportions transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated, respectively. We will use the GRADE methodology to assess the quality of the evidence. DISCUSSION: The challenge posed by COVID-19 requires not just a rapid review of drugs that can be repurposed but also a sustained effort to integrate new evidence into a living systematic review.

This study aimed to assess the clinical characteristics of newborns born to infected women in a tertiary center in Poznan, Poland. (2) Methods: The study comprised 101 newborns delivered by women infected with SARS-CoV-2. The control group consisted of 101 newborns born before the pandemic. Data were collected retrospectively from the medical records. (3) Results: Most newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were delivered by cesarean section—83.17% vs. 40.59% in the control group (p < 0.05). The groups did not differ in Apgar scores and the need for resuscitation. Newborns of SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers were more likely to present with respiratory distress and require respiratory support. The most common diagnosis was transient tachypnea of the newborn, not correlated with the mode of delivery. Newborns of the study group were never exclusively breastfed, 0% vs. 64.36% (p < 0.05). None of the patients in the study group was tested positive for the virus. (4) Conclusions: Infants born to SARS-CoV-2-positive mothers seem to be more at risk of moderate respiratory failure than other newborns.

Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling possibly partakes in the pathophysiology of this devastating complication. METHODS: In the current project, we have appraised expression levels of VDR, CYP27B1 and a number of associated lncRNAs in the circulation of COVID-19 patients versus healthy subjects using real-time PCR method. RESULTS: Expression of SNHG6 was considerably lower in COVID-19 patients compared with control subjects (Ratio of mean expression (RME) = 0.22, P value = 7.04E-05) and in both female and male COVID-19 patients compared with sex-matched unaffected individuals (RME = 0.32, P value = 0.04 and RME = 0.16, P value = 0.000679683, respectively). However, its expression was similar among ICU-hospitalized and non-ICU patients. Similarly, expression of SNHG16 was lower in in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (RME = 0.20, P value = 5.94E-05) and in both female and male patients compared with sex-matched controls (RME = 0.32, P value = 0.04 and RME = 0.14, P value = 0.000496435, respectively) with no significant difference among ICU-hospitalized and non-ICU hospitalized patients. Expression of VDR was lower in COVID-19 patients compared with controls (RME = 0.42, P value = 0.04) and in male patients compared with male controls (RME = 0.27, P value = 0.02). Yet, expression of VDR was statistically similar between female subgroups and between ICU-hospitalized and non-ICU hospitalized patients. Expression levels CYP27B, Linc00511 and Linc00346 were similar among COVID-19 patients and healthy subjects or between their subgroups. Significant correlations have been detected between expression levels of VDR, CYP27B and SNHG6, SNHG16, Linc00511 and Linc00346 lncRNAs both among COVID-19 patients and among healthy controls with the most significant ones being SNHG6 and SNHG16 (r = 0.74, P value = 3.26e-17 and r = 0.81, P = 1.54e-22, respectively). CONCLUSION: Combination of transcript levels of VDR, CYP27B and SNHG6, SNHG16, Linc00511 and Linc00346 could differentiate patients from controls with AUC = 0.76, sensitivity = 0.62 and specificity = 0.81.

Within such a system, real-world data analysis, clinical research and health service research are core activities of the health system. To support the transition to an LHS, the Australian Government is implementing the National Clinical Trials Governance Framework, which extends health service accreditation standards to the conduct of clinical trials. This initiative encourages the integration of clinical trials into clinical care and the fostering of a culture of continuous improvement. However, implementing this initiative may prove challenging if health system leaders, clinicians and patients fail to recognise the value of clinical trials as a core health system activity. In this article we describe the enduring value of clinical trials and how the COVID-19 pandemic has enhanced their value by addressing longstanding deficiencies in the way trials are conducted. We also summarise best-practice advice on the embedding of trials into routine health care to enable their integration into health system operations.What is known about this topic?Many healthcare organisations seek to transition to a learning health system. In Australia, National Safety and Quality Health Service Standards, which support the embedding of clinical trials as a core health system activity, have been implemented to catalyse the move.What does this paper add?Because there is little practical advice on how to embed clinical trials into health system operations, this paper summarises best practice. It also provides a rationale for embedding trials as a core health system activity, because the creation of a strong research culture is an important determinant of success.What are the implications for practitioners?The successful transition to an LHS would significantly advance the goals of value-based care.","Symons, Tanya; Zalcberg, John; Morris, Jonathan",Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34289930/; https://doi.org/10.1071/ah21076,132

Responses of free-living stages of S. stercoralis to the therapeutic corticosteroid dexamethasone (DXM) were investigated using RNA-seq transcriptomes of DXM-treated female and male worms. A total of 17,950 genes representing the transcriptome of these free-living adult stages were obtained, among which 199 and 263 were differentially expressed between DXM-treated females and DXM-treated males, respectively, compared with controls. According to Gene Ontology analysis, differentially expressed genes from DXM-treated females participate in developmental process, multicellular organismal process, cell differentiation, carbohydrate metabolic process and embryonic morphogenesis. Others are involved in signaling and signal transduction, including cAMP, cGMP-dependent protein kinase pathway, endocrine system, and thyroid hormone pathway, as based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. The novel findings warrant deeper investigation of the influence of DXM on growth and other pathways in this neglected tropical disease pathogen, particularly in a setting of autoimmune and/or allergic disease, which may require the clinical use of steroid-like hormones during latent or covert strongyloidiasis.","Rodpai, Rutchanee; Sanpool, Oranuch; Thanchomnang, Tongjit; Laoraksawong, Pokkamol; Sadaow, Lakkhana; Boonroumkaew, Patcharaporn; Wangwiwatsin, Arporn; Wongkham, Chaisiri; Laummaunwai, Porntip; Ittiprasert, Wannaporn; Brindley, Paul J.; Intapan, Pewpan M.; Maleewong, Wanchai",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253701; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34181669/,132

However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on physical activity (PA) in this subgroup of patients with persistent symptoms remain unclear. Methods: Demographics, self-reported average time spent walking per week, as well as participation in activities pre-COVID-19 and after three and six months of follow-up were assessed in members of online long-COVID-19 peer support groups. Results: Two hundred thirty-nine patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis were included (83% women, median (IQR) age: 50 (39–56) years). Patients reported a significantly decreased weekly walking time after three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15–120) min. vs. pre-COVID-19: 120 (60–240) min./week; p < 0.05). Six months after the onset of symptoms walking time was still significantly lower compared to pre-COVID-19 but significantly increased compared to three months of follow-up (three months: 60 (15–120) min. vs. six months: 90 (30–150) min.; p < 0.05).

631193,Does C reactive protein/Albumin ratio have prognostic value in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Background: Music-assisted treadmill training (MATT) is a new therapeutic approach for Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, combining treadmill training with rhythmic auditory cueing and visual feedback. PD studies have shown larger positive effects on motor outcomes than usual treadmill training. However, effects on cognition, in contrast, are less clear. Existing studies provided intensive training protocols and included only stable medicated patients. Thus, a pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to analyze the feasibility of a shorter training protocol as well as preliminary effects on cognition, motor function, and patient-centered outcomes in a rehabilitation setting where PD patients with and without deep brain stimulation (DBS) undergo adaptation of medication and DBS settings. Here, we present the results from the feasibility analysis of the still ongoing trial. Methods: Non-demented PD patients with and without DBS were recruited during their inpatient rehabilitation and randomized to an experimental group (EG; 20 min MATT) or an active control group (CG; 20 min bike ergometer training). The trainings took place for 8 consecutive days and were added to the usual rehabilitation. Feasibility was assessed with the following parameters: patients' study protocol acceptance, study protocol transferability into clinical routine, training-induced adverse events, and patients' training perception. Results: Thirty-two patients (EG: n = 15; CG: n = 17; 72% DBS) were included. The study protocol was well-accepted (inclusion rate: 84%). It was transferable into clinical routines; dropout rates of 40% (EG) and 18% (CG) were observed. However, an in-depth analysis of the dropout cohort did not reveal intervention-related dropout reasons. The MATT and the standard ergometer training showed no adverse events and were positively perceived by PD patients with and without DBS. Conclusion: MATT was shown to be a feasible, safe, and enjoyable treatment option in PD patients with and without DBS. Furthermore, the dropout cohort analysis revealed some exciting first insights into possible dropout reasons that go beyond the form of intervention. Therefore, research would benefit from a common practice of dropout analyses, as this would enhance our understanding of patients' therapy adherence and expectations.","Gooßes, Mareike; Saliger, Jochen; Folkerts, Ann-Kristin; Nielsen, Jörn; Zierer, Jürgen; Schmoll, Paula; Niepold, Annika; Colbach, Liz; Leemhuis, Janna; Engels, Lea; van Krüchten, Maria; Ophey, Anja; Allert, Niels; Karbe, Hans; Kalbe, Elke",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33013612/,132

Design: A cross-sectional, single-centre study. Setting: A large, teaching hospital based in Central London with tertiary infection services. Participants: 236 HCWs completed a survey distributed by internal staff email bulletin. 167 were female and 65 male. Measures: Information on symptomatology, exposures and health-seeking behaviour were collected from participants by self-report. Results: The 236 respondents reported illness compatible with COVID-19 and there was an increase in illness reporting during March 2020. Diagnostic swabs were not routinely performed. Cough (n=179, 75.8%), fever (n=138, 58.5%), breathlessness (n=84, 35.6%) were reported. Anosmia was reported in 42.2%. Fever generally settled within 1 week (n=110, 88%). Several respondents remained at home and did not seek formal medical attention despite reporting severe breathlessness and measuring hypoxia (n=5/9, 55.6%). 2 patients required hospital admission but recovered following oxygen therapy. 84 respondents (41.2%) required greater than the obligated 7 days off work and 9 required greater than 3 weeks off. Conclusion: There was a significant increase in staff reporting illness compatible with possible COVID-19 during March 2020. Conclusions cannot be drawn about exact numbers of confirmed cases due to lack of diagnostic swabbing. There were significant numbers of respondents reporting anosmia; as well as early non-specific illness prior to onset of cough and fever. This may represent pre-symptomatic HCWs who are likely to be infectious and thus criteria for isolation and swabbing should be broadened. The study also revealed concerning lack of healthcare seeking in respondents with significant red flag symptoms (severe breathlessness, hypoxia). This should be addressed urgently to reduce risk of severe disease being detected late. Finally, this study should inform trusts that HCWs may require longer than 7 days off work to recover from illness.","Wilton, Angus de; Kilich, Eliz; Chaudhry, Zain; Bell, Lucy CK; Gahir, Joshua; Cadman, Jane; Lever, Robert A; Logan, Sarah",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.07.20094177; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.07.20094177v1?rss=1,132

We investigated the relationship between cellular immunity and the antibody response to inactivated influenza vaccines. METHODS: 25 patients (age: 2-18 years) undergoing chemotherapy for different malignancies participated in our study. Flow cytometric detection of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations together with hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers were measured before and 21-28 days after vaccination. We examined the ratio and total numbers of CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ T cells, activated helper (CD3+CD4+CD25(low)), regulatory (CD3+CD4+CD25(high)), naive (CD3+CD45RA+) and memory (CD3+CD45RO+) T cells, CD56+NK, and CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells. Relationships between specific antibody responses (seroprotection, seroconversion, geometric mean titer (GMT), geometric mean fold increase (GMFI)) and the ratios and counts of lymphocyte subpopulations were evaluated using one-way ANOVA and the paired sample t test after dichotomization according to age-related reference values. RESULTS: Patients with CD4+ lymphocyte levels in the normal age-specific range showed significantly better response regarding postvaccination GMT elevation for H1N1 and H3N2 strains (97.52 vs. 19.2, p=0.019, 80 vs. 14.43, p=0.021, respectively). GMFI results were significant only against B strain (2.69-fold vs. 1.23-fold, p=0.046). Prevaccination CD3+CD56+ (NKT-like) cells above predicted values according to age showed significant associations both in postvaccination GMT elevation (H1N1: 75.11 vs. 14.14, p=0.010; H3N2: 62.18 vs. 11.22, p=0.012; B: 22.69 vs. 6.67, p=0.043) and GMFI against all three strains (H1N1: 3.76-fold vs. 1.06-fold, p=0.015; H3N2: 2.74-fold vs. 1, p=0.013; B: 2.57-fold vs. 1, p=0.008). By one-way ANOVA, we found a positive relation between absolute lymphocyte cell count above 1000/µl and the postvaccination GMT elevation against H3N2 (12.81 vs. 56.56, p=0.032), and GMFI regarding H1N1 (1.22-fold vs. 3.48-fold, p=0.044). CONCLUSIONS: In addition to verifying the predictive value of absolute lymphocyte count above 1000/µl, our results suggest an association between NKT-like cell counts and the specific antibody response against all three investigated influenza strains in highly immunosuppressed patients. Furthermore, prevaccination CD4+ lymphocyte levels in the normal age-specific range may influence seroresponse.","Leibinger, Evelin A.; Pauler, Gábor; Benedek, Noémi; Berki, Tímea; Jankovics, István; McNally, Richard; Ottóffy, Gábor",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.690940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34267757/,132

On March 16, the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro and partial lockdown measures came into force a week later. The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3–48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO2 and CO median values were 24.1–32.9 and 37.0–43.6% lower. Meteorological interferences, mainly the transport of pollutants from the industrial areas might have also impacted the results.","Dantas, Guilherme; Siciliano, Bruno; França, Bruno Boscaro; da Silva, Cleyton M.; Arbilla, Graciela",Science of The Total Environment,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361428/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720326024; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139085; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720326024,132

I modeled the way the rate of increase y = log(exp(r)-1) has declined through time in each of the 51 states with the goal of determining whether state-at-home orders correlate with reductions in the rate of spread of the virus. A piecewise linear regression was used, with a single break point. This model can identify whether there was a change in the rate of decline, when the change happened, and which states have shown the greatest improvement in reducing the spread of COVID-19. The piecewise model identified a significant breakpoint on 24 Mar for all states combined, and all states had nearly the same breakpoint. Prior to 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.013 per day, meaning a reduction in the rate of spread from 23.5 pct. per day to 19.5 pct. per day; after 24 Mar, the average change in y was -0.070 per day, a reduction from 19.5 pct. per day to 7.5 pct. per day. Prior to 24 Mar there was no significant variation among states in the decline in y, but after 24 Mar there was substantial variation, and the date on which states issued stay at home orders correlated with that variation. Montana, Idaho, and Vermont showed the greatest improvement, while Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa the least. The improvement as measured by the reduction after 24 Mar did not correlate with case density in a state, nor state population.","Condit, Richard",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.27.20081752; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.27.20081752v1?rss=1,132

Although SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, there is growing concern that the disease could cause damage and pathology outside the lungs, including in the genital tract. Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage the testes and reduce testosterone levels, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown and evidence of virus replication in testicular cells is lacking. We infected golden Syrian hamsters intranasally, a model for mild human COVID-19, and detected viral RNA in testes samples without histopathological changes up to one month post-infection. Using an ex vivo infection model, we detected SARS-CoV-2 replication in hamster testicular cells.

The potential harm of microplastic pollution to the environment has been confirmed. With the outbreak and spread of the COVID-19 in the world, disposable surgical masks as effective and cheap protective medical equipment have been widely used by the public. Disposable masks have been a new social norm, but they must have a sense of environmental responsibilities. The random disposal of masks may result in new and greater microplastic pollution, because masks made of polymer materials would release microplastics after entering the environment. Current results showed that masks are a potential and easily overlooked source of environmental microplastics. The release amount of microplastics in the static water by one mask was 360 items, and with the increase of vibration rate, the release amount also increased. The addition of organic solvents (detergent and alcohol) in water would increase the release of microplastics from masks. When the mask became fragments, the ability to release microplastic fibers into the environment was greatly improved due to the increase of exposure area. After two months of natural weathering, the masks become very fragile pieces and microplastics. A fully weathered mask could release several billions of microplastic fibers into the aquatic environment once these fragile fragments enter the water without reservation. The rapid growth of mask production and consumption and improper disposable is worrying. It is urgent to understand the potential environmental risks and significance of masks.","Shen, Maocai; Zeng, Zhuotong; Song, Biao; Yi, Huan; Hu, Tong; Zhang, Yaxin; Zeng, Guangming; Xiao, Rong",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34091337/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721032010?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721032010; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148130,132

This review aims to analyze them with a discussion of evolving therapeutic recommendations. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched from 1 January 2020 to 30 May 2020 with the following key terms: “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “pandemic”, “neuro-COVID”, “stroke-COVID”, “epilepsy-COVID”, “COVID-encephalopathy”, “SARS-CoV-2-encephalitis”, “SARS-CoV-2-rhabdomyolysis”, “COVID-demyelinating disease”, “neurological manifestations”, “psychosocial manifestations”, “treatment recommendations”, “COVID-19 and therapeutic changes”, “psychiatry”, “marginalised”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic” and “social media”. A few newspaper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS: Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are abundant. Clinical features of both central and peripheral nervous system involvement are evident. These have been categorically analyzed briefly with literature support. Most of the psychological effects are secondary to pandemic-associated regulatory, socioeconomic and psychosocial changes. CONCLUSION: Neurological and neuropsychiatric manifestations of this disease are only beginning to unravel. This demands a wide index of suspicion for prompt diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 to prevent further complications and mortality.","Roy, Devlina; Ghosh, Ritwik; Dubey, Souvik; Dubey, Mahua Jana; Benito-León, Julián; Kanti Ray, Biman",The Canadian journal of neurological sciences.

Despite intensive research efforts, the genes and pathways that contribute to COVID-19 remain poorly understood. We, therefore, used an integrative genomics (IG) approach to identify candidate genes responsible for COVID-19 and its severity. We used Bayesian colocalization (COLOC) and summary-based Mendelian randomization to combine gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) from the Lung eQTL (n = 1,038) and eQTLGen (n = 31,784) studies with published COVID-19 genome-wide association study (GWAS) data from the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. Additionally, we used COLOC to integrate plasma protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) from the INTERVAL study (n = 3,301) with COVID-19 loci. Finally, we determined any causal associations between plasma proteins and COVID-19 using multi-variable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). The expression of 18 genes in lung and/or blood co-localized with COVID-19 loci. Of these, 12 genes were in suggestive loci (P(GWAS) < 5 × 10(–05)). LZTFL1, SLC6A20, ABO, IL10RB and IFNAR2 and OAS1 had been previously associated with a heightened risk of COVID-19 (P(GWAS) < 5 × 10(–08)). We identified a causal association between OAS1 and COVID-19 GWAS. Plasma ABO protein, which is associated with blood type in humans, demonstrated a significant causal relationship with COVID-19 in the MR analysis; increased plasma levels were associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 and, in particular, severe COVID-19. In summary, our study identified genes associated with COVID-19 that may be prioritized for future investigations. Importantly, this is the first study to demonstrate a causal association between plasma ABO protein and COVID-19.

This study aims to identify patterns of change in eating habits and physical activity during COVID-19 lockdown in Spain and to identify associations with sociodemographic factors and usual habits. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1155 adults recruited online to answer a 10-section questionnaire. The protocol assessed usual diet by means of a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, usual physical activity (PA) and supplement use, dietary changes, sedentary time, PA, exposure to sunlight, sleep quality, and smoking during confinement. Patterns of dietary change were identified by factor analysis. Factor scores were included in cluster analysis together with change in PA. Results: Six patterns of dietary change were identified that together with PA changes during lockdown defined three clusters of lifestyle change: a cluster less active, a more active cluster, and a third cluster as active as usual. People who were usually less active were more likely to be classified in the cluster that increased physical activity in confinement. Scores of the Healthy Mediterranean-Style dietary pattern were higher in this group. Conclusions: Different patterns of change in lifestyles in confinement suggest the need to tailor support and advice to different population groups.","Pérez-Rodrigo, Carmen; Gianzo Citores, Marta; Hervás Bárbara, Gotzone; Ruiz-Litago, Fátima; Casis Sáenz, Luis; Arija, Victoria; López-Sobaler, Ana M.; Martínez de Victoria, Emilio; Ortega, Rosa M.; Partearroyo, Teresa; Quiles-Izquierdo, Joan; Ribas-Barba, Lourdes; Rodríguez-Martín, Amelia; Salvador Castell, Gemma; Tur, Josep A.; Varela-Moreiras, Gregorio; Serra-Majem, Lluis; Aranceta-Bartrina, Javier",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33494314/; https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13020300,132

MATERIALS AND METHODS: It is a retrospective, observational, and multicenter study conducted in 16 tertiary PICUs in Turkey includes a total of 302 children with viral cause in the nasal swab which required PICU admission with no interventions. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 12 months. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was more common in patients over one year of age whereas influenza, human Bocavirus in patients above a year of age was more common (p <0.05). Clinical presentations influencing mortality were neurologic symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, elevated lactate, and acidosis. The critical pH value related with mortality was ≤7.10, and critical PCO(2) ≥60 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that patients with neurological symptoms, tachycardia, hypoxia, hypotension, acidosis, impaired liver, and renal function at the time of admission exhibit more severe mortal progressions. Presence of acidosis and multiorgan failure was found to be predictor for mortality. Knowledge of clinical presentation and age-related variations among seasonal viruses may give a clue about severe course and prognosis.

A number of medications have been proposed and there are ongoing clinical trials around the world to find a suitable treatment. A recent randomised control trial compared lopinavir/ritonavir with standard care among 199 patients with severe Covid-19 infection and concluded that there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with lopinavir/ritonavir. However, there are a few important lessons which may be learnt from the study apart from the statistical reduction in mortality rate. There was a numerical reduction in mortality rate, less intensive care unit stay and less complications in the lopinavir-ritonavir group.

Here we report an on-mask chemical modulation strategy, whereby droplets escaping a masking layer are chemically contaminated with antipathogen molecules (e.g., mineral acids or copper salts) preloaded on polyaniline-coated fabrics. A colorimetric method based on the color change of polyaniline and a fluorometric method utilizing fluorescence quenching microscopy are developed for visualizing the degree of modification of the escaped droplets by H(+) and Cu(2+), respectively. It is found that even fabrics with low fiber-packing densities (e.g., 19%) can readily modify 49% of the escaped droplets by number, which accounts for about 82% by volume. The chemical modulation strategy could offer additional public health benefits to the use of face covering to make the sources less infectious, helping to strengthen the response to the current pandemic or future outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases.","Huang, Haiyue; Park, Hun; Liu, Yihan; Huang, Jiaxing",Matter,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S259023852030566X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matt.2020.10.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S259023852030566X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33163959/,132

This study aimed to identify the diagnosis based on clinical variables to differentiate pleural tuberculous exudates from other pleural effusions. We also investigated the role of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) in the pathogenesis of pleural exudates. Experimental design: The major components in RAS and extracellular matrix metabolism, including angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2, MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities, were measured and compared in the patients with transudative (n = 45) and exudative (n = 80) effusions. The exudative effusions were come from the patients with tuberculosis (n = 20), pneumonia (n = 32), and adenocarcinoma (n = 28). Results: Increased ACE and equivalent ACE2 activities, resulting in a significantly increased ACE/ACE2 ratio in exudates, were detected compared to these values in transudates. MMP-9 activity in exudates was significantly higher than that in transudates. The significant correlation between ACE and ACE2 activity that was found in transudates was not found in exudates. Advanced analyses showed significantly increased ACE and MMP-9 activities, and decreased ACE2 activity in tuberculous pleural effusions compared with those in pneumonia and adenocarcinoma effusions. The results indicate that increased ACE and MMP-9 activities found in the exudates were mainly contributed from a higher level of both enzyme activities in the tuberculous pleural effusions. Conclusion: Interplay between ACE and ACE2, essential functions in the RAS, and abnormal regulation of MMP-9 probably play a pivotal role in the development of exudative effusions. Moreover, the ACE/ACE2 ratio combined with MMP-9 activity in pleural fluid may be potential biomarkers for diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy.","Hsieh, Wen-Yeh; Kuan, Tang-Ching; Cheng, Kun-Shan; Liao, Yan-Chiou; Chen, Mu-Yuan; Lin, Pei-Heng; Hsu, Yuan-Chang; Huang, Chen-Yi; Hsu, Wei-Hua; Yu, Sheng-Yao; Lin, Chih-Sheng",Int J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23091417/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.5087,132

Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with dentists in their early, mid- and late careers working in a range of settings based in London. Participants were purposively sampled via gatekeeper organisations, supported by snowball sampling. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Eighteen dentists working across a range of career stages and care settings were interviewed. Participants were aware of the risks and benefits of using social media and expressed ways of balancing them. A typology of social media user types in the dental profession emerged from the data, comprising avoiders, secondary users, occasional users, observers, seekers, active and cautious, limited, engaged users and deleters. Participants reported an awareness of the impact of maintaining professionalism when using social media. Conclusion Among the participant population sampled, the risks and benefits of general and professional social media were discussed and, in some cases, these overlapped. The findings suggest that dentists are aware of the risks and benefits and employ techniques to balance risk. There were a range of social media user types that varied by characteristics, use in learning and the influences that change their use. It was evident that social media plays an important role in communication between those dentists engaging with available platforms.

636206,"Lung Ultrasound in COVID-19: Not Novel, but Necessary",2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND: Since October, 2017 (and until October, 2020), pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has only been available in England, UK, through the PrEP Impact Trial, by purchasing it from some genitourinary medicine clinics, or via online sources. Here we report changes from 2013 to 2018 in PrEP and postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) awareness and use among HIV-negative gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) and assess predictors of PrEP initiation. METHODS: In the prospective cohort study Attitudes to, and Understanding of Risk of Acquisition of HIV 2 (AURAH2), MSM were recruited from three sexual health clinics in England: two in London and one in Brighton, UK. Men were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older and HIV-negative or of unknown HIV status. Participants self-completed a baseline paper questionnaire at one of the three clinics between July 30, 2013, and April 30, 2016, and were subsequently able to complete 4-monthly and annual online questionnaires, which were available between March 1, 2015, and March 31, 2018, and collected information on sociodemographics, health and wellbeing, HIV status, and sexual behaviours. PrEP and PEP use in the previous 12 months was obtained at baseline and in annual questionnaires. We assessed trends over calendar time in 3-month periods from first enrolment to the end of the study period (July–December, 2013, was counted as one period) in use of PrEP and PEP using generalised estimating equation logistic models. We used age-adjusted Poisson models to assess factors associated with PrEP initiation among participants who reported never having used PrEP at baseline. FINDINGS: 1162 men completed a baseline questionnaire, among whom the mean age was 34 years (SD 10·4), and of those with available data, 942 (82%) of 1150 were white, 1076 (94%) of 1150 were gay, and 857 (74%) of 1159 were university educated. 622 (54%) of 1162 men completed at least one follow-up online questionnaire, of whom 483 (78%) completed at least one annual questionnaire. Overall, PrEP use in the past year increased from 0% (none of 28 respondents) in July to December, 2013, to 43% (23 of 53) in January to March, 2018. The corresponding increase in PrEP use among men who reported condomless sex with two or more partners was from 0% (none of 13 respondents) to 78% (21 of 27). PEP use peaked in April to June, 2016, at 28% (41 of 147 respondents), but decreased thereafter to 8% (four of 53) in January to March, 2018. Among 460 men who had never used PrEP at baseline, predictors of initiating PrEP included age 40–44 years (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 4·25, 95% CI 1·14–15·79) and 45 years and older (3·59, 1·08–11·97) versus younger than 25 years; and after adjustment for age, recent HIV test (5·17, 1·89–14·08), condomless sex (5·01, 2·16–11·63), condomless sex with two or more partners (5·43, 2·99–9·86), group sex (1·69, 1·01–2·84), and non-injection chemsex-related drugs use (2·86, 1·67–4·91) in the past 3 months, PEP use (4·69, 2·83–7·79) in the past 12 months, and calendar year (Jan 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018 vs July 30, 2013, to Dec 31, 2015: 21·19, 9·48–47·35). Non-employment (0·35, 0·14–0·91) and unstable or no housing (vs homeowner 0·13, 0·02–0·95) were associated with reduced rates of PrEP initiation after adjustment for age. About half of PrEP was obtained via the internet, even after the PrEP Impact trial had started (11 [48%] of 23 respondents in January to March, 2018). INTERPRETATION: PrEP awareness and use increased substantially from 2013 to 2018 among a cohort of MSM in England. Improving access to PrEP by routine commissioning by National Health Service England could increase PrEP use among all eligible MSM, but should include public health strategies to target socioeconomic and demographic disparities in knowledge and use of PrEP.

The Schiff base ligand (H(2)L) is coordinated with Cu(II) ion in O, N, S-tridentate mode. The copper complex (1) crystallized in the monoclinic system of the space group P21/c with eight molecules in the unit cell and reveals a square pyramidal geometry. Furthermore, we also perform quantum chemical calculations to get insights into the structure-property relationship and functional properties of ligand (H(2)L) and its copper (II) complex [Cu(L)(phen)](1). Complex [Cu(L)(phen)](1) was also virtually designed in-silico evaluation by Swiss-ADME. Additionally, inspiring by recent developments to find a potential inhibitor for the COVID-19 virus, we have also performed molecular docking study of ligand and its copper complex (1) to see if our compounds shows an affinity for the main protease (M(pro)) of COVID-19 spike protein (PDB ID: 7C8U). Interestingly, the results are found quite encouraging where the binding affinity and inhibition constant were found to be -7.14 kcal/mol and 5.82 μM for ligand (H(2)L) and -6.18 kcal/mol and 0.76 μM for complex [Cu(L)(phen)](1) with M(pro) protein. This binding affinity is reasonably well as compared to recently known antiviral drugs.

Current antibody drugs have increasingly fewer adverse effects due to their high specificity. As a result, therapeutic antibodies have become the predominant class of new drugs developed in recent years. Over the past five years, antibodies have become the best-selling drugs in the pharmaceutical market, and in 2018, eight of the top ten bestselling drugs worldwide were biologics. The global therapeutic monoclonal antibody market was valued at approximately US$115.2 billion in 2018 and is expected to generate revenue of $150 billion by the end of 2019 and $300 billion by 2025. Thus, the market for therapeutic antibody drugs has experienced explosive growth as new drugs have been approved for treating various human diseases, including many cancers, autoimmune, metabolic and infectious diseases. As of December 2019, 79 therapeutic mAbs have been approved by the US FDA, but there is still significant growth potential.

636645,Visceral adipose tissue in patients with COVID-19: risk stratification for severity,2020-08-03,"BACKGROUND: To develop an effective model of predicting fatal outcomes in the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: Between February 20, 2020 and April 4, 2020, consecutive confirmed 2541 COVID-19 patients from three designated hospitals were enrolled in this study. All patients received chest computed tomography (CT) and serological examinations at admission. Laboratory tests included routine blood tests, liver function, renal function, coagulation profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and arterial blood gas. The SaO(2) was measured using pulse oxygen saturation in room air at resting status. Independent high-risk factors associated with death were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard model. A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict the survival of severe COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: There were 124 severe patients in the training cohort, and there were 71 and 76 severe patients in the two independent validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that age ≥ 70 years (HR = 1.184, 95% CI 1.061–1.321), panting (breathing rate ≥ 30/min) (HR = 3.300, 95% CI 2.509–6.286), lymphocyte count < 1.0 × 10(9)/L (HR = 2.283, 95% CI 1.779–3.267), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 10 pg/ml (HR = 3.029, 95% CI 1.567–7.116) were independent high-risk factors associated with fatal outcome. We developed the nomogram for identifying survival of severe COVID-19 patients in the training cohort (AUC = 0.900, 95% CI 0.841–0.960, sensitivity 95.5%, specificity 77.5%); in validation cohort 1 (AUC = 0.811, 95% CI 0.763–0.961, sensitivity 77.3%, specificity 73.5%); in validation cohort 2 (AUC = 0.862, 95% CI 0.698–0.924, sensitivity 92.9%, specificity 64.5%). The calibration curve for probability of death indicated a good consistence between prediction by the nomogram and the actual observation. The prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients with high levels of IL-6 receiving tocilizumab were better than that of those patients without tocilizumab both in the training and validation cohorts, but without difference (P = 0.105 for training cohort, P = 0.133 for validation cohort 1, and P = 0.210 for validation cohort 2). CONCLUSIONS: This nomogram could help clinicians to identify severe patients who have high risk of death, and to develop more appropriate treatment strategies to reduce the mortality of severe patients. Tocilizumab may improve the prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients with high levels of IL-6.

636743,The Use of Bronchoscopy During the COVID-19 Pandemic: CHEST/AABIP Guideline and Expert Panel Report,2020-05-01,"Abstract–The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted ongoing clinical trials. We consider particular impacts on noninferiority clinical trials, which aim to show that an investigational treatment is not markedly worse than an existing active control with known benefit. Because interpretation of noninferiority trials requires cross-trial validation involving untestable assumptions, it is vital that they be run to very high standards. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced an unexpected impact on clinical trials, with subjects possibly missing treatment or assessments due to unforeseen intercurrent events. The resulting data must be carefully considered to ensure proper statistical inference. Missing data can often, but not always, be considered missing completely at random (MCAR). We discuss ways to ensure validity of the analyses through study conduct and data analysis, with focus on the hypothetical strategy for constructing estimands. We assess various analytic strategies of analyzing longitudinal binary data with dropouts where outcomes may be MCAR or missing at random (MAR). Simulations show that certain multiple imputation strategies control the Type I error rate and provide additional power over analysis of observed data when data are MCAR or MAR, with weaker assumptions about the missing data mechanism.","Wiens, Brian L.; Lipkovich, Ilya",Statistics in biopharmaceutical research,https://doi.org/10.1080/19466315.2020.1788983; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34191977/,132

Antibody testing is essential for infection diagnosis, seroepidemiological analysis, and vaccine evaluation. However, convenient, fast, and accurate antibody detection remains a challenge in this protracted battle. Here, we report an ultrafast, low-cost, label-free, and portable SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG) detection platform based on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which can be remotely controlled by a mobile phone. To enable faster detection, voltage pulses are applied on the gate electrode of the OECT to accelerate binding between the antibody and antigen. By optimizing ion concentrations and pH values of test solutions, we realize specific detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG in several minutes with a detectable region from 10 fM to 100 nM, which encompasses the range of serum SARS-CoV-2 IgG levels in humans. These portable sensors show promise for use in diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19.","Liu, Hong; Yang, Anneng; Song, Jiajun; Wang, Naixiang; Lam, Puiyiu; Li, Yuenling; Law, Helen Ka-wai; Yan, Feng",Science advances,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524851/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abg8387,132
637601,Dynamic Interleukin-6 Level Changes as a Prognostic Indicator in Patients With COVID-19,2020-07-17,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the association of preventive measures with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) seropositivity. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital Kharian Medical College, Pakistan, in September 2020. A total of 442 participants from three different strata (faculty, students, and administration/technical staff) were enrolled using a convenient sampling technique. A rapid antibody testing method was used to detect antibodies. The Ichroma™ COVID-19 Ab test is an in vitro diagnostic device that helps in the rapid identification of COVID-19 by measuring the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the blood. An automated fluorescent immunoassay system (AFIAS-6), with a clinical sensitivity of 95.8% and specificity of 96.7%, was used for qualitative analysis. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data, and data analysis was performed using SPSS version 25. RESULTS: In total, 442 participants were included in the study: 40 (9%) faculty members, 299 (67%) students, and 103 (23.3%) administrative/technical staff. As many as 14.9% of the participants were symptomatic; 32.4% always used masks, and 14% never wore masks. Furthermore, 69.7% of participants frequently washed their hands for 20 s, and 75.6% were aware of social distancing. A total of 16.96% of participants tested positive for IgG antibodies. Moreover, most of the administration/technical staff who tested positive for IgG were asymptomatic (68.42%). A significant association (p < 0.001) was found between following the safety guidelines (wearing masks, handwashing, and social distancing) and the occurrence of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This study showed a higher seroprevalence rate than other studies as it was conducted toward the end of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, we are still far from achieving herd immunity. Furthermore, strict compliance with preventive measures is the only way to ensure safety until an effective vaccine is developed.","Naiyar, Iffat; Anjum, Aiman F.; Khalid, Ahmed M.; Noor, Iffat; Abdullah, Muhammad S.; Anwar, Muhammad Z.",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2021.04.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34093105/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658361221000937; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361221000937,132

The aim of this quality improvement (QI) was to improve BP control <130/80 from the baseline rates of 20%–30% and <140/90 from the baseline rates of 40%–60% between ages of 18–75 years, within 12 months. METHODS: We used the Plan-Do-Study-Act method. A multidisciplinary QI team identified barriers by fish bone diagram. Barriers included: 1) Physicians' knowledge gap and clinical inertia in optimization of medications, and 2) Patients' nonadherence to medication and appointments. The outcome measures were the percentage of patients with BP < 140/90 and < 130/80. Process measures included: 1) attendance rates of physician and nurses at educational sessions, 2) medication reconciliation completion rates and 3) care guide order rates. Key interventions were: 1) physicians and nurses' education regarding ACC/AHA guidelines, 2) patient education and engagement and 3) enhancement of health information technology. Data analysis was performed using monthly statistical process control charts. RESULTS: We achieved 62.6% (n = 885/1426) for BP < 140/90 and 24.47% (n = 349/1426) for BP < 130/80 within 12 months project period. We sustained and exceeded at 72.64% (n = 945/1301) for BP < 140/90 and 44.58% (n = 580/1301) for BP < 130/80 during the 10 months post-project period. CONCLUSIONS: Overcoming physician clinical inertia, enhancing patient adherence to appointments and medications, and a high functioning multidisciplinary team were the key drivers for the success.","Sadeghi, Cirous; Khan, Hassan A.; Gudleski, Gregory; Reynolds, Jessica L.; Bakhai, Smita Y.",Int J Cardiol Hypertens,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchy.2020.100060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447781/,132

Experiences from the Covid-19 have shown that focusing on one sector during a crisis only aggravates the stresses in other sectors as decision-makers often view the world from a linear perspective, with the thought that a click of a button would get the economy and society back on track. This study argues that linearity forgets the interconnectedness of systems and how their systemic properties shape their interactions, interdependencies, and interrelationships, whereas nexus planning integrates and simplifies socio-ecological systems, indicates priority areas for intervention, and reduces risk and vulnerability. The lockdowns implemented during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in job losses, company closures, and economic recessions, demonstrating that linear approaches often over-emphasise on a limited set of attributes of a system, notably efficiency, at the expense of other aspects. While linear approaches have been beneficial to some extent for long, the Covid-19 pandemic exposed how they transfer stresses to other sectors, and compromise resilience-building initiatives, allowing failure to cascade from one sector to the other. Nexus planning emphasises on cross-sectoral sustainability and enhances socio-economic resilience against future shocks.","Nhamo, Luxon; Ndlela, Bekithemba",Environ Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935120312731; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2020.110376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115599/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935120312731?v=s5,132
638617,Neurological complications in critical patients with COVID-19,2020-10-09,"BACKGROUND In Europe, the number of frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles is steadily increasing, now accounting for more than 190 000 cycles per year. It is standard clinical practice to postpone FET for at least one menstrual cycle following a failed fresh transfer or after a freeze-all cycle. The purpose of this practice is to minimise the possible residual negative effect of ovarian stimulation on the resumption of a normal ovulatory cycle and receptivity of the endometrium. Although elective deferral of FET may unnecessarily delay time to pregnancy, immediate FET may be inefficient in a clinical setting, following an increased risk of irregular ovulatory cycles and the presence of functional cysts, increasing the risk of cycle cancellation. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE This review explores the impact of timing of FET in the first cycle (immediate FET) versus the second or subsequent cycle (postponed FET) following a failed fresh transfer or a freeze-all cycle on live birth rate (LBR). Secondary endpoints were implantation, pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) as well as miscarriage rate (MR). SEARCH METHODS We searched PubMed (MEDLINE) and EMBASE databases for MeSH and Emtree terms, as well as text words related to timing of FET, up to March 2020, in English language. There were no limitations regarding year of publication or duration of follow-up. Inclusion criteria were subfertile women aged 18-46 years with any indication for treatment with IVF/ICSI. Studies on oocyte donation were excluded. All original studies were included, except for case reports, study protocols and abstracts only. Covidence, a Cochrane-tool, was used for sorting and screening of literature. Risk of bias was assessed using the Robins-I tool and the quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. OUTCOMES Out of 4124 search results, 15 studies were included in the review. Studies reporting adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for LBR, CPR and MR were included in meta-analyses. All studies (n = 15) were retrospective cohort studies involving a total of 6,304 immediate FET cycles and 13,851 postponed FET cycles including 8,019 matched controls. Twelve studies of very low to moderate quality reported no difference in LBR with immediate versus postponed FET. Two studies of moderate quality reported a statistically significant increase in LBR with immediate FET and one small study of very low quality reported better LBR with postponed FET. Trends in rates of secondary outcomes followed trends in LBR regarding timing of FET. The meta-analyses showed a significant advantage of immediate FET (n =2,076) compared to postponed FET (n =3,833), with a pooled aOR of 1.20 (95% CI 1.01-1.44) for LBR and a pooled aOR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.07-1.39) for CPR. WIDER IMPLICATIONS The results of this review indicate a slightly higher LBR and CPR in immediate versus postponed FET. Thus, the standard clinical practice of postponing FET for at least one menstrual cycle following a failed fresh transfer or a freeze-all cycle may not be best clinical practice. However, as only retrospective cohort studies were assessed, the presence of selection bias is apparent, and the quality of evidence thus seems low. Randomised controlled trials including data on cancellation rates and reasons for cancellation are highly needed to provide high-grade evidence regarding clinical practice and patient counselling.","Bergenheim, Sara J; Saupstad, Marte; Pistoljevic, Nina; Andersen, Anders Nyboe; Forman, Julie Lyng; Løssl, Kristine; Pinborg, Anja",Human reproduction update,https://doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmab002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594441/,132

APPROACH: To organize the emergency responses, the government of Taizhou established on 23 January 2020 novel headquarters for prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak, by coordinating different governmental agencies. People at high risk of acquiring COVID-19, as well as probable and confirmed cases, were identified and quarantined. The government closed public venues and limited gatherings. The Taizhou Health Commission shared information about identified COVID-19 patients and probable cases with affected agencies. To timely track and manage close contacts of confirmed cases, Taizhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention did epidemiological investigations. Medical institutions or local centers for disease control and prevention reported confirmed cases to the national Center for Disease Control and Prevention. LOCAL SETTING: Taizhou, a city in Zhejiang province with about 6 million residents, reported 18 confirmed COVID-2019 cases by 23 January 2020, which ranked it third globally in number of cases after Wuhan and Xiaogan cities in the Hubei province. RELEVANT CHANGES: In total, 146 confirmed cases (85 cases imported and 61 cases through community transmission) and no deaths due to COVID-19 had been reported in Taizhou by 1 June 2020. Between 16 February and 1 June 2020, no confirmed case had been reported. LESSON LEARNT: Identifying and managing imported cases and people at risk for infection, timely information sharing, limiting gatherings and ensuring collaborations between different agencies were important in controlling COVID-19.","Lin, Haijiang; Guo, Congcong; Hu, Yafei; Liang, Hongbiao; Shen, Weiwei; Mao, Wenhui; He, Na",Bull World Health Organ,https://doi.org/10.2471/blt.20.255778; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33012863/,132

METHODS: Cross-sectional study based on ad hoc questions. RESULTS: Of 214 mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients managed at home under self-isolation, 179 reported to have at least one household contact, with the total number of no study participants contacts being 296. Among 175 household contacts not tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 67 (38.3%) had SARS-CoV-2 compatible symptoms, 39 (22.3%) had loss of smell or taste with 7 (4.0%) having loss of smell or taste in the absence of other symptoms. The prevalence of smell or taste impairment was 1.5% in patients tested negative compared to 63.0% of those tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Smell or taste impairment are quite common in not-tested household contacts of mildly symptomatic home-isolated SARS-CoV-2-positive patients. This should be taken into account when estimating the burden of loss of sense of smell and taste during COVID-19 pandemic, and further highlights the value of loss of sense of smell and taste as a marker of infection.","Boscolo-Rizzo, Paolo; Borsetto, Daniele; Spinato, Giacomo; Fabbris, Cristoforo; Menegaldo, Anna; Gaudioso, Piergiorgio; Nicolai, Piero; Tirelli, Giancarlo; Da Mosto, Maria Cristina; Rigoli, Roberto; Polesel, Jerry; Hopkins, Claire",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00405-020-06066-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32449021/,132

This study proposes a COVID-19 detection method based on image modal feature fusion. This method first performs small-sample enhancement processing on chest X-rays, such as rotation, translation, and random transformation. Five classic pretraining models are used when extracting modal features. A global average pooling layer reduces training parameters and prevents overfitting. The model is trained and fine-tuned, the machine learning evaluation standard is used to evaluate the model, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is drawn. Experiments show that compared with the classic model, the classification method in this study can more effectively detect COVID-19 image modal information, and it achieves the expected effect of accurately detecting cases.","Ji, Dongsheng; Zhang, Zhujun; Zhao, Yanzhong; Zhao, Qianchuan",J Healthc Eng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34457220/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6799202,132

DESIGN: We encountered an adult patient with severe bronchiolitis in the absence of pneumonia due to M pneumoniae. To determine the relative frequency of such a condition, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of adults over a 4-year period with a hospital discharge diagnosis of “bronchiolitis” from a university hospital. SETTING: University Hospital of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO. STUDY SUBJECTS: From 1994 to 1998, 10 adult inpatients were identified with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. There were two with respiratory bronchiolitis, one with panbronchiolitis, one patient with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), and six with acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. Including the initial patient, three had a definitive clinical diagnosis of Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis. RESULTS: The three adult patients with bronchiolitis due to M pneumoniae are unusual because they occurred in the absence of radiographic features of a lobar or patchy alveolar pneumonia. Hospital admission was occasioned by the severity of symptoms and gas exchange abnormalities. One patient had bronchiolitis as well as organizing pneumonia (BOOP) that responded favorably to corticosteroid treatment. The other two had high-resolution CT findings diagnostic of an acute inflammatory bronchiolitis. One of the patients with inflammatory bronchiolitis had an unusual pattern of marked ventilation and perfusion defects localized predominantly to the left lung. All three had restrictive ventilatory impairment on physiologic testing. CONCLUSIONS: In adults, Mycoplasma-associated bronchiolitis without pneumonia is rarely reported, but in hospitalized patients, it may be more common than expected and may be associated with severe physiologic disturbances.","Chan, Edward D.; Kalayanamit, Tul; Lynch, David A.; Tuder, Rubin; Arndt, Patrick; Winn, Robert; Schwarz, Marvin I.",Chest,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0012369216377613; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10208228/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369216377613,132

The goal of this meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence regarding the prognostic relevance of cardiac biomarkers from data available in published reports. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched from inception through April 2020 for studies comparing median values of cardiac biomarkers in critically ill versus non-critically ill COVID-19 patients, or patients who died versus those who survived. The weighted mean differences (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between the groups were calculated for each study and combined using a random effects meta-analysis model. The odds ratio (OR) for mortality based on cardiac injury was combined from studies reporting it. Troponin levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients who died or were critically ill versus those who were alive or not critically ill (WMD 0.57, 95% CI 0.43–0.70, p < 0.001). Additionally, BNP levels were also significantly higher in patients who died or were critically ill (WMD 0.45, 95% CI − 0.21–0.69, p < 0.001). Cardiac injury was independently associated with significantly increased odds of mortality (OR 6.641, 95% CI 1.26–35.1, p = 0.03). A significant difference in levels of D-dimer was seen in those who died or were critically ill. CK levels were only significantly higher in those who died versus those who were alive (WMD 0.79, 95% CI 0.25–1.33, p = 0.004). Cardiac biomarkers add prognostic value to the determination of the severity of COVID-19 and can predict mortality.","Sheth, Aakash; Modi, Malak; Dawson, Desiree’; Dominic, Paari",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-84643-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33654230/,132
641387,1604P Global survey of 104 cancer patient organisations reveals devastating impact of COVID-19,2021-09-30,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with chronic pain are uniquely challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, as increased stress may exacerbate chronic pain, and there are new barriers to receiving chronic pain treatment. In light of this, using a large online sample in the United States, we examined 1) the early impact of COVID-19 on pain severity, pain interference, and chronic pain management; and 2) variables associated with perceived changes in pain severity and pain interference. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Online survey data for 1,453 adults with chronic pain were collected via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk platform. RESULTS: Although a large proportion of participants reported no perceived changes in their pain severity and pain interference since the outbreak, approximately 25–30% of individuals reported exacerbation in these domains. Individuals identifying as Black and of non-Hispanic origin, who experienced greater disruptions in their mood and sleep quality, were more likely to report worsened pain interference. The majority of participants reported engaging in self-management strategies as usual. However, most appointments for chronic pain treatment were either postponed or canceled, with no future session scheduled. Furthermore, a notable proportion of participants had concerns about or difficulty accessing prescription opioids due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: We may expect to see a long-term exacerbation of chronic pain and related interference in functioning and chronic pain management among individuals most impacted by the pandemic. These individuals may benefit from remotely delivered intervention to effectively mitigate COVID-19–related exacerbations in chronic pain and interruptions in face-to-face treatment.","Mun, Chung Jung; Campbell, Claudia M; McGill, Lakeya S; Aaron, Rachel V",Pain Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa446; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33537764/,132
641840,Perceived worsening of tics in adult patients with Tourette syndrome after the COVID‐19 outbreak,2020-06-13,"BACKGROUND: During the 2(nd) week of July 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) infection spreading in the community. Now more than 15 lakhs peoples have been infected in India, out of the 26816 patients were deceased. COVID 19 outbreaks become an additional hazard to the health-care workers (HCWs), leading to fatigue, anxiety, depression and fear of death. The objective of this questionnaire-based study is to know about the knowledge of HCWs about COVID 19, their experiences while dealing with the disease, and the protective measures taken to prevent the infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study was conducted for 1 month starting from the 2(nd) week of June 2020 after getting institutional ethical clearance. This study included 240 HCWs posted in the medical and surgical Departments of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Jodhpur, Rajasthan. This questionnaire was prepared in online Google forms and required 2 min to complete. Mean, median, range, and standard deviation were used to describe the continuous variables, and percentages were used to describe the categorical data. RESULTS: Among 240 HCWs, 79.16% (n = 190) participants have good knowledge and adapted good precautions (score 15–23) for COVID 19 infection. Rest 20% (n = 48) and 0.8% (n = 2) participants has average (score 8–14) or poor knowledge (score <8) with adaptation of average or poor precautionary measures against COVID 19, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that we have the requirement of more educational training programs for awareness of HCWs and precautionary measures against COVID 19. Thereby, HCWs can improve their knowledge and participate in this fight against COVID 19 with more efficiency and confidence.","Meena, Satya Prakash; Jhirwal, Manisha; Puranik, Ashok Kumar; Sharma, Naveen; Rodha, Mahaveer Singh; Lodha, Mahendra; Badkur, Mayank",J Educ Health Promot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34084857/; https://doi.org/10.4103/jehp.jehp_874_20,132

Spending more time at home due to the pandemic may increase the number of home injuries. METHODS: A nationally representative sample of 2011 U.S. adults were surveyed online between June 17 – June 29, 2020. Propensity score weighting and T-tests were used. RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent (28%) of households reported a home injury or ingestion during the pandemic; 13% reported experiencing both. Injuries were most often due to falls (32%). Medication ingestions were reported by 6%; household product ingestions were reported by 4%. Relative to households that experienced no injuries or ingestions, those that reported either or both were more likely to: be in urban areas, have household incomes > $100,000, and have children living in them. Among households reporting more time spent at home, those with children were significantly more likely than those without to report an injury or ingestion. CONCLUSIONS: Results help target prevention messages while U.S. families are continuing to work and learn remotely. During this pandemic and future stay-at-home orders, there is a need for public health efforts to prevent home injuries and ingestions.","Gielen, Andrea C.; Bachman, Grace; Badaki-Makun, Oluwakemi; Johnson, Renee M.; McDonald, Eileen; Omaki, Elise; Pollack Porter, Keshia M.; Ryan, Leticia; Shields, Wendy",Inj Epidemiol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-020-00291-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176881/,132
642650,"Clinical Characteristics, Exercise Capacity and Pulmonary Function in Post-COVID-19 Competitive Athletes",2021-07-09,"The intercontinental liner shipping services transport containers between two continents and they are crucial for the profitability of a global liner shipping company. In the daily operations of an intercontinental liner shipping service, however, container slot bookings from customers can be freely cancelled during a booking period, which causes loss of revenue and low utilization of ship capacity. Though a pain-point of the liner shipping industry, the container slot cancellation problem has not yet been well investigated in the literature. To fill this research gap, this study aims to estimate the probability for the cancellation of container slot booking in the long haul transports of the intercontinental liner shipping service by considering the primary influential factors of cancellation behavior. To achieve the objective, a container slot booking data-driven model is developed by means of a time-to-event modeling technique. To incorporate the effect of booking region on the cancellation probability, we introduce the frailty term in the model to capture the regionality of the container shipping market. Our case study with real slot booking data shows that the developed model performs well in forecasting the loaded containers of the slot booking requests. In addition, we shed light on how the internal factors of slot booking and external factors of shipping market influence the probability of cancellation.","Zhao, Hui; Meng, Qiang; Wang, Yadong",Transp Res Part C Emerg Technol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2020.102731; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0968090X2030646X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X2030646X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834686/,132

643850,Deficiency of Tfh Cells and Germinal Center in Deceased COVID-19 Patients,2020-08-07,"In recent years, so called “Last Aid courses”, concerning end-of-life care for people dying, have successfully been established in community settings in several European countries, Australia, and South-America. To date, they have not been evaluated in hospital settings, where educational needs (concerning care of the dying) are especially high, and may differ from the general population. To evaluate if Last Aid courses are feasible in hospital settings, and if informational needs of hospital staff are met by the curriculum, we introduced Last Aid courses at a university hospital. Five courses were offered; participants of courses 1 and 2 completed surveys with open-ended questions; the answers were used to develop the evaluation questionnaire employed in courses 3–5. In these three courses, 55 of the 56 participants completed an evaluation survey to explore their learning goals and obtain feedback. Courses were fully booked; participants were heterogeneous with regard to their professional background. The most prevalent learning goals were “preparation for emotional aspects in care of dying” (65.5% ratings “very important”), “preparation for medical/care aspects in care of dying” (60.0%), and “knowledge of supportive services and facilities” (54.5%). Overall, the evaluation showed that Last Aid courses were more suitable to educate non-medical hospital staff about care of the dying. Medical staff, in contrast to non-medical staff, more often requested courses with an extended curriculum in order to meet their learning goals. Last Aid courses were well accepted and helped to reduce information deficits on care of the dying in a heterogeneous population of hospital staff.","Mueller, Evelyn; Bollig, Georg; Becker, Gerhild; Boehlke, Christopher",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356284/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070906,132

645314,Antibiotic Use in UK's COVID-19 Patients Often Unnecessary,2021,"As of 18 October 2020, over 39.5 million cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 1.1 million associated deaths have been reported worldwide. It is crucial to understand the effect of social determination of health on novel COVID-19 outcomes in order to establish health justice. There is an imperative need, for policy makers at all levels, to consider socioeconomic and racial and ethnic disparities in pandemic planning. Cross-sectional analysis from COVID Boston University’s Center for Antiracist Research COVID Racial Data Tracker was performed to evaluate the racial and ethnic distribution of COVID-19 outcomes relative to representation in the United States. Representation quotients (RQs) were calculated to assess for disparity using state-level data from the American Community Survey (ACS). We found that on a national level, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and Black people had RQs > 1, indicating that these groups are over-represented in COVID-19 incidence. Dramatic racial and ethnic variances in state-level incidence and mortality RQs were also observed. This study investigates pandemic disparities and examines some factors which inform the social determination of health. These findings are key for developing effective public policy and allocating resources to effectively decrease health disparities. Protective standards, stay-at-home orders, and essential worker guidelines must be tailored to address the social determination of health in order to mitigate health injustices, as identified by COVID-19 incidence and mortality RQs.","Raine, Samuel; Liu, Amy; Mintz, Joel; Wahood, Waseem; Huntley, Kyle; Haffizulla, Farzanna",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33153162/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17218115,132
646454,Chloroquine dosage regimens in patients with COVID-19: safety risks and optimization using simulations,2020-05-21,"BACKGROUND: Solitary death (kodokushi) has recently become recognized as a social issue in Japan. The social isolation of older people leads to death without dignity. With the outbreak of COVID-19, efforts to eliminate solitary death need to be adjusted in line with changes in lifestyle and accompanying changes in social structure. Health monitoring services that utilize wearable devices may contribute to this end. Our goals are to outline how wearable devices might be used to (1) detect emergency situations involving solitary older people and swiftly connect them with medical treatment, to (2) reduce the frequency of deaths that remain undiscovered and (3) to reduce social isolation by promoting social interaction. METHODS: Theoretical and philosophical approaches were adopted to examine ethical issues surrounding the application of wearable devices and cloud-based information processing systems to prevent solitary death in the world with/after COVID-19. MAIN BODY: (1) Technology cannot replace social connections; without social support necessary to foster understanding of the benefits of health management through wearable devices among older adults, such devices may remain unused, or not used properly. (2) Maturity of the technology; systems face the difficult task of detecting and responding to a wide range of health conditions and life-threatening events in time to avert avoidable morbidity and mortality. (3) Autonomy and personhood; promoting the voluntary use of wearable devices that are a part of larger efforts to connect isolated individuals to a community or social services might be effective. Legal force should be avoided if possible. There is some concern that landlords may require an older person to sign a contract agreeing to wear a device. The autonomy of solitary older people should be respected. (4) Governance: policies must be developed to limit access to data from wearables and the purposes for which data can be used. CONCLUSION: If thoughtfully deployed under proper policy constraints, wearable devices offer a way to connect solitary older people to health services and could reduce cases of solitary death while respecting the personhood of the user.","Nakazawa, Eisuke; Yamamoto, Keiichiro; London, Alex John; Akabayashi, Akira",BMC Med Ethics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12910-021-00657-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34246258/,132

Records of 252 COVID-19 patients were retrospectively analyzed from February 13 to February 29, 2020 in 4 inpatient wards in the Cancer Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China. The rate of clinical improvement was significantly greater among patients treated with Arbidol than among those who did not receive Arbidol (86.8% vs. 54.2%). In moderately and severely ill patients, the clinical improvement rates in the Arbidol group were 95.6% and 81.7%, respectively, which was significantly higher than in the no-Arbidol group (66.6% and 53.8%). Among critically ill patients, however, there was no significant difference. The levels of hypersensitive C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, D-dimer, IL-6, and IL-10 were increased in non-improved patients but declined during treatment in the improved patients. This suggests these mediators are associated with the disease severity and could potentially serve as prognostic markers. Moreover, our data demonstrate that Arbidol is effective in the treatment of COVID-19 patients and may serve as a cost-effective antiviral treatment strategy for patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms.","Jie, Xiong; Hongmei, Yuan; Ping, Fan; Kuikui, Zhu; Bohan, Yang; Rui, Meng",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202867; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33811756/,132

This study examines the adoption of protective behaviors in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak and the influence of religion on risk perception by comparing precautionary behaviors in public and in mosques. METHODS: Data were collected through an online survey of 327 Muslim men across the Aceh Province, Indonesia, from April 21, 2020, to May 2, 2020. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the paired t-test were employed to compare the uptake of protective behaviors in public and mosques. RESULTS: The adoption of protective behaviors was higher in public rather than in mosques. It further revealed that the understanding of Islamic teachings during the pandemic has influenced perceived risk and the way Muslim men comply with the protective guidelines. Those who have complete, incomplete, or no compliance of precautionary behaviors have their own interpretation of Islamic teachings that inform their individual actions to manage the risk.

However, an association with the COVID-19 vaccine is yet to be established. PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present the case of an elderly gentleman with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection or any recent viral or bacterial illnesses who presented with GBS 20 days after the second dose of COVID-19 vaccination. The diagnosis was established based on physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and electromyography (EMG). DISCUSSION: Due to the occurrence of GBS after certain types of infections, molecular mimicry has become widely acceptable as the underlying pathophysiology. The reported cases of GBS following vaccination further supported this theory, however proving a causal relationship between vaccines and GBS on the molecular level remains a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case in the state of Qatar. It is important to mention that more research is needed to establish an association between COVID-19 vaccine and GBS.

Study design Children <18 years old hospitalized with clinical and radiographic CAP were enrolled at 3 US children's hospitals. Neurologic disorders included cerebral palsy, developmental delay, Down syndrome, epilepsy, non-Down syndrome chromosomal abnormalities, and spinal cord abnormalities. We compared the epidemiology, etiology, and clinical outcomes of CAP in children with neurologic disorders with those with non-neurologic underlying conditions, and those with no underlying conditions using bivariate, age-stratified, and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Results From January 2010-June 2012, 2358 children with radiographically confirmed CAP were enrolled; 280 (11.9%) had a neurologic disorder (52.1% of these individuals also had non-neurologic underlying conditions), 934 (39.6%) had non-neurologic underlying conditions only, and 1144 (48.5%) had no underlying conditions. Children with neurologic disorders were older and more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) admission than children with non-neurologic underlying conditions and children with no underlying conditions; similar proportions were mechanically ventilated. In age-stratified analysis, children with neurologic disorders were less likely to have a pathogen detected than children with non-neurologic underlying conditions. In multivariate analysis, having a neurologic disorder was associated with ICU admission for children ≥2 years of age. Conclusions Children with neurologic disorders hospitalized with CAP were less likely to have a pathogen detected and more likely to be admitted to the ICU than children without neurologic disorders.","Millman, Alexander J.; Finelli, Lyn; Bramley, Anna M.; Peacock, Georgina; Williams, Derek J.; Arnold, Sandra R.; Grijalva, Carlos G.; Anderson, Evan J.; McCullers, Jonathan A.; Ampofo, Krow; Pavia, Andrew T.; Edwards, Kathryn M.; Jain, Seema",The Journal of Pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27017483/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022347616002717; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2016.02.049; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022347616002717,132

648891,Does type of immunosupression influence the course of Covid-19 infection?,2020-06-03,"Coronaviruses replicate their genomes in association with rearranged cellular membranes. The coronavirus nonstructural integral membrane proteins (nsps) 3, 4 and 6, are key players in the formation of the rearranged membranes. Previously, we demonstrated that nsp3 and nsp4 interact and that their co-expression results in the relocalization of these proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) into discrete perinuclear foci. We now show that these foci correspond to areas of rearranged ER-derived membranes, which display increased membrane curvature. These structures, which were able to recruit other nsps, were only detected when nsp3 and nsp4 were derived from the same coronavirus species. We propose, based on the analysis of a large number of nsp3 and nsp4 mutants, that interaction between the large luminal loops of these proteins drives the formation of membrane rearrangements, onto which the coronavirus replication–transcription complexes assemble in infected cells.","Hagemeijer, Marne C.; Monastyrska, Iryna; Griffith, Janice; van der Sluijs, Peter; Voortman, Jarno; van Bergen en Henegouwen, Paul M.; Vonk, Annelotte M.; Rottier, Peter J.M.; Reggiori, Fulvio; de Haan, Cornelis A.M.",Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24928045/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2014.04.027; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214001500; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682214001500,132

This research uses Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) in a field database of 1654 over-indebted households to identify distinguishable clusters and to predict its risk factors. First, unsupervised machine learning using Self-Organizing Maps generated three over-indebtedness clusters: low-income (31.27%), low credit control (37.40%), and crisis-affected households (31.33%). Second, supervised machine learning with exhaustive grid search hyperparameters (32,730 predictive models) suggests that Nu-Support Vector Machine had the best accuracy in predicting families’ over-indebtedness risk factors (89.5%). By proposing an AutoML approach on over-indebtedness, our research adds both theoretically and methodologically to current models of scarcity with important practical implications for business research and society. Our findings also contribute to novel ways to identify and characterize poverty risk in earlier stages, allowing customized interventions for different profiles of over-indebtedness.","Boto Ferreira, Mário; Costa Pinto, Diego; Maurer Herter, Márcia; Soro, Jerônimo; Vanneschi, Leonardo; Castelli, Mauro; Peres, Fernando",J Bus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296320306949; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296320306949; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.10.035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33100428/,132

Using a longitudinal approach that analyzes the movement of an unpredictable and real infection threat to explain and predict human behavior during the pandemic—a novel approach in behavioral immune system research—a panel survey was conducted on Japanese citizens. The results of the survey, conducted in late January, mid‐February, and early March 2020, indicated that the influence of the interaction between the changes in situational infection threat and individual differences in pathogen‐avoidance tendency on infection‐prevention behaviors and exclusionary attitudes toward foreigners was not significant. Moreover, frequent contact with foreigners had a mitigating effect on exclusionary attitudes. The study thus provided a valuable contribution to the application of behavioral immune‐system responses to problems associated with infection threats. Moreover, consideration of the aspects of adaptive reaction and social learning allowed us to observe the process of adaptive strategies in novel environments under conditions of high ecological validity and to accurately understand the psychological response to infectious disease outbreaks.","Yamagata, Mei; Teraguchi, Tsukasa; Miura, Asako",Jpn Psychol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548692/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jpr.12377,132

This study assessed the level of knowledge on SARS-COV-2 infection prevention, transmission and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as perceptions regarding prevention of SARS-COV-2 infection among allied radiation medicine professionals. Cross-sectional descriptive survey was carried out among 145 radiation medicine professionals in Ghana using facts on COVID-19 as presented on the website of the World Health Organization and data was analyzed based on weighted average indices. Overall, the extent of knowledge among allied radiation medicine professionals on the symptoms of COVID-19, transmission and control of SARS-COV-2 infection in radiation medicine facilities were all adequate, with weighted average indices of 3.8, 4.1 and 4.4 respectively. However, overall perception of the respondents regarding the use of radiation medicine procedures in management of COVID-19 was diverse, with weighted index of 3.5. The facts about COVID-19 that were identified to be most known were shortness of breath being a serious symptom of the disease and fever being a common symptom. The extent of knowledge on the fact that “SARS-COV-2 infection can be transmitted through small droplets from the nose or mouth of an infected person” was almost excellent, with weighted average index of 4.9. Also, the thinking that provision of hand washing and sanitizing facilities is a measure for controlling the infection was almost perfectly shared among the respondents. Computed tomography was perceived by majority of the respondents as the most preferred imaging modality for screening patients for COVID-19. The study shows that some aspects of the awareness of radiation medicine professionals on COVID-19 pandemic are adequate and others need critical improvement to help reduce spread of the disease.","Hasford, Francis; Sosu, Edem Kwabla; Awua, Adolf Kofi; Rockson, Prince; Hammond, Emmanuel Nii Boye",Health Technol (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s12553-020-00507-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282626/,132

To support the process, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among the Hungarian population to estimate the prevalence of infectious cases and prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. A representative sample (n = 17,787) for the Hungarian population of 14 years or older living in private households (n = 8,283,810) was selected. The study was performed within 16 days after 50 days of restrictions, when the number of confirmed cases was stable low. Naso- and oropharyngeal smears and blood samples were collected for PCR and antibody testing. The testing was accompanied by a questionnaire about symptoms, comorbidities, and contacts. Design-based prevalence estimates were calculated. In total, 10,474 individuals (67.7% taken into account a sample frame error of 2315) of the selected sample participated in the survey. Of the tested individuals, 3 had positive PCR and 69 had positive serological test. Population estimate of the number of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seropositivity were 2421 and 56,439, respectively, thus active infection rate (2.9/10,000) and the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure (68/10,000) was low. Self-reported loss of smell or taste and body aches were significantly more frequent among those with SARS-CoV-2. In this representative, cross-sectional survey of the Hungarian population with a high participation rate, the overall active infection rate was low in sync with the prevalence of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure. We demonstrated a potential success of containment efforts, supporting an exit strategy.

The interventions were delivered twice a week for 3 months (24 sessions) and assessments were conducted pre and post intervention. The results indicate the feasibility of implementing the interventions and slight improvements in both intervention groups compared to the control group. The diet-only group tended to have larger improvements on body composition measures (especially in muscle mass), while the diet + exercise group tended to have larger improvements on physical function (especially in chair stands). There was a high rate of attrition, especially in the diet + exercise group, but those who completed the intervention tended to have improvements in body composition and physical function.","Vieira, Edgar Ramos; Cavalcanti, Fabricia Azevedo da Costa; Civitella, Fernanda; Hollifield, Monica; Caceres, Stephanie; Carreno, Jorge; Gaillard, Trudy; Huffman, Fatma G.; Mora, Jorge Camilo; Queiroga, Marcos Roberto",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34360312/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18158019,132
651801,CORE‐Myoclonus Syndrome: A Proposed Neurological Initial Manifestation of COVID‐19,2021-04-06,"Comparative functional analysis of the binding interactions between various Betacoronavirus mutant strains and their potential multiple human target proteins is crucial for a more complete understanding of zoonotic spillovers of viruses that cause diseases like COVID-19. Here, employing hundreds of replicate sets of nanosecond scale GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations, we statistically compare atom motions of ACE2 and CD26 target proteins in both the presence and absence of different strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. In all strains, we demonstrate a universally conserved functional binding signature of the viral RBD with the N-terminal helices of ACE2. We also identify a second more dynamically transient interaction of the viral N501 with the previously confirmed ACE2 K353 and two nearby novel sites, Q325 and the AAQPFLL 386–92 motif. We propose a model of the functional evolution of SARS-type zoonotic spillovers involving both (A) a conserved binding interaction with the N-terminal helices of ACE2 that is preadapted from viral interaction of the Tylonycteris bat coronavirus progenitor strain HKU4 with the SAMLI 291–5 motif in protein CD26 and (B) a more promiscuous and likely more evolvable interaction between viral N501 and the above-mentioned multiple regions of ACE2 that is preadapted from the bat viral interaction at the CD26 SS 333–4 motif. Our recent analysis of the highly transmissible N501Y lineage B.1.1.7 mutation in SARS-CoV-2 also supports this model, identifying a less promiscuous Y501 interaction with ACE2 that favors more stable functional binding with the K353 site alone.","Rynkiewicz, Patrick; Babbitt, Gregory A.; Cui, Feng; Hudson, André O.; Lynch, Miranda L.",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501438/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.11.293258,132

A MERS patient came from Korea to China in late May 2015. The patient was 44 years old and had symptoms including high fever, dry cough with a little phlegm, and shortness of breath, which are roughly consistent with those associated with MERS, and had had close contact with individuals with confirmed cases of MERS.After one month of therapy with antiviral, anti-infection, and immune-enhancing agents, the patient recovered in the hospital and was discharged. A nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected for direct sequencing, which revealed two deletion variants of MERS CoV. Deletions of 414 and 419 nt occurred between ORF5 and the E protein, resulting in a partial protein fusion or truncation of ORF5 and the E protein. Functional analysis by bioinformatics and comparison to previous studies implied that the two variants might be defective in their ability to package MERS CoV.

EPIDEMIOLOGY: Many factors lead to underestimate VNI: difficulty to distinguish between community-acquired and nosocomial infections for seasonal viral diseases, incubation time leading to symptoms after patient discharge, difficulty for diagnosis. Population at high risks of VNI are the children, the elderly and the immunocompromized patients. The risk of severe diseases is high in this last population. The main reservoir of virus is infected symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Asymptomatic carriers, especially health care workers, are a major source of transmission. Main routes of transmission are the fecal–oral route, the respiratory route, cutaneous or mucous contact and blood and body fluids exposure. A review of the main virus involved in VNI is presented. PREVENTION: Preventive measures, such as strict adherence to standard precautions and, in some instances, to isolation procedures, are critical to control VNI. In a major outbreak situation, it may be necessary to consider cohort isolation. Specific control measures rely on immunization, antiviral drug prophylaxis (varicella–zooster, herpes, influenza, exposure to blood) and clinical and biological screening of organ, blood, tissue and cell donors.","Traoré, O.; Aumeran, C.; Henquell, C.",Antibiotiques (Paris),https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1294550108001088; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1294550108001088,132

Most providers are very interested in the telehealth program and the opportunities it provides them to best treat their patients. Key barriers to engagement in teledermatology were (1) primary non-adherence: this is rooted in misconception about teledermatology, the investment in time required to master the technology and establish digital links between primary care provider and consultant; and, (2) secondary non-adherence: this is related to the time required to submit a teledermatology consult which disrupts busy offices. Emphasizing the benefits of teledermatology to primary care physicians and simplification of the teledermatology consult submission process may increase the use of teledermatology in rural Mississippi and serve as a model for other academic teledermatology programs throughout the United States.","Morrissette, Summer; Pearlman, Ross L.; Kovar, Margaret; Sisson, William T.; Brodell, Robert T.; Nahar, Vinayak K.",Arch Dermatol Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00403-021-02208-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630147/,132
653423,Vitamin D Deficiency and Outcome of COVID-19 Patients,2020-09-10,"Autopsies of patients who have died from COVID‐19 have been crucial in delineating patterns of injury associated with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Despite their utility, comprehensive autopsy studies are somewhat lacking relative to the global burden of disease, and very few comprehensive studies contextualize the findings to other fatal viral infections. We developed a novel autopsy protocol in order to perform postmortem examinations on victims of COVID‐19 and herein describe detailed clinical information, gross findings, and histologic features observed in the first 16 complete COVID‐19 autopsies. We also critically evaluated the role of ancillary studies used to establish a diagnosis of COVID‐19 at autopsy, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and electron microscopy (EM). IHC and ISH targeting SARS‐CoV‐2 were comparable in terms of the location and number of infected cells in lung tissue; however, nonspecific staining of bacteria was seen occasionally with IHC. EM was unrevealing in blindly sampled tissues. We then compared the clinical and histologic features present in this series to six archival cases of fatal seasonal influenza and six archival cases of pandemic influenza from the fourth wave of the ‘Spanish Flu’ in the winter of 1920. In addition to routine histology, the inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs of COVID‐19 and seasonal influenza victims were compared using quantitative IHC. Our results demonstrate that the clinical and histologic features of COVID‐19 are similar to those seen in fatal cases of influenza, and the two diseases tend to overlap histologically. There was no significant difference in the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in COVID‐19 and influenza at sites of acute lung injury at the time of autopsy.

While travel connectivity-based assessments may help understand patterns of travel network-mediated epidemics, such approaches are rarely carried out in sufficient detail for Oceania where air travel is the dominant method of transportation between countries. DESIGN: Travel data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Stats NZ and the United Nations World Tourism Organization websites were used to calculate travel volumes in 2018 within Oceania and between Oceania and the rest of the world. The Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI) was incorporated into the analysis as an indicator of each country’s capacity to contain an outbreak. Travel networks were developed to assess the spread of infectious diseases (1) into and from Oceania, (2) within Oceania and (3) between each of the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs) and their most connected countries. RESULTS: Oceania was highly connected to countries in Asia, Europe and North America. Australia, New Zealand and several PICTs were highly connected to the USA and the UK (least vulnerable countries for outbreaks based on the IDVI), and to China (intermediate low vulnerable country). High variability was also observed between the PICTs in the geographical distribution of their international connections. The PICTs with the highest number of international connections were Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam and Papua New Guinea. CONCLUSION: Travel connectivity assessments may help to accurately stratify the risk of infectious disease importation and outbreaks in countries depending on disease transmission in other parts of the world. This information is essential to track future requirements for scaling up and targeting outbreak surveillance and control strategies in Oceania.","Cadavid Restrepo, Angela; Furuya-Kanamori, Luis; Mayfield, Helen; Nilles, Eric; Lau, Colleen L",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385235/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046206,132

However, whether these instruments may replace or not gonioscopy in everyday clinical practice remains unclear. This review summarizes the last findings in ACA evaluation, focusing on new instruments and their application to the clinical practice. Special attention will be given to the comparison between these new techniques and traditional slit-lamp gonioscopy. Whereas ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography provide quantitative measurements of the anterior segment’s structures, new gonio-photographic systems allow for a qualitative assessment of angle findings, similarly to gonioscopy.

Compared to 2019, a significant drop in ED presentations occurred (−46.4%), and we recorded a −15.7% difference in the proportion of patients admitted with white codes. The pattern of hourly presentations to the ED was unchanged, with overcrowding during the working daytime. COVID-19 changed ED flows, likely causing an overall reduction in the number of deferrable conditions. However, the pattern associated with urgent conditions did not change abruptly in 2020.","Gambazza, Simone; Galazzi, Alessandro; Binda, Filippo; Passeri, Onorina; Bosco, Paola; Costantino, Giorgio; Laquintana, Dario",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34202591/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070791,132
655458,Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome and its prolonged effects: An updated systematic review,2021-05-14,"Scholars have widely recognised the importance of academic relationships between students at the university. While much of the past research has focused on studying their influence on different aspects such as the students’ academic performance or their emotional stability, less is known about their dynamics and the factors that influence the formation and dissolution of linkages between university students in academic networks. In this paper, we try to shed light on this issue by exploring through stochastic actor-oriented models and student-level data the influence that a set of proximity factors may have on formation of these relationships over the entire period in which students are enrolled at the university. Our findings confirm that the establishment of academic relationships is derived, in part, from a wide range of proximity dimensions of a social, personal, geographical, cultural and academic nature. Furthermore, and unlike previous studies, this research also empirically confirms that the specific stage in which the student is at the university determines the influence of these proximity factors on the dynamics of academic relationships. In this regard, beyond cultural and geographic proximities that only influence the first years at the university, students shape their relationships as they progress in their studies from similarities in more strategic aspects such as academic and personal closeness. These results may have significant implications for both academic research and university policies.","Tomás-Miquel, José-Vicente; Capó-Vicedo, Jordi",High Educ (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34253934/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10734-021-00734-3,132
655516,A qualitative study of online support communities for lung cancer survivors on targeted therapies,2021-01-18,"BACKGROUND: Efficient and early triage of hospitalized Covid-19 patients to detect those with higher risk of severe disease is essential for appropriate case management. METHODS: We trained, validated, and externally tested a machine-learning model to early identify patients who will die or require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from clinical and laboratory features obtained at admission. A development cohort with 918 Covid-19 patients was used for training and internal validation, and 352 patients from another hospital were used for external testing. Performance of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. RESULTS: A total of 363 of 918 (39.5%) and 128 of 352 (36.4%) Covid-19 patients from the development and external testing cohort, respectively, required mechanical ventilation or died during hospitalization. In the development cohort, the model obtained an AUC of 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.82 to 0.87) for predicting severity of disease progression. Variables ranked according to their contribution to the model were the peripheral blood oxygen saturation (SpO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, age, estimated glomerular filtration rate, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index and lymphocytes. In the external testing cohort, the model performed an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.85). This model is deployed in an open source calculator, in which Covid-19 patients at admission are individually stratified as being at high or non-high risk for severe disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: This machine-learning model, applied at hospital admission, predicts risk of severe disease progression in Covid-19 patients.","Marcos, Miguel; Belhassen-García, Moncef; Sánchez-Puente, Antonio; Sampedro-Gomez, Jesús; Azibeiro, Raúl; Dorado-Díaz, Pedro-Ignacio; Marcano-Millán, Edgar; García-Vidal, Carolina; Moreiro-Barroso, María-Teresa; Cubino-Bóveda, Noelia; Pérez-García, María-Luisa; Rodríguez-Alonso, Beatriz; Encinas-Sánchez, Daniel; Peña-Balbuena, Sonia; Sobejano-Fuertes, Eduardo; Inés, Sandra; Carbonell, Cristina; López-Parra, Miriam; Andrade-Meira, Fernanda; López-Bernús, Amparo; Lorenzo, Catalina; Carpio, Adela; Polo-San-Ricardo, David; Sánchez-Hernández, Miguel-Vicente; Borrás, Rafael; Sagredo-Meneses, Víctor; Sanchez, Pedro-Luis; Soriano, Alex; Martín-Oterino, José-Ángel",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882060/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240200,132

In the early days of the pandemic, COVID testing was preferentially available to HCWs. The objective of this study was to understand how individual experiences for all HCWs during the pandemic were associated with perceptions of access to, and receipt of COVID testing . METHODS: All hospital employees (n = 6736) in a single academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey regarding perceived access to, and receipt of COVID testing during the first wave of the pandemic (March – August 2020). Responses were linked to human resources data. Log binomial univariate and multivariable models were used to estimate associations between individual and employment variables and COVID testing. RESULTS: A total of 2543 employees responded to the survey (38 %). The mean age was 40 years (± 14). Respondents were female (76 %), white (55 %), worked as nurses (27 %), administrators (22 %) and patient support roles (22 %); 56 % of respondents wanted COVID testing. Age (RR 0.91, CI 0.88–0.93), full time status (RR 0.85, CI 0.79–0.92), employment tenure (RR 0.96, CI 0.94–0.98), changes in quality of life (RR 0.94, CI 0.91–0.96), changes in job duties (RR 1.19, CI 1.03–1.37), and worry about enough paid sick leave (RR 1.21, CI 1.12–1.30) were associated with interest in testing. Administrators (RR 0.64, CI 0.58–0.72) and patient support staff (RR 0.85, CI 0.78–0.92) were less likely than nurses to want testing. Age (RR 1.04, CI 1.01–1.07), material hardships (RR 0.87, CI 0.79–0.96), and employer sponsored insurance (RR 1.10, CI 1.00-1.22) were associated with receiving a COVID test. Among all employees, only administrative/facilities staff were less likely to receive COVID testing (RR 0.69, CI 0.59–0.79). CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to our understanding of how hospital employees view availability of COVID testing. Hazard pay or other supports for hospital workers may increase COVID testing rates. These findings may be applicable to perceived barriers towards vaccination receipt.

656121,Untimely Myocardial Infarction or COVID-19 Vaccine Side Effect,2021-03-02,"BACKGROUND. Evidence has shown that a large proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals do not experience symptomatic disease. Owing to its critical role in immune response, we hypothesized that variation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci may underly asymptomatic infection. METHODS. We enrolled 29,947 individuals registered in the National Marrow Donor Program for whom high-resolution HLA genotyping data were available in a smartphone-based study designed to track COVID-19 symptoms and outcomes. Among 21,893 individuals who completed the baseline survey, our discovery (N=640) and replication (N=788) cohorts were comprised of self-identified White subjects who reported a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2. We tested for association of five HLA loci (HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1) with asymptomatic vs. symptomatic infection. RESULTS. HLA-B*15:01 was significantly increased in asymptomatic individuals in the discovery cohort compared to symptomatic (OR = 2.45; 95%CI 1.38–4.24, p = 0.0016, p(corr) = 0.048), and we reproduced this association in the replication cohort (OR= 2.32; 95%CI = 1.10–4.43, p = 0.017). We found robust association of HLA-B*15:01 in the combined dataset (OR=2.40 95% CI = 1.54–3.64; p = 5.67 ×10(−5)) and observed that homozygosity of this allele increases more than eight times the chance of remaining asymptomatic after SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR = 8.58, 95%CI = 1.74–34.43, p = 0.003). Finally, we demonstrated the association of HLA-B*15:01 with asymptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infection is enhanced by the presence of HLA-DRB1*04:01 CONCLUSION. HLA-B*15:01 is strongly associated with asymptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2 and is likely to be involved in the mechanism underlying early viral clearance.","Augusto, Danillo G.; Yusufali, Tasneem; Peyser, Noah D.; Butcher, Xochitl; Marcus, Gregory M.; Olgin, Jeffrey E.; Pletcher, Mark J.; Maiers, Martin; Hollenbach, Jill A.",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.13.21257065v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.13.21257065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34031661/,132
656358,CPAP management of COVID-19 respiratory failure: a first quantitative analysis from an inpatient service evaluation,2020-11-04,"Organizational crisis can serve as a base to provide an opportunity to an organization for enhancing individuals, organizations, and communities. The healthcare sector is one of those sectors that remains under continuous pressure to provide high-quality service delivery to the patients. Hence, the requirement of innovation for this sector is huge when compared to other sectors. The majority of the previous studies have investigated the phenomenon of CSR at the employee’s level (CSR-E) to influence employee behavior positively. However, the importance of CSR-E to enhance the innovative capability of the employees at the workplace is not well-explored in extant literature. Moreover, it is not clear from previous studies how the concept of servant leadership can explain the employee’s engagement towards innovative work behavior (EIB). Thus, the current survey aims to test the relationship of CSR-E and EIB in the healthcare sector of Pakistan with the mediating effect of servant leadership. The data of the current study were obtained through a self-administered (paper-pencil) survey and they were analyzed through the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The empirical results of SEM analysis revealed that CSR-E and EIB are positively related and servant leadership partially mediates this relationship. The findings of the current study will be helpful for policymakers to improve their understanding towards CSR-E to induce EIB in the time of crisis. At the same time, the current study also highlights the importance of servant leadership to the policymakers in encouraging the employees to display their innovative capability at the workplace to serve their organization during the time of crisis.","Ahmad, Naveed; Scholz, Miklas; Arshad, Muhammad Zulqarnain; Jafri, Syed Khuram Ali; Sabir, Raja Irfan; Khan, Waris Ali; Han, Heesup",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33925322/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18094608,132
657096,Could COVID-19 be a trigger for manic attack in an adolescent?,2021-06-10,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinants of willingness and practice of physicians’ online medical services (OMS) uptake based on social ecosystem theory, so as to formulate OMS development strategies. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Research was conducted in two comprehensive hospitals and two community hospitals in Jiangsu, China, and the data were gathered from 1 June to 31 June 2020. PARTICIPANTS: With multistage sampling, 707 physicians were enrolled in this study. OUTCOME MEASURE: Descriptive statistics were reported for the basic characteristics. χ(2) test, Mann-Whitney U test and Spearman’s correlation analysis were used to perform univariate analysis. Linear regression and logistic regression were employed to examine the determinants of physicians’ OMS uptake willingness and actual uptake, respectively. RESULTS: The mean score of the physicians’ OMS uptake willingness was 17.33 (range 5–25), with an SD of 4.39, and 53.3% of them reported having conducted OMS. In the micro system, factors positively associated with willingness included holding administrative positions (b=1.03, p<0.05), OMS-related awareness (b=1.32, p<0.001) and OMS-related skills (b=4.88, p<0.001); the determinants of actual uptake included holding administrative positions (OR=2.89, 95% CI 1.59 to 5.28, p<0.01), OMS-related awareness (OR=1.90, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.96, p<0.01), OMS-related skills (OR=2.25, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.74, p<0.01) and working years (OR=2.44, 95% CI 1.66 to 3.59, p<0.001). In the meso system, the hospital’s incentive mechanisms (b=0.78, p<0.05) were correlated with willingness; hospital advocated for OMS (OR=2.34, 95% CI 1.21 to 4.52, p<0.05), colleagues’ experiences (OR=3.81, 95% CI 2.25 to 6.45, p<0.001) and patients’ consultations (OR=2.93, 95% CI 2.02 to 4.25, p<0.001) were determinants of actual uptake. In the macro system, laws and policies were correlated with willingness (b=0.73, p<0.05) and actual uptake (OR=1.98, 95% CI 1.31 to 2.99, p<0.01); media orientation was also associated with willingness (b=0.74, p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Multiple determinants influence physicians’ OMS application. Comprehensive OMS promotion strategies should be put forward from multidimensional perspectives including the micro, meso and macro levels.","Peng, Xueqing; Li, Zhiguang; Zhang, Chi; Liu, Rui; Jiang, Yongzhi; Chen, Jiayu; Qi, Zixin; Ge, Jinjin; Zhao, Shiqi; Zhou, Meng; You, Hua",BMJ Open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-048851; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34531212/,132
657378,Neurologic Manifestations and Complications of COVID-19,2021,"Evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronaviruses, can be dispersed and potentially transmitted by aerosols directly or via ventilation systems. We therefore investigated ventilation openings in one COVID-19 ward and central ducts that expel indoor air from three COVID-19 wards at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden, during April and May 2020. Swab samples were taken from individual ceiling ventilation openings and surfaces in central ducts. Samples were subsequently subjected to rRT-PCR targeting the N and E genes of SARS-CoV-2. Central ventilation HEPA filters, located several stories above the wards, were removed and portions analyzed in the same manner. In two subsequent samplings, SARS-CoV-2 N and E genes were detected in seven and four out of 19 room vents, respectively. Central ventilation HEPA exhaust filters from the ward were found positive for both genes in three samples. Corresponding filters from two other, adjacent COVID-19 wards were also found positive. Infective ability of the samples was assessed by inoculation of susceptible cell cultures but could not be determined in these experiments. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in central ventilation systems, distant from patient areas, indicate that virus can be transported long distances and that droplet transmission alone cannot reasonably explain this, especially considering the relatively low air change rates in these wards. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 must be taken into consideration for preventive measures.","Nissen, Karolina; Krambrich, Janina; Akaberi, Dario; Hoffman, Tove; Ling, Jiaxin; Lundkvist, Åke; Svensson, Lennart; Salaneck, Erik",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-76442-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33177563/,132

The purpose of this study was to investigate pandemic-related changes in the incidence of pediatric surgical emergencies. METHODS: Data from patients with one of 8 typical conditions considered to be pediatric emergencies who presented at 3 hospitals close to central Tokyo were collated retrospectively from accident and emergency (AE) department records for 2020 and compared with data for 3 years prior to 2020. RESULTS: All subjects had similar demographic profiles. The total number of pediatric AE attendances from 2017 to 2020 was 2880 (2017: n = 600, 2018: n = 736, 2019: n = 817, and 2020: n = 727). Annual attendances were similar. Of the 8 conditions, there were significantly less cases of intussusception in 2020 than previously (23/727; 3.1% versus 132/2153; 6.1%) p < 0.01 and the number of emergency surgical interventions for intussusception was also significantly less in 2020 (0/23; 0% versus 13/132; 9.8%) p < 0.01. CONCLUSION: The implementation of preventative measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 would appear to have influenced the etiopathogenesis of intussusception enough to significantly decrease its overall incidence and the requirement for emergency surgical intervention.","Seo, Shogo; Suda, Kazuto; Kato, Haruki; Abe, Eri; Kosaka, Seitaro; Fujiwara, Kentaro; Ochi, Takanori; Koga, Hiroyuki; Urao, Masahiko; Okazaki, Tadaharu; Lane, Geoffrey J.; Yamataka, Atsuyuki",Pediatr Surg Int,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-021-04992-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471948/,132

E2 has complex and mannose-rich-type oligosaccharide side-chains, which are attached by N-glycosidic linkages to the polypeptide. Glycosylation of E2 is initiated at the co-translational level, and it is inhibited by tunicamycin, 2-deoxy-glucose, and 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose. Thus, E2 belongs to a glycoprotein type found in many other enveloped viruses. E1, in contrast, represents a different class of glycoprotein. The following observations indicate that its carbohydrate side-chains have 0-glycosidic linkage. (1) The constituent sugars of E1 are N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, and neuraminic acid; mannose and fucose are absent. (2) The side-chains can be removed by β-elimination. (3) Glycosylation of E1 is not sensitive to the compounds interfering with N-glycosylation. E1 is the first viral glycoprotein analyzed that contains only 0-glycosidic linkages. Coronaviruses are therefore a suitable model system to study biosynthesis and processing of this type of glycoprotein.","Niemann, H.; Klenk, H.-D.",Journal of Molecular Biology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0022283681904630; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022283681904630; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7343686/,132

However, due to the lack of COVID-19 data, there is still no specific drug repositioning targeting the COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a framework for COVID-19 drug repositioning.

659250,The Association of CT-measured Cardiac Indices with Lung Involvement and Clinical Outcome in Patients with COVID-19,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 (COVID) may develop acute respiratory distress syndrome with or without sepsis, coagulopathy and visceral damage. While chest CT scans are routinely performed in the initial assessment of patients with severe pulmonary forms, thymus involvement and reactivation have not been investigated so far. METHODS: In this observational study, we systematically scored the enlargement of the thymus and the lung involvement, using CT scans, in all adult patients admitted to the ICU for COVID or any other cause (control group) at one centre between March and April 2020. Initial biological investigations included nasal detection of SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In a subgroup of 24 patients with different degrees of pulmonary involvement and thymus hypertrophy, plasma cytokine concentrations were measured and the export of mature T cells from the thymus was estimated simultaneously by PCR quantification of T cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients were studied: 50 COVID patients and 37 controls. Non-atrophic or enlarged thymus was more commonly observed in COVID patients than in controls (66% vs. 24%, p < 0.0001). Thymus enlargement in COVID patients was associated with more extensive lung injury score on CT scans (4 [3–5] vs. 2 [1.5–4], p = 0.01), but a lower mortality rate (8.6% vs. 41.2%, p < 0.001). Other factors associated with mortality were age, lymphopaenia, high CRP and co-morbidities. COVID patients had higher concentrations of IL-7 (6.00 [3.72–9.25] vs. 2.17 [1.76–4.4] pg/mL; p = 0.04) and higher thymic production of new lymphocytes (sj/βTREC ratio = 2.88 [1.98–4.51] vs. 0.23 [0.15–0.60]; p = 0.004). Thymic production was also correlated with the CT scan thymic score (r = 0.38, p = 0.03) and inversely correlated with the number of lymphocytes (r = 0.56, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: In COVID patients, thymus enlargement was frequent and associated with increased T lymphocyte production, which appears to be a beneficial adaptation to virus-induced lymphopaenia. The lack of thymic activity/reactivation in older SARS-CoV-2 infected patients could contribute to a worse prognosis.

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess infection complications after lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell therapy. Infections were commonly detected, but manageable in most cases. Fast and appropriate identification as well as treatment were critical, especially in this very vulnerable patient group. Effective strategies to prevent infections as well as adequate medical management also include standardized prophylaxis and additional supportive therapy. ABSTRACT: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has proven to be very effective in patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). However, infections—related either due to lymphodepletion or the CAR-T cell therapy itself—can result in severe and potentially life-threatening complications, while side effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS) might complicate differential diagnosis. Sixty-seven dosings of CAR-T cells in sixty adult patients with NHL (85%) and ALL (15%) receiving CAR-T cell therapy were assessed for infectious complications. Almost two-thirds of patients (61%) developed fever following lymphodepletion and CAR-T cell dosing. Microbiological or radiological findings were observed in 25% of all cases (bacterial 12%, viral 5%, fungal 8%). Inpatient infections were associated with more lines of therapy and more severe CRS. However, overall serious complications were rare after CAR-T therapy, with one patient dying of infection. Pathogen detection after inpatient stay was infrequent and mostly occurred in the first 90 days after dosing. Infections in CAR-T cell treated patents are common. Fast and suitable identification and treatment are crucial in these heavily pretreated and immunocompromised patients. In most cases infectious complications are manageable. Nonetheless, standardized anti-infective prophylaxis and supportive therapy are mandatory to reduce morbidity and mortality in CAR-T cell therapy.","Korell, Felix; Schubert, Maria-Luisa; Sauer, Tim; Schmitt, Anita; Derigs, Patrick; Weber, Tim Frederik; Schnitzler, Paul; Müller-Tidow, Carsten; Dreger, Peter; Schmitt, Michael",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13071684; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33918340/,132

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected >160 million people around the world. Hypertension (HT), chronic heart disease (CHD), and diabetes mellitus (DM) increase susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Aims. We designed this retrospective study to assess the gender differences in hypertensive diabetic SARS-CoV-2 patients. We reported data, by gender differences, on the inflammatory status, on the hospital stays, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, Rx and CT report, and therapy. Methods. We enrolled 1014 patients with confirmed COVID-19 admitted into different Hospitals of Campania from 26 March to 30 June, 2020. All patients were allocated into two groups: diabetic-hypertensive group (DM-HT group) that includes 556 patients affected by diabetes mellitus and arterial hypertension and the non-diabetic- non-hypertensive group (non-DM, non-HT group) comprising 458 patients. The clinical outcomes (i.e., discharges, mortality, length of stay, therapy, and admission to intensive care) were monitored up to June 30, 2020. Results. We described, in the DM-HT group, higher proportion of cardiopathy ischemic (CHD) (47.5% vs. 14.8%, respectively; p < 0.0001) and lung diseases in females compared to male subjects (34.8% vs. 18.5%, respectively; p < 0.0001). In male subjects, we observed higher proportion of kidney diseases (CKD) (11% vs. 0.01%, respectively; p < 0.0001), a higher hospital stay compared to female subjects (22 days vs. 17 days, respectively, p < 0.0001), a higher admission in ICU (66.9% vs. 12.8%, respectively, p < 0.0001), and higher death rate (17.3% vs. 10.7%, respectively, p < 0.0001).

Pre-existing co-morbidities, correlating to incidence of severe COVID-19, are associated with chronic airway neutrophilia and examination of COVID-19 lung tissue revealed a series of epithelial pathologies associated with infiltration and activation of neutrophils. To determine the impact of neutrophil-epithelial interactions on the infectivity and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we developed a co-culture model of airway neutrophilia. We discovered that SARS-CoV-2 infection of the airway epithelium alone does not result in a notable release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, however in the presence of neutrophils, the inflammatory response is both polarized and significantly augmented, epithelial barrier integrity in impaired and viral load of the airway epithelium increased. This study reveals a key role for neutrophil-epithelial interactions in determining inflammation, infectivity, and outcomes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Calvert, BA; Quiroz, EJ; Lorenzana, Z; Doan, N; Kim, S; Senger, CN; Wallace, WD; Salomon, MP; Henley, JE; Ryan, AL",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.09.455472; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34401877/,132

Malaysia is not spared from this pandemic as all universities were forced to close and initiate online learning with the implementation of Movement Control Order since mid-March 2020.The abrupt shift from conventional medical education to fully virtual learning definitely deserves a reflection on how it affects the learning motivation among medical students. Hence, this is the first study that compares the effect of digital learning on learning motivation among medical students in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic period. A modified Students Motivation towards Science Learning (SMTSL) was used to assess the learning motivation of UKM medical students throughout Year 1-5. The number of students that use digital learning during COVID-19 is significantly higher compared to before COVID-19 (p<0.05). However, there is no significant difference (p=0.872) in learning motivation among medical students before and during COVID-19 crisis. Higher frequency in digital learning usage frequency does not exert a great impact on learning motivation. Reflections from each participant were collated to justify the current situation. This could be due to motivation coming from the very choice to pursue medicine as a doctor, which is mainly influenced by intrinsic motivation, and ability to adapt in difficult situations. Thus, medical educators should be creative in enhancing extrinsic motivation by making use of digital learning as a platform so that medical students are able to independently fish for information in the vast pool of digital information and apply in actual medical practice in the future for life-long learning.","Ismail, N.

In this Review, we analyse how viruses from vastly different families converge on this unique intracellular organelle during infection, co-opting some of the endogenous functions of the ER to promote distinct steps of the viral life cycle from entry and replication to assembly and egress. The ER can act as the common denominator during infection for diverse virus families, thereby providing a shared principle that underlies the apparent complexity of relationships between viruses and host cells. As a plethora of information illuminating the molecular and cellular basis of virus–ER interactions has become available, these insights may lead to the development of crucial therapeutic agents.","Ravindran, Madhu Sudhan; Bagchi, Parikshit; Cunningham, Corey Nathaniel; Tsai, Billy",Nature Reviews Microbiology,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5272919?pdf=render; https://doi.org/10.1038/nrmicro.2016.60; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27265768/,132

In fact, the recognition of aPL in patients with infections has been described in parallel to the understating of the syndrome. Since the first description of aPL-positive tests in three patients with COVID-19 diagnosed in January 2020 in Wuhan, China, a large number of studies took part in the ongoing debate on SARS-2-Cov 2 induced coagulopathy, and many following reports speculated a potential role for aPL. In order to get further insights on the effective role of detectable aPL in the pro-thrombotic status observed in COVID-19 patients, we performed an observational age-sex controlled study to compare the aPL profile of hospitalized patients with COVID with those observed in a) patients with thrombotic APS and b) patients with cultural/serologically-proved infections. Our data showed positive aPL testing in about half of the patients (53%) with COVID-19 and patients with other viral/bacterial infections (49%). However, aPL profile was different when comparing patients with overt APS and patients with aPL detected in the contest of infections. Caution is therefore required in the interpretation and generalization of the role of aPL s in the management of patients with COVID-19. Before introducing aPL testing as a part of the routine testing in patients with COVID-19, larger well-designed clinical studies are required.

Although vaccines against the virus are under development, the antigen epitopes on the virus and their immunogenicity are poorly understood. Here, we simulated the three-dimensional structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins with high performance computer, predicted the B cell epitopes on spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of SARS-CoV-2 using structure-based approaches, and then validated the epitope immunogenicity by immunizing mice. Almost all 33 predicted epitopes effectively induced antibody production, six of which were immunodominant epitopes in patients identified via the binding of epitopes with the sera from domestic and imported COVID-19 patients, and 23 were conserved within SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus RaTG13. We also found that the immunodominant epitopes of domestic SARS-CoV-2 were different from that of the imported, which may be caused by the mutations on S (G614D) and N proteins. Importantly, we validated that eight epitopes on S protein elicited neutralizing antibodies that blocked the cell entry of both D614 and G614 pseudo-virus of SARS-CoV-2, three and nine epitopes induced D614 or G614 neutralizing antibodies, respectively.

OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between low vitamin D status and COVID-19. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted with PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to September 25, 2020. The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied to estimate pooled results. Random - or fixed-effect models based on heterogeneity were used for the meta-analysis. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests were used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: A total of ten articles with 361,934 participants were selected for meta-analysis. Overall, the pooled OR in the fixed-effect model showed that vitamin D deficiency or insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.00–2.05). In addition, COVID-19-positive individuals had lower vitamin D levels than COVID-19-negative individuals (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI = -0.52 to -0.21). Significant heterogeneity existed in both endpoints. Funnel plots and Egger regression tests revealed significant publication bias.

In this study, state-wise COVID-19 data, meteorological parameters and air quality index (AQI) were collected from March 13 to April 30, 2020, which encompass three movement control order (MCO) periods in the country. Overall, total infected cases were observed to be higher in MCO phase 1 and 2 and significantly reduced in MCO phase 3. Due to the variation in the spatial interval of population density and individual immunity, the relationship of these parameters to pandemic spread could not be achieved. The study infers that temperature (T) between 23 and 25 °C and relative humidity (RH) (70–80%) triggered the pandemic spread by increase in the infected cases in northern and central Peninsular Malaysia. Selangor, WP Kuala Lumpur and WP Putrajaya show significantly high infected cases and a definite trend was not observed with respect to a particular meteorological factor. It is identified that high precipitation (PPT), RH and good air quality have reduced the spread in East Malaysia. A negative correlation of T and AQI and positive correlation of RH with total infected cases were found during MCO phase 3. Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that T, RH, PPT, dew point (DP) and AQI are the main controlling factors for the spread across the country apart from social distancing. Vulnerability zones were identified based on the spatial analysis of T, RH, PPT and AQI with reference to total infected cases. Based on time series analysis, it was determined that higher RH and T in Peninsular Malaysia and high amount of PPT, RH and good air quality in East Malaysia have controlled the spreading during MCO phase 3. The predominance of D614 mutant was observed prior to March and decreases at the end of March, coinciding with the fluctuation of meteorological factors and air quality. The outcome of this study gives a general awareness to the public on COVID-19 and the influence of meteorological factors.

With this, several studies have employed pooled RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 as this could potentially conserve laboratory resources while has the capacity to test several individuals. However, this was recommended to firstly validate the method as different laboratory reagents and equipment vary with its diagnostic performance. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance of pooled SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabbed samples using the RT-PCR technique. Methods: A records review of two-staged pooled RT-PCR testing data from August 10, 26, 30, and September 5, 2020, was utilized from CHDNM TB Regional Center. For the first stage, using known samples, a total of 30 pools were made for each of the pooling sizes, 5- and 10-pooled, on both pooling phase, pre-and post-RNA extraction. One positive individual was used to represent each of the Cycle threshold values given (<24, 25-28, 29-32, 33-36, and 37-40) while the rest of the samples were negative. For the second stage, 54 pools of five from 270 random unknown samples were used to validate the results. Target gene performance of N gene and RdRp was also determined. Key Results: Results show that 5-pooled sample has higher sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI) 88.97-100), 66.95% (95% CI, 60.75-72.6), 28.18% (95% CI, 20.62-37.22), and 100% (95% CI, 97.66-100) compared to 10-pooled sample that has 87.1% (95% CI, 71.15-94.87), 56.9% (50.57-63.02), 20.77% (95% CI, 14.68-28.53) and 97.14% (95% CI, 92.88-98.88). Further, these Ct values were only from the N gene, emphasizing its higher diagnostic performance as well to detect SARS-CoV-2 compared to RdRp as only a few samples were detected, thus, no analysis was made. Conclusion: This study found out that a 5-pooled sample has better diagnostic performance compared to 10-pooled samples. Specifically, all positive individual samples were detected in 5-pooled samples in the pre-RNA extraction phase which these results are evident and consistent on both known and unknown samples.

We evaluated EMS responses in an EMS region when it experienced low to moderate burden of COVID-19 disease to assess overall trends, response and management characteristics, and non-transport rates. Our goal is to inform current and future pandemic response in similar regions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of prehospital EMS responses from 22 urban, suburban, and rural EMS agencies in Western Pennsylvania. To account for seasonal variation, we compared demographic, response, and management characteristics for the 2-month period of March 15 to May 15, 2020 with the corresponding 2-month periods in 2016–2019. We then tested for an association between study period (pandemic vs historical control) and incidence of non-transport in unadjusted and adjusted regression. Finally, we described the continuous trends in responses and non-transports that occurred during the year before and initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2020. RESULTS: Among 103,607 EMS responses in the 2-month comparative periods of March 15 to May 15, 2016–2020, we found a 26.5% [95% CI 26.9%, 27.1%] decrease in responses in 2020 compared to the same months from the four prior years. There was a small increase in respiratory cases (0.6% [95%CI 0.1%, 1.1%]) and greater frequency of abnormal vital signs suggesting a sicker patient cohort. There was a relative increase (46.6%) in non-transports between periods. The pandemic period was independently associated with an increase in non-transport (adjusted OR 1.68; 95%CI 1.59, 1.78). Among 177,194 EMS responses occurring in the year before and during the early period of the pandemic, between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2020, we identified a 31% decrease in responses and a 48% relative increase in non-transports for April 2020 compared to the previous year's monthly averages. CONCLUSION: Despite a low to moderate burden of infection during the initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic, we found a decline in overall EMS response volumes and an increase in the rate of non-transports independent of patient demographics and other response characteristics.","Satty, Timothy; Ramgopal, Sriram; Elmer, Jonathan; Mosesso, Vincent N.; Martin-Gill, Christian",Am J Emerg Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.12.078; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675720312067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429185/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0735675720312067,132
668763,Aspirin Is Related to Worse Clinical Outcomes of COVID-19,2021-09-04,"Whether virulent human pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) are effectively transmitted by aerosols remains contentious. Transmission modes of the novel coronavirus have become a hot topic of research with the importance of airborne transmission controversial due to the many factors that can influence virus transmission. Airborne transmission is an accepted potential route for the spread of some viral infections (measles, chickenpox); however, aerosol features and infectious inoculum vary from one respiratory virus to another. Infectious virus-laden aerosols can be produced by natural human respiratory activities, and their features are vital determinants for virus carriage and transmission. Physicochemical characteristics of infectious respiratory aerosols can influence the efficiency of virus transmission by droplets. This critical review identifies studies reporting instances of infected patients producing airborne human pathogenic coronaviruses, and evidence for the role of physical/chemical characteristics of human-generated droplets in altering embedded viruses’ viability. We also review studies evaluating these viruses in the air, field studies and available evidence about seasonality patterns. Ultimately the literature suggests that a proportion of virulent human coronaviruses can plausibly be transmitted via the air, even though this might vary in different conditions. Evidence exists for respirable-sized airborne droplet nuclei containing viral RNA, although this does not necessarily imply that the virus is transmittable, capable of replicating in a recipient host, or that inoculum is sufficient to initiate infection. However, evidence suggests that coronaviruses can survive in simulated droplet nuclei for a significant time (>24 h). Nevertheless, laboratory nebulized virus-laden aerosols might not accurately model the complexity of human carrier aerosols in studying airborne viral transport. In summary, there is disagreement on whether wild coronaviruses can be transmitted via an airborne path and display seasonal patterns. Further studies are therefore required to provide supporting evidence for the role of airborne transmission and assumed mechanisms underlying seasonality.","Niazi, Sadegh; Groth, Robert; Spann, Kirsten; Johnson, Graham R.",Environ Pollut,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2020.115767; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0269749120364563; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749120364563?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243541/,132

668946,A review of venous thromboembolism in COVID‐19: A clinical perspective,2021-02-05,"Cephalosporins are the last effective class of antibiotics to treat gonorrhea infections. In Illinois, gonorrhea cases have increased by 70.9% from 2015 to 2019. Because of the concern of antimicrobial resistance and the increasing number of cases, the Illinois Department of Public Health Sexually Transmitted Diseases Section established a procedure to identify possible gonorrhea treatment failure cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A procedure was developed that identifies patients who have had 2 gonorrhea cases in the last 60 days, and the first case was treated with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention–recommended treatment. Interview records were faxed to the local health department (LHD) where the patient resides. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze interview record data. A process evaluation was conducted using telephone interviews with LHDs to obtain qualitative feedback on the procedure. RESULTS: A total of 310 interview records were sent for investigation in 2018 and 2019 with 263 returned. Of those returned, 140 identified reexposure, 104 were unable to be located, 12 refused to be interviewed, 6 had treatment reported incorrectly, and 1 had a possible treatment failure. From telephone interviews with 6 LHDs, 1 question was removed and 2 questions were added to the interview record. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea could occur in Illinois at any time. Monitoring for antibiotic-resistant gonorrhea cases is necessary as gonorrhea morbidity continues to increase. This procedure may prove to be a model for other states.","Smith, Marguerite; Choat, Lesli; McKinney-Colman, Lynette; Brikshavana, Danucha",Sex Transm Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967239/; https://doi.org/10.1097/olq.0000000000001453,132

669207,The clinical characteristics and mortal causes analysis of COVID-19 death patients,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: The pandemic of COVID-19 has disrupted the clinical pathway for patients with suspected upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC). This aims to investigate the optimal management of UTUC during the pandemic by determining 1) Whether a three-month delay of RNU leads to worsened overall survival, 2) Whether radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) can be performed without prior diagnostic ureteroscopy (URS). METHODS: Consecutive patients with RNU performed for suspected UTUC in four hospitals in Hong Kong and Taiwan were included. Patients with histologically proven UTUC and with RNU performed within one year were dichotomized into early (≤3 months) and delayed (>3 months) RNU groups. Diagnostic performances of predictive models based on pre-URS factors (gross haematuria, suspicious or malignant urine cytology, and filling defect or contrast-enhancing mass on computed tomography), with or without URS, were analysed using receiver operating characteristics and area under curve (AUC). Overall survival was analysed using Kaplan-Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2019, 665 patients underwent RNU, and 491 of them had prior diagnostic URS. The early RNU group had a better overall survival (P = 0.015). Early RNU was associated with a better overall survival upon multivariate analysis (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.03–2.33, P = 0.035). Large tumour size, multi-focal tumour, T2 or above disease, and positive nodal status were associated with a poorer overall survival. A combination of any 2 out of the 3 pre-URS factors achieved a positive predictive value of 99.5 to 100%. Presence of all 3 pre-URS factors achieved an AUC of 0.851 with URS, and AUC of 0.809 without URS. CONCLUSIONS: A delay of RNU for over 3 months was associated with poorer overall survival and has to be avoided despite the current COVID-19. We can also consider direct RNU based on clinical factors alone. This also avoids URS hospitalization and expedites the clinical pathway of UTUC.","Lee, Hsiang-Ying; Chan, Erica On-Ting; Li, Ching-Chia; Leung, David; Li, Wei-Ming; Yeh, Hsin-Chih; Chiu, Peter Ka-Fung; Ke, Hung-Lung; Yee, Chi-Hang; Wong, Joseph Hon-Ming; Ng, Chi-Fai; Teoh, Jeremy Yuen-Chun; Wu, Wen-Jeng",Urol Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34332847/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.urolonc.2021.06.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1078143921002660; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1078143921002660,132

Solid waste disposed of in landfill sites provides nutrients for the proliferation of pathogenic microbes which are aerosolized into the atmosphere due to the local meteorology and various waste disposal activities. Bioaerosols released from landfill sites can create health issues for employees and adjoining public. The present study offers an overview of the microbial diversity reported in the air samples collected from various landfill sites worldwide. This paper also discusses other aspects, including effect of meteorological conditions on the bioaerosol concentrations, sampling techniques, bioaerosol exposure and potential health impacts. Analysis of literature concluded that landfill air is dominated by microbial dust or various pathogenic microbes like Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Aspergillus fumigatus. The bioaerosols present in the landfill environment are of respirable sizes and can penetrate deep into lower respiratory systems and trigger respiratory symptoms and chronic pulmonary diseases. Most studies reported higher bioaerosol concentrations in spring and summer as higher temperature and relative humidity provide a favourable environment for survival and multiplication of microbes. Landfill workers involved in solid waste disposal activities are at the highest risk of exposure to these bioaerosols due to their proximity to solid waste and as they practise minimum personal safety and hygiene measures during working hours. Workers are recommended to use personal protective equipment and practise hygiene to reduce the impact of occupational exposure to bioaerosols.","Nair, Abhilash T.",Aerobiologia (Bologna),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33558785/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10453-021-09693-9,132

DESIGN: Multicentre retrospective cohort study. SETTING: 32 acute care hospitals in the state of Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: Patients discharged (16 March–11 May 2020) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were identified. Trained abstractors collected demographic information on all patients and detailed clinical data on a subset of COVID-19-positive patients. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Patient characteristics, treatment and outcomes including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mortality and venous thromboembolism within and across hospitals. RESULTS: Demographic-only data from 1593 COVID-19-positive and 1259 persons under investigation discharges were collected. Among 1024 cases with detailed data, the median age was 63 years; median body mass index was 30.6; and 51.4% were black. Cough, fever and shortness of breath were the top symptoms. 37.2% reported a known COVID-19 contact; 7.0% were healthcare workers; and 16.1% presented from congregated living facilities. During hospitalisation, 232 (22.7%) patients were treated in an intensive care unit (ICU); 558 (54.9%) in a ‘cohorted’ unit; 161 (15.7%) received mechanical ventilation; and 90 (8.8%) received high-flow nasal cannula. ICU patients more often received hydroxychloroquine (66% vs 46%), corticosteroids (34% vs 18%) and antibiotic therapy (92% vs 71%) than general ward patients (p<0.05 for all). Overall, 219 (21.4%) patients died, with in-hospital mortality ranging from 7.9% to 45.7% across hospitals. 73% received at least one COVID-19-specific treatment, ranging from 32% to 96% across sites. Across 14 hospitals, the proportion of patients admitted directly to an ICU ranged from 0% to 43.8%; mechanical ventilation on admission from 0% to 12.8%; mortality from 7.9% to 45.7%. Use of at least one COVID-19-specific therapy varied from 32% to 96.3% across sites.

Methods We searched Web of Science and Google Scholar until 24th December 2020 for relevant articles and extracted data on methodology and results. Results The vast majority of data come from healthcare settings, with typically around 6 % of samples having detectable concentrations of SARS-CoV-2 RNA and almost none of the samples collected had viable virus. There were a wide variety of methods used to measure airborne virus, although surface sampling was generally undertaken using nylon flocked swabs. Overall, the quality of the measurements was poor. Only a small number of studies reported the airborne concentration of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA, mostly just reporting the detectable concentration values without reference to the detection limit. Imputing the geometric mean air concentration assuming the limit of detection was the lowest reported value, suggests typical concentrations in health care settings may be around 0.01 SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA copies/m3. Data on surface virus loading per unit area were mostly unavailable. Conclusion The reliability of the reported data is uncertain. The methods used for measuring SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses in work environments should be standardised to facilitate more consistent interpretation of contamination and to help reliably estimate worker exposure.","Cherrie, J.; Cherrie, M.; Davis, A.; Holmes, D.; Semple, S.; Steinle, S.; MacDonald, E.; Moore, G.; Loh, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.25.21250233v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.25.21250233,132

This study aims to evaluate the presence of cardiac and liver alterations in patients with post-acute COVID-19 syndrome using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and liver elastography (LE). (2) Methods: A total of 97 subjects recovering from COVID-19, attending the hospital’s specialized outpatient clinic for persisting symptoms at 3 to 11 weeks after the acute illness, were included in this study. They all had a basal COVID-19 assessment, and subsequently, a clinical evaluation, laboratory tests, TTE, and LE. (3) Results: considering the presence of pulmonary injury during COVID-19, patients were divided into two groups. Although none of them had altered systolic function, we evidenced pulmonary hypertension, diastolic dysfunction, increased liver stiffness, viscosity, and steatosis in around one-third of the patients, with significantly higher values in subjects with pulmonary injury compared to those without. (4) Conclusion: persisting symptoms characterizing the post-acute COVID-19 syndrome could be explained by residual cardiac and hepatic lesions, which were worse in more severe COVID-19 forms. These patients may be at risk of developing liver fibrosis and cardiac alterations and should be investigated in the first 12 weeks after the onset of the infection.","Bende, Felix; Tudoran, Cristina; Sporea, Ioan; Fofiu, Renata; Bâldea, Victor; Cotrău, Radu; Popescu, Alina; Sirli, Roxana; Ungureanu, Bogdan Silviu; Tudoran, Mariana",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10112507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204032/,132

Here, we identified tylophorine compounds, including naturally occurring and synthetic phenanthroindolizidines and phenanthroquinolizidines, as potent in vitro inhibitors of enteropathogenic coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). The potent compounds showed 50% maximal effective concentration (EC(50)) values ranging from 8 to 1468 nM as determined by immunofluorescent assay of the expression of TGEV N and S proteins and by real time-quantitative PCR analysis of viral yields. Furthermore, the potent tylophorine compounds exerted profound anti-TGEV replication activity and thereby blocked the TGEV-induced apoptosis and subsequent cytopathic effect in ST cells. Analysis of the structure–activity relations indicated that the most active tylophorine analogues were compounds with a hydroxyl group at the C14 position of the indolizidine moiety or at the C3 position of the phenanthrene moiety and that the quinolizidine counterparts were more potent than indolizidines. In addition, tylophorine compounds strongly reduced cytopathic effect in Vero 76 cells induced by human severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV), with EC(50) values ranging from less than 5 to 340 nM. Moreover, a pharmacokinetic study demonstrated high and comparable oral bioavailabilities of 7-methoxycryptopleurine (52.7%) and the naturally occurring tylophorine (65.7%) in rats. Thus, our results suggest that tylophorine compounds are novel and potent anti-coronavirus agents that may be developed into therapeutic agents for treating TGEV or SARS CoV infection.","Yang, Cheng-Wei; Lee, Yue-Zhi; Kang, Iou-Jiun; Barnard, Dale L.; Jan, Jia-Tsrong; Lin, Du; Huang, Chun-Wei; Yeh, Teng-Kuang; Chao, Yu-Sheng; Lee, Shiow-Ju",Antiviral Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2010.08.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20727913/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354210006960; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354210006960,132

It is not intended as an in-depth review of the thinking about reference conditions, but as an opinion paper, with the goal of stimulating discussions about wetland restoration approaches, particularly in regions around the world with highly altered landscapes where restoration of wetlands has been gaining traction only relatively recently. We first explain why the thinking on reference wetlands is biased towards North America, where large areas exist with wetlands that are relatively unimpacted by anthropogenic activities. We then argue that in regions with few unimpaired wetlands those of fair condition may still be good enough to be used as reference wetlands, and that restored and created wetlands should be considered as well.","Otte, Marinus L.; Fang, Wei-Ta; Jiang, Ming",Wetlands (Wilmington),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758457/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13157-021-01439-0,132

Our objective was to identify prevalence of hyperglycemia in COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes and quantify its association with COVID-19 disease course. Research Design and Methods: In this observational cohort study, all consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to John H Stroger Jr. Hospital, Chicago, IL from March 15, 2020 to May 15, 2020 were included. The primary outcome was hospital mortality and the main predictor was hyperglycemia (any blood glucose [≥]7.78 mmol/L during hospitalization). Results: Of 403 COVID-19 patients studied, 228 (57%) developed hyperglycemia. Of these, 83 (21%) had hyperglycemia without diabetes. A total of 51 (12.7%) patients died. Compared to the reference group no-diabetes/no-hyperglycemia patients the no-diabetes/hyperglycemia patients showed higher mortality (1.8% versus 20.5%, adjusted odds ratio 21.94 (95% confidence interval 4.04-119.0), p < 0.001); improved prediction of death (p=0.0162) and faster progression to death (p=0.0051). Hyperglycemia within the first 24 and 48 hours was also significantly associated with mortality (odds ratio 2.15 and 3.31, respectively). Further, compared to the same reference group, no-diabetes/hyperglycemia patients had higher risk of ICU admission (p<0.001), mechanical ventilation (p<0.001) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (p<0.001) and a longer hospital stay in survivors (p<0.001).

Immunization of mice with VSV-eGFP-SARSCoV-2 elicits high titers of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection and target the receptor binding domain that engages human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2). Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice expressing human ACE2 and immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung indicating protection against pneumonia.

However, backyard farming does not appear to be a promising strategy to achieve the poverty reduction until the production level is increased. The major constraint in increasing the production in backyard birds is microbial infection due to lack of biosecurity knowledge among the farmers. The mitigation of the microbial infection depends on the detection of the infection route and its prevention. The source of microbial infection (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) and their dissemination through the eggs in backyard flocks kept in different agroclimatic zones of West Bengal, a major egg producing state in India, was identified.

This demand has led to the development of numerous low-cost ventilation devices, but there has been less emphasis on training health professionals to use these new devices safely. The aim of this technical report is twofold: first, to describe the design and manufacturing process of the automated inflating resuscitator (AIR), a 3D-printed ventilator training device which operates on the principle of pushing a bag valve mask; second, to present a simulation scenario that can be used for training health professionals how to use this and similar, low-cost, 3D-printed ventilators in the context of ventilator shortages caused by COVID-19. To this end, the AIR was designed in an expedient manner in accordance with basic functionality established by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (United Kingdom) for provisional clinical use in light of COVID-19.","Gino, Bruno; Wang, Zhujiang; d'Entremont, Philip; Renouf, Tia S; Dubrowski, Adam",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789074/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.9134,132

Many human viral vaccines are live, attenuated forms of viruses that elicit humoral and cellular immunity. Here, we describe a cold-adapted live-attenuated vaccine (SARS-CoV-2/human/Korea/CNUHV03-CA22 °C/2020) developed by gradually adapting the growth of SARS-CoV-2 from 37 °C to 22 °C in Vero cells. This vaccine can be potentially administered to humans as a nasal spray. Its single dose strongly induced neutralising antibodies (titre > 640), cellular immunity, and mucosal IgA antibodies in intranasally immunised K18-hACE2 mice, which are very susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infections. The one-dose vaccinated mice were completely protected from SARS-CoV-2 infection and did not show body weight loss, death, or the presence of virus in tissues, such as the nasal turbinates, brain, lungs, and kidneys. These results demonstrate that the cold-adapted live attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine we have developed may be a candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for humans.","Seo, Sang Heui; Jang, Yunyueng",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33022950/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8040584,132

The use of multifunctional coatings on orthopedic implants has been proposed as an effective way to overcome a range of difficulties. Here, a multifunctional (TA@HA/Lys)(n) coating composed of tannic acid (TA), hydroxyapatite (HA), and lysozyme (Lys) was fabricated in a layer-by-layer (LBL) manner, where TA deposited onto HA firmly stuck Lys and HA together. The deposition of TA onto HA, the growth of (TA@HA/Lys)(n), and multiple related biofunctionalities were thoroughly investigated. Our data demonstrated that such a hybrid coating displayed antibacterial and antioxidant effects, and also facilitated the rapid attachment of cells [both mouse embryo osteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1) and dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs)] in the early stage and their proliferation over a long period. This accelerated osteogenesis in vitro and promoted bone formation in vivo. We believe that our findings and the developed strategy here could pave the way for multifunctional coatings not only on orthopedic implants, but also for additional applications in catalysts, sensors, tissue engineering, etc.","Wang, Guofeng; Zhu, Yaxin; Zan, Xingjie; Li, Meng",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350164/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.718255,132

Novel and improved preventative strategies with the potential to benefit pregnant women and their infants are needed, with maternal and neonatal immunization representing effective approaches. Experts from immunology, vaccinology, infectious diseases, clinicians, industry, public health, and vaccine-related social sciences convened at the 5th International Neonatal and Maternal Immunization Symposium (INMIS) in Vancouver, Canada, from 15 to 17 September 2019. We critically evaluated the lessons learned from recent clinical studies, presented cutting-edge scientific progress in maternal and neonatal immunology and vaccine development, and discussed maternal and neonatal immunization in the broader context of infectious disease epidemiology and public health. Focusing on practical aspects of research and implementation, we also discussed the safety, awareness, and perception of maternal immunization as an existing strategy to address the need to improve maternal and neonatal health worldwide. The symposium provided a comprehensive scientific and practical primer as well as an update for all those with an interest in maternal and neonatal infection, immunity, and vaccination.

The incidence and outcomes of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and its impact on routine management for patients with pulmonary vascular disease is currently unknown. Objectives: To assess the cumulative incidence and outcomes of recognized COVID-19 for patients with PAH/CTEPH followed at accredited pulmonary hypertension centers, and to evaluate the pandemic’s impact on clinic operations at these centers. Methods: A survey was e-mailed to program directors of centers accredited by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association. Descriptive analyses and linear regression were used to analyze results. Results: Seventy-seven center directors were successfully e-mailed a survey, and 58 responded (75%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in individuals with PAH/CTEPH was 2.9 cases per 1,000 patients, similar to the general U.S. population. In patients with PAH/CTEPH for whom COVID-19 was recognized, 30% were hospitalized and 12% died. These outcomes appear worse than the general population. A large impact on clinic operations was observed including fewer clinic visits and substantially increased use of telehealth. A majority of centers curtailed diagnostic testing and a minority limited new starts of medical therapy. Most centers did not use experimental therapies in patients with PAH/CTEPH diagnosed with COVID-19. Conclusions: The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 recognized in patients with PAH/CTEPH appears similar to the broader population, although outcomes may be worse. Although the total number of patients with PAH/CTEPH recognized to have COVID-19 was small, the impact of COVID-19 on broader clinic operations, testing, and treatment was substantial.","Lee, Joshua D.; Burger, Charles D.; Delossantos, Genecelle B.; Grinnan, Daniel; Ralph, David D.; Rayner, Sam G.; Ryan, John J.; Safdar, Zeenat; Ventetuolo, Corey E.; Zamanian, Roham T.; Leary, Peter J.",Ann Am Thorac Soc,https://doi.org/10.1513/annalsats.202005-521oc; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726561/,132

But substantial numbers of severe episodes occur in older patients. There is a lack of data about COVID-19 in older adults. The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical characteristics of older adult patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Retrospective study of older patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from February 1 st to March 31 st, 2020 was conducted in the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongjing Hospital in Wuhan, China. According to the degree of severity of COVID-19 during hospitalization, 312 older patients were divided into non-severe and severe cases. RESULTS: the mean age of the patients was 69.2 ± 7.3 years, and 47.4% of patients had exposure history. 77.2% of patients had a co-morbidity, with hypertension being the most common(57.1%), followed by diabetes(38.8%) and cardiovascular disease(29.8%). Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of severe COVID-19 associated with age(OR 1.59, 95%CI 1.13-2.08), SOFA score(OR 5.89, 95%CI 3.48-7.96), APACHEⅡ score(OR 3.13, 95%CI 1.85-5.62), platelet count＜125 × 10(9)/L(OR 2.36, 95%CI 1.03-4.14), d-dimer(OR 4.37, 95%CI 2.58-7.16), creatinine＞133 μmol/L(OR 1.85, 95%CI 1.12-3.04), interleukin-6(OR 4.32, 95%CI 2.07-7.13), and lung consolidation(OR 1.94, 95%CI 1.45-4.27) on admission. The most common complication was acute respiratory distress syndrome(35.6%), followed by acute cardiac injury(33.0%) and coagulation disorders(30.8%). 91.7% of patients were prescribed antiviral therapy, followed by immune globulin(52.9%) and systemic glucocorticoids(43.6%). 21.8% of patients received invasive ventilation, 1.92% for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The overall mortality was 6.73%, and mortality of severe patients was 17.1%, which was higher than non-severe patients(0.962%).

Higher levels of serum SP-D have been reported in the patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following treatment with rfhSP-D (10 µg/ml). These results highlight the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection and merit pre-clinical studies in animal models.","Hsieh, Miao-Hsi; Beirag, Nazar; Murugaiah, Valarmathy; Chou, Yu-Chi; Kuo, Wen-Shuo; Kao, Hui-Fang; Madan, Taruna; Kishore, Uday; Wang, Jiu-Yao",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34054808/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.641360,132

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) has not been reported with mRNA vaccines and is an extremely rare immune-related adverse event of immune checkpoint inhibitors. We present a case of CRS that occurred 5 d after vaccination with BTN162b2 (tozinameran)—the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine—in a patient with colorectal cancer on long-standing anti-PD-1 monotherapy. The CRS was evidenced by raised inflammatory markers, thrombocytopenia, elevated cytokine levels (IFN-γ/IL-2R/IL-18/IL-16/IL-10) and steroid responsiveness. The close temporal association of vaccination and diagnosis of CRS in this case suggests that CRS was a vaccine-related adverse event; with anti-PD1 blockade as a potential contributor. Overall, further prospective pharmacovigillence data are needed in patients with cancer, but the benefit–risk profile remains strongly in favor of COVID-19 vaccination in this population.","Au, Lewis; Fendler, Annika; Shepherd, Scott T.

677200,"Under the epidemic situation of COVID‐19, should special attention to pregnant women be given?",2020-03-24,"From an isolated epidemic, COVID-19 has now emerged as a global pandemic. The availability of genomes in the public domain following the epidemic provides a unique opportunity to understand the evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus across the globe. The availability of whole genomes from multiple states in India prompted us to analyse the phylogenetic clusters of genomes in India. We performed whole-genome sequencing for 64 genomes making a total of 361 genomes from India, followed by phylogenetic clustering, substitution analysis, and dating of the different phylogenetic clusters of viral genomes. We describe a distinct phylogenetic cluster (Clade I / A3i) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from India, which encompasses 41% of all genomes sequenced and deposited in the public domain from multiple states in India. Globally 3.5% of genomes, which till date could not be mapped to any distinct known cluster fall in this newly defined clade. The cluster is characterized by a core set of shared genetic variants – C6312A (T2016K), C13730T (A88V/A97V), C23929T, and C28311T (P13L). Further, the cluster is also characterized by a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.4 × 10−3 variants per site per year, lower than the prevalent A2a cluster, and predominantly driven by variants in the E and N genes and relative sparing of the S gene. Epidemiological assessments suggest that the common ancestor emerged in the month of February 2020 and possibly resulted in an outbreak followed by countrywide spread, as evidenced by the low divergence of the genomes from across the country. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study characterizing the distinct and predominant cluster of SARS-CoV-2 in India.","Banu, Sofia; Jolly, Bani; Mukherjee, Payel; Singh, Priya; Khan, Shagufta; Zaveri, Lamuk; Shambhavi, Sakshi; Gaur, Namami; Mishra, Rakesh K; Scaria, Vinod; Sowpati, Divya Tej",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.31.126136,132

DESIGN: Rapid review. DATA SOURCES: Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase, Ovid Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and WHO Global Index Medicus, searched from inception to 14 Mar 2020. Search strategies applied the CADTH database guidelines search filter, with no limits applied to search results. Further studies were identified through searches of grey literature using the ISARIC network. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Clinical guidelines for the management of covid-19, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) produced by international and national scientific organisations and government and non-governmental organisations relating to global health were included, with no exclusions for language. Regional/hospital guidelines were excluded. Only the earliest version of any guideline was included. QUALITY ASSESSMENT: Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. The quality and contents of early covid-19 guidelines were also compared with recent clinical guidelines for MERS and SARS. RESULTS: 2836 studies were identified, of which 2794 were excluded after screening. Forty two guidelines were considered eligible for inclusion, with 18 being specific to covid-19. Overall, the clinical guidelines lacked detail and covered a narrow range of topics. Recommendations varied in relation to, for example, the use of antiviral drugs. The overall quality was poor, particularly in the domains of stakeholder involvement, applicability, and editorial independence. Links between evidence and recommendations were limited. Minimal provision was made for vulnerable groups such as pregnant women, children, and older people. CONCLUSIONS: Guidelines available early in the covid-19 pandemic had methodological weaknesses and neglected vulnerable groups such as older people. A framework for development of clinical guidelines during public health emergencies is needed to ensure rigorous methods and the inclusion of vulnerable populations.

Here, we validated and investigated the usefulness of measuring serum antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using the iFlash3000 CLIA analyzer. We measured IgM and IgG titers against SARS-CoV-2 in sera collected from 26 PCR-positive COVID-19 patients, 53 COVID-19-suspected but PCR-negative patients, and 20 and 100 randomly selected non-COVID-19 patients who visited our hospital in 2020 and 2017, respectively. The within-day and between-day precisions were regarded as good, since the coefficient variations were below 5%. Linearity was also considered good between 0.6 AU/mL and 112.7 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and between 3.2 AU/mL and 55.3 AU/mL for SARS-CoV-2 IgG, while the linearity curves plateaued above the upper measurement range. We also confirmed that the seroconversion and no-antibody titers were over the cutoff values in all 100 serum samples collected in 2017. These results indicate that this measurement system successfully detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG. We observed four false-positive cases in the IgM assay and no false-positive cases in the IgG assay when 111 serum samples known to contain autoantibodies were evaluated. The concordance rates of the antibody test with the PCR test were 98.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 100% for IgG among PCR-negative cases and 30.8% for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and 73.1% for SARS-CoV-2 IgG among PCR-positive cases. In conclusion, the performance of this measurement system is sufficient for use in laboratory testing.","Yokoyama, RIn; Kurano, Makoto; Morita, Yoshifumi; Shimura, Takuya; Nakano, Yuki; Qian, Chungen; Xia, Fuzhen; He, Fan; Kishi, Yoshihiro; Okada, Jun; Yoshikawa, Naoyuki; Nagura, Yutaka; Okazaki, Hitoshi; Moriya, Kyoji; Seto, Yasuyuki; Kodama, Tatsuhiko; Yatomi, Yutaka",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.16.20155796; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.16.20155796v1?rss=1,132

Despite some notable challenges in sampling and analysis, exhaled breath represents a desirable medium for metabolomics applications, foremost due to its non-invasive, convenient and practically limitless availability. Several breath-based tests that target either endogenous or exogenous gas-phase compounds are currently established and are in practical and/or clinical use. This review outlines the concept of breath analysis in the context of these unique tests and their applications. The respective breath biomarkers targeted in each test are discussed in relation to their physiological production in the human body and the development and implementation of the associated tests. The paper concludes with a brief insight into prospective tests and an outlook of the future direction of breath research.","Pham, Y Lan; Beauchamp, Jonathan",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576985/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185514,132
679220,Retraction to: Intersectionality and Inequalities in Medical Risk for Severe COVID-19 in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging,2021-01-22,"BACKGROUND: The use of sound to represent sequence data—sonification—has great potential as an alternative and complement to visual representation, exploiting features of human psychoacoustic intuitions to convey nuance more effectively. We have created five parameter-mapping sonification algorithms that aim to improve knowledge discovery from protein sequences and small protein multiple sequence alignments. For two of these algorithms, we investigated their effectiveness at conveying information. To do this we focussed on subjective assessments of user experience. This entailed a focus group session and survey research by questionnaire of individuals engaged in bioinformatics research. RESULTS: For single protein sequences, the success of our sonifications for conveying features was supported by both the survey and focus group findings. For protein multiple sequence alignments, there was limited evidence that the sonifications successfully conveyed information. Additional work is required to identify effective algorithms to render multiple sequence alignment sonification useful to researchers. Feedback from both our survey and focus groups suggests future directions for sonification of multiple alignments: animated visualisation indicating the column in the multiple alignment as the sonification progresses, user control of sequence navigation, and customisation of the sound parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Sonification approaches undertaken in this work have shown some success in conveying information from protein sequence data. Feedback points out future directions to build on the sonification approaches outlined in this paper. The effectiveness assessment process implemented in this work proved useful, giving detailed feedback and key approaches for improvement based on end-user input. The uptake of similar user experience focussed effectiveness assessments could also help with other areas of bioinformatics, for example in visualisation.","Martin, Edward J.; Meagher, Thomas R.; Barker, Daniel",BMC Bioinformatics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34556048/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-021-04362-7,132

Existing contact tracing methodologies produce contact maps of individuals based on a binary definition of contact which can be hampered by missing data and indirect contacts. Here, we present our Spatial-temporal Epidemiological Proximity (StEP) model to recover contact maps in disease outbreaks based on movement data. The StEP model accounts for imperfect data by considering probabilistic contacts between individuals based on spatial-temporal proximity of their movement trajectories, creating a robust movement network despite possible missing data and unseen transmission routes. We showcase the potential of StEP for contact tracing with outbreaks of multidrug-resistant bacteria and COVID-19 in a large hospital group in London, UK. In addition to the core structure of contacts that can be recovered using traditional methods of contact tracing, the StEP model reveals missing contacts that connect seemingly separate outbreaks. Comparison with genomic data further confirmed that these additional contacts indeed improve characterisation of disease transmission and so highlights how the StEP framework can inform effective strategies of infection control and prevention.","Myall, A.

This demand has led countries to adopt varying surge-facility or alternate care site (ACS) models to manage patient overflow. This report describes the experience of setting up pharmacy services at a city-run surge facility in Philadelphia. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 Surge Facility at the Liacouras Center (CSF-L) was initially developed to serve as a site for patients convalescing from acute inpatient stays in order to free up healthcare resources in surrounding hospitals. The CSF-L site required a distinct set of services to provide the desired level of care. This report details the preparations and challenges faced by the CSF-L pharmacy team in this endeavor, including identifying a pharmacy location that met regulatory requirements, obtaining proper licenses, coordinating drug procurement, filling staffing requirements, developing a formulary, defining the pharmacy and medication management workflow, and ensuring safety protocols were followed. This report explains the rational for developing certain processes and suggests alternative options and ideal plans for developing future pharmacy services in an ACS. CONCLUSION: Identifying a pharmacy leadership team early in the ACS planning process can lead to more efficient plans for pharmacy services. This report details the important steps taken, decisions made, and challenges faced in setting up pharmaceutical services at a COVID-19 field hospital.","Warr, Dillon; Storey, Eileen; Denys, Mark; Brown, Suzanne; Rose, Christina",Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa418; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33386406/,132

Many scientific questions about SARS-CoV-2 and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were raised and urgently need to be answered, including the susceptibility of animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here we tested whether tree shrew, an emerging experimental animal domesticated from wild animal, is susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. No clinical signs were observed in SARS-CoV-2 inoculated tree shrews during this experiment except the increasing body temperature particularly in female animals. Low levels of virus shedding and replication in tissues occurred in all three age groups. Notably, young tree shrews (6 months to 12 months) showed virus shedding at the earlier stage of infection than adult (2 years to 4 years) and old (5 years to 7 years) animals that had longer duration of virus shedding comparatively. Histopathological examine revealed that pulmonary abnormalities were the main changes but mild although slight lesions were also observed in other tissues. In summary, tree shrew is less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with the reported animal models and may not be a suitable animal for COVID-19 related researches. However, tree shrew may be a potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 as an asymptomatic carrier.","Zhao, Yuan; Wang, Junbin; Kuang, Dexuan; Xu, Jingwen; Yang, Mengli; Ma, Chunxia; Zhao, Siwen; Li, Jingmei; Long, Haiting; Ding, Kaiyun; Gao, Jiahong; Liu, Jiansheng; Wang, Haixuan; Li, Haiyan; Yang, Yun; Yu, Wenhai; Yang, Jing; Zheng, Yinqiu; Wu, Daoju; Lu, Shuaiyao; Liu, Hongqi; Peng, Xiaozhong",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32994418/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-72563-w,132

683013,Maintenance of Acute Stroke Care Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: To develop a sensitive risk score predicting the risk of mortality in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using complete blood count (CBC). METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study from a total of 13,138 inpatients with COVID-19 in Hubei, China, and Milan, Italy. Among them, 9,810 patients with ≥2 CBC records from Hubei were assigned to the training cohort. CBC parameters were analyzed as potential predictors for all-cause mortality and were selected by the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM). FINDINGS: Five risk factors were derived to construct a composite score (PAWNN score) using the Cox regression model, including platelet counts, age, white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio. The PAWNN score showed good accuracy for predicting mortality in 10-fold cross-validation (AUROCs 0.92–0.93) and subsets with different quartile intervals of follow-up and preexisting diseases. The performance of the score was further validated in 2,949 patients with only 1 CBC record from the Hubei cohort (AUROC 0.97) and 227 patients from the Italian cohort (AUROC 0.80). The latent Markov model (LMM) demonstrated that the PAWNN score has good prediction power for transition probabilities between different latent conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The PAWNN score is a simple and accurate risk assessment tool that can predict the mortality for COVID-19 patients during their entire hospitalization. This tool can assist clinicians in prioritizing medical treatment of COVID-19 patients.

The aim of this narrative review is to analyze the current data on the possible association between air pollution and interstitial lung disease (ILD). There are multiple studies showing the association of ILD with air pollution but the mechanism remains unclear. Although some of the environmental factors have been associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and pneumoconiosis, data about other ILDs are scarce and not well known. Air pollution as an etiology for ILD may act in multiple ways, leading to disease pathogenesis or exacerbation of underlying ILD. Clinical implications of this association are manifold; limiting the exposure to poor-quality air could possibly reduce the fall in lung functions and the risk of acute exacerbations of the underlying ILD.","Singh, Nishtha; Singh, Sheetu",Pulm Ther,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41030-021-00148-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33689161/,132

Proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production induced by SARS-CoV-2 were observed not only in symptomatic patients but also in asymptomatic cases, and returned to normal after recovery. IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-18, G-CSF, M-CSF, MCP-1, MCP-3, IP-10, MIG, and MIP-1α were found to be associated with the severity of COVID-19. Moreover, a set of cytokine and chemokine profiles were significantly higher in SARS-CoV-2–infected male than female patients. The serum levels of MCP-1, G-CSF, and VEGF were weakly and positively correlated with viral titers. We suggest that combinatorial analysis of serum cytokines and chemokines with clinical classification may contribute to evaluation of the severity of COVID-19 and optimize the therapeutic strategies.","Chi, Ying; Ge, Yiyue; Wu, Bin; Zhang, Wenshuai; Wu, Tao; Wen, Tian; Liu, Jingxian; Guo, Xiling; Huang, Chao; Jiao, Yongjun; Zhu, Fengcai; Zhu, Baoli; Cui, Lunbiao",J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32563194/; https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiaa363,132

Given the person-to-person spread of COVID-19 through respiratory droplets, law enforcement officers are also at a heightened risk of exposure due to their close contact with members of the public. To protect officers, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other agencies have made numerous recommendations for law enforcement agencies to protect officers and the public. Departments around the country have responded to the pandemic in various ways, such as reassigning personnel to high-traffic areas, suspending training, roll calls, and community outreach initiatives, only issuing citations for low-level crimes, implementing safety precautions for officers, and limiting access to department facilities. The COVID-19 pandemic also has exposed some key obstacles for law enforcement, related to communication, resource management, the enforcement of public health restrictions, and changes to crime and service patterns.

METHOD: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies reporting the effectiveness and safety of remdesivir were searched via databases and other sources from December 2019 to December 2020. Two independent reviewers performed literature screening, data extraction and assessment of risk bias. Seven studies involving 3686 patients were included. RESULTS: Treatment with remdesivir was associated with an increase in clinical recovery rate by 21% (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.08–1.35) on day 7 and 29% (RR 1.29; 95% CI 1.22–1.37) on day 14. The likelihoods of requiring high-flow supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation in the remdesivir group were lower than in the placebo group by 27% (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.54–0.99) and 47% (RR 0.53; 95% CI 0.39–0.72), respectively. Remdesivir-treated patients showed a 39% (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.46–0.79) reduction in the risk of mortality on day 14 compared to the control group; however, there was no significant difference on day 28. Serious adverse effects (SAEs) were significantly less common in patients treated with remdesivir, with an absolute risk difference of 6% (RD −0.06; 95% CI −0.09 to −0.03). CONCLUSION: Despite conditional recommendation against its use, remdesivir could still be effective in early clinical improvement; reduction of early mortality and avoiding high-flow supplemental oxygen and invasive mechanical ventilation among hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Remdesivir was also well tolerated without significant SAEs compared to placebo, yet available evidence from clinical studies support the need to conduct close monitoring.

Information regarding virus-laden aerosol concentrations is still scarce in community indoors and what are the risks for general public and the efficiency of restriction policies. This work investigates, for the first time in Italy, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples collected in different community indoors (one train station, two food markets, one canteen, one shopping centre, one hair salon, and one pharmacy) in three Italian cities: metropolitan city of Venice (NE of Italy), Bologna (central Italy), and Lecce (SE of Italy). Air samples were collected during the maximum spread of the second wave of pandemic in Italy (November and December 2020). All collected samples tested negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, using both real-time RT-PCR and ddPCR, and no significant differences were observed comparing samples taken with and without customers. Modelling average concentrations, using influx of customers’ data and local epidemiological information, indicated low values (i.e. < 0.8 copies m(−3) when cotton facemasks are used and even lower for surgical facemasks). The results, even if with some limitations, suggest that the restrictive policies enforced could effectively reduce the risk of airborne transmissions in the community indoor investigated, providing that physical distance is respected.

AIM: Because the evidence regarding ABO blood groups and COVID was empirically not that clear in our country, we tested the association regarding COVID-19 and blood groups. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Adult patients were enrolled in this prospective, case-control, observational multicenter study. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were assigned to one of three groups based on the clinical presentation of the infection. Age, gender, ABO and Rh blood groups, body mass index, history of diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure, and smoking were recorded directly or from their clinical charts. ABO blood group was obtained from 5,000 blood donors (50% each gender). Atherothrombotic variables were compared with a nation-wide data collection. RESULTS: A total of 2,416 patients with COVID-19 were included (women:39.6%; men:60.4%). There were no significant differences between cases and controls in terms of age. O blood group was the most frequently found in healthy donors and COVID-19 patients, but this blood group was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients vs. healthy donors. ABO blood group was not associated with the final health status in COVID-19 patients. Obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking were significantly more frequent among COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The proposed protective effect of the O blood group in COVID-19 patients could not be reproduced in the Mexican population while some atherothrombotic risk factors had a significant effect on the clinical evolution.","Gamboa-Aguilar, Jacqueline; Zamorano-Montaño, Ángela Carele; Enríquez-Osorio, Aldo; Torres-Cubillas, Wendoline; López-Arroyo, José Luis; Chapol, José Agustín Mata; Zurita-Martínez, Hugo; Pascual, Julio Robledo; Saldaña-Campos, Eli; Rojas-Castillejos, Flavio; Madera-Maldonado, Cristina Elizabeth; Peñafiel, Christian Omar Ramos; Maldonado, Emanuel Bermeo; Rascón, Rafael García; Hernández-Juárez, Jesús; Silos-Briones, Graciela; Domínguez, Salvador de la Maza; Pérez-Ramírez, Óscar de Jesús; Sosa-Camas, Rosa Elena; Romero-López, Cuauhtémoc; Guzmán-Chores, Laura; Amador-Sánchez, Raquel; Ledesma-de la Cruz, Cindy; Campos-Cabrera, Gregorio; Ramírez-Chávez, Laura L.; Esparza-García, Juan Carlos; Vela-Ojeda, Jorge; García-Chávez, Jaime; González-Trejo, José Joaquín; Rodríguez-Mejorada, Silvia Margarita; Rosado-Castro, Rilke Armando; de Arredondo, Raúl Agustín Sobrino-Martínez; Pérez-Hernández, Víctor Hugo; Majluf-Cruz, Karim; Domínguez-Reyes, Víctor; Arreola-Diaz, Rodrigo; Alvarado-Moreno, José Antonio; Majluf-Cruz, Abraham",Arch Med Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34649737/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0188440921001946; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcmed.2021.09.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0188440921001946,132
685920,Rehabilitative treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection: the P.A.R.M.A. evidence based clinical practice protocol,2020-11-10,"Antiviral agents blocking SARS-CoV-2 viral replication are desperately needed to complement vaccination to end the COVID-19 pandemic. Viral replication and assembly are entirely dependent on two viral cysteine proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and the papain-like protease (PLpro). PLpro also has deubiquitinase (DUB) activity, removing ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like modifications from host proteins, disrupting the host immune response. 3CLpro is inhibited by many known cysteine protease inhibitors, whereas PLpro is a relatively unusual cysteine protease, being resistant to blockade by such inhibitors. A high-throughput screen of biased and unbiased libraries gave a low hit rate, identifying only CPI-169 and the positive control, GRL0617, as inhibitors with good potency (IC50 < 10 µM). Analogues of both inhibitors were designed to develop structure-activity relationships; however, without a co-crystal structure of the CPI-169 series, we focused on GRL0617 as a starting point for structure-based drug design, obtaining several co-crystal structures to guide optimization. A series of novel 2-phenylthiophene-based non-covalent SARS-CoV-2 PLpro inhibitors were obtained, culminating in low nanomolar potency. The high potency and slow inhibitor off-rate were rationalized by newly identified ligand interactions with a “BL2 groove” that is distal from the active site cysteine. Trapping of the conformationally flexible BL2 loop by these inhibitors blocks binding of viral and host protein substrates; however, until now it has not been demonstrated that this mechanism can induce potent and efficacious antiviral activity. In this study, we report that novel PLpro inhibitors have excellent antiviral efficacy and potency against infectious SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell cultures. Together, our data provide structural insights into the design of potent PLpro inhibitors and the first validation that non-covalent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro can block infection of human cells with low micromolar potency.","Shen, Zhengnan; Ratia, Kiira; Cooper, Laura; Kong, Deyu; Lee, Hyun; Kwon, Youngjin; Li, Yangfeng; Alqarni, Saad; Huang, Fei; Dubrovskyi, Oleksii; Rong, Lijun; Thatcher, Gregory; Xiong, Rui",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.13.431008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594371/,132

Bioinformatics analysis indicated that there were two trans-membrane domains in GuHMGR. A molecular model of tertiary structure showed that GuHMGR is a novel HMGR with a similar spatial structure to other plant HMGRs. The deduced polypeptide of GuHMGR has an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.41 and a calculated molecular weight of about 54.7 kDa. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GuHMGR had the highest homology with HMGRs from Pisum sativum and Medicago truncatula, indicating that GuHMGR belongs to the plant HMGR group. Expression analysis showed the similar amount of transcript level of GuHMGR in roots and leaves, suggesting that this gene was expressed constitutively in plants. Therefore, this novel HMGR gene would possibly provide a new strategy for studying the glycyrrhizin metabolism at the molecular level in the future.","Ma, Chunying; Liu, Chunsheng; Wang, Wenquan",Front Agric China,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214989/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11703-011-1121-3,132

688403,The neurological manifestations of COVID-19: a review article,2020-06-01,"A construction worker in his 30s presented three times in 4 days with progressive upper and then lower limb weakness. On the first two occasions he had no systemic symptoms, but on the third presentation he had fever and cough, starting from day 4 of weakness. Examination identified weakness in all four limbs and areflexia, suggesting a peripheral neuromuscular disorder. Investigations were consistent with Guillain-Barré syndrome and additional COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The patient improved after immunoglobulin treatment. At least four cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome have been reported in the literature with concurrent COVID-19 illness in whom respiratory signs appeared a few days after the onset of neurological signs. With the incubation period for COVID-19 respiratory symptoms believed to be up to 14 days, it is possible that neurological symptoms could develop before respiratory and other symptoms. During the current pandemic, presence of concurrent COVID-19 infection needs to be considered in patients presenting with Guillain-Barré syndrome.","Ameer, Nasir; Shekhda, Kalyan Mansukhbhai; Cheesman, Ann",BMJ Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928835/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bcr-2020-236978,132
688744,Unspecific post-mortem findings despite multiorgan 1 viral spread in COVID-19 patients,2020-05-28,"Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is currently a pandemic with a mortality rate of 1%‐6% in the general population. However, the mortality rate seems to be significantly higher in elderly patients, especially those hospitalized with comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, or coronary artery diseases. Because viral diseases may have atypical presentations in immunosuppressed patients, the course of the disease in the transplant patient population is unknown. Hence, the management of these patients with COVID‐19 is an area of interest, and a unique approach is warranted. Here, we report the clinical features and our treatment approach for a kidney transplant patient with a diagnosis of COVID‐19. We believe that screening protocols for SARS‐Cov‐2 should be re‐evaluated in patients with solid‐organ transplants.","Arpali, Emre; Akyollu, Basak; Yelken, Berna; Tekin, Suda; Turkmen, Aydin; Kocak, Burak",Transpl Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13296; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32301198/,132

To this purpose, the qualitative approach by grounded theory was chosen. In total, 90 semi-structured interviews were recorded and 43 were transcribed; in addition, 10 observations of 46 participations in meetings and working groups were carried out in four public service and hospital establishments. Our results indicate that the role of health workers, its definition, and its execution are fundamental to the understanding of their health at work. Two protective and constructive processes are involved in the maintenance and development of the professionals’ health in this work, with considerable confrontations with death and suffering: individual and collective control of emotional and cognitive commitment, and the development of resources for formation, information, and cooperation. Nonetheless, they are jeopardized when a lasting imbalance is generated between the work’s demands and the available resources. This leads to a loss spiral in organizational, inter-individual, and individual resources that makes it difficult to sustain work.","Armant, Anne; Ollierou, Florian; Gauvin, Jules; Jeoffrion, Christine; Cougot, Baptiste; Waelli, Mathias; Moret, Leila; Beauvivre, Kristina; Fleury-Bahi, Ghozlane; Berrut, Gilles; Tripodi, Dominique",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34299739/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147286,132
690602,Stroke management pathway during COVID-19 pandemic scientific statement by the Saudi Stroke Society,2020-07-11,"The physiotherapist plays an essential role for people with haemophilia, an inherited bleeding disease responsible for musculoskeletal complications. Yet, with the advent of new and advanced therapies, the medical landscape is changing, and physiotherapy must adapt alongside. This paper considers whether there will still be a need for physiotherapy in the era of advanced therapies, and discusses ways in which services should evolve to complement emerging treatment paradigms for haemostasis in people with haemophilia. Ultimately, physiotherapy will remain an important element of care, even for people with little joint damage and low risks in the era of the new mild phenotype. However, competencies will need to evolve, and physiotherapists in both primary care and specialist treatment centres should work with haematology colleagues to develop more sensitive tools for detecting early joint changes. Physiotherapists will also play a crucial role in counselling and physically coaching, monitoring the musculoskeletal status of people with haemophilia who have transitioned to new treatments.","Lobet, Sébastien; Timmer, Merel; Königs, Christoph; Stephensen, David; McLaughlin, Paul; Duport, Gaetan; Hermans, Cédric; Mancuso, Maria Elisa",J Clin Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10132822; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206923/,132
