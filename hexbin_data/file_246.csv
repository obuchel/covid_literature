1559,The potential contributions of traditional Chinese medicine to emergency medicine,2013,"BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been developed and used to treat acute and urgent illness for many thousands of years. TCM has been widely perceived in western societies that TCM may only be effective to treat chronic diseases. The aim of this article is to provide some scientific evidence regarding the application of TCM in emergency medicine and its future potential. METHODS: Multiple databases (PubMed, ProQuest, Academic Search Elite and Science Direct) were searched using the terms: Traditional Chinese Medicine/ Chinese Medicine, Emergency Medicine, China. In addition, three leading TCM Journals in China were searched via Oriprobe Information Services for relevant articles (published from 1990—2012). Particular attention was paid to those articles that are related to TCM treatments or combined medicine in dealing with intensive and critical care. RESULTS: TCM is a systematic traditional macro medicine. The clinical practice of TCM is guided by the TCM theoretical framework – a methodology founded thousands of years ago. As the methodologies between TCM and Biomedicine are significantly different, it provides an opportunity to combine two medicines, in order to achieve clinical efficacy. Nowadays, combined medicine has become a common clinical model particular in TCM hospitals in China. CONCLUSIONS: It is evident that TCM can provide some assistance in emergency although to combine them in practice is still its infant form and is mainly at TCM hospitals in China. The future effort could be put into TCM research, both in laboratories and clinics, with high quality designs, so that TCM could be better understood and then applied in emergency medicine.","He, Jun; Hou, Xiang-yu",World J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4129829/,246
1918,GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and hematologic disorders,2015-08-12,"BACKGROUND: The majority of cases with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) are caused by auto-antibodies against GM-CSF. A multitude of genetic and exogenous causes are responsible for few other cases. Goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of GATA2 deficiency in children and adults with PAP and hematologic disorders. METHODS: Of 21 patients with GM-CSF-autoantibody negative PAP, 13 had no other organ involvement and 8 had some form of hematologic disorder. The latter were sequenced for GATA2. RESULTS: Age at start of PAP ranged from 0.3 to 64 years, 4 patients were children. In half of the subjects GATA2-sequence variations were found, two of which were considered disease causing. Those two patients had the typical phenotype of GATA2 deficiency, one of whom additionally showed a previously undescribed feature – a cholesterol pneumonia. Hematologic disorders included chronic myeloic leukemia, juvenile myelo-monocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic leukemia, sideroblastic anemia and two cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A 4 year old child with MDS and DiGeorge Syndrome Type 2 was rescued with repetitive whole lung lavages and her PAP was cured with heterologous stem cell transplant. CONCLUSIONS: In children and adults with severe GM-CSF negative PAP a close cooperation between pneumologists and hemato-oncologists is needed to diagnose the underlying diseases, some of which are caused by mutations of transcription factor GATA2. Treatment with whole lung lavages as well as stem cell transplant may be successful.","Griese, Matthias; Zarbock, Ralf; Costabel, Ulrich; Hildebrandt, Jenna; Theegarten, Dirk; Albert, Michael; Thiel, Antonia; Schams, Andrea; Lange, Joanna; Krenke, Katazyrna; Wesselak, Traudl; Schön, Carola; Kappler, Matthias; Blum, Helmut; Krebs, Stefan; Jung, Andreas; Kröner, Carolin; Klein, Christoph; Campo, Ilaria; Luisetti, Maurizio; Bonella, Francesco",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4542098/,246
4055,Combination Antifungal Therapy for Invasive Mold Infections Among Pediatric Patients with Hematological Malignancies: Data from A Real-Life Case-Series,2019-09-05,"BACKGROUND: Invasive mold infections in children with hematological malignancies are associated with high mortality rates. The use of combination antifungal therapy in cases with a severe clinical course is increasing, although information on the efficacy and safety of this approach is limited. METHODS: We present a case series of 13 children affected by hemato-oncological disorders who received combination antifungal therapy for invasive mold infections at our center (Pediatric Hematology, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy) from 2011 to 2016, with the aim of describing their clinical characteristics, types of infections, treatment regimens, clinical outcomes, and treatment safety. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed in order to describe patients' characteristics. RESULTS: Combination antifungal therapy included liposomal amphotericin associated with caspofungin (5/13, 38.4%), voriconazole (5/13, 38.4%), or posaconazole (3/13, 23.1%). The 12-week treatment response rate was 69.2% (6/13 patients showed complete response, 3/13 partial response). The crude mortality was 30.7% (4/13): half was related to invasive mold infections (2/13, 15.38%) and half to disease progression (2/13, 15.38%). Overall, treatment was well tolerated, and we did not observe any permanent discontinuation of antifungals due to related side effects. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, combination antifungal therapy seems to be a safe option in immunocompromised children with invasive mold infections. Well-designed studies are needed to confirm the safety of this approach and to better understand its efficacy in the pediatric setting.","Peri, Anna Maria; Verna, Marta; Biffi, Stefano; Alagna, Laura; Longhi, Benedetta; Migliorino, Guglielmo Marco; Foresti, Sergio; Bandera, Alessandra; Rovelli, Attilio; Rizzari, Carmelo; Gori, Andrea; Colombini, Antonella",Pathog Immun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6742350/,246
4304,Painless retrograde type A aortic dissection followed conservative treatment of type B aortic dissection: a case report,2020-01-13,"BACKGROUND: Retrograde type A aortic dissection (RTAD) is a fatal aortic disease secondary to descending aortic dissection, and might be misdiagnosed due to its atypical symptoms lead to catastrophic outcomes. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein reported a case of a 40-year old Chinese non-comorbid man who received conservative treatment for acute type B aortic dissection and progressed to RTAD in a painless manner in a week. After open surgical aortic repair with stented elephant truck technique, the patient survived without obvious complication and cured with a satisfactory outcome in a half-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: This case indicates that RTAD may present without typical symptoms, early diagnosis and open surgical procedure are imperative for treating RTAD.","Ruan, Yongle; Wang, Zhiwei; Wu, Zhiyong; Ren, Wei; Ren, Zongli; Yu, Anfeng; Rahouma, Mohamed",BMC Cardiovasc Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6956508/,246
4820,Presence of factor VIII-related antigen in blood platelets of patients with Von Willebrand's disease,1975,"Necrotizing enterocolitis, a severe gastrointestinal disease in the neonatal period, affects primarily premature infants. Perinatal complications that predispose the neonate to systemic hypoxia are frequent in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis. Ischemia of the intestinal mucosa may facilitate the invasion of enteric microorganisms in stressed low birth weight infants. Geographical and temporal clustering of outbreaks of the disease and the termination of epidemics by standard infection control underline the importance of infectious agents in the development of this disease. Several studies have established the immunoprotective effect of orally administered antibodies against infection of the gastrointestinal mucosa in children and adults. Anecdotal evidence suggested that feeding of human immune globulin might have a positive effect on the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. This paper reviews a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of the efficacy of an oral immune globulin preparation (published in detail in theNew England Journal of Medicine, Vol. 319, pp. 1–7, 1988) and discusses the pathogenic role of infection in necrotizing enterocolitis.","Eibl, Martha M.; Wolf, Hermann M.; Fürnkranz, Heinz; Rosenkranz, Alfred",J Clin Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7086514/,246

5697,Exhaled Air and Aerosolized Droplet Dispersion During Application of a Jet Nebulizer,2015-12-16,"Viral infections are known to be associated with severe exacerbations of asthma in children. In contrast, there is limited data that viral infections evoke acute episodes of asthma that require emergency care in adults. To determine the role of viral infections in exacerbations of asthma in adults, we examined 33 patients who presented to the emergency room with 35 exacerbations of asthma between September 1990 and March 1991 for the presence of a viral infection. A nasal swab was obtained for virus isolation by culture and rapid antigen detection by fluorescent staining. In 16 patients, serum was collected at initial presentation and 3 to 4 weeks later for acute and convalescent viral antibody titers. All patients had acute episodes of asthma ascertained by medical history and physical examination. About 56% of the patients with asthma exacerbations had symptoms suggestive of viral illness. Rapid antigen detection and viral cultures for influenza A and B, parainfluenza-1, 2, 3, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus were negative on all patients. Likewise, in all 16 patients tested, acute and convalescent serologic studies did not show a significant rise in titer by complement fixation test. Thus, despite symptoms consistent with viral infection, viral pathogens could not be shown by current virologic techniques. This study suggests that viral infection may not be as prevalent a precipitate of asthma in adults requiring emergency room treatment as is generally thought.","Sokhandan, Mehrgan; McFadden, E.

5702,A 57-Year-Old Woman With Fever and Abnormal Chest CT Findings,2015-12-31,"Patients with respiratory infections often require the use of supplemental oxygen via oxygen masks, which, in the hospital, may become sources of aerosolized infectious pathogens. To assess this risk, a human lung model (respiration rate, 12 breaths/min) was designed to test the potential for a simple oxygen mask at a common setting (4 L/min) to disperse potentially infectious exhaled air into the surrounding area. A laser sheet was used to illuminate the exhaled air from the mask, which contained fine tracer smoke particles. An analysis of captured digital images showed that the exhaled air at the peak of simulated exhalation reached a distance of approximately 0.40 m.","Hui, David S.; Ip, Margaret; Tang, Julian W.; Wong, Alexandra L.N.; Chan, Matthew T.V.; Hall, Stephen D.; Chan, Paul K.S.; Sung, Joseph J.Y.",Chest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094573/,246

It is essential that the hospital is immediately secured from unauthorized intrusion in order to avoid contamination of the hospital area and staff. The strategy of the pre-hospital emergency staff to avoid the unnecessary spread of contaminated material involves thorough decontamination of exposed persons near the site of the incident and coordinated transport to the primary care hospitals after decontamination. However, uncoordinated access of contaminated victims requires emergency decontamination by hospital staff. Thus, hospital staff must be prepared to provide in-hospital decontamination. Coordinated admission of contaminated patients into the NBC primary care hospital relies on a thorough decontamination by pre-hospital emergency staff at a decontamination site installed outside the hospital. Screening of patients is performed by hospital staff with special expertise in emergency medicine. Following admission, each patient is assigned to a team of specialists. Pre-hospital patient documentation is switched to inhospital documentation after admission using machine-readable electronic admission numbers.","Haeseler, Gertrud; Henke-Gendo, C.; Vogt, P.

6808,Characteristics of pulmonary complications in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients treated with rituximab-containing chemotherapy and impact on survival,2018-07-21,"BACKGROUND: Split liver transplantation is still discussed controversially. Utilization of split liver grafts has been declining since a change of allocation rules for the second graft abolished incentives for German centres to perform ex situ splits. We therefore analysed our long-term experiences with the first ex situ split liver transplant series worldwide. METHODS: A total of 131 consecutive adult ex situ split liver transplants (01.12.1987–31.12.2010) were analysed retrospectively. RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality rates and 1- and 3-year patient survival rates were 13, 76.3, and 66.4 %, respectively. One- and three-year graft survival rates were 63.4 and 54.2 %, respectively. The observed 10-year survival rate was 40.6 %. Continuous improvement of survival from era 1 to 3 was observed (each era: 8 years), indicating a learning curve over 24 years of experience. Patient and graft survival were not influenced by different combinations of transplanted segments or types of biliary reconstruction (p > 0.05; Cox regression). Patients transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis had better survival (p = 0.021; log-rank), whereas all other indications including acute liver failure (13.6 %), acute and chronic graft failure (9.1 %) had no significant influence on survival (p > 0.05; log-rank). Biliary complications (27.4 %) had no significant influence on patient or graft survival (p > 0.05; log-rank). Hepatic artery thrombosis (13.2 %) had a significant influence on graft survival but not on patient survival (p = 0.002, >0.05, respectively; log-rank). CONCLUSIONS: Split liver transplantation can be used safely and appears to be an underutilized resource that may benefit from liberal allocation of the second graft.","Schrem, Harald; Kleine, Moritz; Lankisch, Tim Oliver; Kaltenborn, Alexander; Kousoulas, Lampros; Zachau, Lea; Lehner, Frank; Klempnauer, Jürgen",World J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102172/,246
7138,Clinical analysis of surgery for type III esophageal atresia via thoracoscopy: a study of a Chinese single-center experience,2020-03-30,"BACKGROUND: The probability of weaning and of long-term survival of chronically mechanically ventilated cancer patients is unknown, with incomplete information available to guide therapeutic decisions. We sought to determine the probability of weaning and overall survival of cancer patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation in a specialized weaning unit. METHODS: A single-institution retrospective review of patients requiring mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting from 2008 to 2012 and from January 1 to December 31, 2018, was performed. Demographic and clinical data were recorded, including cancer specifics, comorbidities, treatments, and outcomes. Overall survival was determined using the Kaplan-Meier approach. Time to weaning was analyzed using the cumulative incidence function, with death considered a competing risk. Prognostic factors were evaluated for use in prospective evaluations of weaning protocols. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2012, 122 patients required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting with weaning as a goal of care. The cumulative incidence of weaning after discharge from the intensive care unit was 42% at 21 days, 49% at 30 days, 58% at 60 days, 61% at 90 days, and 61% at 120 days. The median survival was 0.16 years (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.33) for those not weaned and 1.05 years (95% CI, 0.60 to 1.34) for those weaned. Overall survival at 1 year and 2 years was 52 and 32% among those weaned and 16 and 9% among those not weaned. During 2018, 36 patients at our institution required mechanical ventilation outside of a critical care setting, with weaning as a goal of care. Overall, with a median follow-up of 140 days (range, 0–425 days; average, 141 days), 25% of patients requiring long-term mechanical ventilation (9 of 36) are alive. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients can be weaned from long-term mechanical ventilation, even after prolonged periods of support. Implementation of a resource-intensive weaning program did not improve rates of successful weaning. No clear time on mechanical ventilation could be identified beyond which weaning was unprecedented. Short-term overall survival for these patients is poor.","Haviland, Kelly; Tan, Kay See; Schwenk, Nadja; Pillai, Manju V.; Stover, Diane E.; Downey, Robert J.",BMC Palliat Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7106688/,246
7249,Vernakalant-facilitated electrical cardioversion: comparison of intravenous vernakalant and amiodarone for drug-enhanced electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation after failed electrical cardioversion,2015-06-07,"The ability of isolated adrenocortical cells to secrete corticosterone in response to ACTH challenge declines as rats age, but the site or mechanism(s) of this impairment is still unknown. To test the functionality of steroidogenic capacity per se, we measured the key enzyme activities involved in corticosterone biosynthesis. We also measured the mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content and nonsteroidogenic enzymes specific for subcellular fractions. Mitochondria and microsomal fractions were isolated from the adrenals of 2-, 12-, and 18- month-old animals and used for various enzyme measurements. Mitochondrial side-chain cleavage enzyme activity (nanomoles per min mg protein(-1)) increased from a mean of 0.43 ± 0.06 in 2-month-old rats to 1.26 ± 0.11 and 1.51 ± 0.06 in 12- and 18-month old rats, respectively. After incubation with 5- cholesten-3j8,25-diol (25-hydroxycholesterol; 25 μg/ml) sidechain cleave activity rose to 5.0 ± 0.6, 12.4 ± 1.2, and 16 ± 1.4 nmol min(-1) mg protein(-1) in adrenal mitochondrial fractions from 2-, 12-, and 18-month-old rats, respectively. In contrast, mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 content did not vary with advancing age. Microsomal δ(5)-3β-hyroxysteroid dehydrogenase-δ(5)-δ(4)- isomerase activities were similar in 2- and 12-month-old rats, but 21-hydroxylase (nanomoles per min mg protein(-1)) activity was significantly increased in 12-month-old rats (2-month-old, 5.2 ± 0.2; 12-month-old, 7.7 ± 0.5). Finally, mitochondrial 11β- hydroxylase was comparable in both age groups. In addition, activities of mitochondrial nonsteroidogenic enzymes, such as monoamine oxidase, amytal insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, did not change with age. It appears from the evidence presented that the activities of the steroidogenic enzymes are not responsible for the diminished capacity in corticosterone production seen with aging in the rat.

(1993) Clin. Diagn. Virol. 1, 101–108) Objectives: To investigate if the observed lowered IFN producing capacity was secondary to the underlying disease and, consequently, would be normalized after recovery of the child from the chain of infections. Study design: Forty-eight 3–12-year-old children suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections (acute otitis media included) were followed-up for 2 years. Their clinical condition and virus-induced interferon production in cultures of peripheral blood leukocytes were examined at the beginning and end of this period. Results: In 24 children the health improved strikingly during the follow-up, in 12 children a mild improvement took place, while 12 children remained constantly ill. IFN yields in cultures stimulated with corona- and respiratory syncytical viruses improved along with the clinical situation of the children. Parallel cultures induced with adeno-, influenza A or rhinoviruses did not show a similar correlation. Conclusion: These results suggest that the relationship between interferon production by leukocyte cultures and recurrent infections is complex and may be virus-specific.","Pitkäranta, Anne; Karma, Pekka; Hovi, Tapani",Clin Diagn Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134928/,246

10773,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI)-Associated Interstitial Lung Disease During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020-05-05,"BACKGROUND: Human respiratory system infected with influenza A virus (IAV) elicited a robust pro-inflammatory response that resulted in severe illness and even death. Currently, limited immunomodulator is available to counteract IAV-associated pneumonia in the clinic. Sinensetin, a polymethoxylated flavone with five methoxy groups, has been found to possess anti-agiogenesis, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. However, the effects of sinensetin on IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response remain unclear. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effects and corresponding possible mechanism of sinensetin in IAV-infected A549 cells were subjected to investigations. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of sinensetin towards A549 cells was detected by MTT and LDH assays. The antiviral activity of sinensetin against influenza A virus was assayed in A549 cells with an engineered replication-competent influenza A virus carrying Gaussia luciferase reporter gene infection. The effect of sinensetin on influenza A virus-triggered inflammatory reaction was determined by qRT-PCR, Luminex assays, ELISA and Western blot. RESULTS: Our results showed that sinensetin did not exhibit antiviral activity against A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Meanwhile, sinensetin treatment significantly decreased IAV-induced expression of pro-inflammatory mediators at mRNA and protein levels, including IL-6, TNF-α, IP-10, IL-8 and MCP-1. Additionally, levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and the downstream product prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) up-regulated by IAV infection were dramatically suppressed by sinensetin. The mechanistic investigation revealed that sinensetin treatment suppressed the NF-κB transcriptional activity using the NF-κB reporter stable HEK293 cell line stimulated with TNF-α (20 ng/mL) or influenza H1N1 virus. Furthermore, sinensetin abrogated influenza H1N1 virus-induced activation of NF-κB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results indicated that sinensetin has potential capacity to attenuate IAV-triggered pro-inflammatory response via inactivation of NF-κB, ERK1/2 MAPK and p38 MAPK signalings, which implied that sinensetin may be a promising candidate drug for influenza H1N1 virus infection therapeutics.","Li, Jiashun; Jie, Xiang; Liang, Xiaoli; Chen, Ziyu; Xie, Peifang; Pan, Xiping; Zhou, Beixian; Li, Jing",BMC Complement Med Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7200050/,246
10843,FluA-p score: a novel prediction rule for mortality in influenza A-related pneumonia patients,2020-05-08,"BACKGROUND: One major limitation for less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) is the difficulty in providing sedation before this procedure and the competitive risk of respiratory depression versus avoidance of intubation for most sedative or analgesic drugs used in this context. The objective of this study is to compare the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h of life following premedication with propofol, versus placebo (rescue with ketamine), for the LISA procedure in preterm neonates born before 32 weeks gestational age (wGA). METHODS: ProLISA is a phase III, non-inferiority, multicenter, double blind, randomized, placebo controlled trial designed according to the SPIRIT Statement. Neonates born before 32 wGA in 12 geographically dispersed Neonatal Intensive Care Units in France needing surfactant will be included from September 2019 to September 2022. A sample of 542 patients is needed. The neonate is randomized to the intervention (propofol) or control placebo group. Open label rescue treatment with ketamine is possible in both groups if FANS (Faceless Acute Neonatal pain Scale) is ≥6. To guide drug administration, FANS is scored before attempting laryngoscopy. Once an adequate score has been obtained, LISA is performed according to a standardized protocol. The primary outcome is the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h of life. Secondary outcomes are tolerance of the procedure, pain evaluation, hemodynamic and neurologic parameters after the intervention, morbidities before discharge and neurodevelopmental assessment at 2 years of age. DISCUSSION: This paper describes the first multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial on this topic and will provide crucial information to support implementation of the LISA procedure.

We present the case of a 55-year-old female who developed cranial nerve symptoms after a 20-year history of HAM/TSP. Although multiple white matter lesions were observed on brain magnetic resonance imaging, no abnormalities were seen on a systemic computed tomography scan. Quantitative flow-cytometric analysis of cell populations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed that most of the infiltrating cells were not inflammatory cells, but HTLV-1-infected CD4(+) CADM-1(+) T-cells completely lacking CD7 expression. As stepwise downregulation of CD7 is correlated with disease progression from HTLV-1 carrier to aggressive ATL, the CSF cells were classified as aggressive ATL; these cells exhibited a more progressed phenotype than those in peripheral blood (PB). HAM/TSP disease activity was estimated to be low. From these and other examinations, we made a diagnosis of acute-type ATL, which unusually developed in the central nervous system at initial onset prior to systemic progression. In ATL cases with a challenging diagnosis, immunophenotypic characterization of CSF and PB is valuable for differential diagnosis and understanding disease status.","Takeda, Reina; Ishigaki, Tomohiro; Ohno, Nobuhiro; Yokoyama, Kazuaki; Kawamata, Toyotaka; Fukuyama, Tomofusa; Araya, Natsumi; Yamano, Yoshihisa; Uchimaru, Kaoru; Tojo, Arinobu",Int J Hematol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7222977/,246
11379,Utility of Pulmonary Artery Acceleration Time to Estimate Systolic Pulmonary Artery Pressure in Neonates and Young Infants,2019-11-09,"PURPOSE: Polymeric mesh implantation has become the golden standard in hernia repair, which nowadays is one of the most frequently performed surgeries in the world. However, many biocompatibility issues remain to be a concern for hernioplasty, with chronic pain being the most notable post-operative complication. Oxidative stress appears to be a major factor in the development of those complications. Lack of material inertness in vivo and oxidative environment formed by inflammatory cells result in both mesh deterioration and slowed healing process. In a pilot in vivo study, we prepared and characterized polypropylene hernia meshes with vitamin E (α-tocopherol)-a potent antioxidant. The results of that study supported the use of vitamin E as potential coating to alleviate post-surgical inflammation, but the pilot nature of the study yielded limited statistical data. The purpose of this study was to verify the observed trend of the pilot study statistically. METHODS: In this work, we conducted a 5-animal experiment where we have implanted vitamin E-coated and uncoated control meshes into the abdominal walls of rabbits. Histology of the mesh-adjacent tissues and electron microscopy of the explanted mesh surface were conducted to characterize host tissue response to the implanted meshes. RESULTS: As expected, modified meshes exhibited reduced foreign body reaction, as evidenced by histological scores for fatty infiltrates, macrophages, neovascularization, and collagen organization, as well as by the surface deterioration of the meshes. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, results indicate that vitamin E coating reduces inflammatory response following hernioplasty and protects mesh material from oxidative deterioration.","Bredikhin, M.; Gil, D.; Rex, J.; Cobb, W.; Reukov, V.; Vertegel, A.",Hernia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223801/,246

Among infants, these were 1.50 (0.17–18.0, p = 0.50) for all vaccines, 2.00 (0.29–22.1, p = 0.67) for live vaccines, and 1.00 (0.01–78.5, p = 0.50) for inactivated vaccines. Sex-adjusted common ORs for simultaneous vaccination were 1.52 (0.45–5.21, p = 0.71) for all vaccines, 1.83 (0.44–7.59, p = 0.40) for inactivated vaccines only, and 1.36 (0.29–6.30, p = 0.69) for mixed live and inactivated vaccines. In infants, these were 1.95 (0.44–8.72, p = 0.38), 1.41 (0.29–6.94, p = 0.67) and 2.85 (0.43–18.9, p = 0.28), respectively. These limited data suggest no significant ITP risk following vaccinations or simultaneous vaccination in any age group, including infants.

13556,Impact of neurological diseases on family planning: A single-center experience,2020-10-30,"Hypofunction of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) contributes to stress-related neuropsychiatric illnesses. Mechanisms leading to prefrontal hypoactivity remain to be determined. Prior evidence suggests that chronic stress leads to an increase in activity of parvalbumin (PV) expressing GABAergic interneurons (INs) in the PFC. The purpose of the study was to determine whether reducing PV IN activity in the Infralimbic (IL) PFC would prevent stress-related phenotypes. We used a chemogenetic approach to inhibit IL PFC PV INs during stress. Mice were first tested in the tail suspension test (TST) to determine the impact of PV IN inhibition on behavioral responses to acute stress. The long-term impact of PV IN inhibition during a modified chronic variable stress (CVS) was tested in the forced swim test (FST). Acute PV IN inhibition reduced active (struggling) and increased passive coping behaviors (immobility) in the TST. In contrast, inhibition of PV INs during CVS increased active and reduced passive coping behaviors in the FST. Moreover, chronic inhibition of PV INs attenuated CVS-induced changes in Fos expression in the prelimbic cortex (PrL), basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and also attenuated adrenal hypertrophy and body weight loss associated with chronic stress. Our results suggest differential roles of PV INs in acute versus chronic stress, indicative of distinct biological mechanisms underlying acute versus chronic stress responses. Our results also indicate a role for PV INs in driving chronic stress adaptation and support literature evidence suggesting cortical GABAergic INs as a therapeutic target in stress-related illnesses.","Nawreen, Nawshaba; Cotella, Evelin M.; Morano, Rachel; Mahbod, Parinaz; Dalal, Khushali S.; Fitzgerald, Maureen; Martelle, Susan; Packard, Benjamin A.; Franco-Villanueva, Ana; Moloney, Rachel D.; Herman, James P.",eNeuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7598911/,246
15199,Timing of Transfer and Mortality in Neonates with Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome in California,2021-02-03,"Pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) is a globally distributed, virulent member of the avian paramyxovirus type-1. The PPMV-1–associated disease poses a great threat to the pigeon industry. The innate immune response is crucial for antiviral infections and revealing the pathogenic mechanisms of PPMV-1. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenicity of a PPMV-1 strain LHLJ/110822 in one-month-old domestic pigeons, as well as the host immune responses in PPMV-1–infected pigeons. We observed typically clinical sign in infected pigeons by 3 dpi. The morbidity rate and the mortality in pigeons inoculated with the PPMV-1 strain were up to 100% and 30%, respectively. The virus could replicate in all of the examined tissues, namely trachea, lung, liver, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius. In addition, the infected pigeons had developed anti-PPMV-1 antibodies as early as 8 dpi; and the antibody level increased over the time in this study. The expression level of toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, TLR3 TLR15, IFN-γ, and IL-6 were significantly upregulated by the PPMV-1 infection in some tissues of pigeons. By contrast, PPMV-1 infection results in downregulation of IL-18 expression in most of investigated tissues except for bursa of Fabricius in this study. The current results confirmed that this virus could replicate in pigeons and induce host immune responses, then leading to produce serum antibody titers. Meanwhile, the PPMV-1 infection induces strong innate immune responses and intense inflammatory responses at early stage in pigeon which may associate with the viral pathogenesis.","Wang, Fangfang; Gao, Mengying; Han, Zongxi; Hou, Yutong; Zhang, Lili; Ma, Zhanbang; Ma, Deying",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7858190/,246
15586,The association between clinical and biochemical characteristics of late-onset sepsis and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: HIV testing among adolescents is significantly lower than among adults and many adolescents living with HIV do not know their status. Adolescent perceptions of HIV testing are poorly understood and may negatively affect testing uptake. Using a qualitative design, this study sought to explore perceptions about HIV testing and treatment among adolescents living with HIV and adolescents of unknown HIV status in Lusaka, Zambia and Kenya. METHODS: Study participants were adolescents aged 15–19 years old. The adolescents living with HIV were recruited from HIV support groups at health facilities. Adolescents of unknown HIV status were recruited from existing adolescent groups within the community. In both Zambia and Kenya, four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with adolescents living with HIV and four FGDs were conducted with adolescents whose HIV status was unknown, for a total of 16 FDGs. FGDs consisted of 6–12 participants, a moderator, and a note-taker. FGDs were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into transcripts. Transcripts were coded in the qualitative analysis software program MAXQDA v. 12. Data reduction and summary tables were generated to help identify themes across the two study population groups. Data were interpreted within the health belief model. RESULTS: Adolescents discussed the challenges of facing a positive HIV test result, including fear of a positive result and need to change their lifestyle, fear of social isolation, and perception of the lost opportunity to achieve future dreams. Most adolescents of unknown status were not as aware of the benefits of learning their HIV status, nor were they aware of the ability to live a long and healthy life on ART. HIV-positive adolescents reported that the messages targeted towards adolescents focus on the need to remain HIV-negative, as opposed to the benefits of knowing one’s status. Adolescents described age and requirements for parental permission as a significant limitation in their ability to access HIV testing. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents require more information about the benefits of testing early and the ability to live a long and healthy life on ART. Educating adolescents that HIV testing is a normative behavior among their peers could strengthen HIV testing among adolescents.

15913,Current Perspectives of convalescent plasma therapy in COVID-19,2020-11-10,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were first generated in 2007, but the full translational potential of this valuable tool has yet to be realized. The potential applications of hiPSCs are especially relevant to neurology, as brain cells from patients are rarely available for research. hiPSCs from individuals with neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative diseases have facilitated biological and multi-omics studies as well as large-scale screening of chemical libraries. However, researchers are struggling to improve the scalability, reproducibility and quality of this descriptive disease modelling. Addressing these limitations will be the first step towards a new era in hiPSC research — that of predictive disease modelling — involving the correlation and integration of in vitro experimental data with longitudinal clinical data. This approach is a key element of the emerging precision medicine paradigm, in which hiPSCs could become a powerful diagnostic and prognostic tool. Here, we consider the steps necessary to achieve predictive modelling of neurodegenerative disease with hiPSCs, using Huntington disease as an example.","Rivetti di Val Cervo, Pia; Besusso, Dario; Conforti, Paola; Cattaneo, Elena",Nat Rev Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7928200/,246
16364,Deep Neural Networks Can Predict New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation From the 12-Lead ECG and Help Identify Those at Risk of Atrial Fibrillation–Related Stroke,2021-02-16,"Epidemiological studies have shown a dramatic increase in the incidence and the prevalence of allergic diseases over the last several decades. Environmental triggers including risk factors (e.g., pollution), the loss of rural living conditions (e.g., farming conditions), and nutritional status (e.g., maternal, breastfeeding) are considered major contributors to this increase. The influences of these environmental factors are thought to be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms which are heritable, reversible, and biologically relevant biochemical modifications of the chromatin carrying the genetic information without changing the nucleotide sequence of the genome. An important feature characterizing epigenetically-mediated processes is the existence of a time frame where the induced effects are the strongest and therefore most crucial. This period between conception, pregnancy, and the first years of life (e.g., first 1000 days) is considered the optimal time for environmental factors, such as nutrition, to exert their beneficial epigenetic effects. In the current review, we discussed the impact of the exposure to bacteria, viruses, parasites, fungal components, microbiome metabolites, and specific nutritional components (e.g., polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), vitamins, plant- and animal-derived microRNAs, breast milk) on the epigenetic patterns related to allergic manifestations. We gave insight into the epigenetic signature of bioactive milk components and the effects of specific nutrition on neonatal T cell development. Several lines of evidence suggest that atypical metabolic reprogramming induced by extrinsic factors such as allergens, viruses, pollutants, diet, or microbiome might drive cellular metabolic dysfunctions and defective immune responses in allergic disease. Therefore, we described the current knowledge on the relationship between immunometabolism and allergy mediated by epigenetic mechanisms. The knowledge as presented will give insight into epigenetic changes and the potential of maternal and post-natal nutrition on the development of allergic disease.","Acevedo, Nathalie; Alashkar Alhamwe, Bilal; Caraballo, Luis; Ding, Mei; Ferrante, Antonio; Garn, Holger; Garssen, Johan; Hii, Charles S.; Irvine, James; Llinás-Caballero, Kevin; López, Juan Felipe; Miethe, Sarah; Perveen, Khalida; Pogge von Strandmann, Elke; Sokolowska, Milena; Potaczek, Daniel P.; van Esch, Betty C.

In this retrospective analysis of 23,932 animal records from a US shelter, we identified animal characteristics associated with the likelihood of return, key return reasons, and outcomes post-return for dogs and cats. Binary logistic regression models were used to describe the likelihood of return, return reason and outcome based on intake age, intake type, sex, breed and return frequency. Behavioral issues and incompatibility with existing pets were the most common return reasons. Age and breed group (dogs only) predicted the likelihood of return, return reason and post-adoption return outcome. Adult dogs had the greatest odds of post-adoption return (OR 3.40, 95% CI 2.88–4.01) and post-return euthanasia (OR 3.94, 95% CI 2.04–7.59). Toy and terrier breeds were 65% and 35% less likely to be returned compared with herding breeds. Pit bull-type breeds were more likely to be returned multiple times (X(2) = 18.11, p = 0.01) and euthanized post-return (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.47–4.61).

Health-care professionals in cardiology participate in social media to varying degrees and in different ways. Current studies have focused primarily on physicians who have an established presence on social media. To learn more about the social media habits of community-based cardiology providers, we queried attendants at a cardiovascular conference held by our health-care system. The purpose of this article is to: 1. Highlight the social media habits of a range of community-based cardiology providers and distinguish between producing and consuming social media. There is a predominance of social media content consumers compared to producers. 2. Outline important considerations when assessing the risks and benefits of social media use and the perceived concerns of cardiology health-care professionals. 3.

17458,Evaluation of radiologic evidence of metabolic bone disease in very low birth weight infants at fourth week of life,2021-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Suspicion and clinical criteria continue to serve as the foundation for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) diagnosis, however the criteria used to diagnose VAP vary widely. Data from head-to-head comparisons of clinical diagnostic algorithms is lacking, thus a prospective observational study was performed to determine the performance characteristics of the Johanson criteria, Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS), and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC/NHSN) criteria as compared to Hospital in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS) reference standard. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was performed in three mixed medical-surgical ICUs from one academic medical center from 1 October 2016 to 30 April 2018. VAP diagnostic criteria were applied to each patient including CDC/NHSN, CPIS, HELICS and Johanson criteria. Tracheal aspirate cultures (TAC) and serum procalcitonin values were obtained for each patient. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled (VAP 45, controls 40). Using HELICS as the reference standard, the sensitivity and specificity for each of the assessed diagnostic algorithms were: CDC/NHSN (Sensitivity 54.2%; Specificity 100%), CPIS (Sensitivity 68.75%; Specificity 95.23%), Johanson (Sensitivity 67.69%; Specificity 95%). The positive TAC rate was 81.2%. The sensitivity for positive TAC with the serum procalcitonin level > 0.5 ng/ml was 51.8%. CONCLUSION: VAP remains a considerable source of morbidity and mortality in modern intensive care units. The optimal diagnostic method remains unclear. Using HELICS criteria as the reference standard, CPIS had the greatest comparative diagnostic accuracy, whereas the sensitivity of the CDC/NHSN was only marginally better than a positive TAC plus serum procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/ml. Algorithm accuracy was improved by adding serum procalcitonin > 0.5 ng/ml, but not positive quantitative TAC.

17556,Presence of Extra-Criteria Antiphospholipid Antibodies Is an Independent Risk Factor for Ischemic Stroke,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND: With more than 300 million potentially infected people every year, and with the expanded habitat of mosquitoes due to climate change, Dengue virus (DENV) cannot be considered anymore only a tropical disease. The RNA secondary structure is a functional characteristic of RNA viruses, and together with the accumulated high-throughput sequencing data could provide general insights towards understanding virus biology. Here, we profiled the RNA secondary structure of > 7000 complete viral genomes from 11 different species focusing on viral hemorrhagic fevers, including DENV serotypes, EBOV, and YFV. RESULTS: In our work we demonstrated that the secondary structure and presence of protein-binding domains in the genomes can be used as intrinsic signature to further classify the viruses. With our predictive approach, we achieved high prediction scores of the secondary structure (AUC up to 0.85 with experimental data), and computed consensus secondary structure profiles using hundreds of in silico models. We observed that viruses show different structural patterns, where e.g., DENV-2 and Ebola virus tend to be less structured than the other viruses. Furthermore, we observed virus-specific correlations between secondary structure and the number of interaction sites with human proteins, reaching a correlation of 0.89 in the case of Zika virus. We also identified that helicases-encoding regions are more structured in several flaviviruses, while the regions encoding for the contact proteins exhibit virus-specific clusters in terms of RNA structure and potential protein-RNA interactions. We also used structural data to study the geographical distribution of DENV, finding a significant difference between DENV-3 from Asia and South-America, where the structure is also driving the clustering more than sequence identity, which could imply different evolutionary routes of this subtype. CONCLUSIONS: Our massive computational analysis provided novel results regarding the secondary structure and the interaction with human proteins, not only for DENV serotypes, but also for other flaviviruses and viral hemorrhagic fevers-associated viruses. We showed how the RNA secondary structure can be used to categorise viruses, and even to further classify them based on the interaction with proteins. We envision that these approaches can be used to further classify and characterise these complex viruses.

17617,Metabolomics and cardiovascular imaging: a combined approach for cardiovascular ageing,2021-03-30,"BACKGROUND: Aiming to support European countries in improving their breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programmes, the EU-TOPIA consortium has developed an online user-friendly tool (the EU-TOPIA evaluation tool; https://miscan.eu-topia.org) based on the Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN) model. METHODS: We designed an online platform that allows stakeholders to use their country-specific data (demographic, epidemiological, and cancer screening information) to quantify future harms and benefits of different cancer screening scenarios in their country. Current cancer screening programmes and impacts of potential changes in screening protocols (such as extending target ages or increasing screening attendance) can be simulated. Results are scaled to the country-specific population. To illustrate the tool, we used the tool to simulate two different CRC screening scenarios in the Netherlands: biennial fecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in ages 55–75 and colonoscopy every ten years in ages 55–75. Data from the Dutch screening programme was used to inform both scenarios. RESULTS: A total of 482,700 CRC cases and 178,000 CRC deaths were estimated in the Netherlands with FIT screening (for individuals aged 40–100 years, 2018–2050), with 47.3 million FITs performed (1.92 million positives of which 1.64 million adhered to diagnostic colonoscopy). With colonoscopy screening, CRC incidence and mortality were, respectively, up to 17% and 14% lower than in the current FIT screening programme, requiring, however, a colonoscopy demand that was 7-fold higher.

CD45RO+CD8+ T cells are well known as a critical role in host defense of the immune environment. However, their role in clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unknown. To elucidate the clinical importance of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells in ccRCC as well as its underlying mechanism, we analyzed several types of peripheral immune cells from 274 patients with ccRCC who have received radical or partial nephrectomy and 350 healthy people. Flow cytomety assays showed there was no significant difference in the proportions of CD8+ T cells and its subtypes other than CD45RO+/CD45RA+CD8+ cells. Both gene and protein expression levels of CD45RO in ccRCC tissues were decreased. CD45RO+CD8+ T cells showed increased proliferative abilities but decreased apoptotic abilities through MAPK signaling activation in ccRCC. High expression level of CD45RO+CD8+ T cells inhibited ccRCC progression, including proliferation, invasion, as well as autophagy of ccRCC through many signaling pathways. Bioinformatics and immunohistochemical chip analysis measured gene and protein levels of CD45RO and other related proteins. The combination of UCHL1, HMGB3, and CD36 has diagnostic value in ccRCC and is able to predict prognosis.

18829,Cooperative Binding of ETS2 and NFAT Links Erk1/2 and Calcineurin Signaling in the Pathogenesis of Cardiac Hypertrophy,2021-04-06,"BACKGROUND: Ascariasis and malaria are highly prevalent parasitic diseases in tropical regions and often have overlapping endemic areas, contributing to high morbidity and mortality rates in areas with poor sanitary conditions. Several studies have previously aimed to correlate the effects of Ascaris-Plasmodium coinfections but have obtained contradictory and inconclusive results. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate parasitological and immunopathological aspects of the lung during murine experimental concomitant coinfection by Plasmodium berghei and Ascaris suum during larvae ascariasis. METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were inoculated with 1 × 10(4) P. berghei strain NK65-NY-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) intraperitoneally and/or 2500 embryonated eggs of A. suum by oral gavage. P. berghei parasitaemia, morbidity and the survival rate were assessed. On the seventh day postinfection (dpi), A. suum lung burden analysis; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); histopathology; NAG, MPO and EPO activity measurements; haematological analysis; and respiratory mechanics analysis were performed. The concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-12/IL-23p40, IL-6, IL-4, IL-33, IL-13, IL-5, IL-10, IL-17A, IFN-γ, TNF and TGF-β were assayed by sandwich ELISA. RESULTS: Animals coinfected with P. berghei and A. suum show decreased production of type 1, 2, and 17 and regulatory cytokines; low leukocyte recruitment in the tissue; increased cellularity in the circulation; and low levels of NAG, MPO and EPO activity that lead to an increase in larvae migration, as shown by the decrease in larvae recovered in the lung parenchyma and increase in larvae recovered in the airway. This situation leads to severe airway haemorrhage and, consequently, an impairment respiratory function that leads to high morbidity and early mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the Ascaris-Plasmodium interaction is harmful to the host and suggests that this coinfection may potentiate Ascaris-associated pathology by dampening the Ascaris-specific immune response, resulting in the early death of affected animals.

NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations are recurrent in AML and clinically significant. NPM1 mutations are associated with a favourable prognosis, while FLT3-ITD mutations are an independent poor prognostic factor in AML. OBJECTIVE: This study described the prevalence and molecular characteristics of the NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations in a newly diagnosed AML patient cohort in central South Africa. METHODS: The study included 40 de novo AML patients. An NPM1 and FLT3-ITD multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay was optimised to screen patients for the respective mutations and were confirmed using Sanger sequencing. The prevalence of the NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations were determined, and mutation-specific characteristics were described in relation to patients’ demographic information and AML classifications. RESULTS: The patients’ median age was 38.5 years, with 77.5% (n = 31) of patients being self-proclaimed Black Africans. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities was most prevalent (57.5%; n = 23), of which acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) was most common (40.0%; n = 16). None of the patients had the NPM1 mutation. FLT3-ITD was present in 37.5% (6/16) of APL patients and in one (20.0%) of five AML patients with a t(8;21) translocation. Most patients had an FLT3-ITD allele ratio of ≥ 50% and ITD lengths of > 39 bp. CONCLUSION: FLT3-ITD mutations were mainly found in APL cases at a similar prevalence as reported in the literature. High FLT3-ITD allele ratios and long ITD lengths predominated.

First, the results validated the cointegration association among HEEXP, EC, FDI, GDP, TP, and CO(2)e. Second, the finding showed significant long-term negative nexus between HEEXP and CO(2)e. Third, the findings indicated that electricity consumption, foreign direct investment, gross domestic product, and total population are the important factors that intensify the overall situation of CO(2)e.

Chronotype or being a morning or evening person, has a specific physiological, behavioural, and also genetic manifestation. Whether and how chronotype modulates human brain physiology and cognition is, however, not well understood. Here we examine how cortical excitability, neuroplasticity, and cognition are associated with chronotype in early and late chronotype individuals. We monitor motor cortical excitability, brain stimulation-induced neuroplasticity, and examine motor learning and cognitive functions at circadian-preferred and non-preferred times of day in 32 individuals. Motor learning and cognitive performance (working memory, and attention) along with their electrophysiological components are significantly enhanced at the circadian-preferred, compared to the non-preferred time. This outperformance is associated with enhanced cortical excitability (prominent cortical facilitation, diminished cortical inhibition), and long-term potentiation/depression-like plasticity. Our data show convergent findings of how chronotype can modulate human brain functions from basic physiological mechanisms to behaviour and higher-order cognition.","Salehinejad, Mohammad Ali; Wischnewski, Miles; Ghanavati, Elham; Mosayebi-Samani, Mohsen; Kuo, Min-Fang; Nitsche, Michael A.",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8333420/,246

A comparative randomised clinical trial,2021-08-12,"Prolonged waiting to access health care is a primary concern for nations aiming for comprehensive effective care, due to its adverse effects on mortality, quality of life, and government approval. Here, we propose two novel bargaining frameworks to reduce waiting lists in two-tier health care systems with local and regional actors. In particular, we assess the impact of 1) trading patients on waiting lists among hospitals, the 2) introduction of the role of private hospitals in capturing unfulfilled demand, and the 3) hospitals’ willingness to share capacity on the system performance. We calibrated our models with 2008–2018 Chilean waiting list data. If hospitals trade unattended patients, our game-theoretic models indicate a potential reduction of waiting lists of up to 37%. However, when private hospitals are introduced into the system, we found a possible reduction of waiting lists of up to 60%. Further analyses revealed a trade-off between diagnosing unserved demand and the additional expense of using private hospitals as a back-up system. In summary, our game-theoretic frameworks of waiting list management in two-tier health systems suggest that public–private cooperation can be an effective mechanism to reduce waiting lists. Further empirical and prospective evaluations are needed.","Acuna, Jorge A.; Zayas-Castro, José L.; Feijoo, Felipe; Sankaranarayanan, Sriram; Martinez, Rodrigo; Martinez, Diego A.",Health Care Manag Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8367652/,246
20127,A Physio-Logging Journey: Heart Rates of the Emperor Penguin and Blue Whale,2021-08-03,"BACKGROUND: The causal relationship between insomnia and migraine is contradictory and no study has been carried out among the Chinese population to date. METHODS: In this case, we conducted a case–control study and a bidirectional mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to determine whether insomnia is causally related to the development of migraine. The instrumental variables for insomnia were derived from the largest genome-wide association study of 1,331,010 participants, while the genetic instruments for migraine were available from the largest meta-analysis of migraine with 59,674 cases and 316,078 controls. RESULTS: In case–control study, subjects with insomnia have significantly higher risk of migraine (OR=4.29, 95% CI: 3.21–5.74, P<0.001), compared with those without insomnia. The bidirectional two-sample MR analysis revealed that insomnia was significantly associated with higher risk of migraine (OR=1.24, 95% CI: 1.11–1.38, P=1.01×10-4), and the results were validated in the UK Biobank data. The results showed no indication for directional pleiotropy effects as assessed by the MR-Egger intercept (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Conclusively, our study highlighted that increased migraine risk was confined to subjects with a genetic pre-disposition to insomnia, and these findings had potential implications for improving the sleep quality to reduce the burden of migraine.","Chu, Shujuan; Wu, Zhilin; Wu, Zhouyang; Wu, Jing; Qian, Yue",Pharmgenomics Pers Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8370591/,246
20163,Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension: the Bedside,2021-08-19,"Immunotherapies play critical roles in cancer treatment. However, given that only a few patients respond to immune checkpoint blockades and other immunotherapeutic strategies, more novel technologies are needed to decipher the complicated interplay between tumor cells and the components of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Tumor immunomics refers to the integrated study of the TIME using immunogenomics, immunoproteomics, immune-bioinformatics, and other multi-omics data reflecting the immune states of tumors, which has relied on the rapid development of next-generation sequencing. High-throughput genomic and transcriptomic data may be utilized for calculating the abundance of immune cells and predicting tumor antigens, referring to immunogenomics. However, as bulk sequencing represents the average characteristics of a heterogeneous cell population, it fails to distinguish distinct cell subtypes. Single-cell-based technologies enable better dissection of the TIME through precise immune cell subpopulation and spatial architecture investigations. In addition, radiomics and digital pathology-based deep learning models largely contribute to research on cancer immunity. These artificial intelligence technologies have performed well in predicting response to immunotherapy, with profound significance in cancer therapy. In this review, we briefly summarize conventional and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of immunogenomics, single-cell and artificial intelligence, and present prospects for future research.","Xu, Ying; Su, Guan-Hua; Ma, Ding; Xiao, Yi; Shao, Zhi-Ming; Jiang, Yi-Zhou",Signal Transduct Target Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8377461/,246

Currently, the gold standard for sepsis diagnosis is a positive blood culture, which takes 48–72 h to yield results. We hypothesized that identifying differentially expressed miRNA pattern in neonates with late-onset Gram-positive sepsis would help with an earlier diagnosis and therapy. Methods. This is a prospective observational study in newborn infants with late-onset Gram positive bacterial sepsis and non-septic controls. Complementary to blood culture, an aliquot of 0.5 mL of blood was used to determine small non-coding RNA expression profiling using the GeneChip miRNA 4.0 Array. Results. A total of 11 very low birth-weight neonates with late-onset Gram-positive sepsis and 16 controls were analyzed. Further, 217 differentially expressed miRNAs were obtained between both groups. Subsequently, a combined analysis was performed with these miRNAs and 4297 differentially expressed genes. We identified 33 miRNAs that regulate our mRNAs, and the most relevant biological processes are associated with the immune system and the inflammatory response. Conclusions. The miRNA profiling in very low birth-weight neonates distinguishes late-onset Gram-positive sepsis versus control neonates.","Serna, Eva; Parra-Llorca, Anna; Panadero, Joaquín; Vento, Máximo; Cernada, María",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8391178/,246

Andean microbial ecosystems isolated from these environments are of exceptional biodiversity enduring multiple severe conditions. Furthermore, the polyextremophilic nature of the microbes in such ecosystems indicates the potential for biotechnological applications. Within this context, the study undertaken used genome mining, physiological and microscopical characterization to reveal the multiresistant profile of Nesterenkonia sp. Act20, an actinobacterium isolated from the soil surrounding Lake Socompa, Salta, Argentina (3570 masl). Ultravioet-B, desiccation, and copper assays revealed the strain’s exceptional resistance to all these conditions. Act20’s genome presented coding sequences involving resistance to antibiotics, low temperatures, ultraviolet radiation, arsenic, nutrient-limiting conditions, osmotic stress, low atmospheric-oxygen pressure, heavy-metal stress, and toxic fluoride and chlorite. Act20 can also synthesize proteins and natural products such as an insecticide, bacterial cellulose, ectoine, bacterial hemoglobin, and even antibiotics like colicin V and aurachin C.

The aim of this study was to investigate circulatory disturbances in PCAS by assessing the circulatory trajectory during treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: This was a prospective single-center observational cohort study of patients after OHCA. Circulation was continuously and invasively monitored from the time of admission through the following five days. Every hour, patients were classified into one of three predefined circulatory states, yielding a longitudinal sequence of states for each patient. We used sequence analysis to describe the overall circulatory development and to identify clusters of patients with similar circulatory trajectories. We used ordered logistic regression to identify predictors for cluster membership. RESULTS: Among 71 patients admitted to the ICU after OHCA during the study period, 50 were included in the study. The overall circulatory development after OHCA was two-phased. Low cardiac output (CO) and high systemic vascular resistance (SVR) characterized the initial phase, whereas high CO and low SVR characterized the later phase. Most patients were stabilized with respect to circulatory state within 72 h after cardiac arrest. We identified four clusters of circulatory trajectories. Initial shockable cardiac rhythm was associated with a favorable circulatory trajectory, whereas low base excess at admission was associated with an unfavorable circulatory trajectory. CONCLUSION: Circulatory failure after OHCA exhibits time-dependent characteristics. We identified four distinct circulatory trajectories and their characteristics. These findings may guide clinical support for circulatory failure after OHCA.

In addition to their other pharmacological targets, both THC and CBD are competitive inhibitors of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT-1), a primary inactivation mechanism for adenosine, and thereby increase adenosine signaling. The goal of this study was to examine the role of adenosine A2A receptor activation in the effects of intraperitoneally administered THC alone and in combination with CBD or PECS-101, a 4′-fluorinated derivative of CBD, in the cannabinoid tetrad, elevated plus maze (EPM) and marble bury assays. Comparisons between wild-type (WT) and A2AR knock out (A2AR-KO) mice were made. The cataleptic effects of THC were diminished in A2AR-KO; no other THC behaviors were affected by A2AR deletion. CBD (5 mg/kg) potentiated the cataleptic response to THC (5 mg/kg) in WT but not A2AR-KO. Neither CBD nor THC alone affected EPM behavior; their combination produced a significant increase in open/closed arm time in WT but not A2AR-KO. Both THC and CBD reduced the number of marbles buried in A2AR-KO but not WT mice. Like CBD, PECS-101 potentiated the cataleptic response to THC in WT but not A2AR-KO mice. PECS-101 also reduced exploratory behavior in the EPM in both genotypes. These results support the hypothesis that CBD and PECS-101 can potentiate the cataleptic effects of THC in a manner consistent with increased endogenous adenosine signaling.","Stollenwerk, Todd M.; Pollock, Samantha; Hillard, Cecilia J.",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8434367/,246

The aim of the study was to examine and compare the health-related quality of life of people living with HIV in Romania and Spain, compared to the general populations of each country. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among adults (≥ 18 years) attending for HIV care in Romania and Spain from October 2019 to March 2020. The survey included two validated HRQoL instruments: a generic instrument, EQ-5D-5L, and an HIV-specific instrument, PozQoL, and questions on socio-demographics, HIV-related characteristics, physical and mental health conditions, and substance use. Multivariable linear regression was used to determine factors associated with HRQoL. RESULTS: 570 people living with HIV responded (170 in Romania and 400 in Spain). The median age was 31 (18–67) in Romania and 52 (19–83) in Spain. Anxiety/depression symptoms were frequently reported by people with HIV (Romania: 50% vs 30% in the Romanian population; Spain: 38% vs 15% in Spanish population). Spain reported higher mean EQ-5D(utility) scores than Romania (0.88 and 0.85, respectively) but identical PozQoL scores (3.5, on a scale of 0–5). In both countries, health concerns were highlighted as a key issue for people with HIV. In multivariable analysis, two factors were consistently associated with worse HRQoL in people with HIV: bad or very bad self-rated health status and presence of a mental health condition. In Romania, being gay/bisexual and being disabled/unemployed were associated with worse HRQoL. Whereas in Spain, older age and financial insecurity were significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated a good HRQoL for people living with HIV in Romania and Spain; however, worse HRQoL profiles were characterized by health concerns, poor self-rated health status, and the presence of mental health conditions. This study highlights the importance of monitoring HRQoL in people living with HIV due to the chronic nature of the disease. In this highly-treatment experienced group, disparities were found, particularly highlighting mental health as an area which needs more attention to improve the well-being of people living with HIV.","Kall, Meaghan; Fresán, Ujué; Guy, Danielle; Brown, Graham; Burgui, Cristina; Castilla, Jesús; Grecu, Victor Ionel; Dumitrescu, Florentina; Delpech, Valerie; Lazarus, Jeffrey V.",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8436864/,246

To investigate the roles of protein methyltransferases and demethylases in RIG-I antiviral signaling pathway, we screened all the known related enzymes with a siRNA library and identified LSD1 as a positive regulator for RIG-I signaling. Exogenous expression of LSD1 enhances RIG-I signaling activated by virus stimulation, whereas its deficiency restricts it. LSD1 interacts with RIG-I, promotes its K63-linked polyubiquitination and interaction with VISA/MAVS. Interestingly, LSD1 exerts its function in antiviral response not dependent on its demethylase activity but through enhancing the interaction between RIG-I with E3 ligases, especially TRIM25. Furthermore, we provide in vivo evidence that LSD1 increases antiviral gene expression and inhibits viral replication. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that LSD1 is a positive regulator of signaling pathway triggered by RNA-virus through mediating RIG-I polyubiquitination.","Hu, Qi-Xin; Wang, Hui-Yi; Jiang, Lu; Wang, Chen-Yu; Ju, Lin-Gao; Zhu, Yuan; Zhong, Bo; Wu, Min; Wang, Zhen; Li, Lian-Yun",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8445485/,246

Knowledge and practice of ethnobotany help to investigate the pharmacological basis of culturally important species of medical value. Traditional knowledge (TK) exists in local indigenous communities and has been passed down over generations as part of community identity. This research attempts to study the plant diversity of medical importance and traditional knowledge interpretation in the Himalayas. This work discloses rich ethnomedicinal knowledge linked with the people residing in the remote location of Northwestern Himalaya. The study justifies the medicinal plants prospective and the inherent knowledge of the local communities. It contains the raw interpretation of 107 high-altitude plants used for disease remedies by taking advantage of the knowledge of the young and old people of the targeted area. The obtained results provide substantial guidance in designating and obtaining the plant material for potential therapeutic interest, as well as sustaining and maintaining the natural ecosystem of the area. It also shows an impetus in discovering the baseline primary data for molecules which would contribute to future drug discovery and disease management, apart from conserving the gene pool of Himalaya and elsewhere in the world. ABSTRACT: The present study was carried out to enlist the medicinal plants used by the local inhabitants of developing countries such as India, and the district of Kupwara of the Kashmir Himalaya has been targeted. Our research is one of the first study focusing on the statistical evaluation of the cross-cultural analysis between three different communities i.e., Dard, Kashmiri and Gujjar, of the study area. Sampling was carried out in eight villages in 2017 to 2020, and data were collected from 102 informants based on walking transects, to collect plant specimens, and semi-structured interviews. The medical usages of all collected taxa were grouped into 15 disease categories and 81 biomedical ailments. In this study, we documented around 107 plant taxa belonging to 52 families from the local inhabitants of the Kashmir Himalaya, which regulate the livelihood of the people and support cultural ecosystem services. Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Lamiaceae, Malvaceae, Ranunculaceae, Poaceae, Solanaceae, Polygonaceae, Plantaginaceae and Brassicaceae are the top most dominant families. Herbaceous groups of plants were more common than trees and shrubs, and 71.96% of herb taxa were employed as medicine. Liliaceae, Caprifoliaceae and Portulacaceae (FUV = 0.24 each) have the highest family use value (FUV). The most prominent family was Asteraceae (seven genera, nine taxa), followed by Rosaceae and Lamiaceae (six genera, six taxa each). Persicaria Mill., Rheum L., Aconitum L. and Artemisia L. were prominent genera. Valeriana jatamansi Jones ex Roxb. (47UR), Fritillaria cirrhosa D. Don (45UR), Arisaema jacquemontii Blume (37UR), Asparagus racemosus Willd. (36UR) and Rumex acetosa L. (35UR) were the most important plant taxa with reference to use-reports. The ethnomedicinal applications of Aesculus indica Wall. ex Cambess., Solanum pseudocapsicum L., Ranunculus hirtellus Royle and Cormus domestica (L.) Spach plant taxa are reported here for the first time from the Himalayan Kashmiri people. We recommend further research on ethnopharmacological application of these newly recorded ethnobotanical plants. The medical usage of the plant was limited to different parts of the plant. In terms of the usage percentage, whole plant (26.17%), leaves (24.30%) and roots (19.63%) were found to have the highest utilization. The powder form (40.19%) was the most frequently employed method of drug/medicine preparation, followed by the utilization of extracted juice and/or other extracts (22.43%). The ICF values range from 0.85 to 1.00. Their use to remedy parasitic problems (PAR) and insect bites (IB) (ICF = 1.0 each) had the maximum consensus mentioned by the informants, although the number of taxa employed under this category was very limited. The different plant taxa used for the treatment of the gastrointestinal problems (GAS) was the most prominent disease category (262 URs, 16.19%, 25 taxa, ICF = 0.90). About 65% of the plant taxa studied is indigenous to the Asia or Himalayan regions, and around 35% is found to be exotic in nature. A strong positive correlation was found between age, gender, educational qualification and medicinal plant knowledge. No significant association was between people of different communities interviewed in terms of medical knowledge of the plants, p = 0.347 (>0.05) and χ(2) = 2.120. No significant difference was found between the number of species documented concerning gender as p = 0.347 (>0.05) and χ(2) =0.885. This study provides the comprehensive status of ethnomedicinal knowledge among three different communities of the study area. This study provided an impetus in discovering the baseline primary data for molecules which would help in drug discovery and management of various diseases, apart from conserving the genepool of plants in the investigated area.","Bhat, Mudasir Nazir; Singh, Bikarma; Surmal, Opender; Singh, Bishander; Shivgotra, Vijay; Musarella, Carmelo Maria",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8465354/,246

Various factors have been found to influence the hedonic eating experience and thereby influence eating behaviour, and each factor can be regarded a piece that contributes to parts of the total picture of the hedonic response to food. As a result, the literature on the hedonic response to food-related experiences is comprehensive, but at the same time rather fragmented; and importantly, it is not clear how individuals/segments differ in key drivers of their hedonic experience and the extent to which food pleasure is perceived. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for the development of a scale (self-report questionnaire) to measure the qualitative and quantitative aspects of food-related pleasure, the Food Pleasure Scale. We introduce the concept of (an)hedonia and scales developed in the past for its measurement, identify the spectrum of characteristics influencing food-related pleasure and explain the relevance of developing such a scale. Based on this theoretical framework, a strategy for the development of the Food Pleasure Scale is proposed.","Andersen, Barbara Vad; Chan, Raymond C.

While oral anticoagulation is strongly recommended for atrial fibrillation, there are marked variations in guideline recommendations for HFrEF due to uncertainty about net clinical benefit. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the comparative association of oral anticoagulation with stroke and other cardiovascular risk in populations with atrial fibrillation or HFrEF in sinus rhythm and identify factors mediating different estimates of net clinical benefit. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched from database inception to November 20, 2019 for randomized clinical trials comparing oral anticoagulation to control. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate a pooled treatment-effect overall and within atrial fibrillation and HFrEF trials. Differences in treatment effect were assessed by estimating I(2) among all trials and testing the between-trial-population P-interaction. The primary outcome measure was all stroke. Secondary outcome measures were ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, mortality, myocardial infarction, and major hemorrhage. RESULTS: Twenty-one trials were eligible for inclusion, 15 (n=19 332) in atrial fibrillation (mean follow-up: 23.1 months), and 6 (n=9866) in HFrEF (mean follow-up: 23.9 months). There were differences in primary outcomes between trial populations, with all-cause mortality included for 95.2% of HFrEF trial population versus 0.38% for atrial fibrillation. Mortality was higher in controls groups of HFrEF populations (19.0% versus 9.6%) but rates of stroke lower (3.1% versus 7.0%) compared with atrial fibrillation. The association of oral anticoagulation with all stroke was consistent for atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.42–0.63]) and HFrEF (odds ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.47–0.79]; I(2)=12.4%; P interaction=0.31). There were no statistically significant differences in the association of oral anticoagulation with cardiovascular events, mortality or bleeding between populations. CONCLUSIONS: The relative association of oral anticoagulation with stroke risk, and other cardiovascular outcomes, is similar for patients with atrial fibrillation and HFrEF. Differences in the primary outcomes employed by trials in HFrEF, compared with atrial fibrillation, may have contributed to differing conclusions of the relative efficacy of oral anticoagulation.","Reddin, Catriona; Judge, Conor; Loughlin, Elaine; Murphy, Robert; Costello, Maria; Alvarez, Alberto; Ferguson, John; Smyth, Andrew; Canavan, Michelle; O’Donnell, Martin J.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8478106/,246
23821,10 Acute bovenbuikpijn,2005,"Virus encoded ion channels, termed viroporins, are expressed by a diverse set of viruses and have been found to target nearly every host cell membrane and compartment, including endocytic/exocytic vesicles, ER, mitochondria, Golgi, and the plasma membrane. Viroporins are generally very small (<100 amino acids) integral membrane proteins that share common structure motifs (conserved cluster of basic residues adjacent to an amphipathic alpha-helix) but only limited sequence homology between viruses. Ion channel activity of viroporins is either required for replication or greatly enhances replication and pathogenesis. Channel characteristics have been investigated using standard electrophysiological techniques, including planar lipid bilayer, liposome patch clamp or whole-cell voltage clamp. In general, viroporins are voltage-independent non-specific monovalent cation channels, with the exception of the influenza A virus M2 channel that forms a highly specific proton channel due to a conserved HXXXW motif. Viroporin channel currents range between highly variable (‘burst-like’) fluctuations to well resolved unitary (‘square-top’) transitions, and emerging data indicates the quality of channel activity is influenced by many factors, including viroporin synthesis/solubilization, the lipid environment and the ionic composition of the buffers, as well as intrinsic differences between the viroporins themselves. Compounds that block viroporin channel activity are effective antiviral drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly distinct viroporins are inhibited by the same compounds (e.g., amantadines and amiloride derivatives), despite wide sequence divergence, raising the possibility of broadly acting antiviral drugs that target viroporins. Electrophysiology of viroporins will continue to play a critical role in elucidating the functional roles viroporins play in pathogenesis and to develop new drugs to combat viroporin-encoding pathogens.","Hyser, Joseph M.",Electrophysiology of Unconventional Channels and Pores,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119924/,246

When we began this book, there were bombings at the end of the Boston Marathon of 2013, an army coup in Egypt that overthrew the first democratically elected government, an armed conflict in Syria, the President of North Korea made bellicose threats against South Korea and the USA , and the shrinking of the Arctic ice sheet that was implicated in the extreme winter weather that the UK has faced in 2012–2013. ‘The war on terror’, the age of austerity, global warming and consequent climatic instability, disparities in wealth, and other issues add to the sense that social institutions are unable to cope with the major problems that the world faces. It is certainly the case, on the one hand, that states around the world are under enormous fiscal pressure, in large part brought about by the banking failures of 2008, which heralded the end of a long period of conspicuous consumption and an era of deregulation.

The core of the toolkit is a compact and easy to extend Prolog-based automated theorem prover called plCoP. plCoP builds on the leanCoP Prolog implementation and adds learning-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search as done in the rlCoP system. Other components include a Python interface to plCoP and machine learners, and an external proof checker that verifies the validity of plCoP proofs. The toolkit is evaluated on two benchmarks and we demonstrate its extendability by two additions: (1) guidance is extended to reduction steps and (2) the standard leanCoP calculus is extended with rewrite steps and their learned guidance. We argue that the Prolog setting is suitable for combining statistical and symbolic learning methods. The complete toolkit is publicly released.","Zombori, Zsolt; Urban, Josef; Brown, Chad E.",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324016/,246

One important step for drug development is the profound understanding of the structural determinants defining the substrate selectivity of each transporter. Recently, the improvement of computational power and experimental methods such as X-ray and cryo-EM crystallography permitted to conduct structure-based studies on specific transporters having important pharmacological impact. However, a lot remains to be discovered regarding their dynamics, transport modulation and ligand recognition. A detailed functional characterization of transporters would provide opportunities to develop new compounds targeting these key drug targets. Here, we are giving an overview of two major human LeuT-fold families, SLC6 and SLC7, with an emphasis on the most relevant members of each family for drug development. We gather the most recent understanding on the structural determinants of selectivity within and across the two families. We then use this information to discuss the benefits of a more generalized structural and functional annotation of the LeuT fold and the implications of such mapping for drug discovery.","Colas, Claire",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7466448/,246

39979,Very low birth weight infants receive full enteral nutrition within 2 postnatal weeks,2020-09-29,"Taxonomic mycology struggles with what seems to be a perpetual shortage of resources. Logically, fungal taxonomists should therefore leverage every opportunity to highlight and visualize the importance of taxonomic work, the usefulness of taxonomic data far beyond taxonomy, and the integrative and collaborative nature of modern taxonomy at large. Is mycology really doing that, though? In this study, we went through ten years’ worth (2009–2018) of species descriptions of extant fungal taxa – 1,097 studies describing at most ten new species – in five major mycological journals plus one plant journal. We estimated the frequency at which a range of key words, illustrations, and concepts related to ecology, geography, taxonomy, molecular data, and data availability were provided with the descriptions. We also considered a range of science-demographical aspects such as gender bias and the rejuvenation of taxonomy and taxonomists as well as public availability of the results. Our results show that the target audience of fungal species descriptions appears to be other fungal taxonomists, because many aspects of the new species were presented only implicitly, if at all. Although many of the parameters we estimated show a gradual, and in some cases marked, change for the better over time, they still paint a somewhat bleak picture of mycological taxonomy as a male-dominated field where the wants and needs of an extended target audience are often not understood or even considered. This study hopes to leave a mark on the way fungal species are described by putting the focus on ways in which fungal taxonomy can better anticipate the end users of species descriptions – be they mycologists, other researchers, the public at large, or even algorithms. In the end, fungal taxonomy, too, is likely to benefit from such measures.","Durkin, Louisa; Jansson, Tobias; Sanchez, Marisol; Khomich, Maryia; Ryberg, Martin; Kristiansson, Erik; Nilsson, R.

44277,Adjuvant High-Flow Normobaric Oxygen After Mechanical Thrombectomy for Anterior Circulation Stroke: a Randomized Clinical Trial,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at heightened risk of exposure to respiratory pathogens. There are limited published data on influenza-like illness (ILI) experience among HCWs, and the few available studies were hampered by incomplete vaccination histories. PAIVED, a multicenter, multiservice study assessing influenza vaccine effectiveness in the Department of Defense, provides a unique opportunity to describe ILI experience among vaccinated HCWs compared to vaccinated non-HCWs. METHODS: PAIVED participants were randomized to receive either egg-based, cell-based, or recombinant-derived influenza vaccine then surveyed weekly for ILI. At enrollment, participants provided key demographic data including whether they were HCWs with direct patient contact. ILI was defined a priori as 1) having cough or sore throat plus 2) feeling feverish/having chills or having body aches/fatigue. Participants with ILI completed a daily symptom diary for seven days and submitted a nasal swab for pathogen detection. RESULTS: Of 4433 eligible participants enrolled during the 2019-20 influenza season, 1551 (35%) were HCWs. A higher percentage of HCWs experienced an ILI than non-HCWs (34% vs 26%, p< 0.001). Overall, HCWs were more likely to be female (42% vs 32%), age 25-34 years (39% vs 28%), active-duty military (81% vs 62%), non-smokers (88% vs 75%), and physically active (92% vs 85%). Self-reported race differed between HCWs and non-HCWs; a higher proportion of HCWs identified as White (63% vs 56%) or Asian (8% vs 5%). Similar demographic differences existed among HCWs and non-HCWs with ILI. HCWs were more likely to respond to at least 50% of weekly surveillance messages, irrespective of ILI status. HCWs with ILI had less severe lower respiratory symptoms (p< 0.001) and a shorter duration of illness (12.4±8.1 days vs 13.7±9.0, p=0.005) than non-HCWs. Pathogen data is pending. CONCLUSION: HCWs in PAIVED were more likely to report ILI than their non-HCW counterparts yet tended to have lower illness severity, possibly reflecting a higher level of baseline health or enhanced awareness of early ILI symptoms. The important epidemiologic position HCWs occupy for ILI has been apparent in the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploring ways to mitigate ILI risk in HCWs beyond influenza vaccination is warranted.

44448,Racial disparities in mortality after severe traumatic brain injury in childhood: mediators identified by Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition of trauma registry data,2021-01-11,"BACKGROUND: As the number of people living with dementia grows, so does the need to provide them with adequate psychosocial support. Many people with dementia live at home with family carers, who also require social and emotional support to cope with their role. Community group singing has received attention for its potential to support people with dementia and their carers. It is postulated that singing can improve cognitive function, strengthen the bonds between care partners and help to establish social support networks. However, there is a lack of rigorous evidence of singing’s benefits for this population. This study aims to test the feasibility of a randomised controlled trial of community singing in dementia, to pave the way for a larger, conclusive study. METHODS: The PRESIDE study is designed as a two-arm, parallel-group randomised trial with a waiting list control. Dyads consisting of a person with dementia (n = 80) and their carer (n = 80) will be recruited. Each dyad will be randomised either to attend 10 weeks of community group singing sessions straight away or to wait for 3 months before attending the sessions. The singing sessions will be led by experienced professional musicians and will last about 90 min, including time for socialising. The primary outcome of this study is the attainment of feasibility criteria around recruitment, retention and the acceptability of the waiting list control. Secondary outcomes include the quality of life, mood, cognition, and musical engagement of the person with dementia, and quality of life, mood, and experiences/challenges of the carer. These data will be collected during home visits at baseline, and 3 and 6 months post-baseline. DISCUSSION: Despite growing public interest in the positive effects of singing, and encouraging findings from qualitative and non-randomised quantitative studies, there is a lack of rigorous evidence. This is the first randomised controlled trial of community group singing for people with dementia in Europe, to our knowledge. If the results favour a full trial, conclusively demonstrating the effectiveness of group singing could positively affect the opportunities available to community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers.

The phase component is often discarded as it is more sample specific, and thus more sensitive to noise, than the amplitude. However, in general, the phase component also carries information relevant to the underlying biological processes. In fact, in this paper we show the benefits of learning the coupling of both phase and amplitude components of a bio-signal. We do so by introducing a novel self-supervised learning task, which we call phase-swap, that detects if bio-signals have been obtained by merging the amplitude and phase from different sources. We show in our evaluation that neural networks trained on this task generalize better across subjects and recording sessions than their fully supervised counterpart.","Lemkhenter, Abdelhak; Favaro, Paolo",Pattern Recognition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972696/,246

While previous works have leveraged conditional generative models like GANs and VAEs for learning the likely future trajectories, accurately modeling the dependency structure of these multimodal distributions, particularly over long time horizons remains challenging. Normalizing flow based generative models can model complex distributions admitting exact inference. These include variants with split coupling invertible transformations that are easier to parallelize compared to their autoregressive counterparts. To this end, we introduce a novel Haar wavelet based block autoregressive model leveraging split couplings, conditioned on coarse trajectories obtained from Haar wavelet based transformations at different levels of granularity. This yields an exact inference method that models trajectories at different spatio-temporal resolutions in a hierarchical manner. We illustrate the advantages of our approach for generating diverse and accurate trajectories on two real-world datasets – Stanford Drone and Intersection Drone.

Consequently, pharmaceutical companies are transitioning away from outdated batch lines, in large part motivated by the many advantages of continuous manufacturing (e.g., low cost, quality assurance, shortened lead time). As chemical reactions are fundamental to any drug production process, the selection of reactor and its design are critical to enhanced performance such as improved selectivity and yield. In this article, relevant theories, and models, as well as their required input data are summarized to assist the reader in these tasks, focusing on continuous reactions. Selected examples that describe the application of plug flow reactors (PFRs) and continuous-stirred tank reactors (CSTRs)-in-series within the pharmaceutical industry are provided. Process analytical technologies (PATs), which are important tools that provide real-time in-line continuous monitoring of reactions, are recommended to be considered during the reactor design process (e.g., port design for the PAT probe). Finally, other important points, such as density change caused by thermal expansion or solid precipitation, clogging/fouling, and scaling-up, are discussed.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 1029 adults recruited online through social media, website and newsletter of the Spanish Society of Community Nutrition (SENC) in a snowball procedure. The protocol used a 10-section questionnaire, including sociodemographic characteristics of participants (gender, age group, occupation), reported changes in dietary habits (22 Likert type items), and physical activity (PA), self-reported body weight and height as well as reported change in body weight. Body Mass Index (BMI) was computed to estimate prevalence of overweight (BMI ≥ 25) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30). A score of dietary change was computed compared to the Spanish Dietary Guidelines (DG) (Score ≥ 6: greater adherence to DGs). Binomial logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association between sociodemographic factors, dietary change score, change in PA, and overweight or obesity with weight gain during confinement. Responses were collected during the de-escalation phase towards the so-called “new normal”, June 7–26, 2020 (weeks 13–15 since COVID-19 lockdown restrictions started in Spain). RESULTS: In this study, 1029 individuals (74% female) accepted to participate and provided valid responses. 37.7% (95%CI 34.8–40.8) reported weight gain during confinement, mean weight gain 2.8 ± 1.4 kg, significantly higher among overweight (3.1 ± 1.5 kg) and obese (3.5 ± 1.5 kg) subjects. Adjusted for age and occupation, increased body weight was more likely in women OR 1.50 (95%IC 1.03–2.19), overweight OR 3.12(IC95% 2.23–4.36) or obese subjects OR 3.13 (IC95% 1.89–5.18) less active than usual in confinement OR 2.16 (1.60–2.92), but less likely for those with dietary change score ≥6, OR 0.60 (IC95% 0.42–0.85). CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of adults in Spain reported weight gain during confinement, significantly higher in overweight subjects. Female gender, being overweight or obese and being less physically active were factors positively associated to weight gain in COVID-19 confinement. Changes in lifestyles during lockdown can negatively influence the evolution of chronic diseases and risk factors in many people.

Study group, i.e., O + C received five alternate day sessions of ozone therapy by bagging method for 30 minutes each session. Both groups were observed for 30 days for wound healing parameters like reduction of wound surface area, wound diameter, presence and character of discharge, granulation tissue, healing wound edges, microbial negativity, and requirement of revision (re-debridement and/or amputation) surgery. Mean baseline ulcer surface area is 17.43 ± 8.6 cm (2) for C and 17.87 ± 9.2 cm (2) (range 1–50 cm (2) ) in O + C group. Percentage change in ulcer surface after 21 days in O + C group is 32.37% compared with 17.15% in C group, which is statistically significant ( p = 0.01). Rates of microbial negativity and ulcer healing were significantly faster in ozone group. There was a statistically significant decrease in hospital stay, number of revision surgeries required, and mortality in ozone group. Topical ozone gas was well tolerated.

Using two city pairs—Blagoveshchensk/Heihe and Khabarovsk/Fuyuan—as case studies, the article reveals that owing to the altered structure of tourist flows after the 2014 devaluation of the ruble, Russian and Chinese border cities have customized their services for Chinese tourists. Fieldwork data and data collected from the media analysis allowed mapping the service sector openness of border cities and demonstrating that central districts of border cities concentrate the majority of businesses catering to clients from the neighboring state. This finding confirms the role of central districts of border cities as thermometers of cross-border dynamics as they react first to fluctuations in exchange rates and tourist flows. Based on an assessment of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cross-border flows and the tourism industry at the Russian–Chinese borderland, it was concluded that an earlier reorientation towards domestic tourists (after 2014) allowed Heihe and Fuyuan to be more prepared for the next external shock. The tourism industry in Blagoveshchensk and Khabarovsk suffered significant losses and found itself in a situation of high uncertainty, in which it was impossible to predict the timing of resumed arrivals of Chinese tourists.","Mikhailova, E.

Negative health seeking behavior was observed among 70.8% of the participants. Purpose of the trip and duration of destination were significantly associated with health seeking behavior. Knowledge, attitude towards health information seeking behavior and practice-related to travel health among international travelers at King Abdulaziz International airport are insufficient.","Alkadi, Wardah; Salih, Sarah; Al Darbi, Mohammed",J Family Med Prim Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8483095/,246

59172,Daily chronic headache due to giant cell arteritis post COVID-19: Case report,2021-10-08,"This article examines the impact of COVID-19 on the livelihoods of widows and other single women farmers from the most backward districts of Maharashtra, a state in western India. COVID-19 led to food insecurity, loss of farm incomes, decline in employment opportunities and increased debt traps for single women farmers. The paper highlights how agrarian distress and pre-existing inequalities of class, caste and gender in access to food, incomes, credit, land, markets, and decision making, were exacerbated during the pandemic, further impoverishing these women farmers. To trace these effects, the paper draws on two types of evidence gathered in Maharashtra by MAKAAM, an informal all-India women farmer’s forum: observations during multiple rounds of interactions with over a hundred women farmers during the COVID-support work of providing ration and seeds undertaken by MAKAAM during India’s national lockdown in 2020, and a subsequent large-scale survey covering about a thousand women. The paper also focuses on the inadequacy of state response, both in terms of providing relief and in its ability to partner with women’s collectives and grassroots organisations for better outcomes. The article makes a case for strengthening social security measures for women farmers and enhancing their access to productive resources, agricultural programmes and decision-making spaces in relevant institutions.","Kulkarni, Seema; Bhat, Sneha; Harshe, Pallavi; Satpute, Swati",Econ Polit,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8506092/,246

Although more than 200 species in 32 genera have been described for the asellote isopod families Desmosomatidae Sars, 1897 and Nannoniscidae Hansen, 1916 from all ocean basins, their phylogenetic relationships are not completely understood. There is little doubt about the close relationship of these families, but the taxonomic position of a number of genera is so far unknown. Based on a combined morphological phylogeny using the Hennigian method with a dataset of 107 described species and a molecular phylogeny based on three markers (COI, 16S, and 18S) with 75 species (most new to science), we could separate Desmosomatidae and Nannoniscidae as separate families. However, we could not support the concept of the subfamilies Eugerdellatinae Hessler, 1970 and Desmosomatinae Hessler, 1970. Most genera of both families were well supported, but several genera appear as para- or even polyphyletic. Within both families, convergent evolution and analogies caused difficulty in defining apomorphies for phylogenetic reconstructions and this is reflected in the results of the concatenated molecular tree. There is no biogeographic pattern in the distribution as the genera occur over the entire Atlantic and Pacific Ocean, showing no specific phylogeographical pattern. Poor resolution at deep desmosomatid nodes may reflect the long evolutionary history of the family and rapid evolutionary radiations.

Vaccines play an essential role in preventing the spread. However, almost all types of vaccines have been reported to be associated with adverse events. Reactive arthritis (ReA) after vaccination has been reported; however, ReA after COVID-19 vaccination has not been reported. We reported a 23-year-old woman who suffered from an acute ReA on her left knee joint after COVID-19 vaccination and discussed the etiology and preventive strategy. She presented with swollen, painful left knee joint for 18 d. She had been inoculated 0.5 ml CoronaVac vaccine on 0 d and the 14th day with deltoid intramuscular injection. Finally, she was diagnosed as ReA after CoronaVac vaccination and was administered a single intra-articular injection of 1 ml compound betamethasone. The swelling and pain nearly disappeared after 2 d. On 1month follow-up, her condition was normal. ReA after COVID-19 vaccination is rare. The benefits of vaccination far outweigh its potential risks and vaccination should be administered according to the current recommendations. Further attentions should be put to determine which individual is at higher risk for developing autoimmune diseases after COVID-19 vaccination. More versatile and safer vaccines should be explored.","An, Qi-Jun; Qin, De-An; Pei, Jin-Xian",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1920274; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34033732/,246

The current pandemic crisis has fueled the development in an unprecedented way. More and more psychiatric consultations are now carried out online as video-based consultations. Treatment results appear to be comparable with those of face-to-face care in terms of clinical outcome, acceptance, adherence and patient satisfaction. However, evidence on videoconferencing in a variety of different fields indicates that there are extensive changes in the communication behaviour in online conversations. We hypothesise that this might impact ethically relevant aspects of the therapeutic relationship, which plays a prominent role in psychiatry. In this paper, we review effects of video-based consultations on communication between therapists and patients in psychiatry. Based on a common understanding of video-based consultations as changing the lived experience of communication, we categorise these effects according to sensory, spatial and technical aspects. Departing from a power-based model of therapeutic relationships, we then discuss the ethical significance of this changed communication situation, based on dimensions of respect for autonomy, lucidity, fidelity, justice and humanity. We conclude that there is evidence for ethically relevant changes of the therapeutic relationship in video-based telepsychiatric consultations. These changes need to be more carefully considered in psychiatric practice and future studies.","Frittgen, Eva-Maria; Haltaufderheide, Joschka",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610979/,246

60443,Peripheral artery disease and unusual skin findings.,2020-10-01,OBJECTIVE Implementation of faecal immunochemical tests (FIT) as a triage test in primary healthcare may improve the efficiency of referrals without missing cases of colorectal cancer (CRC). We aim to summarise the performance characteristics of FITs for CRC in symptomatic patients presenting to primary healthcare. DESIGN We performed a systematic literature review of Medline and EMBASE databases from May 2018 to November 2020. Previous related systematic searches were also adapted to this aim and completed with reference screening. We identified studies performed on adult patients consulting for abdominal symptoms in primary care which reported data such that the FIT diagnostic performance parameters for CRC could be obtained. Bivariate models were used to synthesise available evidence. Meta-regression analysis was performed to evaluate the causes of heterogeneity. RESULTS Twenty-three studies (69 536 participants) were included (CRC prevalence 0.3%-6.2%). Six studies (n=34 691) assessed FIT as rule in test (threshold of ≥150 µg Hb/g faeces) showing a sensitivity of 64.1% (95% CI 57.8% to 69.9%) and a specificity of 95.0% (95% CI 91.2% to 97.2%). A threshold of 10 µg/g (15 studies; n=48 872) resulted in a sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI 81.0% to 91.6%) and a specificity of 84.4% (95% CI 79.4% to 88.3%) for CRC. At a 20 µg Hb/g faeces threshold (five studies; n=24 187) less than one additional CRC would be missed per 1000 patients investigated compared with 10 µg Hb/g faeces threshold (CRC prevalence 2%).

However, current understanding of treatment outcomes in patients with isolated proximal ureteral stones is limited. Therefore, we performed a prospective, multi-institutional study of ureteroscopic management of proximal ureteral stones smaller than 2 cm to better define clinical outcomes associated with this approach. MATERIALS AND METHODS Adult patients with proximal ureteral calculi smaller than 2 cm were prospectively identified. Patients with concomitant ipsilateral renal calculi or prior ureteral stenting were excluded from study. Flexible ureteroscopy, holmium laser lithotripsy and ureteral stent placement was performed. Ureteral access sheath use, laser settings and other details of perioperative and postoperative management were based on individual surgeon preference. Stone clearance was determined by the results of renal ultrasound and plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters and bladder 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Of 71 patients 44 (62%) were male and 27 (38%) were female. Mean age was 48.2 years. ASA(®) score was 1 in 12 cases (16%), 2 in 41 (58%), 3 in 16 (23%) and 4 in 2 (3%). Mean body mass index was 31.8 kg/m(2), mean stone size was 7.4 mm (range 5 to 15) and mean operative time was 60.3 minutes (range 15 to 148). Intraoperative complications occurred in 2 patients (2.8%), including mild ureteral trauma. Postoperative complications developed in 6 patients (8.7%), including urinary tract infection in 3, urinary retention in 2 and flash pulmonary edema in 1. The stone-free rate was 95% and for stones smaller than 1 cm it was 100%.

The injection of cells as therapeutic treatment often results in apoptosis due to stresses within the needle and the immune response of the host. Degradable microspheres may improve treatment effectiveness by increasing cell residence time, shielding cells during injection, and offering early protection against the immune system response. The objective of the present study was to investigate the potential of human VF fibroblasts encapsulated in polymeric microspheres as an injectable therapeutic treatment in vitro. METHODS Alginate, alginate-poly-L-lysine, and alginate-chitosan microspheres were fabricated using electrospraying and characterized in terms of biocompatibility, swelling, and mechanical properties as well as cytokine production. RESULTS Alginate microspheres were found to have the most desirable properties for VF regeneration. They were resistant to mechanical challenges. They were found to have a stiffness similar to that reported for native VF-lamina propria. They were found to be biocompatible and increased the proliferation of fibroblasts. Human VF fibroblasts encapsulated in alginate microspheres induced the production of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-4 at 24 hours. CONCLUSION The alginate microspheres fabricated in this study were found to offer potential advantages, as cell delivery tool.

True T-cell cross-reactivity, defined as the recognition by a single TCR of more than one distinct peptide-MHC ligand, has never been shown in the context of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS We used the ViraFEST platform to identify T cell responses cross-reactive for the spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs at the T cell receptor (TCR) clonotype level in convalescent COVID-19 patients (CCPs) and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed donors. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2/CCC cross-reactivity and assessments of functional avidity were performed using a TCR cloning and transfection system. RESULTS Memory CD4+ T-cell clonotypes that cross-recognized the S proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and at least one other CCC were detected in 65% of CCPs and unexposed donors. Several of these TCRs were shared among multiple donors. Cross-reactive T-cells demonstrated significantly impaired SARS-CoV-2-specific proliferation in vitro relative to mono-specific CD4+ T-cells, which was consistent with lower functional avidity of their TCRs for SARS CoV-2 relative to CCC. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, our data confirm the existence of unique memory CD4+ T cell clonotypes cross-recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and CCCs. The lower avidity of cross-reactive TCRs for SARS-CoV-2 may be the result of antigenic imprinting, such that pre-existing CCC-specific memory T cells have reduced expansive capacity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies are needed to determine how these cross-reactive T-cell responses impact clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Dykema, Arbor G; Zhang, Boyang; Woldemeskel, Bezawit A; Garliss, Caroline C; Cheung, Laurene S; Choudhury, Dilshad; Zhang, Jiajia; Aparicio, Luis; Bom, Sadhana; Rashid, Rufiaat; Caushi, Justina X; Hsiue, Emily Han-Chung; Cascino, Katherine; Thompson, Elizabeth A; Kwaa, Abena K; Singh, Dipika; Thapa, Sampriti; Ordonez, Alvaro A; Pekosz, Andrew; D'Alessio, Franco R; Powell, Jonathan D; Yegnasubramanian, Srinivasan; Zhou, Shibin; Pardoll, Drew M; Ji, Hongkai; Cox, Andrea L; Blankson, Joel N; Smith, Kellie N",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci146922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830946/,246

There have been reports on enucleation for EGJ GISTs in order to avoid gastrectomy. But the number of patients is too small, or the follow-up period is too short to evaluate it. The purpose of this study was to review our experience of 59 patients with EGJ GISTs treated by enucleation by percutaneous endoscopic intragastric surgery (PEIGS) and assess the clinical outcomes. METHODS PEIGS is performed as described below. Access ports are placed through the abdominal wall and the anterior wall of the stomach. Through the access ports, an endoscope and surgical instruments are inserted into the gastric lumen and tumor enucleation and closure of the defect are carried out. In this study, 59 patients with EGJ GISTs treated by PEIGS between 2005 and 2013 were enrolled. Their hospital records were reviewed, and follow-up data for 8 years were collected to analyze the outcomes. RESULTS En-bloc enucleation was achieved without tumor rupture in all. Average operation time was 172.3 min. Postoperative complications occurred in 3 (one localized peritonitis, one bleeding, and one surgical site infection). Average tumor size was 35.6 mm. Pathological findings confirmed negative margin in all specimens. The maximum follow-up period was 101 months. Multiple liver metastases were detected in two patients (at 12 and 29 months). The survival rate was 100 %. The disease-free rate was 98.3 % at 12 months and 96.6 % at 29 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS As far as the short- and long-term outcomes of our experience are reviewed, PEIGS seems as curative as other aggressive resection methods such as proximal gastrectomy. Tumor enucleation by PEIGS, offering a chance to preserve the stomach, can be a preferable option in carefully selected patients with EGJ GISTs, when performed by a skilled surgeon.","Kanehira, Eiji; Kamei, Aya; Umezawa, Akiko; Kurita, Atsushi; Tanida, Takashi; Nakagi, Masafumi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4439-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26201418/,246

Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been implicated in emergency medicine and acute stroke setting as an important biomarker in the prognosis of patients. However, there are ongoing questions around its accuracy and translation into clinical practice given suboptimal sensitivity and specificity results, as well as varying thresholds and lack of clarity around which NLR time points are most clinically indicative. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the role of NLR in AIS patients receiving reperfusion therapy and perspectives on areas of future research. NLR may be an important biomarker in risk stratifying patients in AIS to identify and select those who are more likely to benefit from reperfusion therapy. Appropriate clinical decision-making tools and models are required to harness the predictive value of NLR, which could be useful in identifying and monitoring high-risk patients to guide early treatment and achieve improved outcomes. Our understanding of the role of NLR in the immunopathogenesis of AIS is also suboptimal, which hinders the ability to translate this into clinical practice.","Sharma, Divyansh; Spring, Kevin J; Bhaskar, Sonu Menachem Maimonides",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13493; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34190348/,246

All content from database inception through April 2020 was included in the search. RESULTS The initial search strategy based on date range and language yielded 571 relevant records and 4 of them were about both TENS and PD. A total of 260 patients were enrolled in the included studies. In all of the included studies, the comparison intervention consisted of sham TENS. The primary outcome of interest was pain intensity. Our analysis indicated that TENS was statistically more effective than sham TENS in reducing PD-related pain (SMD=1.384; 95% CI=0.505, 2.262; p = 0.002). CONCLUSION TENS is a safe and well-tolerated electrophysical therapy that may be effective for relieving pain in PD.","Arik, Meltem Isintas; Kiloatar, Humeyra; Aslan, Burak; Icelli, Muge",Explore,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.explore.2020.08.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917532/,246
63041,Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with COVID-19.,2020-10-08,"Importance Intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) waveform suppression, often suggesting excessive general anesthesia, has been associated with postoperative delirium. Objective To assess whether EEG-guided anesthetic administration decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial of 1232 adults aged 60 years and older undergoing major surgery and receiving general anesthesia at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St Louis. Recruitment was from January 2015 to May 2018, with follow-up until July 2018. Interventions Patients were randomized 1:1 (stratified by cardiac vs noncardiac surgery and positive vs negative recent fall history) to receive EEG-guided anesthetic administration (n = 614) or usual anesthetic care (n = 618). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was incident delirium during postoperative days 1 through 5. Intraoperative measures included anesthetic concentration, EEG suppression, and hypotension. Adverse events included undesirable intraoperative movement, intraoperative awareness with recall, postoperative nausea and vomiting, medical complications, and death. Results Of the 1232 randomized patients (median age, 69 years [range, 60 to 95]; 563 women [45.7%]), 1213 (98.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome. Delirium during postoperative days 1 to 5 occurred in 157 of 604 patients (26.0%) in the guided group and 140 of 609 patients (23.0%) in the usual care group (difference, 3.0% [95% CI, -2.0% to 8.0%]; P = .22). Median end-tidal volatile anesthetic concentration was significantly lower in the guided group than the usual care group (0.69 vs 0.80 minimum alveolar concentration; difference, -0.11 [95% CI, -0.13 to -0.10), and median cumulative time with EEG suppression was significantly less (7 vs 13 minutes; difference, -6.0 [95% CI, -9.9 to -2.1]). There was no significant difference between groups in the median cumulative time with mean arterial pressure below 60 mm Hg (7 vs 7 minutes; difference, 0.0 [95% CI, -1.7 to 1.7]). Undesirable movement occurred in 137 patients (22.3%) in the guided and 95 (15.4%) in the usual care group. No patients reported intraoperative awareness. Postoperative nausea and vomiting was reported in 48 patients (7.8%) in the guided and 55 patients (8.9%) in the usual care group. Serious adverse events were reported in 124 patients (20.2%) in the guided and 130 (21.0%) in the usual care group. Within 30 days of surgery, 4 patients (0.65%) in the guided group and 19 (3.07%) in the usual care group died. Conclusions and Relevance Among older adults undergoing major surgery, EEG-guided anesthetic administration, compared with usual care, did not decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium. This finding does not support the use of EEG-guided anesthetic administration for this indication.

METHODS Clinical, imaging, and outcome data were collected in 173 patients with acute ischemic stroke who presented within 4.5 hours from symptom onset, in the time window eligible for intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator. Imaging data included Alberta Score Program Early Computed Tomographic Score (ASPECTS), site of occlusion, volume of ischemic core and penumbra, and recanalization. Outcome data consisted of modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days. We classified patients based on their baseline imaging characteristics and treatment with intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator (yes/no) according to 5 different hypothetical prognostic algorithms: (1) based on whether patients received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator, (2) based on ASPECTS, (3) based on the site of occlusion, (4) based on volume of ischemic core and penumbra, and (5) based on a matrix of predicted recanalization and volume of ischemic core and penumbra. We compared the performance of such algorithms to predict good clinical outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score of ≤2 at 90 days. RESULTS One hundred and twenty-four patients received intravenous tissue-type plasminogen activator; 49 did not. In the group that was treated, 46 (37%) had good outcome as opposed to 38.7% in the nontreated. The algorithm that combined the prediction of recanalization with the volume of ischemic core and penumbra showed the highest accuracy to predict good outcome (77.7%) as opposed to others (range, 43.9%-57.2%) CONCLUSIONS The combination of predicted recanalization and tissue fate proved superior to prognosticate good clinical outcome when compared with other usual predictors.","Leiva-Salinas, Carlos; Patrie, James T; Xin, Wenjun; Michel, Patrik; Jovin, Tudor; Wintermark, Max",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.011066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26696647/,246

We sought to investigate the balance between procoagulant factors and natural coagulation inhibitors in the critically ill COVID-19 patient and to evaluate the usefulness of hemostasis parameters to identify patients at risk of venous thromboembolic event (VTE). PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted an observational study recording VTEs defined as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism using lower limb ultrasound (92% of the patients), computed tomography pulmonary angiography (6%) and both tests (2%). We developed a comprehensive analysis of hemostasis. RESULTS Ninety-two consecutive mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients (age, 62 years [53-69] (median [25th-75th percentiles]); M/F sex ratio, 2.5; body-mass index, 28 kg/m2 [25-32]; past hypertension (52%) and diabetes mellitus (30%)) admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) from 03/11/2020 to 5/05/2020, were included. When tested, patients were receiving prophylactic (74%) or therapeutic (26%) anticoagulation. Forty patients (43%) were diagnosed with VTE. Patients displayed inflammatory and prothrombotic profile including markedly elevated plasma fibrinogen (7.7 g/L [6.1-8.6]), D-dimer (3,360 ng/mL [1668-7575]), factor V (166 IU/dL [136-195]) and factor VIII activities (294 IU/dL [223-362]). We evidenced significant discrepant protein C anticoagulant and chromogenic activities, combined with slightly decreased protein S activity. Plasma D-dimer >3,300 ng/mL predicted VTE presence with 78% (95%-confidence interval (95% CI), 62-89) sensitivity, 69% (95% CI, 55-81) specificity, 66% (95% CI, 51-79) positive predictive value and 80% (95% CI, 65-90) negative predictive value [area under the ROC curve, 0.779 (95%CI, 0.681-0.859), p=0.0001].

The aim of this bench study was to determine whether different interfaces and ventilator settings may influence patient-ventilator interaction in pediatric models of normal and mixed obstructive and restrictive respiratory conditions. METHODS A test lung, connected to a pediatric mannequin using different interfaces (endotracheal tube [ETT], face mask, and helmet), was ventilated in pressure support ventilation mode testing 2 ventilator settings (pressurization time [Timepress]50%/cycling-off flow threshold [Trexp]25%, Timepress80%/Trexp60%), randomly applied. The test lung was set to simulate one pediatric patient with a healthy respiratory system and another with a mixed obstructive and restricted respiratory condition, at different breathing frequencies (f) (30, 40, and 50 breaths/min). We measured inspiratory trigger delay, pressurization time, expiratory trigger delay, and time of synchrony. RESULTS At each breathing frequency, the helmet showed the longest inspiratory trigger delay compared with the ETT and face mask. At f30, the ETT had a reduced Tpress. The helmet had the shortest Tpress in the simulated child with a mixed obstructive and restricted respiratory condition, at f40 during Timepress50%/Trexp25% and at f50 during Timepress80%/Trexp60%. In the simulated child with a normal respiratory condition, the ETT presented the shortest Tpress value at f50 during Timepress80%/Trexp60%. Concerning the expiratory trigger delay, the helmet showed the best interaction at f30, but the worst at f40 and at f50. The helmet showed the shortest time of synchrony during all ventilator settings. CONCLUSIONS The choice of the interface can influence patient-ventilator synchrony in a pediatric model breathing at increased f, thus making it more difficult to set the ventilator, particularly during noninvasive ventilation. The helmet demonstrated the worst interaction, suggesting that the face mask should be considered as the first choice for delivering noninvasive ventilation in a pediatric model.","Conti, Giorgio; Gregoretti, Cesare; Spinazzola, Giorgia; Festa, Olimpia; Ferrone, Giuliano; Cipriani, Flora; Rossi, Marco; Piastra, Marco; Costa, Roberta",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.03309; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25605957/,246
65528,Early warning score predicts acute mortality in stroke patients.,2016,"During the initial pandemic wave of COVID-19, apart from common presenting symptoms (cough, fever, and fatigue), many countries have reported a sudden increase in the number of smell and taste dysfunction patients. Smell dysfunction has been reported in other viral infections (parainfluenza, rhinovirus, SARS, and others), but the incidence is much lower than SARS-CoV-2 infection. The pathophysiology of post-infectious olfactory loss was hypothesized that viruses may produce an inflammatory reaction of the nasal mucosa or damage the olfactory neuroepithelium directly. However, loss of smell could be presented in COVID-19 patients without other rhinologic symptoms or significant nasal inflammation. This review aims to provide a brief overview of recent evidence for epidemiology, pathological mechanisms for the smell, and taste dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Furthermore, prognosis and treatments are reviewed with scanty evidence.

In this context, we recently performed in silico testing of a novel closed-loop fluid management system that is designed for cardiac output and pulse pressure variation monitoring and optimization. The goal of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of this newly developed system in optimizing hemodynamic variables in an in vivo surgical setting. METHODS Sixteen Yorkshire pigs underwent a 2-phase hemorrhage protocol and were resuscitated by either the Learning Intravenous Resuscitator closed-loop system or an anesthesiologist. Median hemodynamic values and variation of hemodynamics were compared between groups. RESULTS Cardiac index (in liters per minute per square meter) and stroke volume index (in milliliters per square meter) were higher in the closed-loop group compared with the anesthesiologist group over the protocol (3.7 [3.4-4.1] vs 3.5 [3.2-3.9]; 95% Wald confidence interval, -0.5 to -0.23; P < 0.0005 and 40 [34-45] vs 36 [31-38]; 95% Wald confidence interval, -5.9 to -3.1; P < 0.0005, respectively). There was no significant difference in total fluid administration between the closed-loop and anesthesiologist groups (3685 [3230-4418] vs 3253 [2735-3926] mL; 95% confidence interval, -1651 to 431; P = 0.28). Closed-loop group animals also had lower coefficients of variance of cardiac index and stroke volume index during the protocol (11% [10%-16%] vs 22% [18%-23%]; confidence interval, 0.8%-12.3%; P = 0.02 and 11% [8%-16%] vs 17% [13%-21%]; confidence interval, 0.2%-11.4%; P = 0.04, respectively). CONCLUSION This in vivo study building on previous simulation work demonstrates that the closed-loop fluid management system used in this experiment can perform fluid resuscitation during mild and severe hemorrhages and is able to maintain high cardiac output and stroke volume while reducing hemodynamic variability.","Rinehart, Joseph; Lee, Christine; Canales, Cecilia; Kong, Allen; Kain, Zeev; Cannesson, Maxime",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e3182937d61; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23835453/,246

68015,"""Turn downs"" in aortic emergencies: Reassurance or uncertainty?",2020-11-10,"Playing digital games can nurture wellbeing by helping players recover from daily stressors, cope with life's challenges, practice emotion regulation, and engage in meaningful social interaction; however, this same leisure activity can also result in problematic gaming (i.e., harmful play at the expense of healthy behaviors), and social isolation that damages wellbeing. Research consistently demonstrates that the value or harm of gaming on wellbeing cannot be determined solely from whether and how much people play, but rather depends on contingent factors related to the player, the game, and the gaming context. In this paper, we aim to model contingent factors that differentiate between beneficial and harmful outcomes within players of the same massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG). We model how passion for gaming-defined as a strong desire to engage in a beloved activity that is enjoyed and valued, in which time and energy is invested, and that ultimately integrates into a person's identity-affects loneliness and wellbeing. We employ the dualistic model that divides passion into harmonious passion (HP)-characterized by a balanced and authentic relationship with the beloved activity, and obsessive passion (OP)-characterized by preoccupation and inflexible persistence toward the loved activity. We sampled 300 frequent World of Warcraft (WoW) players, recruited from online forums, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the effects of their passion for playing WoW on in-game social capital, loneliness, and wellbeing. We demonstrate that HP for playing WoW facilitates in-game social capital (both bridging and bonding), combats loneliness, and increases wellbeing, whereas OP also builds social capital, but these social ties do not combat loneliness, and OP is directly associated with increased loneliness. Further, the positive effect of HP on wellbeing is mediated through an increase in bonding social capital and a resulting decrease in loneliness. Our findings highlight that passion orientation is important for characterizing the relationship between gaming and wellbeing. We contribute to the conversation on combating problematic gaming, while also promoting digital gaming as an appealing leisure activity that provides enjoyment, recovery, and meaningful social interaction for the millions of gamers who benefit from its captivation.","Mandryk, Regan L; Frommel, Julian; Armstrong, Ashley; Johnson, Daniel",Frontiers in psychology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.02165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33071843/,246

There is less emphasis on the hand hygiene of hospitalised patients; in the context of COVID-19 mechanisms to support it are particularly important. The purpose of this study was to establish if providing patient hand wipes, and a defined protocol for encouraging their use, was effective in improving the frequency of patient hand hygiene (PHH). DESIGN Before and after study SETTING: General Hospital, United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS All adult patients admitted to six acute elderly care/rehabilitation hospital wards between July and October 2018. METHODS Baseline audit of PHH opportunities conducted over 6 weeks. Focus group with staff and survey of the public informed the development of a PHH bundle. Effect of bundle on PHH monitored by structured observation of HH opportunities over 12 weeks. RESULTS During baseline 303 opportunities for PHH were observed; compliance with PHH was 13.2% (40/303; 95%CI 9.9-7.5).

There are limited data on which surgical procedure women will choose when educated about the benefits of an RRS. Our objective was to study the proportion of women desiring sterilization that would choose an RRS. METHODS This cohort study included women 30 years of age and older with a living biological child who requested laparoscopic sterilization at a tertiary academic hospital. Participants were given a decision aid and offered an RRS or a standard tubal sterilization procedure with titanium clips. The primary outcome was to determine the proportion of women who would choose an RRS. Other outcomes included estimated blood loss and operative time, which was compared between groups, along with complications. RESULTS Fourteen of the 18 (78%) women who participated in our study chose RRS. Estimated blood loss and operating time were similar among women who underwent RRS and standard tubal sterilizations. There were no significant complications in either group. The study was ended early based on emerging data and a change in national practice patterns. CONCLUSIONS Because of the elective nature of sterilization and the complexities of cancer risk reduction, a patient-centered approach is beneficial for sterilization counseling. Our results support offering RRS as an alternative to standard tubal sterilization.","Zerden, Matthew L; Castellano, Tara; Doll, Kemi M; Stuart, Gretchen S; Munoz, M Cris; Boggess, Kim A",Southern medical journal,https://doi.org/10.14423/smj.0000000000000779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29505655/,246

Health care workers (HCWs) are particularly vulnerable to these infections. The objectives of this research were to assess the overall knowledge and infection control practices of HCWs about EVD, and to evaluate and compare the role of pre deployment Hajj training of HCWs assigned Hajj duties with those HCWs who did not receive this training. METHODS Through a comparative cross sectional study design a randomly selected representative sample of HCWs who performed Hajj duties in 2015 were compared with those who were not part of Hajj. Participants were taken from different Makkah and Jeddah region hospitals. A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to assess EVD awareness of 1216 HCWs. Chi square test was applied to check the association between the two groups using SPSS 22. RESULTS Overall, medical practitioners had a higher level of knowledge (76.5%) about EVD (in-terms of average correct answers) compared to nurses (59.6%) and other HCWs (56.7%). There was relatively poor knowledge about the EVD management, the Ebola cases fatality rate and the risk of the health care workers from this infectious disease. However, it was obvious that the HCWs who performed Hajj duties and underwent pre-deployment training had more knowledge and better practices about EVD compared to the Non Hajj HCWs and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION This study concludes that even though the HCWs were well aware about EVD but there was a lack of practice.

In the current study, we explored responsiveness to the neuromodulator serotonin as a potential mechanistic link between early life social isolation and auditory processing. The serotonergic system is sensitive to social isolation in many brain regions including the inferior colliculus (IC), an auditory midbrain nucleus. We investigated the effects of social experience on serotonergic responsiveness by measuring cFos, an immediate early gene product, in the IC of female mice. Serotonin was manipulated pharmacologically by administering fenfluramine, pCPA, or saline to mice that had undergone an extreme dichotomy in social experience after weaning: being housed in social groups versus individually. These mice were exposed to a 60-minute recording of vocalizations from an opposite-sex interaction and perfused. Using immunohistochemistry, we measured the density of cFos-positive (cFos+) nuclei in the major subdivisions of the IC. Housing condition, drug treatment, and IC subregion all had a significant effect on cFos+ density. The central IC showed the highest density of cFos+ cells and also the most pronounced effects of housing condition and drug treatment. In the central IC, cFos+ density was higher following fenfluramine treatment than saline, and lower following pCPA treatment than fenfluramine. Individually housed mice showed a higher cFos+ density than socially housed mice in both of the pharmacological treatment groups, but not in the saline group. Drug treatment but not housing condition had strong effects on the behaviors of grooming, digging, rearing, and movement. Once the effects of drug condition were controlled, there were no across-individual correlations between cFos+ densities and behaviors. These findings suggest that the responses of auditory neurons to neuromodulation by serotonin is influenced by early life experience.","Davis, Sarah E; Sansone, Jack M; Hurley, Laura M",Integrative and comparative biology,https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/icab051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974061/,246

However, accurately predicting which viral genotypes will emerge has been elusive. Prior work with lytic RNA bacteriophage ɸ6 (family Cystoviridae) suggested that evolution under low multiplicity of infection (MOI; proportion of viruses to susceptible cells) selected for greater host exploitation, while evolution under high MOI selected for better intracellular competition against co-infecting viruses. We predicted that phage genotypes that had experienced 300 generations of low MOI ecological history would be relatively advantaged in initial growth on two novel hosts. We inferred viral growth through changes in host population density, specifically by analyzing five attributes of growth curves of infected bacteria. Despite equivalent growth of evolved viruses on the original host, low MOI evolved clones were generally advantaged relative to high MOI clones in exploiting novel hosts. However, the specific attributes of growth curves that supported their advantage differed by host, indicating interactions between both viral and host genotype. Although there will be host specificity in viral growth, we suggest based on infectivity differences of viruses from high versus low MOI histories that prior MOI selection can later affect emergence potential.

It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic.","Barnes, Stuart J",Social science & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34052700/,246

This was a retrospective study of medical records conducted in the COVID data center of our hospital This study analyzed data of patients who died in the month of August, 2020 to October 2020 (one month before and after the peak of first wave i.e., 16th September, 2020) & April 2021 to June 2021 (one month before and after the peak of second wave i.e., 6th May, 2021), corresponding to an equal part of the pandemic during first (2020) and second (2021) wave. Out of 1893 patients in the study, 764 patients were admitted during the first wave and 1129 patients during the second wave of pandemic. In total, 420 patients died during the entire study period. Of those, 147 (35%) deaths occurred during the first wave and 273 (65%) during the second wave, reflecting a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19.2% during the first wave and a CFR of 24.18%. There were no significant differences in the Age Group, Gender, Presenting Complaints, Duration of Stay and Comorbidities. However, the deceased COVID-19 patients had an increase in Case Fatality Rate, average duration of symptoms from onset to Hospital Admission (DOSHA) and a major shift from MODS to ARDS being the Cause of Death during the second wave of Pandemic. This study demonstrates increased CFR, average DOSHA and a paradigm shift to ARDS as cause of mortality during the second peak of the Pandemic. It is necessary to remain vigilant of newer COVID-19 variants of concern, follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviors and keep emphasizing on care of high-risk groups including patients with comorbidities and elderly population to prevent mortality.","Nath, Ravindra; Gupta, Neeraj Kumar; Jaswal, Amandeep; Gupta, Sparsh; Kaur, Navjot; Kohli, Santvana; Saxena, Anirudh; Ish, Pranav; Kumar, Rohit; Tiwari, Poornima; Kumar, Mukesh; Kishore, Jugal; Yadav, Geeta; Marwein, Fellisha; Gupta, Nitesh",Monaldi archives for chest disease = Archivio Monaldi per le malattie del torace,https://doi.org/10.4081/monaldi.2021.2034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634900/,246

The goal of the present study was to determine whether such side effects might derive, in part, from increased exocytosis of secretory vesicles and subsequent catecholamine release triggered by varenicline in human chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. In this study, we performed electrophysiological plasma membrane capacitance and carbon fiber amperometry experiments to evaluate the effect of varenicline on exocytosis and catecholamine release, respectively, at concentrations reached during varenicline therapy (100 nM). Experiments were conducted in the absence or presence of nicotine, at plasma concentrations achieved right after smoking (250 nM) or steady-state concentrations (110 nM), in chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland obtained from human organ donors. Cells were stimulated with short pulses (10 ms) of acetylcholine (ACh; 300 μM) applied at 0.2 Hz, in order to closer mimic the physiological situation at the splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell synapse. In addition, rat chromaffin cells were used to compare the effects obtained in cells from a more readily available species. Varenicline increased the exocytosis of secretory vesicles in human and rat chromaffin cells in the presence of nicotine, effects that were not due to an increase of plasma membrane capacitance or currents triggered by the nicotinic agonists alone. These results should be considered in nicotine addiction therapies when varenicline is used.","Jiménez-Pompa, Amanda; Sanz-Lázaro, Sara; Hone, Arik J; Rueda-Ruzafa, Lola; Medina Polo, José; González-Enguita, Carmen; Blázquez, Jesús; de Los Ríos, Cristóbal; Michael McIntosh, J; Albillos, Almudena",Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2021.108632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34097947/,246

Bevezetés: Az új típusú koronavírus-járvány (COVID-19) az egészségügyi ellátóhálózatot egy eddig ismeretlen helyzet elé állította. A nemzetközi adatok alapján a szemészeti járóbeteg-ellátásban jelentős változások alakultak ki. Célkitűzés: Felmérni a COVID-19-járvány okozta kvantitatív és kvalitatív változásokat az Észak-Közép-budai Centrum, Új Szent János Kórház és Szakrendelő Szemészeti Osztályának járóbeteg-szakellátásában. Módszer: A pandémia első hullámában (2020. április 1-30.) mért járóbeteg-forgalmi adatokat hasonlítottuk össze a megelőző év azonos periódusában rögzített adatokkal. A betegek demográfiai jellemzői mellett megvizsgáltuk a sürgősségi besorolásukat, valamint a panaszokhoz köthető fődiagnózis-csoportok eloszlását. Rögzítettük a telemedicina keretein belül történt ellátások számát. Eredmények: 2020 vizsgált időszakában 916, míg az előző év azonos hónapjában 2835 járóbeteg-eset került rögzítésre. A 2020-as időszakban a törvényi szabályozás szerint sürgős panaszokkal jelentkező betegek aránya nem változott (p = 0,38), azonban a szakorvosi megítélés szerint sürgős panaszokkal érkező betegek aránya nőtt (p<0,001) az előző évhez viszonyítva. A zöld hályog, kötőhártya-gyulladás, árpa, sérülés és nedves típusú maculadegeneratio miatt ellátásra jelentkező betegek aránya szignifikánsan nőtt (p<0,001 mind), míg a szürke hályog, a száraz típusú maculadegeneratio, egyéb, a szemhéj és a könnyutak betegségei, utóhályog miatt és a szemészeti betegség nélkül érkezők aránya csökkent (p<0,001 mind). A telemedicina keretei között ellátott betegek száma 2020-ban közel a tizenötszörösére emelkedett 2019-hez képest (p<0,001). Következtetés: A COVID-19-pandémia első hulláma során markáns betegszámcsökkenést regisztráltunk a szemészeti járóbeteg-szakellátásban. Több fődiagnózis-csoport esetén számolhatunk jelentős terápiavesztéssel és halasztott ellátási igény jelentkezésével. Az adatok kiértékelése segítséget nyújthat az elkövetkező években az ellátási folyamat proaktív átszervezésében, a humánerőforrás-szükségletek jobb tervezésében, valamint a teleoftalmológiai ellátás fejlesztésében.

OBJECTIVE To assess the quantitative and qualitative changes of the outpatient specialty care at the Ophthalmology Department of the North-Central-Buda Center, New St. John's Hospital and Clinic, through the pandemic. METHOD Outpatient service data during the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020) were compared with those in April 2019. Patient demographics, emergency classification, distribution of the main diagnostic groups (associated with complaints) and services provided via telemedicine were collected. RESULTS There were 2835 patient visits in 2019 and 916 in 2020. For 2020, the proportion of patients with emergency classification according to legal regulations did not change (p = 0.38), however, using the ophthalmologist's classification increased (p<0.001) significantly. The proportion of patients with glaucoma, conjunctivitis, chalazeon, injury and wet macular degeneration increased (p<0.001 all), while the proportion of patients with cataract, dry macular degeneration, other diseases, other adnexal diseases, secondary cataract and without ophthalmic pathology decreased significantly (p<0.001 for all). Patient number using telemedicine treatment was about 15× of those treated in 2019 (p<0.001). CONCLUSION During the first wave of the pandemic, a marked decrease in ophthalmic outpatient care volume was recorded. In the case of several main diagnosis groups, significant therapy loss and a delayed need for care could be expected. Evaluation of the data helps in the upcoming years in proactive reorganization of the care process, in better planning of human resource needs, and in improvement of teleophthalmology care.

73295,Off-Hour Admission and Outcomes in Patients with Acute Intracerebral Hemorrhage in the INTERACT2 Trial.,2015,"Switching from conventional strain-specific vaccines to multi-strain or multi-species universal vaccines is both justified and scientifically merited. Long-term cross-protective universal vaccines eliminate the need for repetitive short-term vaccination campaigns and short-notice vaccine redesign during impending epidemics. They also have the potential to be cost-effective, convenient, and amenable to stockpiling. Ongoing advances in genomics and reverse vaccinology along with the perceived ability of vaccines, if properly formulated, to induce cross-protective adaptive immunity and long-term T cell memory are at the heart of this trend. Consequently, the search for universal vaccines against influenza, HIV, and many other viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens has intensified in recent years. Currently, several universal influenza vaccines are at different phases of clinical evaluation. That said, vaccine-related differential effectiveness, escape mutants, pathogen strain replacement, limited scope of cross-protective immunity, and diminished potential to reach optimal herd immunity thresholds present serious challenges to the concept and applicability of universal vaccines. Herein, the case for and the case against universal vaccines are investigated to realistically appreciate their prospects of success.","Hamad, Mawieh","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0463.2011.02776.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21851413/,246
73491,Break the Rule of Three: Critical Thoughts from a Tertiary Care Experience with Bougie Dilators.,2020-10-16,"UNLABELLED Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are present in the tissues of the anogenital tract, where HIV-1 transmission occurs in almost all cases. These cells are both target cells for HIV-1 and represent the first opportunity for the virus to interfere with innate recognition. Previously we have shown that both cell types fail to produce type I interferons (IFNs) in response to HIV-1 but that, unlike T cells, the virus does not block IFN induction by targeting IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) for cellular degradation. Thus, either HIV-1 inhibits IFN induction by an alternate mechanism or, less likely, these cells fail to sense HIV-1. Here we show that HIV-1 (but not herpes simplex virus 2 [HSV-2] or Sendai virus)-exposed DCs and macrophages fail to induce the expression of all known type I and III IFN genes. These cells do sense the virus, and pattern recognition receptor (PRR)-induced signaling pathways are triggered. The precise stage in the IFN-inducing signaling pathway that HIV-1 targets to block IFN induction was identified; phosphorylation but not K63 polyubiquitination of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) was completely inhibited. Two HIV-1 accessory proteins, Vpr and Vif, were shown to bind to TBK1, and their individual deletion partly restored IFN-β expression. Thus, the inhibition of TBK1 autophosphorylation by binding of these proteins appears to be the principal mechanism by which HIV-1 blocks type I and III IFN induction in myeloid cells. IMPORTANCE Dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages are key HIV target cells. Therefore, definition of how HIV impairs innate immune responses to initially establish infection is essential to design preventative interventions, especially by restoring initial interferon production. Here we demonstrate how HIV-1 blocks interferon induction by inhibiting the function of a key kinase in the interferon signaling pathway, TBK1, via two different viral accessory proteins. Other viral proteins have been shown to target the general effects of TBK1, but this precise targeting between ubiquitination and phosphorylation of TBK1 is novel.","Harman, Andrew N; Nasr, Najla; Feetham, Alexandra; Galoyan, Ani; Alshehri, Abdullateef A; Rambukwelle, Dharshini; Botting, Rachel A; Hiener, Bonnie M; Diefenbach, Eve; Diefenbach, Russell J; Kim, Min; Mansell, Ashley; Cunningham, Anthony L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00889-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855743/,246

However, despite its extraordinary capabilities, cryo-EM remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. It is therefore beneficial to have a means for rapidly assessing and optimizing the quality of samples prior to lengthy cryo-EM analyses. To do this, we have developed a native mass spectrometry (nMS) platform that provides rapid feedback on sample quality and highly streamlined biochemical screening. Because nMS enables accurate mass analysis of protein complexes, it is well suited to routine evaluation of the composition, integrity, and homogeneity of samples prior to their plunge-freezing on EM grids. We demonstrate the utility of our nMS-based platform for facilitating cryo-EM studies using structural characterizations of exemplar bacterial transcription complexes as well as the replication-transcription assembly from the SARS-CoV-2 virus that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.","Olinares, Paul Dominic B; Kang, Jin Young; Llewellyn, Eliza; Chiu, Courtney; Chen, James; Malone, Brandon; Saecker, Ruth M; Campbell, Elizabeth A; Darst, Seth A; Chait, Brian T",Structure,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2020.11.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217329/,246

74586,Outcome in patients previously on antithrombotic therapy in the SAMMPRIS trial: subgroup analysis.,2015,"BACKGROUND Quarantine is considered as an effective solution in the early stages of an epidemic. In the case of the coronavirus epidemic, quarantine was also recommended and implemented as a significant guideline to prevent the disease. However, despite the benefits of quarantine, there are also complications and problems. OBJECTIVE The present study aimed to investigate the health effects of quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS This study was conducted as a literature review through searching the databases Google Scholar, PubMed, and Science Direct for papers published before July 2020. The research was conducted based on the keywords ""Coronavirus,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""quarantine."" The references of the papers were also reviewed to find the ones not found in the databases. The guidelines published by reputable organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were used in this study. RESULTS Although quarantine is applied as an important and primary solution in the outbreak of epidemics, in cases of pandemics, it may not be free of negative effects on individuals and public health. However, because of the need to reopen and restart social and economic activities, some changes should be made in lifestyles and work activities. Using cyberspace and telework can be helpful. As the findings showed, COVID-19 bubbles can be used to restore social communications. CONCLUSION Using masks, avoiding unnecessary gatherings, complying with personal and social hygiene, and respecting social distancing can be valuable solutions that, if implemented properly, can decrease the rate of the disease significantly. It is also emphasized that quarantine is still necessary and important as the best solution for sick people and individuals who are suspected carriers of the disease.","Feiz Arefi, Maryam; Babaei-Pouya, Amin; Poursadeqiyan, Mohsen",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164969/,246

We systematically reviewed the process and outcome of evaluating CKD-EPICr in estimating point GFR or GFR decline over time in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. METHODS In this systematic review, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched up to August 2019. Observational studies comparing CKD-EPICr with measured GFR (mGFR) in adults with diabetes were included. Studies on people with kidney transplant, non-diabetes related kidney disease, pregnancy, potential kidney donors, and those with critical or other systematic illnesses were excluded. Two independent reviewers extracted data from published papers and disagreements were resolved by consensus. Risk-of-bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 tool. (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018108776) RESULTS: From the 2820 records identified, 29 studies (14 704 participants) were included. All studies were at risk of bias. Bias (eight different forms) ranged from -26 to 35 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ; precision (five different forms) ranged between 9 and 63 ml min-1 1.73 m-2 ; accuracy (five different forms) ranged between 16% and 96%; the correlation coefficient between CKD-EPICr and mGFR (four different forms) ranged between 0.38 and 0.86; and the reduced major axis regression slope ranged between 0.8 and 1.8. CONCLUSIONS Qualitative synthesis of data suggested CKD-EPICr was inaccurate in estimating point GFR or GFR decline over time. Furthermore, a lack of consistency in the methods and processes of evaluating the diagnostic performance of CKD-EPICr limits reliable quantitative assessment. The equation needs to be improved in adults with diabetes.","Zafari, N; Churilov, L; Y-L Wong, L; Lotfaliany, M; Hachem, M; Kiburg, K V; Kong, L; Torkamani, N; Baxter, H; MacIsaac, R J; Ekinci, E I",Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14391; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810875/,246

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify all osteoid osteoma ablations performed over a 5.5-year period at a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. Twenty-five ablations (15 radiofrequency and 10 microwave) in 23 patients undergoing fluoroscopic CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma ablation were compared to 35 ablations (35 radiofrequency) in 32 patients undergoing ablation via conventional CT guidance. Dose area product and dose length product were recorded for CBCT and conventional CT, respectively, and converted to effective doses. Technical success, clinical success (cessation of pain and medication use 1 month after ablation), complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time were compared. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Twenty-two of 25 (88.0%) CBCT and 31 of 35 (88.6%) conventional CT-guided ablations achieved immediate clinical success. There were two minor complications in each group and no major complications. Mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower for CBCT compared to CT guidance (0.12 vs. 0.39 mSv, p = 0.02). Mean total room utilization time for CBCT was longer (133.5 vs. 97.5 min, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Fluoroscopic CBCT guidance for percutaneous osteoid osteoma ablation yields similar technical and clinical success, reduced radiation dose, and increased total room utilization time compared to conventional CT guidance.","Perry, Brandon C; Monroe, Eric J; McKay, Tyler; Kanal, Kalpana M; Shivaram, Giridhar",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-017-1685-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28497188/,246

Data Sources PubMed, the Cochrane COVID-19 trial registry, and the Living Overview of Evidence platform were searched until January 29, 2021. Study Selection The RCTs selected compared any type of convalescent plasma vs placebo or standard of care for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in any treatment setting. Data Extraction and Synthesis Two reviewers independently extracted data on relevant clinical outcomes, trial characteristics, and patient characteristics and used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The primary analysis included peer-reviewed publications of RCTs only, whereas the secondary analysis included all publicly available RCT data (peer-reviewed publications, preprints, and press releases). Inverse variance-weighted meta-analyses were conducted to summarize the treatment effects. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Main Outcomes and Measures All-cause mortality, length of hospital stay, clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, mechanical ventilation use, and serious adverse events. Results A total of 1060 patients from 4 peer-reviewed RCTs and 10 722 patients from 6 other publicly available RCTs were included. The summary risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality with convalescent plasma in the 4 peer-reviewed RCTs was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.63 to 1.38), the absolute risk difference was -1.21% (95% CI, -5.29% to 2.88%), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision. Across all 10 RCTs, the summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, 0.92 to 1.12) and there was moderate certainty of the evidence due to inclusion of unpublished data. Among the peer-reviewed RCTs, the summary hazard ratio was 1.17 (95% CI, 0.07 to 20.34) for length of hospital stay, the summary RR was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.20 to 2.87) for mechanical ventilation use (the absolute risk difference for mechanical ventilation use was -2.56% [95% CI, -13.16% to 8.05%]), and there was low certainty of the evidence due to imprecision for both outcomes. Limited data on clinical improvement, clinical deterioration, and serious adverse events showed no significant differences.

Since flow variation might contribute to endothelial dysfunction, we explored circulating endothelial biomarkers after C-TAH implantation in seven patients and compared the manual and autoregulated mode. Markers of endothelial dysfunction and regeneration were compared before and during a 6- to 9-month follow-up after implantation. The follow-up was divided into three periods (< 3, 3-6, and > 6 months) and used to estimate the temporal trends during the study period. A linear mixed model was used to analyze repeated measures and association between tested parameters according to the mode of C-TAH and the time. Relevance of soluble endoglin (sEndoglin) level increase has been tested on differentiation and migration potential of human vasculogenic progenitor cells (endothelial colony forming cells [ECFCs]). Normal sEndoglin and soluble endothelial protein C receptor (sEPCR) levels were found in patients after implantation with autoregulated C-TAH, whereas they significantly increased in the manual mode, as compared with pretransplant values (p = 0.005 and 0.001, respectively). In the autoregulated mode, a significant increase in the mobilization of cytokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 was found (p = 0.03). After adjustment on the mode of C-TAH, creatinine or C-reactive protein level, sEndoglin, and sEPCR, were found significantly associated with plasma total protein levels.

High viral concentrations in the upper aerodigestive tract, the ability of the virus to be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers and through aerosols, and the need for open airway access during laryngotracheal surgery create a high-risk situation for airway surgeons, anesthesiologists, and operating room personnel. While some surgical cases of laryngotracheal stenosis may be deferred, patients with significant airway obstruction or progressing symptoms often require urgent surgical intervention. We present best practices from our institutional experience for surgical management of laryngotracheal stenosis during this pandemic, including preoperative triage, intraoperative airway management, and personal protective measures.","Prince, Andrew D P; Cloyd, Benjamin H; Hogikyan, Norman D; Schechtman, Samuel A; Kupfer, Robbi A",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820927002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32393105/,246
76618,Mechanical Thrombectomy for Stroke After Cardiac Surgery.,2016,"PURPOSE Mathematical and simulation models are increasingly used to plan for and evaluate health sector responses to disasters, yet no clear consensus exists regarding best practices for the design, conduct, and reporting of such models. The authors examined a large selection of published health sector disaster response models to generate a set of best practice guidelines for such models. METHODS . The authors reviewed a spectrum of published disaster response models addressing public health or health care delivery, focusing in particular on the type of disaster and response decisions considered, decision makers targeted, choice of outcomes evaluated, modeling methodology, and reporting format. They developed initial recommendations for best practices for creating and reporting such models and refined these guidelines after soliciting feedback from response modeling experts and from members of the Society for Medical Decision Making. RESULTS . The authors propose 6 recommendations for model construction and reporting, inspired by the most exemplary models: health sector disaster response models should address real-world problems, be designed for maximum usability by response planners, strike the appropriate balance between simplicity and complexity, include appropriate outcomes that extend beyond those considered in traditional cost-effectiveness analyses, and be designed to evaluate the many uncertainties inherent in disaster response. Finally, good model reporting is particularly critical for disaster response models. CONCLUSIONS . Quantitative models are critical tools for planning effective health sector responses to disasters. The proposed recommendations can increase the applicability and interpretability of future models, thereby improving strategic, tactical, and operational aspects of preparedness planning and response.","Brandeau, Margaret L; McCoy, Jessica H; Hupert, Nathaniel; Holty, Jon-Erik; Bravata, Dena M",Medical decision making : an international journal of the Society for Medical Decision Making,https://doi.org/10.1177/0272989x09340346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19605887/,246
76703,Systematic evaluation of olfaction in patients with hereditary cystic kidney diseases/renal ciliopathies.,2020-09-11,"OBJECTIVE To determine the influence of plating systems on the clinical outcomes in dogs treated for ilial fractures. DESIGN Retrospective study. ANIMALS Fifty-nine dogs (63 hemipelves). METHODS Radiographs and medical records of dogs with ilial fractures presented to Iowa State University between 2003 and 2019 were reviewed. After fracture reduction, fractures were fixed with a locking plate system (LPS) or non-locking plate system (NLS). Perioperative, long-term complications, and follow-up data were recorded. The frequency of implant failure and pelvic collapse were compared using a logistic and linear regression analysis, respectively. Where the univariate test was statistically significant, a multivariate analysis across categories was performed to identify statistically different categories. RESULTS LPS and NLS implants were used in 25/63 and 38/63 hemipelves, respectively. Median follow-up time was 8 weeks (3-624 weeks). Implant failure occurred in 18/63 (29%) of fracture repairs, consisting of 17 with NLS and 1 with LPS. Revision surgery was recommended in five cases of implant failure, all with NLS. The probability of implant failure was higher when fractures were fixed with NLS (p = .0056). All other variables evaluated did not seem to influence outcome measures. CONCLUSION The variable with the most influence on the outcomes of dogs treated for ilial fractures consisted of the fixation method (NLS vs. LPS). Fractures repaired with NLS were nearly 20 times more likely to fail than those repaired with LPS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Surgeons should consider repairing ilial body fractures in dogs with LPS to reduce the risk of short-term implant failure.","Petrovsky, Brian; Knuth, Taylor; Aponte-Colón, Cristina; Hoefle, William; Kraus, Karl; Naiman, Jaron; Yuan, Lingnan; Mochel, Jonathan P; Zellner, Eric",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955036/,246

The Common-Sense Model of illness perceptions provided the theoretical framework. DESIGN A cross-sectional study with 511 respondents and a follow-up study 4 months later on 422 respondents completing an online survey measuring demographic factors, media consumption, self-assessed health, experience with the disease, health anxiety, COVID-19 threat, worries and cognitive and emotional illness representations. RESULTS Health anxiety, media consumption, female gender, lower self-assessed health, knowing a deceased COVID-19 patient and being infected explained variance in threat appraisal. Worries represented 2 factors: psychosocial and existential. Threat appraisal and worries explained variance in illness representations. Representations of the disease worsened and started stabilizing over time. Emotional representations were exceptionally stable and explainable by threat appraisals.

The liver in COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"The results of the current study investigated the chemo-preventive effect of crocin against hepatocarcinogenesis in rats with particular focus on the evaluation of the modulatory impact of crocin on apoptotic and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathways. Thioacetamide (TAA) (200 mg/kg, I.P.) was used for experimental induction of hepatocarcinogenesis in rats. Crocin administration significantly attenuated TAA-induced cancerous lesions with concomitant attenuation of impaired liver functions. This was associated with significant enhancement in hepatic Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression with parallel suppression in Keap-1 expression. Inline, crocin induced a significant improvement in hepatic oxidative status with enhanced antioxidant batteries. Crocin administration significantly suppressed the hepatic content of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (c-JNK) with significant upregulation in TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and caspase-8 protein expression as well as p53 gene expression; biomarkers of apoptosis. Moreover, hepatic expression of the apoptotic BAX significantly increased and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 significantly decreased in the liver specimen; biomarkers of intrinsic apoptosis. In conclusion; crocin attenuates experimentally induced hepato-carcinogenesis via modulation of oxidative/apoptotic signaling. Namely, crocin induced hepatic expression of Nrf2 with downstream modulation of endogenous HO-1 and Keap-1 signaling with modulation of various key players of apoptosis including; c-JNK, p53, TRAIL, caspase-8, BAX, and Bcl-2.","Elsherbiny, Nehal M; Eisa, Nada H; El-Sherbiny, Mohamed; Said, Eman",Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.etap.2020.103494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32942000/,246

79251,Direct aorta ascending approach in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.,2014,"We present two rare cases of mixed large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the colon. A literature search revealed only three published cases with similar histology but none of these reports provided profound molecular and mutational analyses. Our two cases exhibited a distinct, colon-like immunophenotype with strong nuclear CDX2 and β-catenin expression in more than 90% of the tumour cells of both components. We analysed the two carcinomas regarding microsatellite stability, RAS, BRAF and PD-L1 status. In addition, next-generation panel sequencing with Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 was performed. This approach revealed mutations in FBXW7, CTNNB1 and PIK3CA in the first case and FBXW7 and RB1 mutations in the second case. We looked for similar mutational patterns in three publicly available colorectal adenocarcinoma data sets, as well as in collections of colorectal mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasms (MiNENs) and colorectal neuroendocrine carcinomas. This approach indicated that the FBXW7 point mutation, without being accompanied by classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence mutations, such as APC, KRAS and TP53, likely occurs at a relatively high frequency in mixed neuroendocrine and squamous cell carcinoma and therefore may be characteristic for this rare tumour type. FBXW7 codifies the substrate recognition element of an ubiquitin ligase, and inactivating FBXW7 mutations lead to an exceptional accumulation of its target β-catenin which results in overactivation of the Wnt-signalling pathway. In line with previously described hypotheses of de-differentiation of colon cells by enhanced Wnt-signalling, our data indicate a crucial role for mutant FBXW7 in the unusual morphological switch that determines these rare neoplasms. Therefore, mixed large cell neuroendocrine and a squamous cell carcinoma can be considered as a distinct carcinoma entity in the colon, defined by morphology, immunophenotype and distinct molecular genetic alteration(s).","Woischke, Christine; Jung, Peter; Jung, Andreas; Kumbrink, Jörg; Eisenlohr, Sibylle; Auernhammer, Christoph Josef; Vieth, Michael; Kirchner, Thomas; Neumann, Jens",The journal of pathology.

Despite this, the mechanisms underlying disease emergence are still not fully understood, and control measures rely heavily on mitigating the impact of EIDs after they have emerged. Here, we highlight the emergence of a zoonotic Henipavirus, Nipah virus, to demonstrate the interdisciplinary and macroecological approaches necessary to understand EID emergence. Previous work suggests that Nipah virus emerged due to the interaction of the wildlife reservoir (Pteropus spp. fruit bats) with intensively managed livestock. The emergence of this and other henipaviruses involves interactions among a suite of anthropogenic environmental changes, socioeconomic factors, and changes in demography that overlay and interact with the distribution of these pathogens in their wildlife reservoirs. Here, we demonstrate how ecological niche modeling may be used to investigate the potential role of a changing climate on the future risk for Henipavirus emergence. We show that the distribution of Henipavirus reservoirs, and therefore henipaviruses, will likely change under climate change scenarios, a fundamental precondition for disease emergence in humans. We assess the variation among climate models to estimate where Henipavirus host distribution is most likely to expand, contract, or remain stable, presenting new risks for human health. We conclude that there is substantial potential to use this modeling framework to explore the distribution of wildlife hosts under a changing climate. These approaches may directly inform current and future management and surveillance strategies aiming to improve pathogen detection and, ultimately, reduce emergence risk.","Daszak, Peter; Zambrana-Torrelio, Carlos; Bogich, Tiffany L; Fernandez, Miguel; Epstein, Jonathan H; Murray, Kris A; Hamilton, Healy",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1201243109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936052/,246

Consequently, EGFR has become a clinically validated target as extracellular tumor marker for antibodies as well as for tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Within the last years, new mechanistic insights were uncovered and, based on clinical experience as well as progress in protein engineering, novel bio-therapeutic approaches were developed and tested. AREAS COVERED The potential therapeutic targeting arsenal in the fight against cancer now encompasses bispecific or biparatopic antibodies, DARPins, Adnectins, Affibodies, peptides and combinations of these binding molecules with viral- and nano-particles. We review past and recent binding proteins from the literature and include a brief description of the various targeting approaches. Special attention is given to the binding modes with the EGFR. Expert commentary: Clinical data from the three approved anti EGFR antibodies indicate that there is room for improved therapeutic efficacy. Having choices in size, affinity, avidity and the mode of EGFR binding as well as the possibility to combine various effector functions opens the possibility to rationally design more effective therapeutics.","Feiner, Rebecca Christine; Müller, Kristian Mark",Expert review of proteomics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14789450.2016.1212665; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27424502/,246

Secondary brain injury is exacerbated by multiple trauma, and possibly modifiable by EPO. We hypothesized that EPO decreases mortality more in TBI patients with multiple trauma, than in patients with TBI alone. METHODS A post hoc analysis of the EPO-TBI randomized controlled trial conducted in 2009 to 2014. To evaluate the impact of injuries outside the brain, we calculated an extracranial Injury Severity Score (ISS) that included the same components of the ISS, excluding head and face components. We defined multiple trauma as two injured body regions with an Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) score of 3 or higher. Cox regression analyses, allowing for potential differential responses per the presence or absence of extracranial injury defined by these injury scores, were used to assess the effect of EPO on time to mortality. RESULTS Of 603 included patients, the median extracranial ISS was 6 (interquartile range, 1-13) and 258 (43%) had an AIS score of 3 or higher in at least two body regions. On Cox regression, EPO was associated with decreased mortality in patients with greater extracranial ISS (interaction p = 0.048) and weakly associated with differential mortality with multiple trauma (AIS score > 3 or in two regions, interaction p = 0.17). At 6 months in patients with extracranial ISS higher than 6, 10 (6.8%) of 147 EPO-treated patients compared with 26 (17%) of 154 placebo-treated patients died (risk reduction, 10%; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-17%; p = 0.007). CONCLUSION In this post hoc analysis, EPO administration was associated with a potential differential improvement in 6-month mortality in TBI patients with more severe extracranial injury. These findings need confirmation in future clinical and experimental studies.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with the primary aim of estimating mortality from major causes of adult meningitis in routine care settings, and to contrast this with outcomes from clinical trial settings. METHODS We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library for published clinical trials (defined as randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) or investigator-managed prospective cohorts) and observational studies that evaluated outcomes of adult meningitis in SSA from 1 January 1990 through 15 September 2019. We performed random effects modelling to estimate pooled mortality, both in clinical trial and routine care settings. Outcomes were stratified as short-term (in-hospital or two weeks), medium-term (up to 10 weeks) and long-term (up to six months). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Seventy-nine studies met inclusion criteria. In routine care settings, pooled short-term mortality from cryptococcal meningitis was 44% (95% confidence interval (95% CI):39% to 49%, 40 studies), which did not differ between amphotericin (either alone or with fluconazole) and fluconazole-based induction regimens, and was twofold higher than pooled mortality in clinical trials using amphotericin based treatment (21% (95% CI:17% to 25%), 17 studies). Pooled short-term mortality of TB meningitis was 46% (95% CI: 33% to 59%, 11 studies, all routine care). For pneumococcal meningitis, pooled short-term mortality was 54% in routine care settings (95% CI:44% to 64%, nine studies), with similar mortality reported in two included randomized-controlled trials. Few studies evaluated long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Mortality rates from HIV-associated meningitis in SSA are very high under routine care conditions. Better strategies are needed to reduce mortality from HIV-associated meningitis in the region.","Tenforde, Mark W; Gertz, Alida M; Lawrence, David S; Wills, Nicola K; Guthrie, Brandon L; Farquhar, Carey; Jarvis, Joseph N",Journal of the International AIDS Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25416; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31957332/,246

OBJECTIVE To describe our experience with artificial intelligence (AI) for automated ELVO detection and its impact on stroke workflow. METHODS We conducted a retrospective chart review of code stroke cases in which VizAI was used for automated ELVO detection. Patients with ELVO identified by VizAI were compared with patients with ELVO identified by usual care. Details of treatment, CT angiography (CTA) interpretation by blinded neuroradiologists, and stroke workflow metrics were collected. Univariate statistical comparisons and linear regression analysis were performed to quantify time savings for stroke metrics. RESULTS Six hundred and eighty consecutive code strokes were evaluated by AI; 104 patients were diagnosed with ELVO during the study period. Forty-five patients with ELVO were identified by AI and 59 by usual care. Sixty-nine mechanical thrombectomies were performed.Median time from CTA to team notification was shorter for AI ELVOs (7 vs 26 min; p<0.001). Door to arterial puncture was faster for transfer patients with ELVO detected by AI versus usual care transfer patients (141 vs 185 min; p=0.027). AI yielded a time savings of 22 min for team notification and a 23 min reduction in door to arterial puncture for transfer patients. CONCLUSIONS AI automated alerts can be incorporated into a comprehensive stroke center hub and spoke system of care. The use of AI to detect ELVO improves clinically meaningful stroke workflow metrics, resulting in faster treatment times for mechanical thrombectomy.","Elijovich, Lucas; Dornbos Iii, David; Nickele, Christopher; Alexandrov, Andrei; Inoa-Acosta, Violiza; Arthur, Adam S; Hoit, Daniel",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2021-017714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34417344/,246

Objectives To describe the frequency of cases, deaths, incidence, and case fatality rate attributed to COVID-19 in children and adolescents from Latin American and the Caribbean countries. Methods An observational study was carried-out using COVID-19 case registries in children and adolescents published by the Ministries of Health of 19 countries in Latin American and the Caribbean countries until May 20, 2020. Cases and deaths were classified by sex and age group. Also, incidence and case fatality rates were calculated for each country. Results A total of 20,757 (4.2% of all patients) cases of COVID-19 were reported in children from 0 to 19 years of age. 52.4% was in the group aged 10 to 19 years. 50.6% were male. 139 (0.26%) deaths were reported in children from 0 to 19 years. The accumulated incidence was higher in Chile, Panama, and Peru. The cumulative incidence per 100,000 inhabitants ranged from 1.26 to 77.55 in the population from 0 to 9 years old, 1.57 to 98.84 from 10 to 19 years old, and 0.91 to 88.34 from 0 to 19 years old.

To identify suitable therapeutic targets, a more comprehensive understanding of the viral entry pathway is required, particularly of the role of proteases. Here, we identified the proteases that activate the viral spike (S) glycoprotein to initiate cell entry and also pinpointed the host-cellular pathways that PDCoV uses for entry. Our results revealed that cathepsin L (CTSL) and cathepsin B (CTSB) in lysosomes and extracellular trypsin in cell cultures independently activate the S protein for membrane fusion. Pretreating the cells with the lysosomal acidification inhibitor bafilomycin-A1 (Baf-A1) completely inhibited PDCoV entry, and siRNA-mediated ablation of CTSL or CTSB expression significantly reduced viral infection, indicating that PDCoV uses an endosomal pathway for entry. Of note, trypsin treatment of cell cultures also activated PDCoV entry, even when the endosomal pathway was inhibited. This observation indicated that trypsin-induced S protein cleavage and activation in cell cultures enables viral entry directly from the cell surface. Our results provide critical insights into the PDCoV infection mechanism, uncovering two distinct viral entry pathways: one through cathepsin L and cathepsin B in the endosome and another via a protease at the cell surface. Because PDCoV infection sites represent a proteases-rich environment, these findings suggest that endosome inhibitor treatment alone is insufficient to block PDCoV entry into intestinal epithelial cells in vivo Therefore, approaches that inhibit viral entry from the cell membrane should also be considered.","Zhang, Jialin; Chen, Jianfei; Shi, Da; Shi, Hongyan; Zhang, Xin; Liu, Jianbo; Cao, Liyan; Zhu, Xiangdong; Liu, Ye; Wang, Xiaobo; Ji, Zhaoyang; Feng, Li",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.007779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31068417/,246
82528,Body mass index and immune-related adverse events in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-07-09,"The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been starkly unequal across race and ethnicity. We examined the geographic variation in excess all-cause mortality by race and ethnicity to better understand the impact of the pandemic. We used individual-level administrative data on the US population between January 2011 and April 2020 to estimate the geographic variation in excess all-cause mortality by race and Hispanic origin. All-cause mortality allows a better understanding of the overall impact of the pandemic than mortality attributable to COVID-19 directly. Nationwide, adjusted excess all-cause mortality during that period was 6.8 per 10,000 for Black people, 4.3 for Hispanic people, 2.7 for Asian people, and 1.5 for White people. Nationwide averages mask substantial geographic variation. For example, despite similar excess White mortality, Michigan and Louisiana had markedly different excess Black mortality, as did Pennsylvania compared with Rhode Island. Wisconsin experienced no significant White excess mortality but had significant Black excess mortality. Further work understanding the causes of geographic variation in racial and ethnic disparities-the relevant roles of social and environmental factors relative to comorbidities and of the direct and indirect health effects of the pandemic-is crucial for effective policy making.","Polyakova, Maria; Udalova, Victoria; Kocks, Geoffrey; Genadek, Katie; Finlay, Keith; Finkelstein, Amy N",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33523748/,246

METHODS Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 40) or a control group (n = 40). The intervention group was followed up with WeChat, while the control group was followed up using a traditional method. The disease knowledge, mental state, and quality of life of the two groups of parents were analyzed and compared. RESULTS During the 3-month follow-up period, the PedSQL (PedsQL family impact module) results showed that the overall score in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group. The parents in the intervention group were better at managing ""emotion control,"" ""worry,"" and ""family communication"" than those in the control group. The results of the LKQCHD (Leuven congenital heart disease knowledge questionnaire) showed that the parents in the intervention group had a higher mastery of ""basic knowledge and treatment of congenital heart disease,"" ""related complications,"" and ""postoperative rehabilitation"" than those in the control group. CONCLUSION Knowledge education and psychological counseling for parents of children who underwent VSD repair through WeChat follow-up management can effectively improve parents' knowledge, relieve their anxiety and sadness, and improve their quality of life.","Xie, Wen-Peng; Liu, Jian-Feng; Lei, Yu-Qing; Cao, Hua; Chen, Qiang",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15848; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34318543/,246

Moreover, triple-reassortant swine (TRS) H1N1 viruses, which share similar host and lineage origins with 2009 H1N1 viruses, have been responsible for sporadic human cases since 2005. Similar to 2009 H1N1 viruses, TRS viruses are capable of causing severe disease in previously healthy individuals and frequently manifest with gastrointestinal symptoms; however, their ability to cause severe disease has not been extensively studied. Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity and transmissibility of two TRS viruses associated with disease in humans in the ferret model. TRS and 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited comparable viral titers and histopathologies following virus infection and were similarly unable to transmit efficiently via respiratory droplets in the ferret model. Utilizing TRS and 2009 H1N1 viruses, we conducted extensive hematologic and blood serum analyses on infected ferrets to identify lymphohematopoietic parameters associated with mild to severe influenza virus infection. Following H1N1 or H5N1 influenza virus infection, ferrets were found to recapitulate several laboratory abnormalities previously documented with human disease, furthering the utility of the ferret model for the assessment of influenza virus pathogenicity.","Belser, Jessica A; Gustin, Kortney M; Maines, Taronna R; Blau, Dianna M; Zaki, Sherif R; Katz, Jacqueline M; Tumpey, Terrence M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02231-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21123386/,246

Measuring the levels of these components at the same time would be critical in studying mitochondrial functions. We have established an HPLC method to simultaneously measure ATP, ADP, AMP, malondialdehyde and uric acid. Samples were treated with perchloric acid followed by centrifugation. After neutralization, the supernatant was subjected to HPLC determination. HPLC was performed with a C18 chromatographic column, isocratic elusion and UV detection. The detection and quantification limits for these components were determined with standard solutions. The precision, repeatability and 24-hour stability were evaluated with cellular samples, and their relative standard deviations were all within 2%. The reproducibility and efficiency were confirmed with sample recovery tests and the observed oxidative effects of H2 O2 on Jurkat cells. With this method, we discovered the dependence of energy and oxidative states on the density of Jurkat cells cultured in suspension. We also found a significant correlation between uric acid in serum with that in saliva. These results indicate that this method has good accuracy and applicability. It can be used in biological, pharmacological and clinical studies, especially those involving mitochondria, reactive oxygen species and purinergic signalling.","Chen, Yanjie; Ji, Peng; Ma, Guangyin; Song, Zehua; Tang, Bruce Qing; Li, Tongju",Biomedical chromatography : BMC,https://doi.org/10.1002/bmc.5156; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955024/,246

85451,Point-of-care ultrasound assessment of the abdominal aorta by physician assistant students: a pilot study.,2020-08-25,"PURPOSE Multimorbidity is associated with increased intensity of end-of-life healthcare. This association has been examined by number but not type of conditions. Our purpose was to understand how intensity of care is influenced by multimorbidity within specific chronic conditions to provide guidance for interventions to improve end-of-life care for these patients. METHODS We identified adults cared for in a multihospital healthcare system who died between 2010-2017. We categorized patients by 4 primary chronic conditions: heart failure, pulmonary disease, renal disease, or dementia. Within each condition, we examined the effect of multimorbidity (presence of 4 or more chronic conditions) on hospital and ICU admission in the last 30 days of life, in-hospital death, and advance care planning (ACP) documentation >30 days before death. We performed logistic regression to estimate associations between multimorbidity and end-of-life care utilization, stratified by the presence or absence of ACP documentation. RESULTS ACP documentation >30 days before death was associated with lower odds of in-hospital death for all 4 conditions both in patients with and without multimorbidity. With the exception of patients with renal disease without multimorbidity, we observed lower odds of hospitalization and ICU admission for all patients with ACP >30 days before death. CONCLUSIONS Patients with dementia and multimorbidity had the highest odds of high-intensity end-of-life care. For patients with dementia, heart failure, or pulmonary disease, ACP documentation >30 days before death was associated with lower likelihood of in-hospital death, hospitalization, and ICU use at end-of-life, regardless of multimorbidity.","McDermott, Cara L; Engelberg, Ruth A; Khandelwal, Nita; Steiner, Jill M; Feemster, Laura C; Sibley, James; Lober, William B; Curtis, J Randall",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120968527; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084357/,246
85539,Impending Shortages of Kidney Replacement Therapy for COVID-19 Patients.,2020-04-28,"Background Hewes flap is a tarsoconjunctival eyelid flap, based at the lateral canthal tendon, and rotated and stretched to repair lateral defects in the lower eyelid commonly following tumor surgery. The aim of the present study was to monitor perfusion in a Hewes flap during reconstruction, which to the best of our knowledge, has not previously been done. Methods A Hewes tarsoconjunctival eyelid flap was raised and the effects on blood perfusion of rotating the flaps by 90° and 180°, stretching the flaps with a force of 5 or 10 N, and repeated diathermic coagulation was monitored with laser speckle contrast imaging. Results Rotating the flaps by 90° did not significantly affect perfusion, while further rotation to 180° reduced blood perfusion to 75% of the baseline value. When the tarsoconjunctival flaps were both rotated 90° and stretched with 5 N, the perfusion was reduced even further, to 63%. A further reduction in perfusion, to 36%, was seen when the higher force of 10 N was applied. Diathermy decreased blood perfusion to 56% after being applied once. Successive applications led to further decreases: 43%, 31%, and 15%, after the second, third and fourth applications. Conclusions Perfusion in Hewes tarsoconjunctival flaps is affected by both rotation and stretching, but some perfusion is maintained despite these manipulations. Diathermy, however, has detrimental effects and should be avoided.","Ansson, Cu Dinh; Sheikh, Rafi; Dahlstrand, Ulf; Hult, Jenny; Lindstedt, Sandra; Malmsjö, Malin",JPRAS open,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpra.2018.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32158843/,246

87572,Can Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound Treat Discrete Pulmonary Lesions in Patients With COVID-19?,2020-10-19,"PURPOSE The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with reports of increased substance use. College students are a population of concern for high risk binge drinking and their behavior may be particularly impacted by COVID-19 campus closures. Therefore, we examine first-year college students' binge drinking soon after their university's pandemic-related suspension of in-person operations. METHODS Students from a single campus (N = 741; age: M = 18.05, SD = 0.22) completed one assessment in April-May 2020 post-campus closure (March 2020) including theoretically-informed measures (e.g., drinking motives, norms) and two items of self-reported pre- and post-closure binge drinking frequency, the focus of these analyses. RESULTS About half of students consistently reported not binge drinking pre- and post-closure; 6.75% reported a consistent frequency of binge drinking pre- and post-closure. Many (39.41%) reported lower 30-day binge drinking post-campus closure compared to their pre-closure reports; few (4.18%) reported higher 30-day binge drinking frequency post-campus closure. Students reporting lower binge drinking post-closure showed differences in coping, social, and enhancement drinking motives and isolation. Students reporting greater post-closure binge drinking reported higher perceived drinking norms and were more likely to be in Greek life. CONCLUSION This study demonstrates self-reported patterns in binge drinking among first-year college students at the point of COVID-19 campus closures. Pandemic-related college closures may have been a temporary environmental intervention on this high-risk behavior for some students. Although many students were not binge drinking, some continued binge drinking after closure and may benefit from preventive interventions.","Bonar, Erin E; Parks, Michael J; Gunlicks-Stoessel, Meredith; Lyden, Grace R; Mehus, Christopher J; Morrell, Nicole; Patrick, Megan E",Addictive behaviors,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.106879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33706071/,246

Among these, the dianionic d-serine pyrazine derivatives 2d and 2j, and the neutral dihydroxypropyl 2h, exhibited favorable physicochemical and clearance properties. In vitro studies show that 2d, 2h, and 2j have low plasma protein binding, a necessary condition for renal excretion. In vivo animal model results show that these three compounds exhibit a plasma clearance equivalent to iothalamate (a commonly considered gold standard GFR agent). In addition, these compounds have a higher urine recovery compared to iothalamate. Finally, the plasma clearance of 2d, 2h, and 2j remained unchanged upon blockage of the tubular secretion pathway with probenecid, a necessary condition for establishment of clearance via glomerular filtration only. Hence, 2d, 2h, and 2j are promising candidates for translation to the clinic as exogenous fluorescent tracer agents in real-time point-of-care monitoring of GFR.","Rajagopalan, Raghavan; Neumann, William L; Poreddy, Amruta R; Fitch, Richard M; Freskos, John N; Asmelash, Bethel; Gaston, Kimberly R; Galen, Karen P; Shieh, Jeng-Jong; Dorshow, Richard B",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jm200257k; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21667980/,246

This study aims to identify and evaluate the forms of supportive care for patients with respiratory diseases. Methods An umbrella review of supportive care for patient with respiratory diseases was undertaken. We comprehensively searched the following databases: Medline, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang Data and CBM (SinoMed) from their inception to 31 March 2020, and other sources to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to supportive treatments for patient with respiratory diseases including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and influenza. We assessed the methodological quality using the AMSTAR score and the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes of each included systematic review and meta-analysis. Results We included 18 systematic reviews and meta-analyses in this study. Most studies focused on the respiratory and circulatory support. Ten studies were of high methodological quality, five studies of medium quality, and three studies of low quality. According to four studies extracorporeal membrane oxygenation did not reduce mortality in adults [odds ratio/relative risk (OR/RR) ranging from 0.71 to 1.28], but two studies reported significantly lower mortality in patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than in the control group (OR/RR ranging from 0.38 to 0.73). Besides, monitoring of vital signs and increasing the number of medical staff may also reduce the mortality in patients with respiratory diseases. Conclusions Our overview suggests that supportive care may reduce the mortality of patients with respiratory diseases to some extent. However, the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes in the included studies was low to moderate. Further systematic reviews and meta-analyses are needed to address the evidence gap regarding the supportive care for SARS, MERS and COVID-19.","Luo, Xufei; Lv, Meng; Wang, Xiaoqing; Long, Xin; Ren, Mengjuan; Zhang, Xianzhuo; Liu, Yunlan; Li, Weiguo; Zhou, Qi; Ma, Yanfang; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Wang, Xiaohui; Chen, Yaolong",Annals of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32566558/,246

91110,Emerging therapies for right ventricular dysfunction and failure.,2020-10-01,"Background Respiratory depression is a serious perioperative complication associated with morbidity and mortality. Recently, technology has become available to wirelessly monitor patients on regular surgical wards with continuous pulse oximetry and wireless clinician notification with alarms. When a patient's SpO2 falls below a set threshold, the clinician is notified via a pager and may intervene earlier to prevent further clinical deterioration. To date, the technology has not been evaluated with a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods We designed a parallel-group unblinded pilot RCT of a wireless monitoring system on two surgical wards in an academic teaching hospital. Postsurgical patients with an anticipated length of stay of at least 1 day were included and randomized to standard care or standard care plus wireless respiratory monitoring for up to a 72-h period. The primary outcomes were feasibility outcomes: average patients recruited per week and tolerability of the system by patients. Secondary outcomes included (1) respiratory events (naloxone administration for respiratory depression, ICU transfers, and cardiac arrest team activation) and (2) system alarm types and details. The analysis of the outcomes was based on descriptive statistics and estimates reported using point (95% confidence intervals). Criteria for success of feasibility were recruitment of an average of 15 patients/week and 90% of the patients tolerating the system. Results The pilot trial enrolled 250 of the 335 patients screened for eligibility, with 126 and 124 patients entering the standard monitoring and wireless groups, respectively. Baseline demographics were similar between groups, except for slightly more women in the wireless group. Average patient recruitment per week was 14 95% CI [12, 16] patients. The wireless monitoring was quite tolerable with 86.6% (95% CI 78.2-92.7%) of patients completing the full course, and there were no other adverse events directly attributable to the monitoring. With regard to secondary outcomes, the respiratory event rate was low with only 1 event in the wireless group and none in the control group. The average number of alarms per week was 4.0 (95% CI, 1.6-6.4). Conclusions This pilot study demonstrated adequate patient recruitment and high tolerability of the wireless monitoring system.

Cyclic β2,3-amino acids (cβAAs), such as 2-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (2-ACHC), are strong helix/turn inducers due to their restricted conformations. Here we report the ribosomal synthesis of foldamer peptides that contain multiple, up to ten, consecutive cβAAs via genetic code reprogramming. We also report the de novo discovery of macrocyclic cβAA-containing peptides capable of binding to a protein target. As a demonstration, potent binders with low-to-subnanomolar KD values were identified for human factor XIIa (hFXIIa) and interferon-gamma receptor 1, from a library of their 1012 members. One of the anti-hFXIIa macrocyclic peptides that exhibited a high inhibitory activity and serum stability was co-crystallized with hFXIIa. The X-ray structure revealed that it adopts an antiparallel β-sheet structure induced by a (1S,2S)-2-ACHC residue via the formation of two γ-turns. This work demonstrates the potential of this platform to explore the previously inaccessible sequence space of cβAA-containing peptides.","Katoh, Takayuki; Sengoku, Toru; Hirata, Kunio; Ogata, Kazuhiro; Suga, Hiroaki",Nature chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41557-020-0525-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839601/,246

The glycan library included blood group antigens and other most frequent terminal oligosaccharides and their cores of mammalian N- and O-linked glycoproteins and glycolipids, tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens, and common components of bacterial/pathogenic polysaccharides and lipopolysaccharides, totally 205 glycans. The serum Ab interacted with at least 50 normal human glyco-motifs. Apart from expected blood group-, xeno- (heterophil) and infection-related binding activities, we observed a number of new and unexpected features. The surprising, relatively high antibody binding was found to the blood group P(1) and P(k) trisaccharides and H(type 2) trisaccharide. Novel and very high binding activities have been observed towards Galbeta1-3GlcNAc (Le(C)) related glycans, especially 3'-O-Su-Le(C), and towards 4'-O-sulfated lactosamine. Relatively high and uniform Ab binding to GalNAcalpha1-3Gal disaccharide demonstrated absence of correlation with fucosylated blood group A GalNAcalpha1-3(Fucalpha1-2)Gal antigen-similarly to well known relationship between Galalpha1-3Gal and true, fucosylated blood group B Galalpha1-3(Fucalpha1-2)Gal antigen. The binding intensity to Galalpha1-3Galbeta1-4GlcNAc xenoantigen was shown to be rather modest. Absence or very low Ab binding was found against oligosialic acid, sialooligosaccharides except SiaT(n), type 2 backbone glycans such as Le(y), and biantennary N-chain as well as its truncated forms, i.e. without terminal Sia, SiaGal, and SiaGalGlcNAc motifs. We have also found that Ab are capable of recognizing the short inner core typical for glycolipids (-Galbeta1-4Glc) and glycoproteins (-GalNAcalpha) as a fragment of bigger glycans.","Huflejt, Margaret E; Vuskovic, Marko; Vasiliu, Daniela; Xu, Hongyu; Obukhova, Polina; Shilova, Nadezhda; Tuzikov, Alexander; Galanina, Oxana; Arun, Banu; Lu, Karen; Bovin, Nicolai",Molecular immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2009.06.010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19608278/,246
93022,A Retrospective Study of Preferable Alternative Route to Right Internal Jugular Vein for Placing Tunneled Dialysis Catheters: Right External Jugular Vein versus Left Internal Jugular Vein.,2016,"PURPOSE In our previous study, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) system using imaging findings annotated by radiologists. The system, however, requires radiologists to input many imaging findings. In order to reduce such an interaction of radiologists, we further developed a CADx system using derived imaging findings based on calculated image features, in which the system only requires few user operations. The purpose of this study is to check whether calculated image features (CFT) or derived imaging findings (DFD) can represent information in imaging findings annotated by radiologists (AFD). METHODS We calculate 2282 image features and derive 39 imaging findings by using information on a nodule position and its type (solid or ground-glass). These image features are categorized into shape features, texture features and imaging findings-specific features. Each imaging finding is derived based on each corresponding classifier using random forest. To check whether CFT or DFD can represent information in AFD, under an assumption that the accuracies of classifiers are the same if information included in input is the same, we constructed classifiers by using various types of information (CTT, DFD and AFD) and compared accuracies on an inferred diagnosis of a nodule. We employ SVM with RBF kernel as classifier to infer a diagnosis name. RESULTS Accuracies of classifiers using DFD, CFT, AFD and CFT [Formula: see text] AFD were 0.613, 0.577, 0.773 and 0.790, respectively. Concordance rates between DFD and AFD of shape findings, texture findings and surrounding findings were 0.644, 0.871 and 0.768, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that CFT and AFD are similar information and CFT represent only a portion of AFD. Particularly, CFT did not contain shape information in AFD. In order to decrease an interaction of radiologists, a development of a method which overcomes these problems is necessary.","Kawagishi, Masami; Chen, Bin; Furukawa, Daisuke; Sekiguchi, Hiroyuki; Sakai, Koji; Kubo, Takeshi; Yakami, Masahiro; Fujimoto, Koji; Sakamoto, Ryo; Emoto, Yutaka; Aoyama, Gakuto; Iizuka, Yoshio; Nakagomi, Keita; Yamamoto, Hiroyuki; Togashi, Kaori",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11548-017-1554-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28285338/,246
93052,Correlation of the endoscopic findings for small and large bowels in pediatric patients with established Crohn's disease.,2019,"Human astroviruses (HAtVs) are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that were discovered in 1975. Astroviruses infecting other species, particularly mammalian and avian, were identified and classified into the genera Mamastrovirus and Avastrovirus. Through next-generation sequencing, many new astroviruses infecting different species, including humans, have been described, and the Astroviridae family shows a high diversity and zoonotic potential. Three divergent groups of HAstVs are recognized: the classic (MAstV 1), HAstV-MLB (MAstV 6), and HAstV-VA/HMO (MAstV 8 and MAstV 9) groups. Classic HAstVs contain 8 serotypes and account for 2 to 9% of all acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in children worldwide. Infections are usually self-limiting but can also spread systemically and cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients. The other groups have also been identified in children with gastroenteritis, but extraintestinal pathologies have been suggested for them as well. Classic HAstVs may be grown in cells, allowing the study of their cell cycle, which is similar to that of caliciviruses. The continuous emergence of new astroviruses with a potential zoonotic transmission highlights the need to gain insights on their biology in order to prevent future health threats. This review focuses on the basic virology, pathogenesis, host response, epidemiology, diagnostic assays, and prevention strategies for HAstVs.","Bosch, Albert; Pintó, Rosa M; Guix, Susana",Clinical microbiology reviews,https://doi.org/10.1128/cmr.00013-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25278582/,246

BACKGROUND Convalescent plasma from people recovered from COVID-19 with sufficient antibody titres is a potential option for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. However, to date, recruiting and retaining COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors has been challenging. Understanding why those eligible to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma have not donated is critical to developing recruitment campaigns. METHODS/MATERIALS A total of 419 UK residents who indicated that they had been infected with COVID-19 and who lived within 50 km of sites collecting COVID-19 convalescent plasma completed an online survey between 25th June and 5th July 2020. Respondents completed items assessing their awareness of convalescent plasma, motivations and barriers to donation and intention to donate COVID-19 convalescent plasma. RESULTS Awareness of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was low. Exploratory factor analysis identified six motivations and seven barriers to donating. A stronger sense of altruism through adversity and moral and civic duty were positively related to intention to donate, whereas generic donation fears was negatively related. CONCLUSIONS Once potential donors are aware of convalescent plasma, interventions should focus on the gratitude and reciprocity that those eligible to donate feel, along with a focus on (potentially) helping family and norms of what people ought to do. Fears associated with donation should not be neglected, and strategies that have been successfully used tor recruit whole-blood donors should be adapted and deployed to recruit COVID-19 convalescent plasma donors.","Masser, Barbara M; Ferguson, Eamonn; Thorpe, Rachel; Lawrence, Claire; Davison, Tanya E; Hoad, Veronica; Gosbell, Iain B",Transfusion medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/tme.12753; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368777/,246
94864,Complementary deformation of tracheal tubes and flexible introducers: a prerequisite to a secured guided tracheal intubation.,2019,"One striking characteristic of certain herpesviruses is their ability to induce rapid and widespread RNA decay in order to gain access to host resources. This phenotype is induced by viral endoribonucleases, including SOX in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), muSOX in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68), BGLF5 in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and vhs in herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1). Here, we performed comparative transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) upon expression of these herpesviral endonucleases in order to characterize their effect on the host transcriptome. Consistent with previous reports, we found that approximately two-thirds of transcripts were downregulated in cells expressing any of these viral endonucleases. Among the transcripts spared from degradation, we uncovered a cluster of transcripts that systematically escaped degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among these escapees, we identified C19ORF66 and reveal that this transcript is protected from degradation by its 3' untranslated region (UTR). We then show that C19ORF66 is a potent KSHV restriction factor by impeding early viral gene expression, suggesting that its ability to escape viral cleavage may be an important component of the host response to viral infection. Collectively, our comparative approach is a powerful tool to pinpoint key regulators of the viral-host interplay and led us to uncover a novel KSHV regulator.IMPORTANCE Viruses are master regulators of the host gene expression machinery. This is crucial to promote viral infection and to dampen host immune responses. Many viruses, including herpesviruses, express RNases that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, it emerged that some mRNAs escape this fate, although it has been difficult to determine whether these escaping transcripts benefit viral infection or instead participate in an antiviral mechanism. To tackle this question, we compared the effect of the herpesviral RNases on the human transcriptome and identified a cluster of transcripts consistently escaping degradation from all tested endonucleases. Among the protected mRNAs, we identified the transcript C19ORF66 and showed that it restricts Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. Collectively, these results provide a framework to explore how the control of RNA fate in the context of viral-induced widespread mRNA degradation may influence the outcome of viral infection.","Rodriguez, William; Srivastav, Kumaraman; Muller, Mandy",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00373-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30944177/,246
95520,Aggressive CSF diversion reverses delayed cerebral ischemia in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report.,2012,"This study examines trends in the rates of active commuting to school (ACS) in Spanish children (n=18,343; 8.93±1.68) and adolescents (n=18,438; 14.11±1.58) aged 6-18 years from 2010 to 2017. Given the study period included the economic crisis in Spain (2008-2013), the second aim of this study was to compare ACS rates during and after the economic crisis. Data were obtained from 28 studies conducted across Spain. The overall trends in ACS were evaluated using multilevel logistic regression analysis. Among Spanish children and adolescents, the rates of ACS to school ranged around 60% between 2010 and 2017. The rates of ACS in Spanish youth did not change significantly during the 2010-2017 period, except a sporadic increase in the rate of ACS in adolescents in 2012-2013. No significant association between the ACS and the economic crisis time period in youth were found. As conclusion, the ACS remains stable in Spain during the last decade, which is a promising result regarding the evidenced decreasing trend in many countries. Further educational and policy strategies are important to continue promoting this behavior in children and adolescents in the long term.","Gálvez-Fernández, P; Herrador-Colmenero, M; Esteban-Cornejo, I; Castro-Piñero, J; Molina-García, J; Queralt, A; Aznar, S; Abarca-Sos, A; González-Cutre, D; Vidal-Conti, J; Fernández-Muñoz, S; Vida, J; Ruiz-Ariza, A; Rodríguez-Rodríguez, F; Moliner-Urdiales, D; Villa-González, E; Barranco-Ruiz, Y; Huertas-Delgado, F J; Mandic, S; Chillón, P",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423302/,246

The objective of this study is to describe the impact of COVID on the delivery of treatment for substance use disorders (SUDs) from the perspectives of service providers. METHODS Between May and September 2020, 61 service providers from 16 SUD treatment sites in California participated in virtual focus groups that lasted about an hour. We recorded the discussions and transcribed them verbatim. Two qualitative analysts independently conducted content analysis to identify themes from the transcripts. RESULTS At the beginning of the pandemic, service providers observed a slight decrease in patient admissions, followed by an uptick in patient flow due to increased mental health issues, alcohol use, and relapse. Many of the clinics adopted flexible service delivery modes, such as curbside dosing and extended take-home medication, to enable social distancing in clinic settings. Approximately half of the clinic encounters offered telemedicime, and a considerable proportion of patients preferred to use telephone-based services rather than video-based services. Internet instability and technical difficulties limited the use of telemedicine among their patients. CONCLUSION COVID has been challenging for SUD treatment, but health care systems rapidly reacted with adjustments that may result in long-term changes in SUD service delivery. Telemedicine-based services have played a major role in ensuring uninterrupted patient care. Providers need organizational, technical, and logistical support to improve and sustain telemedicine services that increase access to quality care for their patients.","Lin, Chunqing; Clingan, Sarah E; Cousins, Sarah J; Valdez, Jonathan; Mooney, Larissa J; Hser, Yih-Ing",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34183213/,246

We assessed the levels of monitoring and achievement of European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) performance measures (PMs) across Europe using responses to the ECQI questionnaires. Methods The questionnaire comprises three forms: institution and practitioner questionnaires are completed once; a procedure questionnaire is completed on multiple occasions for individual total colonoscopies. ESGE PMs were approximated as closely as possible from the data collected via the procedure questionnaire. Procedure data could provide rate of adequate bowel preparation, cecal intubation rate (CIR), withdrawal time, polyp detection rate (PDR), and tattooing resection sites. Results We evaluated ECQI questionnaire data collected between June 2016 and April 2018, comprising 91 practitioner and 52 institution questionnaires. A total of 6445 completed procedure forms were received. Institution and practitioner responses indicate that routine recording of PMs is not widespread: adenoma detection rate (ADR) is routinely recorded in 29 % of institutions and by 34 % of practitioners; PDR by 42 % and 47 %, CIR by 62 % and 64 %, bowel preparation quality by 56 % and 76 %, respectively.

METHODS We studied 94 non-obese, non-diabetic, Japanese men. Using a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, we evaluated insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver. Intrahepatic lipid and fat distribution were measured using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, respectively. We divided the subjects into risk carrying group with ALDH2 rs671 G/G (n=53) and non-risk carrying group with ALDH2 rs671 G/A or A/A (n=41). RESULTS The risk carrying group had significantly higher levels of alcohol consumption (18.4 (IQR, 10.4-48.9) vs. 12.1(IQR, 1.3-29.0) g/day; P=0.003), elevated fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (97.5±7.9 vs. 93.5±6.2 mg/dL; P=0.010), lower hepatic insulin sensitivity (61.7±20.5% vs.73.1±15.9%; P=0.003) and lower fasting glucose clearance (0.84±0.8 dL·m -2·min -1 vs. 0.87±0.09 dL·m -2·min -1; P=0.047) than the non-risk carrying group, while insulin resistance in muscle and body fat distribution were similar. The single linear correlation analysis revealed significant correlations between alcohol consumption and hepatic insulin sensitivity (r=-0.262, P=0.011), fasting glucose clearance (r=-0.370, P<0.001) or FPG (r=0.489, P<0.001). The multiple regression analysis revealed that both ALDH2 rs671 G/G genotype and alcohol consumption were significant independent correlates for hepatic insulin sensitivity, while only alcohol consumption was a significant independent correlate for fasting glucose clearance. CONCLUSION Our data suggested that high-alcohol-intake dependent and independent hepatic insulin resistance and reduced fasting glucose clearance due to high alcohol intake could be a relatively upstream metabolic abnormality in ALDH2 rs671 G/G carriers.","Takeno, Kageumi; Tamura, Yoshifumi; Kakehi, Saori; Kaga, Hideyoshi; Kawamori, Ryuzo; Watada, Hirotaka",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgab324; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974068/,246

Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, time to full weight-bearing activity, medical cost, ankle function, and ankle pain were compared between the 2 groups.The operation time was significantly less with cortical screw fixation (57.1 ± 5.3 min) than with tendon suture fixation (63.3 ± 6.3 min; p = 0.01), but there was no significant difference in intraoperative blood loss. The time until full weight-bearing was possible was significantly longer after cortical screw fixation (10.9 ± 2.7 weeks) than after tendon suture fixation (7.1 ± 1.9 weeks; P < .001). The medical cost was much greater for cortical screw fixation (1861.6 ± 187.3 USD) than for tendon suture fixation (1209.6 ± 97.6 USD; P < .01). The rate of excellent and good ankle function at 3 months after surgery was significantly higher with tendon suture fixation (71.4%) than with cortical screw fixation (33.3%; P = .03).Tendon suture fixation is associated with quicker recovery of ankle function, shorter time to full weight-bearing, and lower medical cost to the patient compared with screw fixation.

Methods: For 10 decedents with 2019-nCoV infection in Wuhan, bilateral lungs underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous multi-point puncture autopsy, and pulmonary pathological changes were described in routine hematoxylin-eosin staining (HE) slides. Electron microscopy was also performed. The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to detect 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in lung tissue, and the pathological characteristics were demonstrated in combination with clinical data analysis. Results: Of the 10 deaths associated with COVID-19, 7 were male and 3 were female. The average age was 70 (39-87) years. Medical record showed that 7 patients had underlying diseases. The average course of disease was 30 (16-36) days. Nine cases showed fibrinous and suppurative exudation in the alveolar cavity accompanied by the formation of hyaline membrane, and fibroblastic proliferation of alveolar septum. Type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cells showed reactive hyperplasia and desquamation. Many macrophages accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Capillary hyaline thrombus and intravascular mixed thrombus were noted. In some cases, acute bronchiolitis with mucous membrane exfoliation, accumulation of bronchiolar secretions, and bronchiolar epithelial metaplasia occurred. In the cohort, a large number of bacteria (cocci) were detected in 1 case and a large number of fungi (yeast type) were detected in 1 case. Nine cases were positive for the nucleic acids of 2019-nCoV while one case remained negative by RT-PCR. Coronavirus particles were detected in the cytoplasm of type Ⅱ alveolar epithelium. Conclusions: The pulmonary pathological changes of fatal COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), mainly in the acute exudative stage and the organic proliferative stage. There are fibrinous exudate aggregation in alveolar cavity with hyaline membrane formation, fibroblastic proliferation in alveolar septum, and alveolar epithelial cell injuries with reactive hyperplasia and desquamation of type Ⅱ alveolar epithelial cells. A large amount of neutrophils and monocytes infiltration is present in most cases and bacteria and fungi are detected in some cases, suggesting a serious bacterial or fungal infection secondary to the DAD.","Wu, J H; Li, X; Huang, B; Su, H; Li, Y; Luo, D J; Chen, S; Ma, L; Wang, S H; Nie, X; Peng, L",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112151-20200405-00291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32486534/,246

Despite months of mitigation strategies, COVID-19 continues to spread and ascertainment of new knowledge about the disease process continues to be a priority of the medical community. Originally described by characteristic symptoms of fever, cough and/or shortness of breath that can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, it has become clear that COVID-19 has manifold clinical presentations (2-4). Notably, olfactory dysfunction (OD)-decreased sense of smell-has been reported to occur in up to 85.6% of COVID-19 patients (2,5).","Speth, M M; Singer-Cornelius, T; Oberle, M; Gengler, I; Brockmeier, S J; Sedaghat, A R",Rhinology,https://doi.org/10.4193/rhin20.227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32533768/,246

The Flow-Redirection Intraluminal Device (FRED) system has not been previously assessed in a large cohort of patients with posterior circulation aneurysms. The purpose of the present study was to assess safety and efficacy of FRED in this location. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with posterior circulation aneurysms treated at 8 centers participating in the European FRED study (EuFRED) between April 2012 and January 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Complication and radiographic and functional outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS Eighty-four patients (median age, 54 years) with 84 posterior circulation aneurysms were treated with the FRED. A total of 25 aneurysms (29.8%) had previously ruptured, even though most aneurysms were diagnosed incidentally (45.2%). The intradural vertebral artery was the most common location (50%), and saccular, the most common morphology (40.5%). The median size was 7 mm. There were 8 (9.5%) symptomatic thromboembolic and no hemorrhagic complications. Thromboembolic complications occurred mostly (90.9%) in nonsaccular aneurysms. On last follow-up at a median of 24 months, 78.2% of aneurysms were completely occluded. Functional outcome at a median of 27 months was favorable in 94% of patients. All mortalities occurred in patients with acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and its sequelae. CONCLUSIONS The largest cohort of posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the FRED to date demonstrated favorable safety and efficacy profiles of the device for this indication. Treatment in the setting of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage was strongly related to mortality, regardless of whether procedural complications occurred.","Griessenauer, C J; Möhlenbruch, M A; Hendrix, P; Ulfert, C; Islak, C; Sonnberger, M; Engelhorn, T; Müller-Thies-Broussalis, E; Finkenzeller, T; Holtmannspötter, M; Buhk, J-H; Reith, W; Simgen, A; Janssen, H; Kocer, N; Killer-Oberpfalzer, M",AJNR.

Current regimens for TB treatment are lengthy, expensive and ineffective to emerging drug resistant strains. Thus, there is an urgent need for identification and development of novel TB drugs and drug regimens with comprehensive and specific mechanisms of action. Many medicinal plants are traditionally used for TB treatment. While some of their phytochemical composition has been elucidated, their mechanisms of action are not well understood. Insufficient knowledge on Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) biology and the complex nature of its infection limit the effectiveness of current screening-based methods used for TB drug discovery. Nonetheless, application of metabolomics tools within the 'omics' approaches, could provide an alternative method of elucidating the mechanism of action of medicinal plants. Metabolomics aims at high throughput detection, quantification and identification of metabolites in biological samples. Changes in the concentration of specific metabolites in a biological sample indicate changes in the metabolic pathways. In this paper review and discuss novel methods that involve application of metabolomics to drug discovery and the understanding of mechanisms of action of medicinal plants with anti-TB activity. Current knowledge on TB infection, anti-TB drugs and mechanisms of action are also included. We further highlight metabolism of M. tuberculosis and the potential drug targets, as well as current approaches in the development of anti-TB drugs.","Tuyiringire, Naasson; Tusubira, Deusdedit; Munyampundu, Jean-Pierre; Tolo, Casim Umba; Muvunyi, Claude M; Ogwang, Patrick Engeu",Clinical and translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40169-018-0208-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30270413/,246

Lombardy was the first Italian region to be affected by the pandemic. Subsequently, the entire Northern part of Italy recorded a high number of cases, while the South was hit following the migratory waves. On March 8th, the Italian Government has issued a decree that imposed a total lockdown defined as a state of isolation and restricted access in Lombardy and in the other 14 provinces of Northern Italy. METHODS We analyzed the virus trend in the period between February 24th and September 8th, 2020, focusing on Calabria, with regards to the following items: new positives, change of total positives and total cases. Furthermore, we included other information, such as the incubation period, symptom resolution period, quarantine period. RESULTS On March 27th, the epidemic curve spiked with 101 new positive cases validating the hypothesis that this abnormal event was related to the displacement of non-residents people, living in the Northern part of Italy, to the home regions in the South. The epidemic curve showed a decreasing trend in the period after lockdown proving the effectiveness of this measure. From the end of the lockdown (May 04th) to September 8th, the registered trend was -94.51%. A negative growth rate indicates that the number of new positive cases is lower than the number of healed patients. CONCLUSION This study describes the effectiveness of the Italian Government policy, particularly the role of lockdown, for the containment of SARS-CoV-2 contagion in Calabria, a region with a low SARS-CoV-2 infection rate within the registered period.","Abenavoli, Ludovico; Cinaglia, Pietro; Procopio, Anna Caterina; Serra, Raffaele; Aquila, Isabella; Zanza, Christian; Longhitano, Yaroslava; Artico, Marco; Larussa, Tiziana; Boccuto, Luigi; Ricci, Pietrantonio; Luzza, Francesco",Reviews on recent clinical trials,https://doi.org/10.2174/1574887116666210401124945; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33797377/,246

Serious health hazards have been described including cardiac diseases, neurological complications, multi-organ failure, and even death. Spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) is rarely described as a result of ecstasy ingestion. CASE PRESENTATION We present a case of a 19-year-old male patient who was admitted to our rehabilitation center, after developing a T11 AIS B SCI/D following recreational use of ecstasy. DISCUSSION In our case magnetic resonance imaging was inconclusive due to artifacts caused by metallic rods used for surgical scoliosis treatment in the past. This individual received no surgical or pharmacological treatments; however, it is questionable whether any specific treatments would have been beneficial. Ecstasy ingestion leads to a serotonin surge and induces microvascular changes. Neurovascular hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, de novo aneurysm formation, and subsequent rupture can occur. 5-hydroxytryptamine, which comes from serotonergic terminals, is a very potent vasoconstrictive amine and can thus lead to prolonged vasoconstriction and ischemia. It is most likely that the SCI/D in our case is the result of an ischemic event following the vasoconstrictive effects of ecstasy ingestion. It is important to stress the possible consequences of recreational ecstasy usage and in unexplained SCI/D, one should consider the possibility of drug-related causes.","Kastaneer, Myrna Elena; Maijers, Maria Christina; Martina, Juan David",Spinal cord series and cases,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41394-020-0277-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32345982/,246

A report on a patient with COVID-19 with psoriatic arthritis receiving ustekinumab.,2020-08-18,"BACKGROUND Peanut is an important legume crop growing worldwide. With the published allotetraploid genomes, further functional studies of the genes in peanut are very critical for crop improvement. CRISPR/Cas9 system is emerging as a robust tool for gene functional study and crop improvement, which haven't been extensively utilized in peanut yet. Peanut plant forms root nodules to fix nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. In model legumes, the response of plants to rhizobia is initiated by Nod factor receptors (NFRs). However, information about the function of NFRs in peanut is still limited. In this study, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in peanut hairy root transformation system to explore the function of NFR genes. RESULTS We firstly identified four AhNFR1 genes and two AhNFR5 genes in cultivated peanut (Tifrunner). The gene expression analysis showed that the two AhNFR1 and two AhNFR5 genes had high expression levels in nodulating (Nod+) line E5 compared with non-nodulating (Nod-) line E4 during the process of nodule formation, suggesting their roles in peanut nodulation. To further explore their functions in peanut nodulation, we applied CRISPR technology to create knock-out mutants of AhNFR1 and AhNFR5 genes using hairy root transformation system. The sequencing of these genes in transgenic hairy roots showed that the selected AhNFR1 and AhNFR5 genes were successfully edited by the CRISPR system, demonstrating its efficacy for targeted mutation in allotetraploid peanut. The mutants with editing in the two AhNFR5 genes showed Nod- phenotype, whereas mutants with editing in the two selected AhNFR1 genes could still form nodules after rhizobia inoculation. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that CRISPR-Cas9 could be used in peanut hairy root transformation system for peanut functional genomic studies, specifically on the gene function in roots. By using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting peanut AhNFR genes in hairy root transformation system, we validated the function of AhNFR5 genes in nodule formation in peanut.","Shu, Hongmei; Luo, Ziliang; Peng, Ze; Wang, Jianping",BMC plant biology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-020-02614-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32894045/,246

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) isomers in healthy human subjects. METHODS Three ASMA ligands (rac-, L- and D-ASMA) were labeled with (99m)Tc(CO)3 using an IsoLink kit (Covidien), and each formed (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) tracer was co-injected with (131)I-OIH into healthy human subjects followed by sequential imaging, plasma clearance measurements and timed urine collection. Plasma protein binding, red cell uptake and percent injected dose in the urine were determined. Urine from each group of volunteers was analyzed for metabolites by HPLC. RESULTS Image quality was excellent with all three agents. Each (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) preparation was excreted unchanged in the urine. The plasma clearance ratio ((99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA)/(131)I-OIH) was 81 ± 3 % for D-ASMA compared to only 20 ± 4 % for L-ASMA and 37 ± 7 % for rac-ASMA; the 81 % clearance ratio for D-ASMA isomer is still ∼ 30 % higher than the (99m)Tc-MAG3/(131)I-OIH clearance ratio (∼50-60 %). Red cell uptake was similar for all three tracers (6-9 %), and all tracers had a relatively rapid renal excretion; at 3 h, the (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA)/(131)I-OIH urine ratio was 100 ± 3 % for D-ASMA, 80 ± 2 % for L-ASMA and 88 ± 1 % for rac-ASMA. CONCLUSIONS The renal excretion characteristics of (99m)Tc(CO)3(D-ASMA) in humans are superior to those of the other two (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) isomers studied, but are still inferior to (131)I-OIH, even though there was no difference in the clearance of two of (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) isomers and (131)I-OIH in rats. The work described here demonstrates the sensitivity in in vivo biological behavior of (99m)Tc(CO)3(ASMA) isomers to their subtle structural differences.","Lipowska, Malgorzata; Klenc, Jeffrey; Folks, Russell D; Taylor, Andrew T",Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13139-014-0270-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25177379/,246

In the Pinch-Burn-Cut (PBC) technique, a small amount of tissue around the dissection plane is pinched with forceps, electocauterized and gently cut. The present study sought to estimate the usefulness of the PBC technique in LT. METHODS Between June 2007 and December 2010, 123 adult cases underwent LT in our center. Of these, 72 involved a recipient hepatectomy using the PBC technique (PBC group). and 51 involved the conventional technique (non-PBC group). Clinical parameters were compared between two groups. RESULTS The amount of blood loss and related transfusions were significantly reduced, and the operating time was shorter in the PBC group than in the non-PBC group (p=0.006, p<0.05 and p=0.002, respectively). There was also shorter duration of mechanical ventilation after LT in the PBC group (p=0.017).

Respiratory materials (saliva, sputum and food tray swabs) were non-invasively collected from the four cheetahs. Although we were unable to isolate the virus, the NP gene of influenza A virus was detected in three of the cheetahs but not in the fourth cheetah that had nearly recovered. From a food tray swab which tested weakly positive by a commercial influenza detection kit, we were able to obtain the whole-genome sequence of the influenza A virus. Analysis of the genome, A/cheetah/Kanagawa/2/2019(H1N1), revealed that the virus was closely related to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated from humans in Japan in the 2018-2019 winter. Production of haemagglutinin inhibition (HI) antibodies (64-128 HI) against an A(H1N1)pdm09 virus in plasma samples confirmed infection of all four cheetahs. The animals continued to produce antibodies for at least 314 days after disease onset. These findings strongly suggest that reverse zoonotic transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus occurred from human to cheetah and subsequently from cheetah to cheetah in the zoo. We also show that specimens can be safely and non-invasively collected from non-domesticated animals and used to investigate respiratory infectious diseases.","Usui, Tatsufumi; Ueda, Miya; Azumano, Akinori; Nomura, Mika; Arima, Toru; Murata, Koichi; Ito, Toshihiro; Yamaguchi, Tsuyoshi",Zoonoses and public health,https://doi.org/10.1111/zph.12813; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33576190/,246

This sophisticated commercial platform allows the assembly of the viral particle in leaf cells and the systemic spread of heterologous protein biosynthesis in green tissues caused by Agrobacterium tumefaciens ""gene delivery method"". The system also presents increased gene expression levels mediated by potent viral expression machinery. These characteristics allow the mass recovery of heterologous proteins in the leaves of N. benthamiana in 8 to 10 days. This system was highly efficient for the synthesis of different classes of pharmacological proteins and contains enormous potential for the rapid and abundant biosynthesis of AMPs.","Leite, Michel L; Sampaio, Kamila B; Costa, Fabrício F; Franco, Octávio L; Dias, Simoni C; Cunha, Nicolau B",Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,https://doi.org/10.1590/0001-3765201820180124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30365717/,246
105309,"Antibodies: Friends, Foes, or Both? Lessons From COVID-19 for the Rheumatologist.",2021-03-25,"Objectives The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of nontechnical skills (NTS) training on performance in advanced life support (ALS) simulation. Furthermore, we aimed to determine the ideal frequency of training sessions for an optimal retention and the value of debriefing. Methods A systematic search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, WoS, ERIC, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library conducted through August 1, 2018. All primary studies mentioning NTS in ALS education were included. Three reviewers independently extracted data on study design and outcome. The MERSQI approach was used to evaluate the overall quality of evidence. Results Of the 10,723 identified articles, 40 studies were included with a combined total of 3,041 participants, ranging from students to experts. Depending on the focus of the study, articles were categorized in NTS (n = 25), retention (n = 8), and feedback (n = 10). Incorporating NTS during ALS simulation showed significant improvements in timing for performing critical first steps. Furthermore, good leadership skills had a favorable effect on overall technical performance and teamwork during simulation improved team dynamics and performance. Finally, debriefing also had a beneficial effect on team performance. One particular type of debriefing does not appear to be superior to other types of debriefing. Conclusion Team simulation training resulted in improved NTS and a reduction in the time required to complete a simulated cardiac arrest. Therefore, a formal NTS program should be introduced into ALS courses. Feedback and repetitive practice are key factors to train NTS. The impact of training on team behaviors can persist for at least 3 to 6 months. In conclusion, understanding and improving NTS may help to create more effective teams. The effect on patient outcome requires further investigation.","Dewolf, Philippe; Clarebout, Geraldine; Wauters, Lina; Van Kerkhoven, Joke; Verelst, Sandra",AEM education and training,https://doi.org/10.1002/aet2.10522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041431/,246

The training requires a 1:10 instructor-to-participant ratio, which creates a resource drain on volunteer instructors. Nursing students are eligible to assist instructors. PROBLEM Our State Legislature mandated that public schools equip themselves with bleeding control kits resulting in thousands of school staff needing training. APPROACH Our nursing school used a service learning model to aid schools. Nursing students coordinated the program, and student learning occurred through a learning-by-teaching strategy. OUTCOMES We trained 656 community members, taught in 5 counties, and students received 320 clinical hours. If not for COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), numbers would have been doubled. We developed a sustainable relationship with school nurses. Students rated the program highly with respect to meeting course objectives and preparation for professional practice.

105785,A pilot study on the applicability of thromboelastometry in detecting brain tumour-induced hypercoagulation.,2017,"Over the past decade, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has started to replace median sternotomy for the resection of non-invasive anterior mediastinal masses, including thymoma. In fact, many studies confirmed that, compared to standard sternotomy, VATS thymectomy results in less post-operative pain, better preserved pulmonary function, improved cosmesis (which can be particularly important to many young female myasthenia gravis patients) and is oncologically feasible for non-invasive thymomas as long as en bloc resection of the tumour is achieved. Classically three ports are used, but the current trend is to reduce the number of ports and minimize the length of incisions to further decrease postoperative pain, chest wall paraesthesia, and length of hospitalization. Uniportal VATS thymectomy for non-invasive mediastinal tumour resection is proven to be a safe and reliable method. In this paper we describe and illustrate our technique for single port VATS thymectomy.","Bedetti, Benedetta; Solli, Pierfiorgio; Lawrence, David; Panagiotopoulos, Nikolaos; Hayward, Martin; Scarci, Marco",Journal of visualized surgery,https://doi.org/10.21037/jovs.2016.08.07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29078536/,246

Changes in daily living routines, reduction in physical activities, and changes in environmental indicators were suggested to positively impact pediatric asthma indicators in western cultures. Little is known about such impact in developing countries. This study investigating the potential impact of COVID-19 NPI measures on pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions in Northern Jordan. METHODS Aggregate data from a pediatric hospital, Princess Rahma Pediatric Teaching Hospital, and King Abdulla University Teaching Hospital were utilized between 2018 and 2020. Number of pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were calculated by week and compared by year, lockdown status, and weeks for lockdown (weeks 13 to 19). Stringency index was correlated with number of weekly pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions for 2020. RESULTS A total of 1,207 pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were reported; 40.3%, 35.2%, and 24.5% in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The number of weekly admissions ranged between 1 and 13 pediatric asthma cases (mean (SD) = 7.6 (2.7)). In 2018 and 2019, respectively, the mean weekly admissions was 9.2 (1.9) and 8.0 (2.0) pediatric asthma cases, while in 2020 the mean was 5.6 (2.7) cases. Significant differences in mean weekly pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions were detected by year, with mean weekly admissions for 2020 being significantly lower than that for 2018 and 2019. During the lockdown (March 22nd to May 1st 2020), mean weekly admissions (2.6 (1.4)) was significantly lower than that before the lockdown (8.6 (2.0)) and after the lockdown (5.2 (2.0)). For the lockdown weeks only, the mean admissions for year 2020 was significantly lower than that for years 2019 and 2018. Stringency index negatively correlated with number of weekly admissions. CONCLUSION NPI measures in Jordan seems to have positively impacted pediatric asthma exacerbation admissions.

107528,Wound complication among different skin closure techniques in the emergency cesarean section: a randomized control trial.,2020-01-01,"BACKGROUND Caesarean sections (CS) are increasing worldwide. Financial incentives and related regulatory and legislative factors are important determinants of CS rates. This scoping review examines the evidence base of financial, regulatory and legislative interventions intended to reduce CS rates. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and two trials registers in June 2019. Both experimental and observational intervention studies were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcome measures were: CS, spontaneous vaginal and instrumental birth rates. We assessed quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) method. RESULTS We identified 9057 articles and assessed 65 full-texts. We included 16 observational studies. Most of the studies were conducted in high-income countries. Three studies assessed payment methods for health workers: equalising physician fees for vaginal and caesarean delivery reduced CS rates in one study; however, little or no difference in CS rates was found in the remaining two studies. Nine studies assessed payment methods for health organisations: There was no difference in CS rates between diagnosis-related group (DRG) payment system compared to fee-for-service system in one study. However, DRG system was associated with lower odds for CS in another study. There was little or no difference in CS rates following implementation of global budget payment (GBP) system in two studies. Vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) increased after implementation of a case-based payment system in one study. Caesarean section increased while VBAC rates decreased following implementation of a cap-based payment system in another study. Financial incentive for providers to promote vaginal delivery combined with free vaginal delivery policy was found to reduce CS rates in one study. Studied regulatory and legislative interventions (comprising legislatively imposed practice guidelines for physicians in one study and multi-faceted strategy which included policies to control CS on maternal request in another study) were found to reduce CS rates. The GRADE quality of evidence varied from very low to low. CONCLUSIONS Available evidence on the effects of financial and regulatory strategies intended to reduce unnecessary CS is inconclusive given inconsistency in effects and low quality of the available evidence. More rigorous studies are needed.","Opiyo, Newton; Young, Claire; Requejo, Jennifer Harris; Erdman, Joanna; Bales, Sarah; Betrán, Ana Pilar",Reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12978-020-00983-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867791/,246

However, most patients included in those studies underwent polysomnography because of symptoms, so the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in this population is unknown. OBJECTIVE To determine the prevalence of sleep disordered breathing in children with myelomeningocele using screening polysomnography. METHODS In this cross-sectional study, all children with myelomeningocele seen in a multi-disciplinary spina bifida clinic between 2016 and 2020 were referred for polysomnography regardless of clinical symptoms. Included children had not previously undergone polysomnography. The primary outcome for this study was presence of sleep disordered breathing, defined as Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI, number of apnea or hypopnea events per hour of sleep) greater than 2.5. Clinical and demographic variables relevant to myelomeningocele were also prospectively collected and tested for association with presence of sleep apnea. RESULTS A total of 117 participants underwent polysomnography (age 1 mo to 21 yr, 49% male). The majority were white, non-Hispanic. Median AHI was 1.9 (interquartile range 0.6-4.2). A total of 49 children had AHI 2.5 or greater, yielding a sleep disordered breathing prevalence of 42% (95% CI 33%-51%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, children with more rostral neurological lesion levels had higher odds of sleep disordered breathing (OR for thoracic, mid-lumbar, and low-lumbar: 7.34, 3.70, 4.04, respectively, compared to sacral level, P = .043).

BACKGROUND Results of infrapopliteal interventions using balloon angioplasty and/or bare stents are limited by a relatively high restenosis rate, which could be potentially improved by stabilizing the lesion with a SES. METHODS Two hundred patients (total lesion length 27 ± 21 mm) were randomized to infrapopliteal SES stenting or percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (PTA). The primary endpoint was 1-year in-segment binary restenosis by quantitative angiography. RESULTS Ninety-nine and 101 patients (mean age 73.4 years; 64% diabetics) were randomized to SES and PTA, respectively (8 crossover bailout cases to SES). At 1 year, there were lower angiographic restenosis rates (22.4% vs. 41.9%, p = 0.019), greater vessel patency (75.0% vs. 57.1%, p =0.025), and similar death, repeat revascularization, index-limb amputation rates, and proportions of patients with improved Rutherford class for SES versus PTA.

Rapid and accurate identification of viral agents is crucial for both outbreak control and estimating regional disease burdens. Recently developed metagenomic methods have proven to be powerful tools for simultaneous pathogen detection. Here, we performed a systematic study of the capability of the short-read-based metagenomic approach in the molecular detection of viral pathogens in nasopharyngeal aspirate samples from patients with acute lower respiratory tract infections (n = 16). Using the high-throughput capacity of ultradeep sequencing and a dedicated data interpretation method, we successfully identified seven species of known respiratory viral agents from 15 samples, a result that was consistent with results of conventional PCR assays. We also detected a coinfected case that was missed by regular PCR testing. Using the metagenomic data, 11 draft genomes of the abundantly detected viruses in the samples were reconstructed with 21.84% to 98.53% coverage. Our results show the power of the short-read-based metagenomic approach for accurate and parallel screening of viral pathogens.

The aim of this study was to determine the usefulness of McGrath MAC for routine nasotracheal intubation by comparing McGrath MAC with Airway scope and Macintosh laryngoscope. METHODS A total of 60 adult patients with ASA physical status class 1 or 2, aged 20-70 years were enrolled in this study. Patients were scheduled for elective oral surgery under general anesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. Exclusion criteria included lack of consent and expected difficult airway. Patients were randomly allocated to three groups: McGrath MAC (n = 20), Airway scope (n = 20), and Macintosh laryngoscope (n = 20). After induction, nasotracheal intubation was performed by six expert anesthesiologists with more than 6 years of experience. RESULTS There were no significant differences in preoperative airway assessment among the three groups. Successful tracheal intubation time was 26.8 ± 5.7 (mean ± standard deviation) s for McGrath MAC, 36.4 ± 11.0 s for Airway scope, and 36.5 ± 8.9 s for Macintosh laryngoscope groups.

McGrath MAC significantly improved the Cormack Lehane grade for nasotracheal intubation compared with Macintosh laryngoscope (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION McGrath MAC significantly facilitates routine nasotracheal intubation compared with Airwayscope and Macintosh laryngoscope by shortening the tracheal intubation time and improving the Cormack Lehane grade.

111311,Percutaneous coronary intervention versus medical therapy for chronic total coronary occlusions: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.,2020-10-16,"BACKGROUND Many patients present to an initial pediatric orthopedic clinic visit without bringing previously obtained x-rays (XRs), leading to repeat imaging, unnecessary radiation exposure, and increased health care costs. Importing images to the picture archiving and communication system and the use of cloud-based medical image-sharing software systems result in the reduction of reimaging rates and health care costs. LOCAL PROBLEM Unnecessary duplicative XR imaging was recognized in our pediatric orthopedic clinic as an area for quality improvement. Our purpose was to determine the magnitude of the problem and the feasibility of decreasing total visit charges through electronic retrieval of previous XRs. METHOD Data collection occurred from May 22, 2019, through June 22, 2019, in the orthopedic trauma clinics at the main campus of a quaternary care pediatric hospital in the northeast United States and its three satellite locations. INTERVENTION The number of patients who did not bring XRs to their initial orthopedic visit and the type of XR ordered were recorded by clinicians. A retrospective chart audit was also completed for comparison. RESULTS Of 699 new patient visits, 77 (11%) did not bring previous XRs. This resulted in total reimaging charges of $33,326, representing 30%-50% of total visit charges. Retrospective chart audit identified 60% more new patients than the clinicians. CONCLUSIONS Electronic retrieval of XRs in pediatric orthopedic clinics can decrease duplicative charges, radiation exposure, and health care waste. It can also contribute to successful care of patients via virtual visits in times of restricted access such as a pandemic.","Thompson, Cynthia T; Bartolomei, Olivia; Vuillermin, Carley",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33534280/,246

For the above-mentioned activities it is expected to exert a clinical benefit in the treatment of diseases where the immune system is altered. AREAS COVERED Several clinical trials have been carried out with Tα1 for treatment or prevention of many different infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C, sepsis and Aspergillosis in bone marrow-transplanted patients. Data available on the use of Tα1 in infectious disease as well as a vaccine enhancer will be reviewed to possibly generate new working hypothesis. EXPERT OPINION Tα1 has been widely used in thousands of patients. Nevertheless, there are some issues that have not yet been properly addressed (i.e., dose, schedule, combination treatments, end-points to be evaluated in clinical trials). In the most recent clinical trials Tα1 has been used at higher doses than those commonly used in the past showing a direct proportionality between the dose and the effect. The safety profile of Tα1 is excellent and it is virtually devoid of toxicity.","Camerini, Roberto; Garaci, Enrico",Expert opinion on biological therapy,https://doi.org/10.1517/14712598.2015.1033393; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26098768/,246

Transmission pathways by which foodborne viruses may enter human populations and evolutionary mechanisms by which viruses can become virulent are discussed in this chapter. A majority of viruses emerge from zoonotic animal reservoirs, often by adapting and infecting intermediate hosts, such as domestic animals and livestock. Viruses that are known foodborne threats include hepatitis E virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, enteroviruses, adenovirus, and astroviruses, among others. Viruses may potentially evolve and emerge as a result of modern agricultural practices which can concentrate livestock and bring them into contact with wild animals. Examples of viruses that have emerged in this manner are influenza, coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and the Nipah virus. The role of bats, bush meat, rodents, pigs, cattle, and poultry as reservoirs from which infectious pathogenic viruses emerge are discussed.","Kingsley, David H",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/microbiolspec.pfs-0007-2014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27726774/,246

We report outcomes after carotid artery stenting (CAS) based on aspirin and P2Y12 assays. METHODS We retrospectively identified patients who had aspirin and P2Y12 assays at the time of stenting. Aspirin (325 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) were started 7-10 days pre-intervention. If not possible, aspirin (650 mg) and clopidogrel (600 mg) loading doses were given pre-intervention. Assays were checked on postoperative day 0/1. Outcomes included neurological ischemic sequela at 30 days, 1 and 2 years, as well as 30 day death/hemorrhage/myocardial infarction. RESULTS 449 patients were included. Mean P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values were higher in patients with an ipsilateral ischemic event (stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA)) or stroke (alone) at 1 and 2 years than in patients with no events: ischemic event versus no event at 1 year, 252 vs 202 (p=0.008); stroke versus no stroke at 1 year, 252 versus 203(p=0.029); ischemic event versus no event at 2 years, 244 vs 203 (p=0.047); stroke versus no stroke at 2 years, 243 versus 203 (p=0.082). Ischemic event free survival (stroke/TIA, p=0.0268) and overall survival (p=0.0291) post-CAS were longer in patients with PRU ≤198 compared with an initial threshold of PRU ≤237. Mean PRU values were higher in patients who died from all causes at 30 days than in survivors (p=0.031). No correlation was found between lower PRU values and hemorrhage. Aspirin reaction units did not correlate with outcome. CONCLUSIONS PRU ≤198 may be associated with a lower incidence of ischemic neurological sequela and death post-CAS. Prospective studies are needed to validate the relationship between antiplatelet assays and outcomes post-CAS.","Sorkin, Grant C; Dumont, Travis M; Wach, Michael M; Eller, Jorge L; Mokin, Maxim; Natarajan, Sabareesh K; Baxter, Melissa S; Snyder, Kenneth V; Levy, Elad I; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-010771; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23794673/,246
112702,Nonrobotic Total Endoscopic Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Proof-of-Concept Study in 20 Patients.,2018,"Background The World Health Organization (WHO) integrated management of childhood illness (IMCI) protocol recommends treatment of chest indrawing in 2-59 months old children with oral amoxicillin by trained health facility workers. Whereas, the WHO/UNICEF integrated community case management (iCCM) protocol recommends referral by community level health workers (CLHWs) to a health facility. This study aims to evaluate whether CLHWs can treat chest indrawing pneumonia effectively and safely. Methods This multi-centre cluster randomized controlled open label, non-inferiority trial will be conducted in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India and Malawi. All sites will use a common protocol with the same study design, participants, intervention, control and outcomes. CLHWs will identify 2-59 months old children with chest indrawing. Study supervisors, trained in the iCCM protocol, will confirm CLHWs' findings. Pulse oximetry will be used to identify hypoxaemic children. In the intervention group, enrolled children will be treated with oral amoxicillin for 5 days, and in the control group they will be referred to a health facility, after providing first dose of oral amoxicillin. An independent outcome assessor will visit each enrolled child on days 6 and 14 of enrolment, to assess study outcomes. Conclusions If CLHWs can effectively and safely treat chest indrawing pneumonia in 2-59 months old children, it will increase access to pneumonia treatment substantially, as in many settings, health facilities and trained health workers are not easily accessible. Moreover, this evidence will contribute towards the review of the current iCCM protocol and its harmonization with the IMCI protocol.

The present study focused on everyday moral decision-making after acute psychosocial stress and how it is influenced by effects of social closeness and timing. We exposed 40 young healthy men to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST, n = 20) or its non-stressful placebo version (PTSST, n = 20). Moral decision-making was assessed early (+10 until +30 min) and late (+75 until +95 min) after (P)TSST exposure by the Everyday Moral Conflict Situations (EMCS) Scale (Singer et al., 2019). The EMCS Scale requests altruistic versus egoistic responses to everyday moral conflict situations with varying closeness of target persons. Results revealed significantly higher total percentages of altruistic decisions in the stress than in the control condition and for scenarios involving socially close (e.g., mother) versus socially distant (e.g., stranger) protagonists, while the main effect of timing was nonsignificant. Only secondary analyses showed increased altruistic decision-making after acute stress exposure towards socially close but not towards distant protagonists at the early but not at the late point of measurement. Moreover, psychological stress responses and personality traits were significantly associated with EMCS scores. Positive correlations between cortisol levels and altruistic decision-making were descriptively observable, but did not reach statistical significance. In sum, our findings suggest increased altruistic decision-making towards socially close compared to socially distant protagonists and provide further evidence that acute stress influences decision-making in everyday moral conflict scenarios in a prosocial manner.","Singer, Nina; Binapfl, Julia; Sommer, Monika; Wüst, Stefan; Kudielka, Brigitte M",Stress,https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2020.1846029; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138682/,246

113605,2020: the rise of the virtual congress.,2020-06-25,"Early marriages (EM) adversely affect women's physical and mental health, education, and social status. The current study aimed to analyze effects of EM through the thoughts, experiences, and suggestions of women who were married under the age of eighteen in Istanbul, Turkey, and the key informants (e.g., social worker, psychologist, obstetrician) who have encountered EM. In-depth interviews were conducted with fifteen women who were married before age 18, recruited from psychiatry outpatient department and eleven key informants. Thematic analysis was used. Low educated, poor family environment with domestic violence and neglect of children, loss of parents, lack of access to education, and traditional social structure were stated as causes for EM. Families' attitudes about EM were characterized as their daughter's reputation would be tarnished which implied the daughter's premarital relationships would be perceived as immoral by community. All women experienced traditional, aggressive rituals for the first night of marriage, husbands were mostly insensitive, and coercive resulting a traumatic experience. Women were subjected to physical, sexual, psychological, and emotional violence; most of them were socially isolated after marriage with restrictions imposed by their spouses and spouses' family that limited communication with their loved ones. The women generally felt unprepared for adult sexual life and motherhood. In order to prevent EM, raising parents' awareness about EM, supporting girls' education, and enforcing legitimate regulations were recommended. Early marriages violate human rights, cause negative consequences for health both physically and mentally, and deepen social inequality for women. All the participants suggested a better functioning legislative arrangement. The male dominated society that legitimizes child marriages and other harmful traditional practices should be addressed.","Baysak, Erensu; Yorguner, Neşe; Kandemir, Güler; Denizman, Işık Akyollu; Akvardar, Yıldız",Archives of women's mental health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00737-020-01067-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32901363/,246
114023,Novel Zero-Heat-Flux Deep Body Temperature Measurement in Lower Extremity Vascular and Cardiac Surgery.,2016,"Ring vaccination can be a highly effective control strategy for an emerging disease or in the final phase of disease eradication, as witnessed in the eradication of smallpox. However, the impact of behavioural dynamics on the effectiveness of ring vaccination has not been explored in mathematical models. Here, we analyze a series of stochastic models of voluntary ring vaccination. Contacts of an index case base vaccinating decisions on their own individual payoffs to vaccinate or not vaccinate, and they can also imitate the behaviour of other contacts of the index case. We find that including imitation changes the probability of containment through ring vaccination considerably. Imitation can cause a strong majority of contacts to choose vaccination in some cases, or to choose non-vaccination in other cases-even when the equivalent solution under perfectly rational (non-imitative) behaviour yields mixed choices. Moreover, imitation processes can result in very different outcomes in different stochastic realizations sampled from the same parameter distributions, by magnifying moderate tendencies toward one behaviour or the other: in some realizations, imitation causes a strong majority of contacts not to vaccinate, while in others, imitation promotes vaccination and reduces the number of secondary infections. Hence, the effectiveness of ring vaccination can depend significantly and unpredictably on imitation processes. Therefore, our results suggest that risk communication efforts should be initiated early in an outbreak when ring vaccination is to be applied, especially among subpopulations that are heavily influenced by peer opinions.","Wells, Chad R; Tchuenche, Jean M; Meyers, Lauren Ancel; Galvani, Alison P; Bauch, Chris T",Bulletin of mathematical biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11538-011-9646-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21409511/,246

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a history of cardiovascular disease or cancer affects the risk of dying after a COVID-19 diagnosis in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data were compiled from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases, the Norwegian Cardiovascular Disease Registry and the Cancer Registry of Norway. Univariable and multivariable regression models were used to calculate both relative and absolute risk. RESULTS In the first half of 2020, 8 809 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and 260 COVID-19-associated deaths were registered. Increasing age, male sex (relative risk (RR): 1.5; confidence interval (CI): 1.2-2.0), prior stroke (RR: 1.5; CI: 1.0-2.1) and cancer with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis (RR: 3.0; CI: 1.1-8.2) were independent risk factors for death after a diagnosis of COVID-19. After adjusting for age and sex, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, hypertension, and non-metastatic cancer were no longer statistically significant risk factors for death. INTERPRETATION The leading risk factor for death among individuals who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 was age. Male sex, and a previous diagnosis of stroke or cancer with distant metastasis were also associated with an increased risk of death after a COVID-19 diagnosis.","Kvåle, Rune; Bønaa, Kaare Harald; Forster, Rachel; Gravningen, Kirsten; Júlíusson, Pétur Benedikt; Myklebust, Tor Åge","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0956; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33528146/,246

The current study investigated the long-term safety and efficacy of a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of N/C therapy in moderate-to-severe essential hypertension. METHODS A multinational, 70-centre, open-label study of N/C treatment for 28 or 52 weeks at a target dose of N60 mg/C32 mg. The primary assessment included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Efficacy assessments included change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A total of 508 patients were enrolled, with 417 (82·1%) completing week 28 of treatment. Of these, 200 patients continued treatment, as planned, to week 52, with 193 (96·5%) completing this period. At least one TEAE or drug-related TEAE were reported in 76·8% and 45·3% patients up to week 28, and in 80·7% and 46·9% up to week 52/end of study. Most TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs to week 52 (93·9% and 95·4%, respectively) were mild or moderate in intensity. Rates of drug-related serious AEs were low (0·6%). TEAE-related discontinuations occurred in 10% patients before week 28 and in no additional patients thereafter. N/C provided substantial, sustained reductions in mean systolic and diastolic BP from baseline: 30·1 ± 18·4 and 12·8 ± 10·7 mmHg, respectively, at week 52.

Desktops, laptops, and tablets are essential tools for communication and project management. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers have transitioned to work from home (WFH) to sustain public health emergency guidelines, and it is anticipated that many WFH jobs will be maintained post-pandemic. The transition to WFH occurred rapidly without time to establish ideal workstations. Ergonomic assessments that were typically performed in person needed to be performed using virtual technology. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose of this review is (1) to describe the components of a computer workstation evaluation; (2) to offer suggestions for identifying computer workstation problems that may be contributing to the client's musculoskeletal (MSK) pain and symptoms; (3) to provide suggestions that may improve the safety and comfort at the computer workstation, and (4) to suggest a method of completing the workstation analysis virtually, without onsite in-person evaluation. METHODS AND RESULTS There is a paucity of peer-reviewed literature regarding computer workstation evaluations to be performed in person, let alone using a virtual method. The components of computer workstation evaluations have been recommended by regulatory agencies that survey injuries in the workplace. Prior to 2020, these evaluations were done in person at the office workstation. Modifications in data collection were needed to transition the analysis to a reliable virtual format.

115251,Same-Day Discharge after Catheter Ablation in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in a Large Nationwide Administrative Claims Database.,2021-07-29,"Clinical workflows in oncology depend on predictive and prognostic biomarkers. However, the growing number of complex biomarkers contributes to costly and delayed decision-making in routine oncology care and treatment. As cancer is expected to rank as the leading cause of death and the single most important barrier to increasing life expectancy in the 21st century, there is a major emphasis on precision medicine, particularly individualisation of treatment through better prediction of patient outcome. Over the past few years, both surgical and pathology specialties have suffered cutbacks and a low uptake of pathology specialists means a solution is required to enable high-throughput screening and personalised treatment in this area to alleviate bottlenecks. Digital imaging in pathology has undergone an exponential period of growth. Deep-learning (DL) platforms for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) image analysis, with preliminary artificial intelligence (AI)-based grading capabilities of specimens, can evaluate image characteristics which may not be visually apparent to a pathologist and offer new possibilities for better modelling of disease appearance and possibly improve the prediction of disease stage and patient outcome. Although digital pathology and AI are still emerging areas, they are the critical components for advancing personalised medicine. Integration of transcriptomic analysis, clinical information and AI-based image analysis is yet an uncultivated field by which healthcare professionals can make improved treatment decisions in cancer. This short review describes the potential application of integrative AI in offering better detection, quantification, classification, prognosis and prediction of breast and prostate cancer and also highlights the utilisation of machine learning systems in biomarker evaluation.","Fitzgerald, Jenny; Higgins, Debra; Mazo Vargas, Claudia; Watson, William; Mooney, Catherine; Rahman, Arman; Aspell, Niamh; Connolly, Amy; Aura Gonzalez, Claudia; Gallagher, William",Journal of clinical pathology,https://doi.org/10.1136/jclinpath-2020-207351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34117103/,246

MATERIALS AND METHODS Laparo-endoscopic single-site surgery LDN was performed through an umbilical incision. Different trocars were used, namely Gelpoint (Applied Mιdical, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA) SILS port (Covidien, Hamilton, Bermuda), R-port (Olympus Surgical, Orangeburg, NY) and standard trocars, inserted through the same skin incision but using separate fascial punctures. The standard laparoscopic technique was employed. The kidney was pre-entrapped in a retrieval bag and extracted trans-umbilically. Data were collected prospectively including questionnaires containing patient reported oral pain medication duration and time to recovery. RESULTS LESS LDN was successful in all patients. Mean warm ischemia time was 6.2 min (3-15), mean procedure time was 233.2 min (172-300), and hospitalization stay was 3.94 days (3-7) with a visual analogue pain score at discharge of 1.32 (0-3). No intraoperative complications occurred. The mean time of oral pain medication was 8.72 days (1-20) and final scar length was 4.06 cm (3-5). Each allograft was functional. CONCLUSION Although challenging, trans-umbilical LESS LDN seems to be feasible and safe. Hence, LESS has the potential to improve cosmetic results and decrease morbidity.","Alessimi, Abdullah; Adam, Emilie; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Badet, Lionel; Codas, Ricardo; Fehri, Hakim Fassi; Martin, Xavier; Crouzet, Sébastien",Urology annals,https://doi.org/10.4103/0974-7796.160321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26229326/,246
115888,Two-year results of a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing Mechanochemical endovenous Ablation to RADiOfrequeNcy Ablation in the treatment of primary great saphenous vein incompetence (MARADONA trial).,2019,"BACKGROUND Chronic alveolar hypoventilation is a common complication of many neuromuscular and chest wall disorders. Long-term nocturnal mechanical ventilation is commonly used to treat it. This is a 2014 update of a review first published in 2000 and previously updated in 2007. OBJECTIVES To examine the effects on mortality of nocturnal mechanical ventilation in people with neuromuscular or chest wall disorders. Subsidiary endpoints were to examine the effects of respiratory assistance on improvement of chronic hypoventilation, sleep quality, hospital admissions and quality of life. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 10 June 2014. We contacted authors of identified trials and other experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for quasi-randomised or randomised controlled trials of participants of all ages with neuromuscular or chest wall disorder-related stable chronic hypoventilation of all degrees of severity, receiving any type and any mode of long-term nocturnal mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome measure was one-year mortality and secondary outcomes were unplanned hospital admission, short-term and long-term reversal of hypoventilation-related clinical symptoms and daytime hypercapnia, improvement of lung function and sleep breathing disorders. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We used standard Cochrane methodology to select studies, extract data and assess the risk of bias in included studies. MAIN RESULTS The 10 eligible trials included a total of 173 participants. Roughly half of the trials were at low risk of selection, attrition or reporting bias, and almost all were at high risk of performance and detection bias. Four trials reported mortality data in the long term. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of dying was 0.62 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42 to 0.91, P value = 0.01) in favour of nocturnal mechanical ventilation compared to spontaneous breathing. There was considerable and significant heterogeneity between the trials, possibly related to differences between the study populations. Information on unplanned hospitalisation was available from two studies. The corresponding pooled RR was 0.25 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.82, P value = 0.02) in favour of nocturnal mechanical ventilation. For most of the outcome measures there was no significant long-term difference between nocturnal mechanical ventilation and no ventilation. Most of the secondary outcomes were not assessed in the eligible trials. Three out of the 10 trials, accounting for 39 participants, two with a cross-over design and one with two parallel groups, compared volume- and pressure-cycled non-invasive mechanical ventilation in the short term. From the only trial (16 participants) on parallel groups, there was no difference in mortality (one death in each arm) between volume- and pressure-cycled mechanical ventilation. Data from the two cross-over trials suggested that compared with pressure-cycled ventilation, volume-cycled ventilation was associated with less sleep time spent with an arterial oxygen saturation below 90% (mean difference (MD) 6.83 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 8.98, P value = 0.00001) and a lower apnoea-hypopnoea (per sleep hour) index (MD -0.65, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.46, P value = 0.00001). We found no study that compared invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation or intermittent positive pressure versus negative pressure ventilation. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Current evidence about the therapeutic benefit of mechanical ventilation is of very low quality, but is consistent, suggesting alleviation of the symptoms of chronic hypoventilation in the short term. In four small studies, survival was prolonged and unplanned hospitalisation was reduced, mainly in participants with motor neuron diseases. With the exception of motor neuron disease and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, for which the natural history supports the survival benefit of mechanical ventilation against no ventilation, further larger randomised trials should assess the long-term benefit of different types and modes of nocturnal mechanical ventilation on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, and its cost-benefit ratio in neuromuscular and chest wall diseases.","Annane, Djillali; Orlikowski, David; Chevret, Sylvie",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd001941.pub3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25503955/,246

By combining planar microarrays and other multiparallel systems with sets of reagents, possibilities to discover new and unpredicted protein-disease associations, either via directed hypothesis-driven or via undirected hypothesis-generating target selection, can be created. In the following stages, the discoveries made during these screening phases have to be verified for potential clinical relevance based on both technical and biological aspects. The use of affinity tools throughout discovery and verification has the potential to streamline the introduction of new markers, as transition into clinically required assay formats appears straightforward. In this article, we summarize some of the current building blocks within array- and affinity-based proteomic profiling with a focus on body fluids, by giving a perspective on how current and upcoming developments in this bioscience could enable a path of pursuit for biomarker discovery.","Ayoglu, Burcu; Häggmark, Anna; Neiman, Maja; Igel, Ulrika; Uhlén, Mathias; Schwenk, Jochen M; Nilsson, Peter",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://doi.org/10.1586/erm.10.110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21405972/,246

We conducted a systematic review for studies using measured anthropometry to examine trends in obesity in the USA published from 2012 to 2018 and for systematic reviews to document trends in obesity across the globe published from 2014 to 2018. RECENT FINDINGS For the USA, the only nationally representative data source capturing trends in obesity in this period was the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which uses repeated cross-sectional data to document national trends in obesity in the USA. For global trends, the only systematic reviews of obesity across the globe were the Global Burden of Disease Obesity study and the Non-communicable Disease Risk Factor Collaboration study. In general, the population distribution of body mass index (BMI) in the USA has shifted towards the upper end of its distribution over the past three decades. The global distribution has similarly increased, albeit with large regional differences. US and global studies suggest an increasing trend in obesity since the 1980s, and there is a dearth of nationally representative longitudinal studies using measured anthropometry to capture trends in adult obesity in the USA for the same individuals over time. Greater efforts are needed to identify factors contributing to the continued increases in obesity.","Inoue, Yosuke; Qin, Bo; Poti, Jennifer; Sokol, Rebeccah; Gordon-Larsen, Penny",Current obesity reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13679-018-0317-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30155850/,246

The optimal surgical approach for more advanced disease is unknown. An evaluation of MIE in patients with advanced tumors having undergone neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) is presented. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with esophageal cancer who underwent MIE from November 2006 to November 2011 was performed RESULTS In total, 96 consecutive patients underwent MIE for malignancy. Median age was 65 years (range 26 to 88), and 86% were male. Adenocarcinoma represented 87% of patients. Eighty-three percent of patients were staged IIa or higher and 62 (65%) patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Four (6%) patients additionally received intraoperative electron beam radiotherapy. Twenty-six (27%) patients received postoperative adjuvant therapy with 22 (85%) of these having also received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. All cases were completed thoraco-laparoscopically except for 2 conversions to mini-laparotomy. Twelve (12%) cervical anastomoses and 84 (88%) thoracic anastomoses were performed. Median operative time was 326 minutes (range 193 to 567) and did not differ significantly between those with and without nCRT. Complete pathologic response was seen in 21 (34%) of the 62 patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment. Major and minor morbidities were experienced in 28% and 38.5% of patients. There were 2 (2%) in-hospital mortalities; 1 each having received or not received neoadjuvant therapy. At median follow-up 24 months (range 3 to 70 months), overall survival was 58% and 55 (57%) patients were alive without recurrence. CONCLUSIONS Minimally invasive esophagectomy is an acceptable surgical therapy for advanced-stage esophageal malignancies after nCRT without evidence for increased morbidity or mortality.","Warner, Susanne; Chang, Yu-Hui; Paripati, Harshita; Ross, Helen; Ashman, Jonathan; Harold, Kristi; Day, Ryan; Stucky, Chee-Chee; Rule, William; Jaroszewski, Dawn",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2013.09.042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24266955/,246

As two important means of examination, computed tomography (CT) and real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) have always been controversial in the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Here, we report a family cluster case of a father and a son diagnosed as COVID-19 at our hospital, and described the clinical manifestations, laboratory results, CT changes, diagnosis and treatment strategy of these two patients. Focus on the value of these two methods in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, as well as their respective deficiencies. For patient 1 (father), the efficacy of RT-PCR is not satisfactory either in terms of diagnosis or follow-up, which may cause misdiagnosis and delay treatment. For patient 2 (son), the clinical symptoms were not obvious, but CT imaging clearly displayed dynamic changes of the lung lesions. Meanwhile, the two patients respectively underwent five chest CT examinations during their hospitalization and discharge follow-up, showing the potential harm of radiation. Therefore, in clinical work, doctors should make full use of the advantages of CT and RT-PCR, and take other measures to make up for their disadvantages.","Tang, Lei; Ye, Zheng; Huang, Zixing; Zeng, Xianchun; Wang, Tao; Xu, Rui; Wang, Rongpin; Song, Bin",Annals of palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.21037/apm.2020.03.34; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32312064/,246
119355,Evaluation of cerebral oxygenation during procedural sedation in children using near infrared spectroscopy.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Non-saccular aneurysms of the posterior fossa are an uncommon pathology with no clear treatment strategy. The use of flow-diverting stents (FDS) has had mixed results. We sought to evaluate our experience of FDS for the treatment of this pathology. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our database of prospectively collected information for all patients treated only with flow diversion for an unruptured non-saccular aneurysm of the posterior circulation between February 2009 and April 2016. The aneurysms were classified as dolichoectasia, fusiform or transitional, and imaging characteristics including maximal diameter, disease vessel segment, MRI features (intra-aneurysmal thrombus, T1 hyperintensity in the aneurysmal wall, infarctions in the territory of the posterior circulation, and mass effect) were recorded alongside clinical and follow-up data. RESULTS We identified 56 patients (45 men) with 58 aneurysms. The average age of the patients was 63.5 years. Twenty-two patients were symptomatic from the aneurysms at presentation. The majority of the lesions were vertebrobasilar in location (44.8%) with isolated vertebral lesions representing 29.3% of aneurysms. Transitional aneurysms were the most common (48.2%). The mean maximal diameter of the aneurysms was 11 mm. Angiographic exclusion of the aneurysms was seen in 57.4% of aneurysms with follow-up (n=47). During the follow-up period nine patients died. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of non-saccular aneurysms of the posterior fossa is technically possible. Early treatment, particularly of the fusiform and transitional subtypes, is recognized, as is treatment prior to the development of symptoms. A 'watch and wait' strategy with regular imaging follow-up could be employed for asymptomatic dolichoectasia.","Bhogal, P; Pérez, M Aguilar; Ganslandt, O; Bäzner, H; Henkes, H; Fischer, S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2016-012781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27836994/,246

As part of this, utilising biomarkers to risk stratify patients has become increasingly popular. During the COVID-19 pandemic the use of D-dimer has increased due to the evidence of COVID-19 induced thrombo-embolic disease. We evaluated the use of D-dimer on all hospital admissions during the peak of the pandemic and evaluated its sensitivity in diagnosing pulmonary embolic disease (PE). Patients without COVID-19 infection were as likely to have evidence of PE as their COVID-positive counterparts. However, the sensitivity of a D-dimer was higher in COVID-positive patients at a lower D-dimer level (>1,500 μg/L, sensitivity 81%, specificity 70%) than in those without clinical, immunological or radiological evidence of COVID-19 infection (D-dimer >2,000 μg/L, sensitivity 80%, specificity 76%).

The private sector provides many services, but often in parallel to the public sector. This study aimed to understand current private sector engagement in adolescent health service delivery and develop recommendations to strengthen partnerships. Methods The study focussed on Mongolia, Myanmar and the Philippines. An initial participatory workshop in each country was followed by semi-structured key-informant interviews (32 in total) with public and private sector actors and adolescents to explore: perceptions of the public and private sectors, strengths and challenges, existing models of partnership, and insights for successful public-private partnership (PPP). Interview transcripts were analysed thematically, with findings and recommendations verified through a second workshop in Mongolia and the Philippines. Findings The private sector already plays a significant role in adolescent health care, and stakeholders reported a genuine willingness for partnership. Strengthened PPP was identified as necessary to improve service accessibility and quality for adolescents, unburden the public sector and introduce new technologies, with advantages for the private sector including improved access to training and resources, and an enhanced public image. Recommendations for strengthened PPP included the need to establish the foundations for partnership, clearly define roles and co-ordinate stakeholders, ensure capacity and sustainability, and monitor and evaluate efforts. Interpretation This is the first comprehensive study of public-private partnership for adolescent health in the Asia Pacific region. It identifies stakeholders are willing for stronger partnerships and the benefits this partnership will bring.

Despite increasing documentation of pervasive inequalities within the scope of radiology, dedicated curricula designed to improve cultural competency and understanding of healthcare disparities among radiology trainees remains sparse. With relatively fewer patient interactions, radiology trainees are particularly susceptible to insufficient contextual awareness of how socioeconomic factors influence patient health and behaviors, physician recommendations, and ultimately clinical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to provide a high-yield background of foundational health equity and disparity concepts for radiology trainees, from which additional educational curricula may be derived. Specifically, this article will discuss the fundamental socioeconomic factors known to contribute to discrepant access and use of imaging services, followed by areas in radiology with well-documented disparities of which trainees should be aware. Lastly, previous and current strategies for addressing disparities in radiology will be discussed with the ultimate goal of stimulating trainee participation and the development of novel approaches.","Mach, John C; Omar, Abdillahi; Abujudeh, Hani",Current problems in diagnostic radiology,https://doi.org/10.1067/j.cpradiol.2021.03.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838972/,246

A β-(1→6)-linked poly-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) surface capsule is synthesized by four proteins encoded in genetic loci designated intercellular adhesion in Staphylococcus aureus or polyglucosamine in selected Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. We report that many microbial pathogens lacking an identifiable intercellular adhesion or polyglucosamine locus produce PNAG, including Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and fungal pathogens, as well as protozoa, e.g., Trichomonas vaginalis, Plasmodium berghei, and sporozoites and blood-stage forms of Plasmodium falciparum. Natural antibody to PNAG is common in humans and animals and binds primarily to the highly acetylated glycoform of PNAG but is not protective against infection due to lack of deposition of complement opsonins. Polyclonal animal antibody raised to deacetylated glycoforms of PNAG and a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that both bind to native and deacetylated glycoforms of PNAG mediated complement-dependent opsonic or bactericidal killing and protected mice against local and/or systemic infections by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B, Candida albicans, and P. berghei ANKA, and against colonic pathology in a model of infectious colitis. PNAG is also a capsular polysaccharide for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and nontypable Hemophilus influenzae, and protects cells from environmental stress. Vaccination targeting PNAG could contribute to immunity against serious and diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens, and the conserved production of PNAG suggests that it is a critical factor in microbial biology.","Cywes-Bentley, Colette; Skurnik, David; Zaidi, Tanweer; Roux, Damien; Deoliveira, Rosane B; Garrett, Wendy S; Lu, Xi; O'Malley, Jennifer; Kinzel, Kathryn; Zaidi, Tauqeer; Rey, Astrid; Perrin, Christophe; Fichorova, Raina N; Kayatani, Alexander K K; Maira-Litràn, Tomas; Gening, Marina L; Tsvetkov, Yury E; Nifantiev, Nikolay E; Bakaletz, Lauren O; Pelton, Stephen I; Golenbock, Douglas T; Pier, Gerald B",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1303573110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23716675/,246

DESIGN A cross-sectional study was conducted during the Spring 2020 semester using self-reported student data from an end of course survey. METHODS A 16 item instructor-designed survey of student's perceptions of critical thinking, preparation, availability of materials, practice, video recording skill demonstrations, self-reported levels of anxiety related to the virtual testing environment and type of skill assessment exam was provided to all first semester baccalaureate nursing students enrolled in the basic nursing skills course. RESULTS Approximately half of the cohort (N = 33) voluntarily responded to the instructor designed survey. The greatest relationship was observed between 'adequate information for each version' of the test and 'adequate time to prepare' (rho (32) = 0.729 p = 0.000). Although 54.6% (n = 18) of the respondents believed performing the demonstration in the home environment caused them to 'think harder' about the tasks, 78.8% (n = 26) reported feeling less anxiety than while performing previous demonstrations in the lab. A Wilcoxon test examined the results of the anxiety for demonstration on campus and anxiety for demonstration at home and a significant difference was found (p = 0.000, 95% CI) indicating anxiety levels were significantly less when demonstrating in the home environment. A moderate positive correlation was identified between opportunity to repeat with less stress at home (rho (32) = 0.61, p = 0.000), while moderate negative correlations were found between opportunity to repeat and anxiety levels related to recording (rho (32) = -0.60, p = 0.000), opportunity to repeat and anxiety related to demonstration at home (rho (32) = -0.53, p = 0.002) and concern about recording and opportunity to repeat (rho (32) = -0.49, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS Student success using remote assessment strategies during the Spring 2020 semester was similar to the success rate using traditional skill assessment methods in Fall 2019. Although the need for prompt feedback was identified as an area of improvement to promote deliberate practice, student video recording of skill proficiency was a viable solution for comprehensive remote assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic and campus closure.

However, multiple barriers exist to provide and access this therapy. LOCAL PROBLEM A rural Midwestern county struggled with increasing OUD and scant access to B-MAT. A nurse-led, community clinic had the potential to expand access to treatment but no support structure to provide it. METHODS In this quality improvement project, a one-group posttest-only design was used to assess treatment access, care quality, and patient characteristics. INTERVENTIONS An evidence-based, nurse led weekly B-MAT clinic using a low-threshold, chronic-care model for treatment of OUD. RESULTS The B-MAT clinic expanded county-wide access by 34% over seven months. A total of 23 patients were seen with 21 eligible for treatment with B-MAT. All nine patients with at least 90-day continuous treatment were retained in the program. Three quarters of patients had at least 30 days of active buprenorphine-naloxone coverage and 17% of all patients were lost to follow up. There were no induction-related adverse events, no fatalities, and one nonfatal overdose. In a chart review, 85% of patients met at least six of eight quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS This low-barrier approach to OUD expanded access to treatment and demonstrated a model stable enough to continue delivering care throughout the first 5 months of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

According to literature, nutrition can play a key role in the prevalence and severity of dysmenorrhea. This study aims to investigate the relation between dietary patterns and the risk of dysmenorrhea among university students. METHODS A nested case control study was conducted among 293 students of Urmia University of Medical Sciences who were randomly recruited via a proportional cluster sampling method. From 293 students, 46 students with moderate to severe dysmenorrhea and 54 students without dysmenorrhea were assigned to the case and control groups, respectively. The major dietary patterns of students were identified by factor analysis and the association between dietary patterns and risk of dysmenorrhea was investigated using logistic regression analysis in SPSS 20. RESULTS Three major dietary patterns were found and nominated as ""Lacto-vegetarian"", ""Snacks"" and ""Mixed food items"" patterns. After controlling for family history of dysmenorrhea, subjects in the second and third tertiles of ""snacks"" pattern had a 4.23 (95% CI = 1.32-13.58, P = 0.01) and 3.41 (95% CI = 1.10-10.50, P = 0.03) times, respectively, higher chance to experience moderate to severe dysmenorrhea in comparison with subjects in the first tertile. There was no significant association between the risk of dysmenorrhea and two other dietary patterns.

METHODS All patients undergoing LS at our institution were classified as obese or nonobese (group A, body mass index [BMI] >30; group B, BMI <30). Primary end points included conversion rate, operative complications, length of stay, operative time, and estimated blood loss (EBL). RESULTS Three hundred seventy patients who underwent LS were included. Baseline characteristics were similar in groups A (n = 127; mean BMI, 36.2 ± 6.9 kg/m²) and B (n = 243; mean BMI, 24.6 ± 2.9 kg/m²). Conversion rates and overall morbidity were similar in both groups (9% vs 11% for conversion to open procedures, P = .621; 16% vs 16% for morbidity rates, P = .940). Length of hospital stay and EBL were also comparable (P = .643 and P = .544, respectively). Mean operative time was significantly increased in the obese group on multivariate analysis (170 vs 151 minutes, P = .021). CONCLUSIONS Obesity does not adversely affect outcomes after LS.

We also questioned if the onset of feedforward control can be categorized into one of the postural phases: anticipatory or early postural adjustment. Eight elite fencers and nine physical education students performed an attack with a lunge in self-paced and reaction time conditions from three different initial stance widths. The onset of the center of pressure (COP) displacement and EMG activities for the tibialis anterior (TA) of both limbs were recorded. The results show that expertise in fencing delays the onset of the activity of TA of the front leg and the onset of COP displacement during fencing lunge performance in comparison to controls. Additionally, in contrast to the control group, fencers produce typical APA patterns in the activation of TA under different performance conditions, delayed reaction time in comparison to self-initiated lunging, and constant time of APA onset under different widths of stance. According to different times and functions of TA activity and COP displacement in lunging, we propose to address them as anticipatory postural adjustment and early postural adjustment, respectively.","Akbaş, Anna; Marszałek, Wojciech; Bacik, Bogdan; Juras, Grzegorz",Frontiers in human neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34194305/,246
126239,Noninvasive monitoring of venous oxygen saturation by transcutaneous near-infrared spectroscopy in pediatric patients undergoing congenital cardiac surgery.,2020-06-03,"UNLABELLED Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spreads to humans via zoonotic transmission from camels. MERS-CoV belongs to lineage C of betacoronaviruses (betaCoVs), which also includes viruses isolated from bats and hedgehogs. A large portion of the betaCoV genome consists of two open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are translated into polyproteins. These are cleaved by viral proteases to generate 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) which compose the viral replication-transcription complex. We investigated the evolution of ORF1a and ORF1b in lineage C betaCoVs. Results indicated widespread positive selection, acting mostly on ORF1a. The proportion of positively selected sites in ORF1a was much higher than that previously reported for the surface-exposed spike protein. Selected sites were unevenly distributed, with nsp3 representing the preferential target. Several pairs of coevolving sites were also detected, possibly indicating epistatic interactions; most of these were located in nsp3. Adaptive evolution at nsp3 is ongoing in MERS-CoV strains, and two selected sites (G720 and R911) were detected in the protease domain. While position 720 is variable in camel-derived viruses, suggesting that the selective event does not represent a specific adaptation to humans, the R911C substitution was observed only in human-derived MERS-CoV isolates, including the viral strain responsible for the recent South Korean outbreak. It will be extremely important to assess whether these changes affect host range or other viral phenotypes. More generally, data herein indicate that CoV nsp3 represents a major selection target and that nsp3 sequencing should be envisaged in monitoring programs and field surveys. IMPORTANCE Both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and MERS-CoV originated in bats and spread to humans via an intermediate host. This clearly highlights the potential for coronavirus host shifting and the relevance of understanding the molecular events underlying the adaptation to new host species. We investigated the evolution of ORF1a and ORF1b in lineage C betaCoVs and in 87 sequenced MERS-CoV isolates. Results indicated widespread positive selection, stronger in ORF1a than in ORF1b. Several selected sites were found to be located in functionally relevant protein regions, and some of them corresponded to functional mutations in other coronaviruses. The proportion of selected sites we identified in ORF1a is much higher than that for the surface-exposed spike protein. This observation suggests that adaptive evolution in ORF1a might contribute to host shifts or immune evasion. Data herein also indicate that genetic diversity at nonstructural proteins should be taken into account when antiviral compounds are developed.","Forni, Diego; Cagliani, Rachele; Mozzi, Alessandra; Pozzoli, Uberto; Al-Daghri, Nasser; Clerici, Mario; Sironi, Manuela",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02988-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26792741/,246
126468,Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy: a complication of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.,2020-12-17,"Intracranial aneurysms are present in roughly 5% of the population, yet most are often asymptomatic and never detected. Development of an aneurysm typically occurs during adulthood, while formation and growth are associated with risk factors such as age, hypertension, pre-existing familial conditions, and smoking. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, the most common presentation due to aneurysm rupture, represents a serious medical condition often leading to severe neurological deficit or death. Recent technological advances in imaging modalities, along with increased understanding of natural history and prevalence of aneurysms, have increased detection of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA). Studies reporting on the risk of rupture and outcomes have provided much insight, but the debate remains of how and when unruptured aneurysms should be managed. Treatment methods include two major intervention options: clipping of the aneurysm and endovascular methods such as coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and flow diversion stents. The studies reviewed here support the generalized notion that endovascular treatment of UIA provides a safe and effective alternative to surgical treatment. The risks associated with endovascular repair are lower and incur shorter hospital stays for appropriately selected patients. The endovascular treatment option should be considered based on factors such as aneurysm size, location, patient medical history, and operator experience.","Seibert, Brad; Tummala, Ramachandra P; Chow, Ricky; Faridar, Alireza; Mousavi, Seyed A; Divani, Afshin A",Frontiers in neurology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2011.00045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21779274/,246

This fact could be related to an inappropriate use of these measures due to the absence of specific VTE risk scores. To assess the current situation in Spain, we have performed a cross-sectional study, analyzing if the prophylactic measures were appropriate to the patients' VTE risk. METHODS Through an electronic questionnaire, we carried out a single day point prevalence study on the VTE prophylactic measures used in several critical care units in Spain. We performed a risk stratification for VTE in three groups: low, moderate-high, and very high risk. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines were used to determine if the patients were receiving the recommended prophylaxis. RESULTS A total of 777 patients were included; 62% medical, 30% surgical, and 7% major trauma patients. The median number of the risk factors for VTE was four. According to the proposed VTE risk score, only 2% of the patients were at low risk, whereas 83% were at very high risk. Sixty-three percent of patients received pharmacological prophylaxis, 12% mechanical prophylaxis, 6% combined prophylaxis, and 19% did not receive any prophylactic measure. According to criteria suggested by the guidelines, 23% of medical, 71% of surgical, and 70% of major trauma patients received an inappropriate prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS Most critically ill patients are at high or very high risk of VTE, but there is a low rate of appropriate prophylaxis. The efforts to improve the identification of patients at risk, and the implementation of appropriate prevention protocols should be enhanced.","García-Olivares, Pablo; Guerrero, Jose Eugenio; Galdos, Pedro; Carriedo, Demetrio; Murillo, Francisco; Rivera, Antonio",Intensive care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00134-014-3442-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25138229/,246

This study explores diet-PFAS interactions and the impact of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanesulfonic (PFHxS) on the hepatic proteome and blood lipidomic profiles. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a low-fat diet (10.5% kcal from fat) or a high fat (58% kcal from fat) high carbohydrate (42g/L) diet with or without PFOS or PFHxS in feed (0.0003% w/w) for 29 weeks. Lipidomic, proteomic, and gene expression profiles were determined to explore lipid outcomes and hepatic mechanistic pathways. With administration of a high fat high carbohydrate (HFHC) diet, PFOS and PFHxS increased hepatic expression of targets involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. In the blood, PFOS and PFHxS altered serum phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, plasmogens, sphingomyelins, and triglycerides. Further, oxidized lipid species were enriched in the blood lipidome of PFOS and PFHxS treated mice. These data support the hypothesis that PFOS and PFHxS increase the risk of metabolic and inflammatory disease induced by diet, possibly by inducing dysregulated lipid metabolism and oxidative stress.","Pfohl, Marisa; Ingram, Lishann; Marques, Emily; Auclair, Adam; Barlock, Benjamin; Jamwal, Rohitash; Anderson, Dwight; Cummings, Brian; Slitt, Angela L",Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,https://doi.org/10.1093/toxsci/kfaa148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991729/,246

It was estimated that about 75% of these subjects have an impairment of insulin action, as measured by gold standard methods. While the relationship between insulin resistance and PCOS is consistently shown by a number of studies, the mechanisms underlying its primary origin still remains an unsolved issue. Insulin resistance and the associated hyperinsulinemia can induce both the endocrine and reproductive traits of PCOS. However, androgen excess, in turn, can impair insulin action, directly and/or through several changes occurring in different tissues. Body fat excess, which is another common feature in these women, can contribute to worsening the whole picture. Nevertheless, insulin resistance may also be found in many normal-weight individuals. Endocrine and metabolic abnormalities can develop in different moments, and probably there is fetal programming of these alterations. However, a number of vicious circles, with bidirectional relationships between androgen excess and insulin resistance, and with the contribution of several other factors, make it extremely difficult to understand where this process really originates. This review summarizes available evidence on this topic, in order to better understand the complex relationships linking hyperandrogenism and impaired insulin action in women with PCOS.","Moghetti, P; Tosi, F",Journal of endocrinological investigation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40618-020-01351-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648001/,246

However, most interventions are limited in accessibility and fail to address individualized goals. This pilot study examined the dyadic effects on multiple indicators of well-being of the Wish Outcome Obstacle Plan (WOOP) intervention which guides participants to use Mental Contrasting with Implementation Intentions (MCII) to achieve attainable goals in their daily lives. METHODS This randomized controlled trial included 45 older persons with early-stage dementia (PWD) and their spousal care partners (CPs: n = 90 individuals). CPs were assigned randomly to WOOP training immediately after baseline (WOOP) or after a three-month follow-up interview (Control; CON). Both groups received a dementia care education booklet. WOOP CPs were instructed to practice WOOP at least once a day for two weeks. All CPs and PWDs completed home surveys (baseline, two-weeks, and three months) measuring perceived stress, depressive symptoms, quality of life, and affect. RESULTS Mixed effects models showed significant intervention x time interaction effects with large effect sizes for CPs on three of the five outcomes over three months. Compared to CON, WOOP CPs had decreased perceived stress (δ = 1.71) and increased quality of life (δ = 1.55) and positive affect (δ = 2.30). WOOP PWD showed decreased perceived stress (δ = .87) and increased quality of life (δ = 1.26) but these effects were not statistically significant.

128574,COVID-19 and AKI: Where Do We Stand?,2021-02-26,"INTRODUCTION High sensitivity troponin (hs-cTn) assays are central to the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Their increased sensitivity has facilitated rapid pathways for the exclusion of MI. However, hs-cTn is now more readily detectable in patients without symptoms typical of MI, in whom a degree of myocardial injury is assumed. Recently, the practice of using the 99th centile of hs-cTn as a working ""upper reference limit"" has been challenged. There is increasing evidence that hs-cTn may provide useful prognostic information, regardless of any suspicion of MI, and as such these assays may have potential as a general biomarker for mortality. This raises the concept that detection of hs-cTn ""never means nothing"". AREAS COVERED In this review we will evaluate the evidence for the use of hs-cTn assays outside their common clinical indication to rule out or diagnose acute MI. EXPERT OPINION The data presented suggest that hs-cTn testing may in the future have a generalised role as a biomarker of mortality risk and may be used less as a test for ruling in acute MI, but will remain a frontline test to exclude that diagnosis in ED.

Therefore, careful patient selection is mandatory. Our aim was to find valid predictors of clinical outcome after mechanical thrombectomy (mTE) based on the sparse information available in the emergency setting. METHODS We included consecutive patients aged ≥80 years treated by mTE for anterior circulation thromboembolic vessel occlusion in our department between January 2008 and January 2013. Successful recanalization was defined as a thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score of 2b or 3. The rates of parenchymal hemorrhage types I (PHI) and II (PHII) according to the ECASS definition and the rate of focal and diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were reported. A modified Ranking scale (mRS) score of 0-2 at 90 days was defined as a favorable outcome. We evaluated the influence of gender, smoking habits, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery and peripheral artery disease, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS), and duration of symptoms on favorable outcome. Significant predictors were then included in a stepwise logistic regression analysis. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were calculated. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS In the defined period, we treated 109 patients aged ≥80 years with 116 occluded anterior circulation target vessels. Successful recanalization was achieved in 87.9% of the targets. The rates of PHI, PHII, and focal and diffuse SAH were 6.4, 5.5, 12.8, and 7.3%, with an overlap between PH and SAH. The combined rate of PHII and/or diffuse SAH was 9.2%. Despite good recanalization rates and reasonable rates of hemorrhage, only 19 patients (17.4%) were functionally independent at 90 days. An additional 12 patients (11.0%) suffered from moderate disability (mRS score 3), 26 (23.9%) were severely disabled (mRS score 4-5) and 52 (47.7%) were deceased. NIHSS, ASPECTS, and THRIVE scores significantly predicted a favorable outcome. Stepwise logistic regression identified NIHSS (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.82-0.96; p = 0.009) and ASPECTS (OR 2.27; 95% CI 1.28-4.02; p = 0.005) as independent predictors. The ROC area was 0.81. CONCLUSION ASPECTS and NIHSS were independent predictors of a favorable outcome in patients aged ≥80 years after mTE for anterior circulation large vessel occlusion and may support decision making with regard to the treatment modality.

129893,Heart Best Research Paper Award 2020.,2020-08-26,"UNLABELLED Positive-strand RNA [(+) RNA] viruses remodel cellular membranes to facilitate virus replication and assembly. In the case of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), the viral membrane protein 6K2 plays an essential role in endomembrane alterations. Although 6K2-induced membrane dynamics have been widely studied by confocal microscopy, the ultrastructure of this remodeling has not been extensively examined. In this study, we investigated the formation of TuMV-induced membrane changes by chemical fixation and high-pressure freezing/freeze substitution (HPF/FS) for transmission electron microscopy at different times of infection. We observed the formation of convoluted membranes connected to rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) early in the infection process, followed by the production of single-membrane vesicle-like (SMVL) structures at the midstage of infection. Both SMVL and double-membrane vesicle-like structures with electron-dense cores, as well as electron-dense bodies, were found late in the infection process. Immunogold labeling results showed that the vesicle-like structures were 6K2 tagged and suggested that only the SMVL structures were viral RNA replication sites. Electron tomography (ET) was used to regenerate a three-dimensional model of these vesicle-like structures, which showed that they were, in fact, tubules. Late in infection, we observed filamentous particle bundles associated with electron-dense bodies, which suggests that these are sites for viral particle assembly. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. Our work thus unravels the sequential appearance of distinct TuMV-induced membrane structures for viral RNA replication, viral particle assembly, and accumulation. IMPORTANCE Positive-strand RNA viruses remodel cellular membranes for different stages of the infection process, such as protein translation and processing, viral RNA synthesis, particle assembly, and virus transmission. The ultrastructure of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV)-induced membrane remodeling was investigated over several days of infection. The first change that was observed involved endoplasmic reticulum-connected convoluted membrane accumulation. This was followed by the formation of single-membrane tubules, which were shown to be viral RNA replication sites. Later in the infection process, double-membrane tubular structures were observed and were associated with viral particle bundles. In addition, TuMV particles were observed to accumulate in the central vacuole as membrane-associated linear arrays. This work thus unravels the sequential appearance of distinct TuMV-induced membrane structures for viral RNA replication, viral particle assembly, and accumulation.","Wan, Juan; Basu, Kaustuv; Mui, Jeannie; Vali, Hojatollah; Zheng, Huanquan; Laliberté, Jean-François",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02138-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26423955/,246

This study aimed to identify and follow potentially infected healthcare workers in one hospital in order to develop an epidemiological baseline for COVID-19 infection and spread rates in this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective study was conducted between 1 April and 30 June 2020 at a single Belgian hospital. Healthcare workers with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were included. Participants underwent testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and analysis of blood samples for antibody response at different timepoints (day 0, 7, 14 and day 30 or 60). Patient exposures, symptoms, and disease progression were collected. RESULTS Of a total of 150 healthcare workers with symptoms compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 31% (47) tested positive for the virus by NP swab. Of the 47 participants with positive NP swabs, 66% also had positive IgG serology. Of the 99 participants with negative NP swabs who underwent blood sample collection, 5% had positive IgG serology results. Of the 29 participants who presented with at least 3 major symptoms, 15 (52%) had positive NP swabs and 14 (48%) had positive serology. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that evidence of symptoms, even when major, is a poor predictor for SARS-CoV-2 positivity in health care workers and raises the question of the best way to efficiently screen this population especially during the upcoming flu period.","Datlibagi, Azine; Tran, Ngoc Anh Phuong; Dugauquier, Artemise; Hoornaert, Mathilde; Mabchour, Ayman; Mayamba, Anthony-Rostane; Fayad, Georges; Wautier, Magali; Van Den Wijngaert, Sigi; Debaisieux, Laurent; De Wilde, Virginie",Acta clinica Belgica,https://doi.org/10.1080/17843286.2021.1899695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33757413/,246

Recent studies have investigated the complex membrane rearrangements induced by diverse positive-strand RNA viruses, which are of two morphotypes : membrane invagination towards the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or other specifically targeted organelles and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) formed by extrusion of the ER membrane. DMVs resemble small autophagosomes and the viruses inducing these intriguing organelles are known to promote autophagy, suggesting a potential link between DMVs and the autophagic pathway. In this review, we summarize recent findings concerning the biogenesis, architecture and role of DMVs in the life cycle of viruses from different families and discuss their possible connection to autophagy or other related pathways.","Blanchard, Emmanuelle; Roingeard, Philippe",Cellular microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cmi.12372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25287059/,246

The authors evaluated this device for the treatment of elastase-induced aneurysms in rabbits. MATERIALS AND METHODS Three V-POD types (A, circumferential patch closed-cell stent [n = 9]; B, asymmetric patch closed-cell stent [n = 7]; and C, asymmetric patch open-cell stent [n = 4]) were evaluated by using angiography, conebeam micro-CT, histology, and SEM. Aneurysm flow modifications were expressed in terms of immediate poststent/prestent ratios of maximum CA volume entering the aneurysm dome tracked on procedural angiograms. Flow modifications were correlated with 4 weeks' follow-up angiographic, micro-CT, histologic, and SEM results. RESULTS Mechanical stent-deployment difficulties in 4 aneurysms (1 type A; 3 type B) led to suboptimal results and exclusion from analysis. Of the remaining 16 aneurysms, 4-week post-treatment angiograms showed no aneurysm filling in 10 (63%), 3 (∼19%) had no filling with a small remnant neck, and 3 (∼19%) had <0.25 filling. Successfully treated aneurysms (n = 16) demonstrated an immediate poststent/prestent CA maximum volume ratio of 0.13 ± 0.18% (0.0%-0.5%). Favorable contrast-flow modification on immediate angiography after deployment correlated significantly with aneurysm occlusion on follow-up angiography, micro-CT, and histology. The occlusion percentage derived from micro-CT was 96 ± 6.8%. Histology indicated advanced healing (grade ≥3) in the aneurysm dome in 13 of 16 cases. SEM revealed 15 of 16 stents in an advanced state of endothelialization. CONCLUSIONS This study showed the feasibility and effectiveness of V-POD for aneurysm healing in a rabbit elastase model.","Ionita, C N; Natarajan, S K; Wang, W; Hopkins, L N; Levy, E I; Siddiqui, A H; Bednarek, D R; Rudin, S",AJNR.

131590,Lung Ultrasound and Pulmonary Congestion During Stress Echocardiography.,2020-07-09,"On the global health agenda, Universal Health Coverage has been displaced by the COVID-19 pandemic while disparities in COVID-19 outcomes have exposed stark gaps in quality, access, equity, and financial risk protection. These disparities highlight the importance of the core goals of Universal Health Coverage and the need for innovative approaches to working toward them. The newly codified concept of ""Networks of Care"" offers a promising option for implementation. The articles in this special issue present the Networks of Care lexicon and framework and demonstrate the development of leadership, responsibility, intra- and inter-facility cooperation, and dynamic cycles of quality improvement. These elements are associated with better access to services and better health outcomes, the ultimate goals of Universal Health Coverage. Increases in poverty, food insecurity, and deleterious impact on the status of women secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic add urgency to Universal Health Coverage, while the economic impact of pandemic mitigation may reduce availability of resources for years to come. The need for Universal Health Coverage and efficiency and flexibility in health spending, including the ability to contract directly, has become even more important. Countries where Universal Health Coverage efforts have yet to carry through to provision of good quality, accessible and equitable service delivery could potentially benefit from concurrent Networks of Care implementation. Documentation of Networks of Care in the context of Universal Health Coverage should be prioritized to understand how Networks of Care can be used to help realize the goals of Universal Health Coverage around the world.","Brady, Eoghan; Carmone, Andy E; Das, Sarthak; Hurley, Raphael; Martinez Vergara, Maria Theresa; Malata, Address",Health systems and reform,https://doi.org/10.1080/23288604.2020.1840825; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252995/,246

132089,PCR e-Course: reshaping education in exceptional circumstances.,2020-06-25,"Affiliative vocalizations occur across primate taxa and may be used to maintain spatial cohesion and/or to regulate social interactions in group-living species. For gregarious strepsirhines like the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta), with large vocal repertoires and several distinct affiliative vocalizations including the chirp and wail, it is important to understand behavioural usage of these vocalizations to gain insight into their social interactions. To determine whether chirp and wail vocalizations facilitate group cohesion, regulate interactions to achieve socially positive outcomes, and are correlated with differences in individual characteristics such as dominance rank and age, I collected 565 h of focal data on 31 males aged ≥1 year at Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, Madagascar, from March to July 2010. I found that chirp and wail vocalizations occurred at the highest rates during group-wide travel compared to other behaviours. Although nearest neighbour distance did not influence calling rate, focal animals maintained the same distance or were located closer to nearest neighbours after calling. Both chirp and wail calls were heard in behavioural contexts without agonism rather than agonistic contexts. No relationship was found between male calling rate and dominance rank or age, although the chirp showed a non-significant tendency to be produced at higher rates by younger males. Overall, my results indicated that ring-tailed lemur males of all ages and dominance ranks used both chirp and wail vocalizations as contact calls during group-wide travel events, helping individuals maintain proximity to other group members during movement. Chirp and wail vocalizations may additionally help regulate the caller's social interactions and promote increased tolerance from conspecifics. These findings add to our understanding of the breadth of communication behaviour in wild lemurs, thus furthering our knowledge of the social lives and cognitive abilities of strepsirhines. Through examining the complexity of vocalization use by a living lemur species with a communication system much like early social primates, we gain broad insight into the evolution of primate sociality.","Bolt, Laura M",Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000508808; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32756063/,246

Herein, we report a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) platform that can achieve this sensitivity and rapidity without bulky lab-bound equipment. The key technology is a flattened pipette tip with an elliptical cross-section, which extends a high aspect-ratio microfluidic chip design to pipette scale, for rapid (<5 min) generation of several thousand monodispersed droplets ∼150 to 350 μm in size with a CV of ∼2.3%. A block copolymer surfactant (polyoxyalkylene F127) is used to stabilize these large droplets in oil during thermal cycling. At this droplet size and number, positive droplets can be counted by eye or imaged by a smartphone with appropriate illumination/filtering to accurately quantify up to 100 target copies. We demonstrate with 2019 nCoV-PCR assay LODs of 3.8 copies per 20 μL of sample and a dynamic range of 4-100 copies. The ddPCR platform is shown to be inhibitor resistant with spiked saliva samples, suggesting RNA extraction may not be necessary. It represents a rapid 1.5-h POC quantitative PCR test that requires just a pipette equipped with elliptical pipette tip, a commercial portable thermal cycler, a smartphone, and a portable trans-illuminator, without bulky and expensive micropumps and optical detectors that prevent POC application.","Chen, Liao; Yadav, Vivek; Zhang, Chenguang; Huo, Xiaoye; Wang, Ceming; Senapati, Satyajyoti; Chang, Hsueh-Chia",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33861566/,246

However, traditional organic liquid electrolytes bestow SIBs/KIBs with serious safety concerns. In contrast, quasi-/solid-phase electrolytes including polymer electrolytes (PEs) and inorganic solid electrolytes (ISEs) show great superiority of high safety.

PEs combine some merits of both liquid-phase electrolytes and ISEs, and present great potentials in next-generation energy storage systems. Considerable efforts have been devoted to improving their overall properties. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of an in-depth and comprehensive review to get insights into mechanisms and corresponding design strategies of PEs. Herein, the advantages of different electrolytes, particularly PEs are first minutely reviewed, and the mechanism of PEs for Na+ /K+ ion transfer is summarized.

In primary care, an advance care planning (ACP) group visit may leverage group dynamics and peer mentorship to facilitate education and personal goal setting that result in ACP engagement. OBJECTIVE To determine whether the ENgaging in Advance Care Planning Talks (ENACT) group visits intervention improves ACP documentation and readiness in older adults. METHODS This randomized clinical trial was conducted among geriatric primary care patients from the University of Colorado Hospital Seniors Clinic, Aurora, CO, from August 2017 to November 2019. Participants randomized to ENACT group visits (n = 55) participated in two 2-hour sessions with discussions of ACP topics and use of ACP tools (i.e., Conversation Starter Kit, Medical Durable Power of Attorney form, and PREPARE videos). Participants randomized to the control arm (n = 55) received the Conversation Starter Kit and a Medical Durable Power of Attorney form by mail. The primary outcomes included presence of ACP documents or medical decision-maker documentation in the electronic health record (EHR) at 6 months, and a secondary outcome was ACP readiness (validated four-item ACP Engagement Survey) at 6 months. RESULTS Participants were a mean of 77 years old, 60% female, and 79% white. At 6 months, 71% of ENACT participants had an advance directive in the EHR (26% higher) compared with 45% of control arm participants (P < .001). Similarly, 93% of ENACT participants had decision-maker documentation in the EHR (29% higher) compared with 73% in the control arm (P < .001). ENACT participants trended toward higher readiness to engage in ACP compared with control (4.56 vs 4.13; P = .16) at 6 months. CONCLUSION An ACP group visit increased ACP documentation and readiness to engage in ACP behavior change. Primary care teams can explore implementation and adaptation of ACP group visits into routine care, as well as longer-term impact on patient health outcomes.","Lum, Hillary D; Dukes, Joanna; Daddato, Andrea E; Juarez-Colunga, Elizabeth; Shanbhag, Prajakta; Kutner, Jean S; Levy, Cari R; Sudore, Rebecca L",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726475/,246

The wellbeing and good preservation of monuments is a key factor to encourage again tourism. Historical monuments exposed to outdoor pollution are subjected to well known degradation phenomenon including the formation on their surface of black crusts (BCs) causing blackening and deterioration of the monuments and, as a consequence, a worst fruition by the visitors. The aim of this research is the development and validation of a novel method to characterize and quantify the various components present in the black crusts. SO2 together with the carbonaceous fraction (i.e. OC, organic carbon, and EC, elemental carbon) represent the main atmospheric pollutants involved in the process of BCs formation which consists in the partial transformation of the carbonate substrate into gypsum where black particles are embedded. A new methodology based on the use of TGA/DSC (Thermogravimetric Analysis/Differential scanning calorimetry) and CHN (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen) analysis was set up allowing to determine organic carbon and elemental carbon together with other components such as gypsum. Four standard mixtures simulating BCs composition were prepared and analysed to the set-up the methodology. The new procedure was subsequently applied to study real BCs samples taken from monuments and historical buildings placed in cities heavily affected by atmospheric pollution and by PCA (principal component analysis) their main features, from the point of view of carbonaceous fraction, were highlighted.","Comite, Valeria; Miani, Alessandro; Ricca, Michela; La Russa, Mauro; Pulimeno, Manuela; Fermo, Paola",Environmental research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34192555/,246

Low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance characterize T2D. Even though the decline of thermogenic adipose tissues is well-established during ageing, the mechanisms by which this event affects immune system and contributes to the development of T2D is still poorly defined. It is emerging that activation of thermogenic adipose tissues promotes type 2 immunity skewing, limiting type 1 inflammation. Of note, metabolic substrates sustaining type 1 inflammation (e.g. glucose and succinate) are also used by activated adipocytes to promote thermogenesis. Keeping in mind this aspect, a nutrient competition between adipocytes and adipose tissue immune cell infiltrates could be envisaged. Herein, we reviewed the metabolic rewiring of adipocytes during thermogenesis in order to give important insight into the anti-inflammatory role of thermogenic adipose tissues and delineate how their decline during ageing may favor the setting of low-grade inflammatory states that predispose to type 2 diabetes in elderly. A brief description about the contribution of adipokines secreted by thermogenic adipocytes in modulation of immune cell activation is also provided. Finally, we have outlined experimental flow chart procedures and provided technical advices to investigate the physiological processes leading to thermogenic adipose tissue impairment that are behind the immunometabolic decline during aging.","Lettieri-Barbato, Daniele; Aquilano, Katia",Ageing research reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arr.2020.101143; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810648/,246

Paired afferent stimulation (PAS) combines peripheral sensory stimulation with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of primary motor cortex to induce rapid, reversible, topographically specific increases in primary motor cortex excitability suggestive of long-term potentiation in adults. Our aim was to determine frequency, characteristics, age effects, and reproducibility of PAS in school-age children. METHOD Typically developing right-handed children (6-18y) were recruited. Median nerve stimulation was delivered 25ms before suprathreshold primary motor cortex stimulation (0.2Hz, 7.5min). Primary outcome was changed in the amplitude of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at five time points after PAS (0, 15, 30, 45, 75min) expressed as area under the curve. Reproducibility was evaluated. Secondary outcomes included stimulus response curves and safety/tolerability. RESULTS Of 28 children (20 males, mean age 12y), 64% demonstrated PAS effects (11 definite, seven probable).

These were divided by biopsy location: submuscular capsule (control) as well as superiorly, centrally, and inferiorly along the paramedian acellular dermis. Specimens were assessed for cellular infiltration, cell type, fibrous encapsulation, scaffold degradation, extracellular matrix deposition, neovascularization, mean composite remodeling score, and type I and III collagen. Patients were compared based on five oncologic treatment groups: no adjuvant therapy (untreated), neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without radiation, and chemotherapy with or without radiation. RESULTS Biopsy specimens were procured 45 to 1805 days after implantation and demonstrated a significant reduction in type I collagen over time. Chemotherapy adversely impacted fibrous encapsulation (p = 0.03). Chemotherapy with or without radiation adversely impacted type I collagen (p = 0.02), cellular infiltration (p < 0.01), extracellular matrix deposition (p < 0.04), and neovascularization (p < 0.01). Radiation exacerbated the adverse impact of chemotherapy for several remodeling parameters. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy also caused a reduction in type I (p = 0.01) and III collagen (p = 0.05), extracellular matrix deposition (p = 0.03), and scaffold degradation (p = 0.02). CONCLUSION Chemotherapy and radiation therapy limit acellular dermal matrix remodeling.

137417,A serum CRP and procalcitonin based risk score to predict urinary infection in patients with obstructive urolithiasis undergoing decompression.,2020-09-22,"OBJECTIVE To quantify weekly rates of use of buprenorphine for those with employer-based insurance and whether the rate differs based on county-level measures of race, historical fatal drug overdose rate, and COVID-19 case rate. METHODS We used 2020 pharmaceutical claims for 4.8 million adults from a privately insured population to examine changes in the use of buprenorphine to treat opioid use disorder in 2020 during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantified variation by examining changes in use rates across counties based on their fatal drug overdose rate in 2018, number of COVID-19 cases per capita, and percent nonwhite. RESULTS Weekly use of buprenorphine was relatively stable between the first week of January (0.6 per 10,000 enrollees, 95%CI = 0.2 to 1.1) and the last week of August (0.8 per 10,000 enrollees, 95%CI = 0.4 to 1.3). We did not find evidence of any consistent change in use of buprenorphine by county-level terciles for COVID-19 rate as of August 31, 2020, age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate, and percent nonwhite. Use was consistently higher for counties in the highest tercile of county age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate when compared to counties in the lowest tercile of county age-adjusted fatal drug overdose rate. DISCUSSION Our results provide early evidence that new federal- and state-level policies may have steadied the rate of using buprenorphine for those with employer-based insurance during the pandemic.","Cantor, Jonathan; Dick, Andrew W; Haffajee, Rebecca; Pera, Megan F; Bravata, Dena M; Stein, Bradley D; Whaley, Christopher M",Journal of substance abuse treatment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34080552/,246
137839,Same-Day Discharge after Cryoballoon Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation: A Multicenter Experience.,2020-12-20,"ABSTRACT The COVID-19 crisis has challenged the U.S. health-care system in a variety of ways, including how we teach and train orthopaedic surgery residents and fellows. During the spring of 2020, the cessation of all elective surgical procedures and the diminished number of outpatient visits challenged graduate medical education. While residency programs in less affected areas may not have had to make many dramatic adjustments, some of those located in pandemic hotspots had to redirect trainees from orthopaedic rotations to COVID-19 units. No matter the region, the time that trainees have spent in rotations has been altered, and absences have occurred due to quarantines. This symposium summarizes the impact of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic on residency and fellowship programs from the perspectives of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), a program director, and a graduating resident. Although new opportunities for virtual curricula, virtual surgical simulation, and virtual interviews have been innovated, residency programs and residents report primarily a negative effect from the pandemic due to decreased surgical volumes and the limitation of patient-care experiences. Ultimately, program directors have an obligation to the program, the trainee, and the general public to graduate only those residents and fellows who are truly prepared to practice independently; they have the responsibility of making the final decision regarding graduation. The COVID-19 pandemic has continued to underscore the need for competency-based medical education. Assessing competency includes evaluation of the knowledge, the operative skills, the nonoperative patient-care skills, and the professional behavior of each and every individual graduating from orthopaedic residency and fellowship training programs. A hybrid model for time and competency-based training, with established national standards not only for accreditation for our training programs but also for board certification of our graduating residents, was enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic and is highlighted in this symposium.","Van Heest, Ann; Brandt, Aaron M; Dyer, George; Homer, Cole J; Murray, Peter M",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

138816,Google Trends demonstrate public interest in COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy.,2020-12-19,"BACKGROUND Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are polymers of varying molecular weight (MW) used widely as excipients in drugs and products, including the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. Allergy to PEGs is very rare. Skin testing and graded challenge carries a high risk of inducing systemic reactions. OBJECTIVE To evaluate skin prick test (SPT) and in-vitro reactivity over time to different MW PEGs and assess cross-sensitization patterns in PEG allergy. METHODS Ten patients with previously diagnosed PEG allergy were skin prick tested twice with PEGs 26 months apart. Lower MW (PEG 300, 3000, 6000) were tested, followed by PEG 20,000 in stepwise, increasing concentrations. Cross-sensitization to polysorbate 80 and poloxamer 407 was assessed. SPT was performed in 16 healthy controls. In vitro Basophil Histamine Release (HR) test and passive sensitization HR test were performed in patients and controls. RESULTS Patients previously testing positive on SPT to PEG 3000 and/or 6000 also tested positive to PEG 20,000. Patients with longer interval since diagnosis tested negative to lower MW PEGs and positive mainly to higher concentrations of PEG 20,000. Three patients developed systemic urticaria during SPT. Eight patients showed cross-sensitization to poloxamer 407 and three to polysorbate 80. All controls tested negative. In-vitro tests showed limited usefulness. CONCLUSION Skin test reactivity to PEG can decrease over time, but titrated SPT with increasing concentrations of PEG 20,000 can be diagnostic when lower MW PEGs test negative. To avoid systemic reactions stepwise SPT is mandatory. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS An algorithm using a stepwise approach of skin prick testing to PEGs of increasing molecular weights and concentrations can be used to diagnose allergy to PEGs.","Bruusgaard-Mouritsen, Maria Anna; Jensen, Bettina Margrethe; Poulsen, Lars K; Johansen, Jeanne Duus; Garvey, Lene Heise",The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2021.05.020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34052265/,246
139298,Review of new and newly discovered respiratory tract viruses in children.,2009,"AIM To explore the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic first wave in Quebec, Canada on practices in early intervention services (EIS) for first-episode psychosis, including reorganization of clinical and administrative practices and teleconsultation use. METHODS Adopting a cross-sectional descriptive study design, a 41 questions online survey was sent to the team leaders of all the 33 Quebec EIS, of which 100% responded. Data were collected from 18 May to 4 June 2020 and analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. Programmes were categorized as urban/non-urban and results were compared between these. RESULTS All 33 existing Quebec EIS (16 urban and 17 non-urban) completed the survey. Among them, 85% did not experience redeployment of EIS team staff and 58% reported stable frequency of patient interactions, either in-person or through telemedicine. During the studied period, 64% of programmes reported that all professionals used teleconsultation at least occasionally. However, 73% of programmes, mostly in non-urban areas, reported some limitations regarding clinicians' degree of ease with teleconferencing platforms and half of EIS could not access technical support to use them. The majority of EIS (94%) expressed interest to participate in a training program about the use of technologies for teleconsultations. Many smaller clinics reported interest in offering multiregional/multiclinics group teletherapy, therefore merging their pool of patients and clinical staff workforce. CONCLUSIONS Further studies are warranted to improve access to and use of technology-mediated treatment, which seems to be a promising alternative to provide high-quality mental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Pires de Oliveira Padilha, Paula; Bertulies-Esposito, Bastian; L'Heureux, Sophie; Olivier, David; Lal, Shalini; Abdel-Baki, Amal",Early intervention in psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13227; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34626091/,246

METHODS The plasma samples were obtained from 112 sepsis patients within 24 hours after admission and 100 healthy controls (HCs) at enrollment. The lncRNA MEG3 expression in plasma samples was determined by RT-qPCR. In sepsis patients, ARDS occurrence was assessed based on Berlin definition of ARDS and 28-day mortality risk was evaluated. RESULTS LncRNA MEG3 expression was increased in sepsis patients compared with HCs. During 28-day duration, 30 sepsis patients occurred ARDS and 82 sepsis patients did not occur ARDS. LncRNA MEG3 expression was elevated in ARDS sepsis patients compared with non-ARDS sepsis patients, then the following receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis disclosed that lncRNA MEG3 predicted ARDS risk (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.775), which was further validated as an independent risk factor by multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, lncRNA MEG3 was positively correlated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infection, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score, sequential organ failure assessment score, white blood cell, and C-reactive protein, while negatively correlated with albumin in sepsis patients. Additionally, lncRNA MEG3 was elevated in 28-day deaths compared with 28-day survivors, and it predicted 28-day mortality risk in sepsis patients (AUC = 0.708) by ROC curve analysis. CONCLUSION LncRNA MEG3 might represent as a valuable biomarker for individualizing prevention strategies against ARDS and improving prognosis in sepsis.","Wu, Xiaoling; Chen, Dan; Yu, Li",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844492/,246
139933,Current agreement on the management of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND Children with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are more likely to have mild or no symptoms compared to adults and may represent important vectors for transmitting the virus. Little is known about the duration of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral shedding in children with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE To determine the average shedding times of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts in children. METHODS We performed a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL databases for studies reporting real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) results in children with COVID-19, then extracted and synthesized data on duration of viral shedding from symptom onset in respiratory and gastrointestinal samples. RESULTS Based on data compiled from 69 pediatric cases, the duration of viral shedding through the respiratory tract is up to 24 days from symptom onset with a mean of 11.1 ± 5.8 days. Of the children who underwent testing with stool PCR, rectal swab or anal swab, 86% returned a positive result. The mean duration of viral shedding via the gastrointestinal tract was 23.6 ± 8.8 days from symptom onset. In 89% of cases, viral shedding via the gastrointestinal tract persisted after nasopharyngeal or throat swabs became negative, for as long as 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically review the duration of respiratory and gastrointestinal viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in pediatric patients.

This study aimed to determine the anxiety level of emergency medical services professionals in Ankara, Turkey after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In the first part of the survey, the participants of the study were asked about their socio-demographic characteristics and their contact with the COVID-19 patients. In the second part, a survey with 20 questions that determined the state anxiety level derived from the State Anxiety Inventory was performed after obtaining verbal consent. RESULTS The mean age of the participants was 33.1±6.9, while 52.7% of all participants were males. In this study, the mean STAI Anxiety Score was 50.7±11.6. Anxiety scores were higher in females and those who had family members at risk of COVID-19 infection (p<0.05). The majority of those who had family members at risk of the infection started to stay in guesthouses instead of going home. Participants were worried about transmitting the infection to their family members (p<0.05). They felt more anxious when treating COVID-19 diagnosed or other patients (p<0.05). In addition, they thought that their anxiety level increased in general (p<0.05). CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic caused an anxiety increase in EMS workers in Turkey. Protecting the physical and mental health of the EMS employees who work at the front line against the COVID-19 pandemic and who have a high risk of infection, and ensuring their efficient work should be the main priority.","Usul, Eren; Şan, Ishak; Bekgöz, Burak",Psychiatria Danubina,https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.563; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33370767/,246

142161,CT findings of pulmonary cysts.,2021-03-16,"INTRODUCTION The exponential growth of SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission during the first months of 2020 has placed substantial pressure on most health systems around the world. The complications derived from the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vary due to comorbidities, sex and age, with more than 50% of the patients requiring some level of intensive care developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The authors carried out an extensive and comprehensive literature review on SARS-CoV-2 infection, the clinical, pathological and radiological presentation as well as the current treatment strategies. AREAS COVERED Various complications caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection have been identified, the most lethal being the acute respiratory distress syndrome, caused most likely by the presence of severe immune cell response and the concomitant alveolus inflammation. The new treatment strategies are updated, and the analysis of the physiopathology is included in this review. EXPERT OPINION ARDS is one of the most frequent complications in patients with COVID-19. Information regarding the etiology and physiopathology are still unfolding and for the prevention and amelioration, good clinical management, adequate ventilatory support and the use of systemic corticoids seem to be the most efficient way to reduce mortality and to reduce hospital lengths.","Montenegro, Francisco; Unigarro, Luis; Paredes, Gustavo; Moya, Tatiana; Romero, Ana; Torres, Liliana; López, Juan Carlos; González, Fernando Esteban Jara; Del Pozo, Gustavo; López-Cortés, Andrés; Diaz, Ana M; Vasconez, Eduardo; Cevallos-Robalino, Doménica; Lister, Alex; Ortiz-Prado, Esteban",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2020.1820329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32902367/,246

During spring 2021, we routinely tested all residential students 1 to 2 times per week using pooled, RNA-extraction-free, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) testing of saliva at a cost of $0.43/sample with same-day results. The limit of detection was 500 copies/ml on individual samples, and analysis indicates 1,000 and 2,500 copies/ml in pools of 5 and 10, respectively, which is orders of magnitude more sensitive than rapid antigen tests. Importantly, saliva testing flagged 83% of semester positives (43,884 tests administered) and was 95.6% concordant with nasopharyngeal diagnostic results (69.0% concordant on the first test when the nucleocapsid gene (N1) cycle threshold (CT) value was >30). Moreover, testing reduced weekly cases by 59.9% in the spring despite far looser restrictions, allowing for more normalcy while eliminating outbreaks. We also coupled our testing with a survey to clarify symptoms and transmissibility among college-age students. While only 8.5% remained asymptomatic throughout, symptoms were disparate and often cold-like (e.g., only 37.3% developed a fever), highlighting the difficulty with relying on symptom monitoring among this demographic. Based on reported symptom progression, we estimate that we removed 348 days of infectious individuals by routine testing. Interestingly, viral load (CT value) at the time of testing did not affect transmissibility (R2 = 0.0085), though those experiencing noticeable symptoms at the time of testing were more likely to spread the virus to close contacts (31.6% versus 14.3%). Together, our findings support routine testing for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Implementation of cost- and resource-efficient approaches should receive strong consideration in communities that lack herd immunity. IMPORTANCE This study highlights the utility of routine testing for SARS-CoV-2 using pooled saliva while maintaining high sensitivity of detection (under 2,500 copies/ml) and rapid turnaround of high volume (up to 930 samples in 8 h by two technicians and one quantitative PCR [qPCR] machine). This pooled approach allowed us to test all residential students 1 to 2 times per week on our college campus during the spring of 2021 and flagged 83% of our semester positives. Most students were asymptomatic or presented with symptoms mirroring common colds at the time of testing, allowing for removal of infectious individuals before they otherwise would have sought testing. To our knowledge, the total per-sample consumable cost of $0.43 is the lowest to date. With many communities still lagging in vaccination rates, routine testing that is cost-efficient highlights the capacity of the laboratory's role in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Vander Schaaf, Nicole A; Fund, Anthony J; Munnich, Brianna V; Zastrow, Alexi L; Fund, Erin E; Senti, Tanner L; Lynn, Abigail F; Kane, Jonathon J; Love, Jennifer L; Long, Gregory J; Troendle, Nicholas J; Sharda, Daniel R",Microbiology spectrum,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.01089-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34643445/,246

We encountered a patient with a primary chest wall tumor that had exposure characteristics similar to our limited, but promising, experience with en bloc rib resections for primary lung cancer. A 71-year-old female patient presented with a symptomatic right meningocele, at which time a 7.7-cm left anterior mediastinal mass bulging through the second interspace was detected. With the patient in the lateral decubitus position, a modified three-incision approach similar to that for a video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy was performed but angled slightly different to expose the anterior chest wall. Using this approach, the mass was excised intact en bloc, with ribs 2 and 3 (9.5-cm total specimen with 6-cm longest rib). No chest wall reconstruction was necessary. The patient did well and had her chest tube removed on postoperative day (POD) 1, was discharged with minimal pain on POD 3, and was pain free on POD 14. Because a microscopic focus of chondrosarcoma was found at the second rib intramedullary margin on the final pathologic review, she returned for VATS re-resection of an additional 5 cm of rib on POD 43 using the same incisions, and her postoperative recovery was replicated. The operative times were 160 and 90 minutes, and blood loss was 400 and 100 mL, respectively. This case demonstrates that if traditional surgical values of exposure and oncologic safety can be replicated using enhanced instrumentation, it is reasonable to attempt more complex operations thoracoscopically. Even though ribs were removed, pain control was similar to other VATS operations.","Hennon, Mark W; Demmy, Todd L",Innovations,https://doi.org/10.1097/imi.0b013e318284b12b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23422809/,246

The source of lyssavirus infections is diverse with numerous reservoirs in a wide geographical area. In many parts of the world reservoir hosts can potentially be carrying one of several lyssavirus strains and possibly new divergent isolates await discovery. Accordingly, generic detection methods are required to be able to detect and discriminate all lyssaviruses and identify new divergent isolates. Here we have allied a sequence-independent amplification method to microarray to enable simultaneous detection and identification of all lyssavirus genotypes. To do so, lyssavirus RNA was converted to cDNA and amplified in a random PCR, labelled and hybridized to probes on the microarray chip before being statistically analysed. The probes were to a 405 bp region of the relatively conserved N gene. Here we demonstrate a microarray capable of detecting each of the seven lyssavirus genotypes. The random amplification of lyssavirus RNA and the numerous oligonucleotide probes on the microarray chip also offer the potential to detect novel lyssaviruses.","Gurrala, R; Dastjerdi, A; Johnson, N; Nunez-Garcia, J; Grierson, S; Steinbach, F; Banks, M",Virus research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2009.04.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19433118/,246

Surgical methods differ on the degree of tissue reduction and reliance on surgical tissue removal vs tissue ablation. The outcome and morbidity from 3 different turbinate techniques are compared. METHODS A randomized double-blinded study was performed. Patient nasal cavities were randomized to different interventions on each side within the same patient. One group had a combination of submucosal powered turbinate reduction (designated ""submucosal"") and submucosal electrocautery (designated ""electrocautery""); and the second group had a combination of submucosal powered turbinate reduction (designated ""submucosal"") and medial flap turbinoplasty (designated ""turbinoplasty""). Patient-scored nasal obstruction and rhinorrhoea (1 to 5) along with blindly assessed nasal airway patency ratings (1 to 4) was done at 12 and 60 months postoperatively. Pain requiring additional analgesia, crusting, bleeding (needing review), and revision were documented. RESULTS A total of 100 patients were recruited (age 32.79 ± 13.58 years; 39% female). This represented 200 nasal airway surgeries with 100 submucosal procedures, 50 electrocautery and 50 medial flap turbinoplasties. No patients complained of worsening of their obstruction. At 60 months patients in the turbinoplasty group had greater outcomes, with 90.2% having occasional or no decongestant use (Kendall's tau B p < 0.001) compared to electrocautery (15.8%) and submucosal (37.8%). Fewer turbinoplasty patients had a revision procedure (12%, χ(2) = 20.08, p < 0.001) compared to electrocautery (54%) and submucosal (40%). Crusting was more common in the electrocautery group (58% vs submucosal 2% and turbinoplasty 0%; χ(2) = 92.04; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The medial flap turbinoplasty provided consistent, robust results.

EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS Of the 202 unique citations, 18 citations met the inclusion criteria. Study sample sizes ranged from 51 to 17,695. Eleven of the 18 studies had fewer than 500 participants; two studies had ≥ 1,000. Overall, statistically significant associations with VMS were found for variants in 14 of the 26 genes assessed in candidate gene studies. The cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1B1) gene was the focus of the largest number (n = 7) of studies, but strength and statistical significance of associations of CYP1B1 variants with VMS were inconsistent. A genome-wide association study reported statistically significant associations between 14 single-nucleotide variants in the tachykinin receptor 3 gene and VMS. Heterogeneity across trials regarding VMS measurement methods and effect measures precluded quantitative meta-analysis; there were few studies of each specific genetic variant. CONCLUSIONS Genetic variants are associated with VMS. The associations are not limited to variations in sex steroid metabolism genes. However, studies were few and future studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings.","Crandall, Carolyn J; Diamant, Allison L; Maglione, Margaret; Thurston, Rebecca C; Sinsheimer, Janet",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/clinem/dgaa536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797194/,246

146954,Uncovering Atrial Fibrillation Beyond Short-Term Monitoring in Cryptogenic Stroke Patients: Three-Year Results From the Cryptogenic Stroke and Underlying Atrial Fibrillation Trial.,2016,"BACKGROUND Mass critical care entails time-sensitive decisions and changes in the standard of care that it is possible to deliver. These circumstances increase provider uncertainty as well as patients' vulnerability and may, therefore, jeopardize disciplined, ethical decision-making. Planning for pandemics and disasters should incorporate ethics guidance to support providers who may otherwise make ad hoc patient care decisions that overstep ethical boundaries. This article provides consensus-developed suggestions about ethical challenges in caring for the critically ill or injured during pandemics or disasters. The suggestions in this article are important for all of those involved in any pandemic or disaster with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government officials. METHODS We adapted the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Guidelines Oversight Committee's methodology to develop suggestions. Twenty-four key questions were developed, and literature searches were conducted to identify evidence for suggestions. The detailed literature reviews produced 144 articles. Based on their expertise within this domain, panel members also supplemented the literature search with governmental publications, interdisciplinary workgroup consensus documents, and other information not retrieved through PubMed. The literature in this field is not suitable to support evidence-based recommendations. Therefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modified Delphi process. RESULTS We report the suggestions that focus on five essential domains: triage and allocation, ethical concerns of patients and families, ethical responsibilities to providers, conduct of research, and international concerns. CONCLUSIONS Ethics issues permeate virtually all aspects of pandemic and disaster response. We have addressed some of the most pressing issues, focusing on five essential domains: triage and allocation, ethical concerns of patients and families, ethical responsibilities to providers, conduct of research, and international concerns. Our suggestions reflect the consensus of the Task Force. We recognize, however, that some suggestions, including those related to end-of-life care, may be controversial. We highlight the need for additional research and dialogue in articulating values to guide health-care decisions during disasters.","Biddison, Lee Daugherty; Berkowitz, Kenneth A; Courtney, Brooke; De Jong, Col Marla J; Devereaux, Asha V; Kissoon, Niranjan; Roxland, Beth E; Sprung, Charles L; Dichter, Jeffrey R; Christian, Michael D; Powell, Tia",Chest,https://doi.org/10.1378/chest.14-0742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25144262/,246
147132,Acute Myopericarditis with Pericardial Effusion and Cardiac Tamponade in a Patient with COVID-19.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A number of studies have examined the role of matrix metalloproteinases in aneurysm healing following endovascular coiling. Because ruptured aneurysms are known to express higher levels of matrix metalloproteinases, we hypothesized that patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage who were on a statin at the time of coil embolization would have lower aneurysm recanalization and retreatment rates than patients not on statins. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of patients who underwent intrasaccular coil embolization of ruptured intracranial aneurysms of ≤10 mm with at least 6 months of imaging follow-up. Patients were separated into 2 groups: 1) those on an oral statin medication at the time of coiling, and 2) those who were not. Outcomes studied were aneurysm recurrence and aneurysm retreatment after endovascular coiling. Student t and χ(2) tests were used for statistical significance of differences between groups. RESULTS One hundred thirty-two patients with 132 ruptured aneurysms were included in our study. Sixteen were on statins (12.1%) and 116 were not (87.9%). The recurrence rate was 6.3% in the statin group (1/16) and 36.2% in the nonstatin group (42/107) (P = .02). Unplanned retreatment rates were 6.3% (1/16) for the statin group and 25.9% (30/116) for the nonstatin group (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS Statins were associated with a lower rate of aneurysm recurrence following endovascular coiling of small- and medium-sized ruptured aneurysms in this small retrospective study. Further studies are needed to confirm this finding to determine whether statins can be used to reduce recurrence rates in these aneurysms.","Brinjikji, W; Shahi, V; Cloft, H J; Lanzino, G; Kallmes, D F; Kadirvel, R",AJNR.

We continued our SIV effectiveness against medically-attended influenza-like illness (ILI) under the Department of Health Hong Kong's sentinel private medical practitioners (PMP) network, using the test-negative case-control design, for the 2018/19 and 2019/20 season. In addition, we studied the potential interference between SIV and ILI caused by non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) based on data collated from 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons. 3404 patients were analysed. Across the 2017/18 to 2019/20 seasons, the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of SIV was 44% (95% CI 30-56%) against pan-negative controls, 57% (95%CI: 42-68%) against NIRV controls and 50% (95%CI 38-59%) against both. SIV was moderately effective against medically-attended ILI caused by influenza A/B in both 2018/19 and 2019/20 winter seasons (53.2% (95%CI 36.7-65.5%) and 41.8% (95%CI 6.3-64.1%), respectively). The VE against the main circulating subtype, influenza A(H1), was higher for the 2018/19 season (57.2% (95%CI 39.8-69.9%), compared to 34.6% (95%CI -9.6-61.4%) in the 2019/20 season). When compared to pan negative controls, those with single NIRV infections were similarly likely to have received SIV (OR 1.05 (95%CI 0.72-1.54) within the influenza season; OR 0.97 (95%CI 0.73-1.29) when including non-influenza seasons). Analyses by type of virus showed no increased risk of SIV identified among those with single infections of EV/RV, HMPV and parainfluenza but a 2-fold increased risk was shown for those with single infections of adenovirus and parainfluenza virus (adenovirus: OR 2.54 (95%CI 1.24-5.14) within influenza season and OR 1.78 (95%CI 1.01-3.09) for the whole period; parainfluenza virus: OR 2.01 (95%CI 1.22-3.29) within influenza season and OR 1.89 (95%CI 1.29-2.76) for the whole period). SIV programme and surveillance of influenza and NIRV, including SARS-CoV-2, should continue during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chan, Yung-Wai; Wong, Miu-Ling; Kwok, Fong-Yuen; Au, Albert Ka-Wing; Leung, Emily Chi-Mei; Chuang, Shuk-Kwan",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.04.059; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34016472/,246
147268,Cardiac surgery in presence of concomitant corona virus disease-2019 infection.,2020-09-16,"Post-transcriptional repression of gene expression by miRNAs occurs through transcript destabilization or translation inhibition. mRNA decay is known to account for most miRNA-dependent repression. However, because transcript decay occurs co-translationally, whether target translation is a requirement for miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization remains unknown. To decouple these two molecular processes, we used cytosolic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as models for endogenous transcripts that are not translated. We show that, despite interacting with the miRNA-loaded RNA-induced silencing complex, the steady-state abundance and decay rates of these transcripts are minimally affected by miRNA loss. To further validate the apparent requirement of translation for miRNA-dependent decay, we fused two lncRNA candidates to the 3'-end of a protein-coding gene reporter and found this results in their miRNA-dependent destabilization. Further analysis revealed that the few natural lncRNAs whose levels are regulated by miRNAs in mESCs tend to associate with translating ribosomes, and possibly represent misannotated micropeptides, further substantiating the necessity of target translation for miRNA-dependent transcript decay. In summary, our analyses suggest that translation is required for miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization, and demonstrate that the levels of coding and noncoding transcripts are differently affected by miRNAs.","Biasini, Adriano; Abdulkarim, Baroj; de Pretis, Stefano; Tan, Jennifer Y; Arora, Rajika; Wischnewski, Harry; Dreos, Rene; Pelizzola, Mattia; Ciaudo, Constance; Marques, Ana Claudia",The EMBO journal,https://doi.org/10.15252/embj.2020104569; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33300180/,246

Implant design remains a critical challenge for the successful repair and prevention of recurrent hernias, and despite significant progress, there is no ideal mesh for every surgery. This review summarizes the evolution of prostheses design toward successful hernia repair beginning with a description of the anatomy of the disease and the classifications of hernias. Next, the major milestones in implant design are discussed. Commonly encountered complications and strategies to minimize these adverse effects are described, followed by a thorough description of the implant characteristics necessary for successful repair. Finally, available implants are categorized and their advantages and limitations elucidated, including non-absorbable and absorbable (synthetic and biologically derived) prostheses, composite prostheses, and coated prostheses.

The new metronidazole derivative (2-amine-3-[2-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethylthio]propanoic acid) (L) containing adequate groups to coordinate technetium through the formation of a Tc(I)-tricarbonyl complex was synthesised with adequate yield (33%) and characterised by spectroscopy. Labelling was performed by substitution of three labile water molecules of the technetium tricarbonyl precursor, fac-[(99m)Tc(CO)3 (H2O)3](+) with the ligand. A radiochemical purity higher than 90% was achieved and remained unchanged for more than 4 h. The complex has a high stability in plasma, a moderate plasma protein binding and a moderate hydrophilicity. In vitro cell uptake studies showed a ratio between the activity taken up by cells in hypoxia/normoxia of 1.6 ± 0.4 (p < 0.5). Biodistribution in normal mice showed rapid depuration and low uptake in all organs and tissues except liver. Biodistribution in mice bearing induced tumours showed a low tumour uptake, but tumour/muscle ratio was favourable thanks to depuration. Comparison with biological results of other metronidazole derivatives clearly shows that modifications of the chelator are very important and contribute to improve the biological behaviour.","Giglio, J; Dematteis, S; Fernández, S; Cerecetto, H; Rey, A",Journal of labelled compounds & radiopharmaceuticals,https://doi.org/10.1002/jlcr.3195; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24692093/,246

MATERIAL AND METHODS Forty-nine patients who underwent MWA of 77 lung metastases between 2008 and 2015 were included. All patients received an unenhanced chest CT and a ceMRI (including T2 and ceT1) 24 h after MWA. The conspicuities of the peripheral rim and the ablated tumour were scored using 1-3 scales and compared between examinations. The safety margin was measured directly (both scores ≥2) and indirectly using a subtraction method. The ability of each imaging modality to predict LTP based on safety margin width was analysed using receiver operating characteristic curves. The MRI ability to detect a pneumothorax was compared to CT. RESULTS The peripheral rim was best visualised on T2 followed by T1 and CT. The tumour was best visualised on CT, followed by T1 and T2. Direct safety margin measurement was possible on CT, ceT1 and T2 in 68.8%, 64.9% and 27.3% of cases, respectively. Direct CT (AUC = 0.77) and ceT1 (AUC = 0.76) measurements had better diagnostic performance than indirect CT (AUC = 0.72), ceT1 (AUC = 0.70) and T2 (AUC = 0.69) measurements. The MRI sensitivity and specificity for pneumothorax were 60.8% and 87.0%, respectively. Only one pneumothorax >1 cm was missed. CONCLUSIONS A ceMRI performed 24 h after MWA of lung tumours has a similar ability to predict LTP and detect important complications as a CT has.","Roman, Andrei; Kaltenbach, Benjamin; Gruber-Rouh, Tatjana; Naguib, Nagy N; Vogl, Thomas J; Nour-Eldin, Nour-Eldin A","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",https://doi.org/10.1080/02656736.2017.1377354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877612/,246

While the exact molecular and cellular basis for motor neuron death is not yet fully understood, the current conceptualization is that multiple aberrant biological processes contribute. Among these, one of the most compelling is based on alterations of RNA metabolism. In this review, we examine how the normal process of cellular response to stress leading to RNA stress granule formation might become pathological, resulting in the formation of stable protein aggregates. We discuss the emerging roles of post-translational modifications of RNA binding proteins in the genesis of these aggregates. We also review the contemporary literature regarding the potential role for more widespread alterations in RNA metabolism in ALS, including alterations in miRNA biogenesis, spliceosome integrity and RNA editing. A hypothesis is presented in which aberrant RNA processing, modulated through pathological stress granule formation as a reflection of either mutations within intrinsically disordered or prion-like domains of critical RNA binding proteins, or the post-translational modification of RNA binding proteins, contributes directly to motor neuron death.","Droppelmann, Cristian A; Campos-Melo, Danae; Ishtiaq, Muhammad; Volkening, Kathryn; Strong, Michael J",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis & frontotemporal degeneration,https://doi.org/10.3109/21678421.2014.881377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555412/,246

150016,Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in Childhood.,2020-07-09,"Persistent viral vector-mediated transgene expression in the airways requires delivery to cells with progenitor capacity and avoidance of immune responses. Previously, we observed that GP64-pseudotyped feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-mediated gene transfer was more efficient in the nasal airways than the large airways of the murine lung. We hypothesized that in vivo gene transfer was limited by immunological and physiological barriers in the murine intrapulmonary airways. Here, we systematically investigate multiple potential barriers to lentiviral gene transfer in the airways of mice. We show that GP64-FIV vector transduced primary cultures of well-differentiated murine nasal epithelia with greater efficiency than primary cultures of murine tracheal epithelia. We further demonstrate that neutrophils, type I interferon (IFN) responses, as well as T and B lymphocytes are not the major factors limiting the transduction of murine conducting airways. In addition, we observed better transduction of GP64-pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in the nasal epithelia compared with the intrapulmonary airways in mice. VSVG glycoprotein pseudotyped VSV transduced intrapulmonary epithelia with similar efficiency as nasal epithelia. Our results suggest that the differential transduction efficiency of nasal versus intrapulmonary airways by FIV vector is not a result of immunological barriers or surface area, but rather differential expression of cellular factors specific for FIV vector transduction.Molecular Therapy - Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e69; doi:10.1038/mtna.2012.60; published online 29 January 2013.","Oakland, Mayumi; Maury, Wendy; McCray, Paul B; Sinn, Patrick L",Molecular therapy.

150857,COVID-19 with rheumatic diseases: a report of 5 cases.,2020-05-14,"OBJECTIVES We investigated the effects of two different types of manual rib cage compression on expiratory flow and mucus clearance during prolonged mechanical ventilation in pigs. DESIGN Prospective randomized animal study. SETTING Animal research facility, University of Barcelona, Spain. SUBJECTS Nine healthy pigs. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Pigs were tracheally intubated, sedated, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated. The animals were prone on a surgical bed in the anti-Trendelenburg position. The experiments were carried out at approximately 60 and 80 hrs from the beginning of mechanical ventilation. Two types of manual rib cage compressions were tested: Hard and brief rib cage compressions synchronized with early expiratory phase (hard manual rib cage compression) and soft and gradual rib cage compressions applied during the late expiratory phase (soft manual rib cage compression). The interventions were randomly applied for 15min with a 15-min interval between treatments. Respiratory flow and mucus movement were assessed during the interventions. Respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics were assessed prior to and after the interventions. Peak expiratory flow increased to 60.1±7.1L/min in comparison to 51.2±4.6L/min without treatment (p < 0.0015) and 48.7±4.3L/min with soft manual rib cage compression (p = 0.0002). Similarly, mean expiratory flow increased to 28.4±5.2L/min during hard manual rib cage compression vs. 15.9±2.2 and 16.6±2.8L/min without treatment and soft manual rib cage compression, respectively (p = 0.0006). During hard manual rib cage compression, mucus moved toward the glottis (1.01 ± 2.37mm/min); conversely, mucus moved toward the lungs during no treatment and soft manual rib cage compression, -0.28 ± 0.61 and -0.15±0.95mm/min, respectively (p = 0.0283). Soft manual rib cage compression slightly worsened static lung elastance and cardiac output (p = 0.0391). CONCLUSIONS Hard manual rib cage compression improved mucus clearance in animals positioned in the anti-Trendelenburg position. The technique appeared to be safe. Conversely, soft manual rib cage compression was not effective and potentially unsafe. These findings corroborate the predominant role of peak expiratory flow on mucus clearance.","Martí, Joan Daniel; Li Bassi, Gianluigi; Rigol, Montserrat; Saucedo, Lina; Ranzani, Otavio Tavares; Esperatti, Mariano; Luque, Nestor; Ferrer, Miquel; Vilaro, Jordi; Kolobow, Theodor; Torres, Antoni",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3182711b52; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314585/,246

Prestenting of the RVOT is commonly performed before PPVI in order to ensure a stable landing zone. The AndraStent XXL (AndraMed GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany), a cobalt-chromium stent with semi-open cell design, has unique mechanical properties in this indication but is no longer available in France. AIMS To assess the efficiency of AndraStent XXL before PPVI. METHODS In this retrospective multicentre cohort study, 86 AndraStents XXL were implanted in 77 patients in 6 centres. RESULTS PPVI was indicated mainly for pulmonary regurgitation (75.3%) in native or patched RVOT (88.3%). The stents were manually mounted on balloon catheters and delivered through sheaths using a conventional femoral approach. PPVI was performed successfully in 97.4% of patients after successful prestenting, generally during the same procedure (77.9%). There were no deaths associated with stent implantation, and four patients experienced five complications, mainly stent embolization, including one requiring surgery. Neither stent fracture nor dysfunction were observed in any patient during a mean follow-up of 19.2±8.7months. Stent analysis showed an excellent maximal stent expansion (97.1%) regardless of balloon size. A 22.3%±3.4 stent shortening with a 30mm balloon was observed.

In addition, while antibodies are effective specific labels, their reproducibility is often inconsistent, and they are difficult to use when staining thick specimens. We report the use of conventional, commercially available fluorescent dyes for rapid and intense covalent labeling of proteins and carbohydrates in super-resolution (expansion) microscopy and cleared tissue microscopy. This approach, which we refer to as Fluorescent Labeling of Abundant Reactive Entities (FLARE), produces simple and robust stains that are modern equivalents of classic small-molecule histology stains. It efficiently reveals a wealth of key landmarks in cells and tissues under different fixation or sample processing conditions and is compatible with immunolabeling of proteins and in situ hybridization labeling of nucleic acids.","Mao, Chenyi; Lee, Min Yen; Jhan, Jing-Ru; Halpern, Aaron R; Woodworth, Marcus A; Glaser, Adam K; Chozinski, Tyler J; Shin, Leonard; Pippin, Jeffrey W; Shankland, Stuart J; Liu, Jonathan T C; Vaughan, Joshua C",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba4542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32518827/,246

152752,Uninterrupted edoxaban vs. vitamin K antagonists for ablation of atrial fibrillation: the ELIMINATE-AF trial.,2019,"PURPOSE Early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, the scientific community highlighted a potential risk of epidemics occurring inside prisons. Consequently, specific operational guidelines were promptly released, and containment measures were quickly implemented in prisons. This paper aims to describe the spread of COVID-19 in detention facilities within the Lombardy region of Italy during March to July 2020, and the impact of the prevention and control measures implemented. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH A descriptive retrospective analysis of case distribution was performed for all COVID-19 cases identified among people in detention (PiD) and prison officers (POs). A comparison of the epidemic burden affecting different populations and a correlation analysis between the number of cases that occurred and prevention measures implemented were also carried out. FINDINGS From this study, it emerged that POs were at a high risk of contracting COVID-19. This study observed a delay in the occurrence of cases among PiD and substantial heterogeneity in the size of outbreaks across different prisons. Correlation between reported cases among PiD and registered sick leave taken by POs suggested the latter contributed to introducing the infection into prison settings. Finally, number of cases among PiD inversely correlated with the capacity of each prison to identify and set up dedicated areas for medical isolation. ORIGINALITY/VALUE Prevention and control measures when adopted in a timely manner were effective in protecting PiD. According to the findings, POs are a population at high risk for acquiring and transmitting COVID-19 and should be prioritized for testing, active case finding and vaccination. This study highlights the critical importance of including prison settings within emergency preparedness plans.","Giuliani, Ruggero; Mazzilli, Sara; Sebastiani, Teresa; Cocca, Giorgia; Bortolotti, Raffaella; Cairone, Cristina; Scardina, Giuditta; Arzilli, Guglielmo; Tavoschi, Lara; Ranieri, Roberto",International journal of prisoner health,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijph-11-2020-0091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34128377/,246

Commercial 3-0 monofilament nylon sutures which are commonly used may vary significantly outside of this diameter. PURPOSE Postoperative hypotony is a complication of surgical treatment of glaucoma using the Baerveldt glaucoma implant (BGI). One method utilized to prevent early postoperative hypotony is intraluminal stenting of the implant with monofilament sutures. The present study attempted to determine optimal stent diameter in microns for 3-0 monofilament sutures to reduce outflow and thereby reduce the risk of postoperative hypotony using the BGI. MATERIALS AND METHODS A laboratory bench model of the anterior chamber was utilized to measure the outflow rate of balanced salt solution (BSS) through the BGI at pressures of 20 and 40▒mmHg while utilizing commercially available 3-0 monofilament nylon stents of various diameters. The BGI tube has an inner diameter of 300▒µm. Additionally, 3-0 nylon sutures were studied for variability by measuring the diameters at 10 equally spaced points along the length of each sample using a digital micrometer. RESULTS Average experimental flow rates decreased with increasing intraluminal stent diameter and increased with increasing pressure. An intraluminal stent diameter of 250▒µm yielded a flow rate of 40▒µL/min at a nominal pressure of 20▒mmHg. Diameters of the tested 3-0 monofilament nylon sutures were all within the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) diameter range of 200-250▒µm, but diameters varied significantly depending on the manufacturer. CONCLUSIONS In our laboratory model, the optimal stent diameter to reduce aqueous flow to a level approaching the normal aqueous production is at least 250▒µm. Secondarily, commercially available 3-0 monofilament nylon suture materials showed variable diameters within the USP diameter range.","DiSclafani, Mark; Richards, David; Schneider, Alex; Whitfield, Whitney; Ayoubi, Yasmin",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001839; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33813561/,246

SAMPLE Healthy intestines from cadavers of dogs euthanized for reasons unrelated to the study. PROCEDURES 18 anastomoses were performed on intestinal sections within 72 hours after dogs were euthanized and intestinal samples collected. Anastomoses were performed with a simple continuous suture pattern. Leakage and maximum intraluminal pressures were measured and recorded for 6 control segments and 18 anastomosed sections. A barbed glycomer 631 suture (size 4-0 United States Pharmacopeia [USP]) was compared with glycomer 631 sutures (sizes 3-0 and 4-0 USP). Results for leakage and maximum intraluminal pressures were compared via an ANOVA. RESULTS The barbed glycomer 631 suture material leaked at a significantly higher pressure than did the comparable glycomer 631 suture materials. Maximum intraluminal pressures were not significantly different among the suture materials.

153397,Rethinking Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b: Which Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction Scales Best Define Near Complete Recanalization in the Modern Thrombectomy Era?,2017,"INTRODUCTION Somatization, defined as a number of medically unexplained physical symptoms for many years, is a resource-intensive condition with much suffering. Adult somatization has been linked to childhood trauma in both men and women. Among women, sexual trauma affects somatization level to a greater extent than non-sexual trauma. Early diagnosis of a somatization disorder would be of great help for both patients and society. The purpose of this scoping review is to map and summarize the literature on symptoms within somatization in women who have been sexually abused, and if any specific symptom can be linked to previous sexual abuse. MATERIAL AND METHODS A scoping review methodology was used. The databases PubMed, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched for original qualitative and quantitative research published between 2008 and 2019 that matched the objectives of the review. RESULTS The database search identified 195 articles, of which 43 were retrieved in full text. Seven articles were included, involving 2076 women. All studies were quantitative. The included studies were heterogeneous. Four studies showed inconsistent findings regarding a link between sexual abuse and chronic or acute pain. Two studies showed an association between sexual abuse and increased incidence of somatic symptoms. One study showed an association between sexual abuse and symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. No specific somatic symptoms in somatization were identifiable within the scope of this study. CONCLUSIONS This is to our knowledge the first scoping review on sexual abuse and symptoms of somatization. The findings suggest a link between sexual abuse and somatic symptoms, but the identified association with pain and irritable bowel syndrome is inconsistent. No studies have clearly identified specific symptoms within somatization associated to sexual abuse. Qualitative research on the topic was identified as a knowledge gap.","Iloson, Carina; Möller, Anna; Sundfeldt, Karin; Bernhardsson, Susanne",Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423277/,246

153669,What good came out of the Covid-19 outbreak for workers with occupational asthma?,2021-04-19,"The complexities of modern biomedicine are rapidly increasing. Thus, modeling and simulation have become increasingly important as a strategy to understand and predict the trajectory of pathophysiology, disease genesis, and disease spread in support of clinical and policy decisions. In such cases, inappropriate or ill-placed trust in the model and simulation outcomes may result in negative outcomes, and hence illustrate the need to formalize the execution and communication of modeling and simulation practices. Although verification and validation have been generally accepted as significant components of a model's credibility, they cannot be assumed to equate to a holistic credible practice, which includes activities that can impact comprehension and in-depth examination inherent in the development and reuse of the models. For the past several years, the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare, an interdisciplinary group seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative, has worked to codify best practices. Here, we provide Ten Rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare developed from a comparative analysis by the Committee's multidisciplinary membership, followed by a large stakeholder community survey. These rules establish a unified conceptual framework for modeling and simulation design, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and usage across the modeling and simulation life-cycle. While biomedical science and clinical care domains have somewhat different requirements and expectations for credible practice, our study converged on rules that would be useful across a broad swath of model types. In brief, the rules are: (1) Define context clearly. (2) Use contextually appropriate data. (3) Evaluate within context. (4) List limitations explicitly. (5) Use version control. (6) Document appropriately. (7) Disseminate broadly. (8) Get independent reviews. (9) Test competing implementations. (10) Conform to standards. Although some of these are common sense guidelines, we have found that many are often missed or misconstrued, even by seasoned practitioners. Computational models are already widely used in basic science to generate new biomedical knowledge. As they penetrate clinical care and healthcare policy, contributing to personalized and precision medicine, clinical safety will require established guidelines for the credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare.","Erdemir, Ahmet; Mulugeta, Lealem; Ku, Joy P; Drach, Andrew; Horner, Marc; Morrison, Tina M; Peng, Grace C Y; Vadigepalli, Rajanikanth; Lytton, William W; Myers, Jerry G",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02540-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32993675/,246
153785,Noninvasive Home Mechanical Ventilation in Adult Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1: A Systematic Review.,2021-05-07,"Determination of structure of RNA via NMR is complicated in large part by the lack of a precise parameterization linking the observed chemical shifts to the underlying geometric parameters. In contrast to proteins, where numerous high-resolution crystal structures serve as coordinate templates for this mapping, such models are rarely available for smaller oligonucleotides accessible via NMR, or they exhibit crystal packing and counter-ion binding artifacts that prevent their use for the chemical shifts analysis. On the other hand, NMR-determined structures of RNA often are not solved at the density of restraints required to precisely define the variable degrees of freedom. In this study we sidestep the problems of direct parameterization of the RNA chemical shifts/structure relationship, and examine the effects of imposing local fragmental coordinate similarity restraints based on similarities of the experimental secondary ribose 13C/1H chemical shifts instead. The effect of such chemical shift similarity (CSS) restraints on the structural accuracy is assessed via residual dipolar coupling (RDC)-based cross-validation. Improvements in the coordinate accuracy are observed for all of the six RNA constructs considered here as test cases, which argues for routine inclusion of these terms during NMR-based oligonucleotide structure determination. Such accuracy improvements are expected to facilitate derivation of the chemical shift/structure relationships for RNA.","Lawrence, Chad; Grishaev, Alexander V",RNA,https://doi.org/10.1261/rna.074617.119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917774/,246

We sought to evaluate the efficacy, surgical feasibility, risks, and advantages of local uterine resection in cases complicated with PAS. Materials and Methods This study included 97 patients with PAS, which was confirmed during surgery and by histopathological examination between January 2013 and December 2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on operative approach. The study population (local resection group) consisted of 30 cases in whom total resection of adherent placenta and myometrium was performed, whereas the control group (hysterectomy group) of 67 cesarean hysterectomy cases. Results Patients who underwent hysterectomy had significantly more bleeding than the local resection group (1180±160 mL vs 877±484 mL; p=0.002). The mean number of transfused packed red blood cells (pRBCs) was greater in the hysterectomy group (4.5±2.3) than in the local resection group (2.6±3.1; p=0.001). Transfusion rate of four and/or more pRBCs was 67.2% in the hysterectomy group and 33.3% in the local resection group, which indicated a statistically significant difference (p=0.002). Of patients, 29.6% required intensive care unit in the hysterectomy group and 6.7% in the local resection group (p=0.023). Conclusion Local resection can be performed safely in selected PAS cases. In these cases, using a standardized protocol in terms of patient selection and surgical procedure will reduce morbidity and mortality.","Üstünyurt, Emin",Turkish journal of obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.4274/tjod.galenos.2020.82652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32850185/,246

PATIENTS AND METHODS Details of 520 patients were retrospectively analyzed, from 2009 to 2019. Extraperitoneal approach, with only two accesses (2.5 cm and 5 mm respectively) was used to perform radical prostatectomy. Perioperative characteristics and postoperative oncologic and functional outcomes are reported. RESULTS The mean age was 66.6 ± 5.6 years. Mean PSA level was 9 ± 3.5 ng/ml. According to D'Amico classification, the percentage of patients with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk disease cases were 116 (22.4%), 275 (52.8%), and 129 (24.8%) respectively. Mean operative time was 156 ± 43 min. Mean estimated blood loss was 214 ± 93 ml. Positive surgical margins (PSMs) were detected in 110 (21.2%) patients.

Due to the global lockdown, work, employment, businesses and the economic climate have been severely affected. It has generated stress among people from all sections of society, especially to workers who have been assigned to cater to healthcare service or those constrained to secure daily essential items. It is widely perceived that elderly or those affected by diabetes, hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases are prone to COVID-19. As per an ongoing survey, the initial data shows that the above-mentioned anxiety and stress cause insomnia, and has the considerable potential to weaken the immune system, the sole protection against the virus. OBJECTIVE This study focuses on the need of Yoga practice at work places and at home during the global lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY Literature was searched using PubMed and Google Scholar for COVID-19-related stress and anxiety at work and society due to the worldwide lockdown. The predisposing comorbidities, viral mechanism of action and treatment regimen were also searched. Yoga-based intervention studies and online programs were also searched. RESULTS As the lockdown cannot last forever and workplaces will have to be functional soon, there is an increased possibility of recurrent infection. Therefore, Yoga can provide the necessary tool for risk reduction, amelioration of stress and anxiety and strengthening of the immune function. The online platforms provide a good media for Yoga training at work places and homes. CONCLUSION Due to social distancing norms, the availability of Yoga trainers has become restricted. Yoga practice is actively sought to achieve reduced anxiety and stress so that improved sleep may positively impact immunity. As a consequence, there is a spurt in social media, catering to daily online Yoga sessions which apparently prove useful in providing accessible means to achieve mental as well as physical well-being.","Sharma, Kanupriya; Anand, Akshay; Kumar, Raj",Work,https://doi.org/10.3233/wor-203219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925134/,246

The objective of this single-center study was to evaluate 2-year weight loss in patients ≥60 years compared with younger matched patients undergoing RYGB. Secondary aims were to record complications and the resolution of comorbidities in a 2-year follow-up. METHODS Of 722 patients with at least 2 years follow-up data, 48 elderly patients were matched with 92 young (<40 years) and 96 middle-aged (40-59 year) patients, according to sex, baseline body mass index, and date of surgery. Weight loss, remission of comorbidities, death, and early (30-day) and 2-year complication rates were compared. RESULTS There were three deaths in the elderly group and none in the other groups. The early complication rate was not significantly different in the elderly group (17.8 %) compared with the young (11.5 %, p = 0.637) and middle-aged (13.7 %, p = 1.000) groups.

METHODS Specification, quantity, amount, defined daily dose system (DDDs), defined daily dose consumption (DDDc), antibiotics use density (AUD), composition, frequency of use, combined use of antibacterial drugs used in the hospital were analyzed between Feb. 2020 and Mar. 2020. RESULTS A total of 25 antibiotic drugs in 12 categories were used. The total cost for antibiotic drugs was 1 million 238 thousand yuan, in which quinolone accounts for 48%, the third generation cephalosporin/lactamase inhibitors accounts for 15.86%, antifungals accounts for 14.17%, oxazolidone accounts for 13.46%, and carbapenms account for 12.73%. The top three drugs of DDDs and AUD were moxifloxacin hydrochloride tablets, moxifloxacin hydrochloride and sodium chloride injection, cefoperazone sodium and sulbactam sodium for injection. The proportion of patients who had been used more than two kinds of antibiotics was 22.36%. CONCLUSIONS Broad-spectrum, high-potency antibiotics are used at the beginning of COVID-19 treatment. The varieties of antibiotics meet the requirements of the management of antibiotics, and the utilization rate of antibiotics and the cost proportion of antibiotics in COVID-19 patients are within a reasonable range.In the future, for the treatment of COVID-19, we should continue to summarize the experience, improve the strategies, and rationally apply antibiotics on the basis of guidelines.","Li, Wenbin; Zhang, Qiang; Wang, Tonghui",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Serum biochemistry revealed hyperglycemia (28.5 mmol/L), hypocalcemia (1.27 mmol/L), hyperphosphatemia (3.39 mmol/L), hypoproteinemia (total protein 50 g/L), and hypoalbuminemia (20 g/L). Based on the poor prognosis associated with the presumptive diagnosis of fibrous osteodystrophy, the camel was euthanized. Gross postmortem findings revealed expanded fibrous tissue replacing the maxilla and mandible, and bilaterally prominent parathyroid glands. Histology of the maxilla revealed proliferative loose fibrous tissue with widely scattered, regularly spaced, small spicules of mineralized bone. The parathyroid glands were prominent bilaterally; the internal and external parathyroid glands were composed of plump cells with abundant pale basophilic cytoplasm and open nuclei. The pathologic findings were consistent with the antemortem diagnosis of fibrous osteodystrophy. The camel's diet, which was not specifically balanced for a camel, included grass hay, sweet feed, and alfalfa pellets. The camel's caregivers reported feeding her treats of cookies. A feed analysis was not available. The biochemistry abnormalities and clinical and postmortem findings, along with a diet that was not balanced for a camel, are consistent with a diagnosis of nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism.","Hines, Elizabeth S; Stevenson, Valentina B; Patton, Molly E; Leventhal, Hannah R; Diaz-Portalatin, Noah; Meyerhoeffer, Mitchell A; Dahlgren, Linda A; Sponenberg, D Phillip","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638720965252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33350346/,246

M-CT is a useful strategy to obtain response, overcome resistance and reduce side effects, with low costs. This review will focus on the use of M-CT in advanced breast cancer (ABC). Cytostatic and cytotoxic effect on cancer cells, the anti-angiogenic and the immunomodulatory effects are its main mechanisms of actions. Many clinical trials proved the efficacy and tolerability of different monotherapies and combinations of chemotherapeutic agents administered in metronomic doses and frequencies in ABC. M-CT is a reasonable option for second and later lines of chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer including those with prior anthracycline or taxane exposure, older patients and patients with comorbidities, and even as first-line in certain groups of patients. The acceptable efficacy and low toxicity of oral metronomic chemotherapy makes it a reasonable option during COVID-19 pandemic as well as in the post-COVID era which is projected to last for some time.","Fares, Johny E; El Tomb, Paul; Khalil, Lana E; Atwani, Rula W; Moukadem, Hiba A; Awada, Ahmad; El Saghir, Nagi S",Cancer treatment reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769038/,246

MATERIALS AND METHODS The Pipeline for Uncoilable or Failed Aneurysms is a multicenter, prospective, interventional, single-arm trial of PED for the treatment of uncoilable or failed aneurysms of the internal carotid artery. Institutional review board approval of the HIPAA-compliant study protocol was obtained from each center. After providing informed consent, 108 patients with recently unruptured large and giant wide-necked aneurysms were enrolled in the study. The primary effectiveness endpoint was angiographic evaluation that demonstrated complete aneurysm occlusion and absence of major stenosis at 180 days. The primary safety endpoint was occurrence of major ipsilateral stroke or neurologic death at 180 days. RESULTS PED placement was technically successful in 107 of 108 patients (99.1%). Mean aneurysm size was 18.2 mm; 22 aneurysms (20.4%) were giant (>25 mm). Of the 106 aneurysms, 78 met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint (73.6%; 95% posterior probability interval: 64.4%-81.0%). Six of the 107 patients in the safety cohort experienced a major ipsilateral stroke or neurologic death (5.6%; 95% posterior probability interval: 2.6%-11.7%). CONCLUSION PED offers a reasonably safe and effective treatment of large or giant intracranial internal carotid artery aneurysms, demonstrated by high rates of complete aneurysm occlusion and low rates of adverse neurologic events; even in aneurysms failing previous alternative treatments.","Becske, Tibor; Kallmes, David F; Saatci, Isil; McDougall, Cameron G; Szikora, István; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Moran, Christopher J; Woo, Henry H; Lopes, Demetrius K; Berez, Aaron L; Cher, Daniel J; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Albuquerque, Felipe C; Fiorella, David J; Berentei, Zsolt; Marosfoi, Miklós; Cekirge, Saruhan H; Nelson, Peter K",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.13120099; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23418004/,246

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the anastomotic leakage rate in laparoscopic rectal surgery according to the need of using one or two stapler firings for rectal transection. METHODS PubMed, Ovid, the Cochrane Library database and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched. All of the statistical analyses were performed using Revman software. RESULTS Five studies were included (1267 patients). The overall anastomotic leakage rate was 5.5% [0.7-8.4%]. Anastomotic leak occurred in 3.5% (17/491) of the cases where 1 stapler firing was used versus 6.7% (50/786) of the cases in which 2 firings were needed (50/786). Two stapler firings were significantly associated with an increased risk of anastomotic leakage (OR 2.44, 95% CI 1.34-4.42, p = 0.003, I2 = 1%). CONCLUSIONS Our systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that two firings imply a higher rate of anastomotic leak than a single firing after laparoscopic rectal surgery with a double stapling technique. Coloproctologists should strive to reduce the number of linear stapler firings and try to transect the rectum with a single firing.","Balciscueta, Z; Uribe, N; Caubet, L; López, M; Torrijo, I; Tabet, J; Martín, M C",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-020-02240-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32451807/,246

Traditionally, SRS are designed for on-site settings. However, the safety measures in relation to the recent COVID-19 pandemic result in remote teaching at an unprecedented scale, with online courses becoming the rule. In this paper, we discuss the utilization of interactive SRS in such remote settings for which they initially were not designed. Over the last term, we conducted several empirical surveys across different groups of Computer Science students on undergraduate and postgraduate levels, and covering a broad age spectrum. The results indicate that, while common interactive features of videoconferencing tools, such as chat or polls, are well appreciated, there is still a need for dedicated SRS with game-based elements and feature sets beyond standard multiple-choice questions. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Botev, J.; Grévisse, C.; Rothkugel, S.","8th International Conference on Learning and Collaboration Technologies, LCT 2021, held as Part of the 23rd International Conference, HCI International 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77889-7_27,246

One possibility to improve distance learning can be the use of virtual reality (VR). To this day there are no common guidelines for educators for using VR, and therefore no recommendations to decide which platform to use and what specific requirements they entail. This paper presents an evaluation of currently available proprietary social VR platforms for the use in distance learning. Based on results of expert interviews (n= 4 ) with educators and an online survey (n= 92 ) of students, we identified ten relevant criteria for teaching in VR. We compiled a list of 155 currently available proprietary social VR platforms, which we filtered and evaluated. The results indicate that current social VR platforms can provide an easy and affordable way for educators to access the usage of VR in education, although we could not determine a single best social VR platform. Our recommendations rather provide different most suitable platforms for particular learning applications depending to respective educational requirements. Our research provides a guideline for interested educators in order to find an affordable entry into the usage of VR in education. Building on this, future research can shed light on questions of didactic effects, user-friendliness, or data protection. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Genz, F.; Fuchs, N.; Kolb, D.; Müller, S.; Kranzlmüller, D.","8th International Conference on Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Computer Graphics, AVR 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-87595-4_34,246

We investigated the risk of mortality and critical care admission in hospitalised adults with nosocomial COVID-19, relative to adults requiring hospitalisation due to community-acquired infection. Methods: We systematically reviewed the peer-reviewed and pre-print literature from 1/1/2020 to 9/2/2021 without language restriction for studies reporting outcomes of nosocomial and community-acquired COVID-19. We performed a random effects meta-analysis (MA) to estimate the 1) relative risk of death and 2) critical care admission, stratifying studies by patient cohort characteristics and nosocomial case definition. Results: 21 studies were included in the primary MA, describing 8,246 admissions across 8 countries during the first wave, comprising 1517 probable or definite nosocomial COVID-19, and 6729 community-acquired cases. Across all studies, the risk of mortality was 1.31 times greater in patients with nosocomial infection, compared to community-acquired (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.70). Rates of critical care admission were similar between groups (Relative Risk, RR=0.74, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.08). Immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with nosocomial COVID-19 were twice as likely to die in hospital as those admitted with community-acquired infection (RR=2.14, 95% CI: 1.76 to 2.61). Conclusions: Adults who acquire SARS-CoV-2 whilst already hospitalised are at greater risk of mortality compared to patients admitted following community-acquired infection; this finding is largely driven by a substantially increased risk of death in individuals with malignancy or who had undergone transplantation. These findings inform public health and infection control policy, and argue for individualised clinical interventions to combat the threat of nosocomial COVID-19, particularly for immunosuppressed groups.

However, the role of maternal-fetal genetic interactions (MFGI) and parent-of-origin (imprinting) effects in PA remain unknown. We investigated MFGI in MB-OP, and imprinting effects in relation to risk of PA. Among Peruvian mother-infant pairs (503 PA cases and 1,052 controls), independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), with linkage-disequilibrium coefficient <0.80, were selected to characterize genetic variations in MB-OP (78 SNPs in 24 genes) and imprinted genes (2713 SNPs in 73 genes). For each MB-OP SNP, four multinomial models corresponding to fetal allele effect, maternal allele effect, maternal and fetal allele additive effect, and maternal-fetal allele interaction effect were fit under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, random mating, and rare disease assumptions. The Bayesian information criterion (BIC) was used for model selection. For each SNP in imprinted genes, imprinting effect was tested using a likelihood ratio test. Bonferroni corrections were used to determine statistical significance (p-value<6.4e-4 for MFGI and p-value<1.8e-5 for imprinting). Abruption cases were more likely to experience preeclampsia, have shorter gestational age, and deliver infants with lower birthweight compared with controls. Models with MFGI effects provided improved fit than models with only maternal and fetal genotype main effects for SNP rs12530904 (log-likelihood ratio=18.2; p-value=1.2e-04) in CAMK2B, and, SNP rs73136795 (log-likelihood ratio=21.7; p-value=1.9e-04) in PPARG, both MB genes. We identified 311 SNPs in 35 maternally-imprinted genes (including KCNQ1, NPM, and, ATP10A) associated with abruption. Top hits included rs8036892 (p-value=2.3e-15) in ATP10A, rs80203467 (p-value=6.7e-15) and rs12589854 (p-value=1.4e-14) in MEG8, and rs138281088 in SLC22A2 (p-value=1.7e-13). We identified novel PA-related maternal-fetal MB gene interactions and imprinting effects that highlight the role of the fetus in PA risk development. Findings can inform mechanistic investigations to understand the pathogenesis of PA. Author summary Placental Abruption (PA) is a complex multifactorial and heritable disease characterized by premature separation of the placenta from the wall of the uterus. PA is a consequence of complex interplay of maternal and fetal genetics, epigenetics, and metabolic factors. Previous studies have identified common maternal single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several mitochondrial biogenesis (MB) and oxidative phosphorylation (OP) genes that are associated with PA risk, although findings were inconsistent. Using the largest assembled mother-infant dyad of PA cases and controls, that includes participants from a previous report, we identified novel PA-related maternal-fetal MB gene interactions and imprinting effects that highlight the role of the fetus in PA risk development. Our findings have the potential for enhancing our understanding of genetic variations in maternal and fetal genome that contribute to PA.","Workalemahu, Tsegaselassie; Enquobahrie, Daniel A.; Gelaye, Bizu; Tadesse, Mahlet G.; Sanchez, Sixto E.; Tekola-Ayele, Fasil; Hajat, Anjum; Thornton, Timothy A.; Ananth, Cande V.; Williams, Michelle A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/340687,246

Methods: Surveys conducted at time 1 (February 2020), and time 2 (April 2020) comprised of the short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale, the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and self-reported moderate and vigorous PA levels. Repeated measures analyses established changes pre-post lockdown restrictions, and differences between sub-groups. Associations between changes in well-being, self-esteem and PA over time were explored through further regression analyses. Results: 65 respondents completed the survey at time 1, and 50 respondent at time 2. Wellbeing increased significantly over time, yet remained significantly lower than the population average. Self-esteem increased significantly post-lockdown, however remained significantly lower for females, compared with males. Overall, PA levels increased-whereby ‘inactive’ participants at time 1 reported significant increases in moderate and total activity levels at time 2. Increased PA levels significantly predicted increased well-being: F(1, 48) = 4.15, p &lt; .05;while participants who had become less active accounted for 69.2% with low self-esteem at time 2. Conclusions: Findings indicate that increased PA accounted for improved mental well-being, while decreased PA was associated with reduced levels of self-esteem.

This study aims to investigate the interdependencies of organisational flexibility enabled by ICT, demographics and containment measures in the ever more dismal economic performances seen during COVID-19 with a view to preparing socio-economic systems for similar future shocks. Design/methodology/approach: Using non-classical fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, the authors are able to capture the asymmetric relationships and complexities found in real life. Findings: Analysing data acquired from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker and Eurostat, the authors find these conditions give mixed results depending on how they are combined. The results imply that countries under strict containment measures might only be able to survive when fully equipped with ICT solutions. E-commerce also plays an important role in countries with a below-average decrease in their growth rate. Put differently, the presence and absence of telework produces mixed results. If the population is old, telework seems to generate the desired outcomes. Yet, when the population is young, it might be more beneficial to avoid this practice.

178439,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in Patients With Covid-19,2021,"COVID-19 (Coronavirus) is a very contagious infection that has drawn the world public's attention. Modeling such diseases can be extremely valuable in predicting their effects. Although classic statistical modeling may provide adequate models, it may also fail to understand the data's intricacy. An automatic COVID-19 detection system based on computed tomography (CT) scan or X-ray images is effective, but a robust system's design is a challenging problem. In this paper, motivated by the outstanding performance of deep learning (DL) in many solutions, we used DL based approach for computer-aided design (CAD) of the COVID-19 detection system. For this purpose, we used a state-of-the-art classification algorithm based on DL, i.e., ResNet50, to detect and classify whether the patients are normal or infected by COVID-19. We validate the proposed system's robustness and effectiveness by using two benchmark publicly available datasets (Covid-Chestxray-Dataset and Chex-Pert Dataset). The proposed system was trained on the collection of images from 80% of the datasets and tested with 20% of the data. Cross-validation is performed using a 10-fold cross-validation technique for performance evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed system gives an accuracy of 98.6%, a sensitivity of 97.3%, a specificity of 98.2%, and an F1-score of 97.87%. Results clearly show that the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score of our proposed system are high, and it performs better than the existing state-of-the-art systems. The proposed system based on DL will be helpful in medical diagnosis research and health care systems. © 2021 IEEE.","Nasser, N.; Emad-Ul-Haq, Q.; Imran, M.; Ali, A.; Al-Helali, A.","2021 IEEE International Conference on Communications, ICC 2021",https://doi.org/10.1109/icc42927.2021.9500460,246

This study argues that as the impact of COVID-19 pandemic condition, the middle class working mothers, who have been “forced to go back” to their homes, seemingly, use their homes as “struggling places” to renegotiate the old patriarchal role divisions and unequal gender/power relations. Moreover, it is argued that their homes, to some extends, are used as learning sites for gender equality values, and modified to fulfill their extended functions: as domestic, work, and social spheres.","Elfira, Mina; Wibawarta, Bambang; Esther, Rouli; Febriand, Fandra; en,",International Review Of Humanities Studies,https://doi.org/10.7454/irhs.v6i1.326,246

Kindergartens and schools were closed (lockdown) and children were forced to pause their therapy. Materials and Methods We conducted a survey during August and October 2020 and asked parents of children with a speech and language disorder about their child's therapy during lockdown and their fears and sorrows associated with it. Results Parents of 39 children participated (age: 6,15 years (3,06 - 10,09)). 34 children received speech therapy before lockdown. This therapy was paused for 17 children during lockdown. The other 17 children still received speech therapy during lockdown with the following alterations: hygiene measures (n=12), via internet (Skype, Zoom;n=3) or via work sheets sent by mail (n=1). Parents whose children were forced to pause therapy were more likely to worry about their children to stagnate or even regress in their development. Furthermore, they feared that their children were less motivated to return to therapy after lockdown and/or might develop problems in school. In addition to that, those parents felt more left alone with their sorrows and more burdened by missing support for their children. Discussion Due to the physiological speech development, there is a sensitive time frame for a child with a speech and language disorder to receive therapy. Forcing them to pause therapy might influence their development in a negative manner. Their parents might also be mentally burdened. It is important to acknowledge this in future political decisions, so that children with speech and language disorders won't have a permanent handicap.","Hackenberg, B.; Grosse, L.; Büttner, M.; Martin, E.; Cordier, D.; Läßig, A.

Portugal entered the emergency state on 19th march due to rising numbers of infected patients. The emergency state introduced regulatory measures that restricted people’s movements, applied a curfew, and closed most non-essential spaces and activities, such as shops and religious celebrations.ObjectivesTo evaluate the rates of suicides during the emergency state in Portugal.MethodsWe obtained the number of probable suicides during 19th march and 2nd may 2020, 2019 and 2018 from SICO/eVM (Real Time Mortality Electronic Surveillance). This system is used for health planning in Portugal and provides provisory data which is updated every 10 minutes. ExcelÒ was used for the statistical analysis.ResultsDuring the Emergency State in Portugal there were 57 probable suicides. Comparing to the same period in 2018 and 2019, there were 62 and 70 probable suicides, respectively. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders. Literature on suicides due to COVID-19 mention not only fear of infection, but also social isolation and distancing and economic recession as causes for suicide attempts and completions.ConclusionsDuring the emergency state there was not an increase of probable suicides, compared to previous years. The greater vigilance of people’s movements may have deterred many attempts. However, policymakers and health care providers must be alert as the current psychosocial predispose to an increase in suicide rates.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Freitas Ramos, S.; Fonseca Marinho Vaz Soares, M.

183097,Lethal outcome of Covid-19 pneumonia in a new liver recipient with neurological manifestation,2020,"Since its emergence in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has swept through many cities around the world, claiming millions of lives and causing major socio-economic impacts. The pandemic occurred at an important historical juncture when smart solutions and technologies have become ubiquitous in many cities. Against this background, in this review, we examine how smart city solutions and technologies have contributed to resilience by enhancing planning, absorption, recovery, and adaptation abilities. For this purpose, we reviewed 147 studies that have discussed issues related to the use of smart solutions and technologies during the pandemic. The results were synthesized under four themes, namely, planning and preparation, absorption, recovery, and adaptation. This review shows that investment in smart city initiatives can enhance the planning and preparation ability. In addition, the adoption of smart solutions and technologies can, among other things, enhance the capacity of cities to predict pandemic patterns, facilitate an integrated and timely response, minimize or postpone transmission of the virus, provide support to overstretched sectors, minimize supply chain disruption, ensure continuity of basic services, and offer solutions for optimizing city operations. These are promising results that demonstrate the utility of smart solutions for enhancing resilience. However, it should be noted that realizing this potential hinges on careful attention to important issues and challenges related to privacy and security, access to open-source data, technological affordance, legal barriers, technological feasibility, and citizen engagement. Despite this, this review shows that further development of smart city initiatives can provide unprecedented opportunities for enhancing resilience to the pandemic and similar future events.","Sharifi, Ayyoob Khavarian-Garmsir Amir Reza Kummitha Rama Krishna Reddy",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13148018,246

To support the process of digital competence assessment, it is consequently necessary to understand the different approaches and methods. This paper carries out a systematic literature review and includes an analysis of the existing proposals and conceptions of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education, with the aim of better understanding the field of research. The review follows three objectives: (i) describe the characteristics of digital competence assessment processes and methods in higher education;(ii) provide an overview of current trends;and, finally, (iii) identify challenges and issues in digital competence assessment in higher education with a focus on the reliability and validity of the proposed methods. On the basis of the findings, and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital competence assessment in higher education requires more attention, with a specific focus on instrument validity and reliability. Furthermore, it will be of great importance to further investigate the use of assessment tools to support systematic digital competence assessment processes.

Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn't find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (>60 vs <60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker's lung compared to non-smoker's lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.","Cai, Guoshuai",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.05.20020107,246

Five subgenomic cDNA constructs were generated to transcribe different negative-strand RNA fragments. In UV cross-linking assays, distinct differences in binding of proteins in extracts from poliovirus-infected and uninfected cells to virus-specific, radiolabeled transcripts were observed. Two proteins present in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells with approximate molecular masses of 36 and 38 kDa were shown to cross-link to the 3' end of poliovirus negative-strand RNA. Appearance of the 36- and 38-kDa proteins in UV cross-linking assays can be detected 3 to 3.5 h after infection, and cross-linking reaches maximum levels by 5 h after infection. The binding site for the 36-kDa protein overlaps with the computer-predicted loop b region of stem-loop I, the so-called cloverleaf structure, and the RNA sequence of this region is required for efficient binding. Transfection of full-length, positive-sense RNA containing a five-nucleotide substitution (positions 20 to 25) in the loop b region of stem-loop I into tissue culture cells yielded only viral isolates with a reversion at position 24 (U-->C). This finding demonstrates that the wild-type cytidine residue at position 24 is essential for virus replication. RNA binding studies with transcripts corresponding to the 3' end of negative-strand RNA suggest that complex formation with the 36-kDa protein plays an essential role during the viral life cycle.","Roehl, H H; Semler, B L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7707521/,246

The sample consists of patients with dual diagnosis, divided into two subgroups based on gender; descriptive and bivariate statistics were performed (p<0.05). Male and females were compared according to socio-demographic, clinical and psychopathological features, measured by Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) and factor models of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). RESULTS In our sample (n=157), no significant differences in socio-demographic features were found between male (n=108, 68.8%) and female subjects (n=49, 31.2%). Women displayed a higher frequency of involuntary hospitalizations (53.1% vs 32.4%, p=0.022) and a higher score on the general psychopathology scale of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (41.86±8.96 vs 36.54±10.38, p=0.041).

Early detection of incursions of virus prevented establishment of the disease in several countries, notably Japan, South Korea, and Malaysia. In countries where detection of early cases was delayed, infection is endemic and has been for three or more years. Control measures implemented in these countries need to reflect this finding. Vaccination will continue to be one of the key measures used in these endemically infected countries. Used alone, vaccination will not result in elimination of H5N1 viruses from a country, but, if used correctly, it will markedly reduce the prevalence of and susceptibility to infection. Vaccination has already played a valuable role in reducing the adverse effects of H5N1 viruses. Mass culling also reduces the level of infection in infected areas. However, the long-term benefits are limited in endemically infected countries owing to the high probability of reinfection on restocking unless other measures are used in parallel. Full epidemiological studies have not been conducted in many infected countries. Nevertheless, it is recognized that the number of clinical cases does not truly reflect the levels of infection. Domestic ducks and large live poultry markets have played a key role in the persistence of infection, because they can be infected silently. In tackling this disease, countries should adopt integrated control programs using the combination of measures best suited to the local environment. All surveillance data should be shared, both positive and negative, and should include information on cases of infection and disease. Socioeconomic and ecological implications of all control measures should be assessed before implementation, especially the impact on the rural poor.","Sims, L D",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17494550/,246

As a step toward understanding the function of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) E protein, we carried out clustered charged-to-alanine mutagenesis on the E gene and incorporated the resulting mutations into the MHV genome by targeted recombination. Of the four possible clustered charged-to-alanine E gene mutants, one was apparently lethal and one had a wild-type phenotype. The two other mutants were partially temperature sensitive, forming small plaques at the nonpermissive temperature. Revertant analyses of these two mutants demonstrated that the created mutations were responsible for the temperature-sensitive phenotype of each and provided support for possible interactions among E protein monomers. Both temperature-sensitive mutants were also found to be markedly thermolabile when grown at the permissive temperature, suggesting that there was a flaw in their assembly. Most significantly, when virions of one of the mutants were examined by electron microscopy, they were found to have strikingly aberrant morphology in comparison to the wild type: most mutant virions had pinched and elongated shapes that were rarely seen among wild-type virions. These results demonstrate an important, probably essential, role for the E protein in coronavirus morphogenesis.","Fischer, F; Stegen, C F; Masters, P S; Samsonoff, W A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9733825/,246

Previously, we showed that mutations in the immunodominant CD8 T-cell epitope (S-510-518) could be detected in nearly all samples of RNA and virus isolated from these mice. These mutations abrogated recognition by T cells harvested from the central nervous systems of infected mice in direct ex vivo cytotoxicity assays. These results suggested that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutants contributed to virus amplification and the development of clinical disease in mice infected with wild-type virus. In the present study, the importance of these mutations was further evaluated by infecting naive mice with MHV-JHM variants isolated from infected mice and in which epitope S-510-518 was mutated. Compared to mice infected with wild-type virus, variant virus-infected animals showed higher mortality and morbidity manifested by decreased weight gain and neurological signs. Although a delay in the kinetics of virus clearance has been demonstrated in previous studies of CTL escape mutants, this is the first illustration of significant changes in clinical disease resulting from infection with viruses able to evade the CD8 T-cell immune response.","Pewe, L; Xue, S; Perlman, S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9621053/,246
195484,Risk of high dose hydrocortisone in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,2008,"Dengue virus is an arthropod-borne flavivirus that causes a mild febrile illness, dengue fever, or a potentially fatal syndrome, dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Chemokines primarily orchestrate leukocyte recruitment to the areas of viral infection, which makes them critical mediators of immune and inflammatory responses. In the present study, we investigated the induction and function of chemokines in mice early after infection with dengue virus in vivo. We found that CXCL10/IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) expression was rapidly and transiently induced in liver following infection. The expressed CXCL10/IP-10 likely mediates the recruitment of activated NK cells, given that anti-CXCL10/IP-10-treated mice showed diminished NK cell infiltration and reduced hepatic expression of effector molecules in activated NK cells after dengue virus infection. Of particular interest, we found that CXCL10/IP-10 also was able to inhibit viral binding to target cells in vitro. Further investigation revealed that various CXCL10/IP-10 mutants, in which the residues that mediate the interaction between the chemokine and heparan sulfate were substituted, failed to exert the inhibitory effect on dengue binding, which suggests that CXCL10/IP-10 competes with dengue virus for binding to heparan sulfate on the cell surface. Moreover, subsequent plaque assays showed that this inhibition of dengue binding blocked viral uptake and replication. The inhibitory effect of CXCL10/IP-10 on the binding of dengue virus to cells may represent a novel contribution of this chemokine to the host defense against viral infection.","Chen, Jia-Perng; Lu, Hsin-Lin; Lai, Szu-Liang; Campanella, Gabriele S; Sung, Jui-Ming; Lu, Mei-Yi; Wu-Hsieh, Betty A; Lin, Yi-Ling; Lane, Thomas E; Luster, Andrew D; Liao, Fang",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16920957/,246
195505,Tocilizumab as a Treatment for 'Cytokine Storm Syndrome' in COVID-19: A Case Report.,2021-04-01,"Coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses involved in a variety of pathologies that affect animals and humans. Existing structural models of these viruses propose a helical nucleocapsid under the virion envelope as the unique internal structure. In the present work, we have analyzed the structure of the transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus. The definition of its organization supports a new structural model for coronaviruses, since a spherical, probably icosahedral, internal core has been characterized. Disruption of these cores induces the release of N-protein-containing helical nucleocapsids. Immunogold mapping and protein analysis of purified cores showed that they consist of M and N proteins, M being the main core shell component. This surprising finding, together with the fact that M protein molecules are also located in the virion envelope, indicates that a reconsideration of the assembly and maturation of coronaviruses, as well as a study of potential M-protein subclasses, is needed.","Risco, C; Antón, I M; Enjuanes, L; Carrascosa, J L",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8676505/,246
197166,"Acute infections, venous thrombosis, and recommended thromboprophylaxis.",2020,"Direct massively parallel sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome was undertaken from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab samples of infected individuals in Eastern India. Seven of the isolates belonged to the A2a clade, while one belonged to the B4 clade. Specific mutations, characteristic of the A2a clade, were also detected, which included the P323L in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and D614G in the Spike glycoprotein. Further, our data revealed emergence of novel subclones harbouring nonsynonymous mutations, viz. G1124V in Spike (S) protein, R203K, and G204R in the nucleocapsid (N) protein. The N protein mutations reside in the SR-rich region involved in viral capsid formation and the S protein mutation is in the S2 domain, which is involved in triggering viral fusion with the host cell membrane. Interesting correlation was observed between these mutations and travel or contact history of COVID-19 positive cases. Consequent alterations of miRNA binding and structure were also predicted for these mutations. More importantly, the possible implications of mutation D614G (in SD domain) and G1124V (in S2 subunit) on the structural stability of S protein have also been discussed.

198526,An unusual cause of ventricular tachycardia: Port-A-Cath fracture and embolization into the pulmonary artery.,2014,"Hospitals discharge considerable amounts of chemicals and microbial agents in their wastewaters. Problem chemicals present in hospital wastewater belong to different groups, such as antibiotics, X-ray contrast agents, disinfectants and pharmaceuticals. Many of these chemical compounds resist normal wastewater treatment. They end up in surface waters where they can influence the aquatic ecosystem and interfere with the food chain. Humans are particularly exposed by the drinking water, produced from surface water. Microbial agents of special concern are multiresistant microbial strains. The latter are suspected to contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance. In this paper, we will discuss the different approaches towards hospital wastewater treatment. The principle of uncoupling hospitals from public sewers warrants indepth evaluation by technologists and ecotoxicologists as well as public health specialists.","Pauwels, B; Verstraete, W",Journal of water and health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17176811/,246
199544,Anaphylactic events in mRNA vaccines: a reporting case-control study,2021,"Background COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th March 2020. Individuals with correct understanding about the risks and severity of the disease are more likely to respond positively and practice recommended preventive measures. Objectives To assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures among residents of Nigeria. Methods The study was cross-sectional and involved 469 participants from 1st July to 31st August 2020. A 36-item questionnaire with Cronbach alpha of 0.753 was adapted and administered through an online survey tool. A snowball sampling approach was employed whereby the questionnaire link was distributed through social media networks including WhatsApp©, Facebook© and Instagram©. Data was analysed using SPSS 23 and a statistical significance level of 0.05 was used. Bivariate and multivariate analysis were employed to determine factors affecting the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19 transmission and prevention. Results The mean age of participants was 39±11.29years. Majority (54%) of the participants heard about COVID-19 through mass and social media. The study found that 71.6% of the participants had good knowledge, just 31.3% had a good attitude while 84.9% of them had good practices towards COVID-19 in Nigeria. The high rates of the knowledge and practices were driven by income, age, education and marital status. Conclusions Majority of the study participants showed correct knowledge and adhered to recommended practices towards COVID- 19. However, there were gaps in the understanding of the underlying realities and beliefs in certain myths about COVID-19. Hence, interventions such as jingles and posters in various languages that would serve to correct the negative perceptions and myths about COVID-19 instituted through mass media and social media are recommended.","Akafa, A T; Amos, Y; Okeke, A; Oreh, A C",West African journal of medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33901392/,246

202110,Late Breaking Abstract - Retrospective analysis of CPAP using home NIV machines outwith ICU for COVID-19,2020,"Today, COVID-19 pneumonia causes global concern. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported many mortalities from this disease all around the world. Therefore, recognizing new cases of COVID-19 is crucial during this pandemic. Many studies have shown that COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of signs and symptoms, including GI and cutaneous manifestations. Previous studies have reported liver enzyme changes as well as diarrhea as a common GI manifestation of COVID-19. However, there are few reports about COVID-19 synchronous cutaneous and liver involvement. Additionally, there are few reports about intrahepatic cholestasis in COVID-19 patients. In this article, a confirmed case of COVID-19 with vasculopathy-related cutaneous manifestation and liver cholestasis is reported. A 67-year-old Iranian woman was admitted to Taleghani Hospital with epigastric pain, vomiting, anosmia, rising liver enzyme levels, fever, itching, and skin rashes. Skin and liver biopsies were performed during the patient's admission; the results suggested vasculopathy-related cutaneous lesion and liver cholestasis. Plasmapheresis was initiated and all manifestations disappeared after treatment. All atypical presentations, including cutaneous lesions and liver manifestations, should be considered as COVID-19 and evaluated.","Sadeghi, Amir; Dooghaie Moghadam, Arash; Eslami, Pegah; Pirsalehi, Ali; Salari, Sina; Roshandel, Elham",Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33244385/,246
202875,Intestinal ischemia secondary to Covid-19,2020,"Digital contact tracing is being used by many countries to help contain COVID-19's spread in a post-lockdown world. Among the various available techniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal strength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered less of a privacy risk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS, cellular-tower history, or QR-code scanning. As of October 2020, there have been millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contract-tracing apps, as more and more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of these apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical research that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to fill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of Bluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80 participants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world gatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting proximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially crowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in need, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover, technical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused by the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users' willingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still be useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity of up to 20m lasting for an hour. Based on our findings, we recommend that existing contact-tracing apps can be re-purposed to focus on coarse-grained proximity detection, and that future ones calibrate distance estimates and adjust broadcast frequencies based on auxiliary information.","Hsiao, Hsu-Chun; Huang, Chun-Ying; Hong, Bing-Kai; Cheng, Shin-Ming; Hu, Hsin-Yuan; Wu, Chia-Chien; Lee, Jian-Sin; Wang, Shih-Hong; Jeng, Wei",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.04322v2.pdf,246

SETTING: We conducted a survey in Wuhan, China, to characterize the status of coinfected PLWH, their time to clinical improvement, and clinical prognoses. METHODS: Using a Wuhan shipping service for antiretroviral medications, the Wuhan LGBT Center screened 2900 PLWH shipping addresses and cross-referenced 36 of them to quarantine sites or hospitals, suggesting possible COVID-19 cases. Through telephone calls and WeChat (social media) messaging, we conducted a survey after obtaining online informed consent. RESULTS: We had 12 HIV-infected respondents (10 men and 2 women) who also reported COVID-19. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range: 33.0-56.3), mean age 42.4 years, and range 25-66 years of age. Nine of 10 persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with only mild COVID-19 symptoms. The 10th person on ART was a 56-year-old man who died at home early in the outbreak when health care services were overwhelmed. Two additional cases who had been in intensive care with acute COVID-19 were both men, aged 25 and 37 years; both were ART-naive until this hospitalization. Excluding the deceased man, 6 of 11 coinfected persons reported feeling depressed even after clinical improvements. CONCLUSION: Twelve coinfected persons were identified in Wuhan; 9 of 10 were on long-term ART and had favorable outcomes. Two men identified as having started ART only recently were found to have severe symptoms. Our case series suggests the value of ART for potential mitigation of COVID-19 coinfection.","Hu, Yifei; Ma, Juntao; Huang, Haojie; Vermund, Sten H",J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,,246

205286,A word of caution in interpreting COVID-19 diagnostics tests,2020,"University administrators face decisions about how to safely return and maintain students, staff and faculty on campus throughout the 2020-21 school year. We developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) deterministic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 among university students, staff, and faculty. Our goals were to inform planning at our own university, Emory University, a medium-sized university with around 15,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff, and to provide a flexible modeling framework to inform the planning efforts at similar academic institutions. Control strategies of isolation and quarantine are initiated by screening (regardless of symptoms) or testing (of symptomatic individuals). We explored a range of screening and testing frequencies and performed a probabilistic sensitivity analysis. We found that among students, monthly and weekly screening can reduce cumulative incidence by 59% and 87%, respectively, while testing with a 2-, 4- and 7-day delay between onset of infectiousness and testing results in an 84%, 74% and 55% reduction in cumulative incidence. Smaller reductions were observed among staff and faculty. Community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 onto campus may be controlled with testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine. Screening would need to be performed at least weekly to have substantial reductions beyond disease surveillance. This model can also inform resource requirements of diagnostic capacity and isolation/quarantine facilities associated with different strategies.","Lopman, Ben; Liu, Carol Y; Le Guillou, Adrien; Handel, Andreas; Lash, Timothy L; Isakov, Alexander P; Jenness, Samuel M",Sci Rep,,246

The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate such observations with the thromboprophylaxis received. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 67 patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. The deep veins were examined using compression duplex ultrasonography with the transducer on B-mode. The patients were separated into two groups for statistical analysis: those receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis and those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. Risk analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, 57 were included in the present study after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 49.1% were women, and the patient mean age was 71.3 years. All 57 patients had undergone compression duplex ultrasonography. Of these 57 patients, 6 were diagnosed with DVT, for an in-hospital rate of DVT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia of 10.5%. All the patients who had presented with DVT had been receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. The patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation treatment had a greater risk of DVT (16.21%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.28; P = .056) compared with those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. We also found a protective factor for DVT in the intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment group (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.46; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Non-critically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have a high risk of DVT despite receipt of correct, standard thromboprophylaxis.","Jimenez-Guiu, Xavier; Huici-Sánchez, Malka; Romera-Villegas, Antonio; Izquierdo-Miranda, Alexandre; Sancho-Cerro, Ana; Vila-Coll, Ramon",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,,246

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, we followed patients admitted for suspicion of COVID-19 at Djoungolo Hospital between 01st April and 31st July 2020. Patients were categorised by age groups and disease severity: mild (symptomatic without clinical signs of pneumonia), moderate (with clinical signs of pneumonia without respiratory distress) and severe cases (clinical signs of pneumonia and respiratory distress not requiring invasive ventilation). Demographic information and clinical features were summarised. Multivariable analysis was performed to predict risk. FINDINGS: A total of 313 patients were admitted during the study period; 259 were confirmed cases of COVID-19 by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the confirmed cases, the male group aged 40 to 49 years (13.9%) was predominant. Disease severity ranged from mild (26.2%; n = 68) to moderate (59%; n = 153) to severe (14.7%; n = 38); the case fatality rate was 1% (n = 4). Dysgusia (46%; n = 119) and hyposmia/anosmia (37.8%; n = 98) were common features of COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had comorbidities (29%; n = 53), of which hypertension was the most common (18.9%; n = 49).

207723,MR-proADM as marker of endotheliitis predicts COVID-19 severity,2021,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the current global coronavirus pandemic and more than one million infections since December 2019. The exact origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, but the presence of a distinct motif in the S1/S2 junction region suggests the possible acquisition of cleavage site(s) in the spike protein that promoted cross-species transmission. Through plaque purification of Vero-E6 cultured SARS-CoV-2, we found a series of variants which contain 15-30-bp deletions (Del-mut) or point mutations respectively at the S1/S2 junction. Examination of the original clinical specimen from which the isolate was derived, and 26 additional SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical specimens, failed to detect these variants. Infection of hamsters shows that one of the variants (Del-mut-1) which carries deletion of 10 amino acids (30bp) does not cause the body weight loss or more severe pathological changes in the lungs that is associated with wild type virus infection. We suggest that the unique cleavage motif promoting SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans may be under strong selective pressure, given that replication in permissive Vero-E6 cells leads to the loss of this adaptive function. It would be important to screen the prevalence of these variants in asymptomatic infected cases. The potential of the Del-mut variants as an attenuated vaccine or laboratory tool should be evaluated.","Lau, Siu-Ying; Wang, Pui; Mok, Bobo Wing-Yee; Zhang, Anna Jinxia; Chu, Hin; Lee, Andrew Chak-Yiu; Deng, Shaofeng; Chen, Pin; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Song, Wenjun; Chen, Zhiwei; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Yuen, Kwok-Yung; Chen, Honglin",Emerg Microbes Infect,,246

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients in the Shahid Mostafa Khomeini Hospital of Ilam from March to August 2020. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, all the COVID-19 patients with a cardiac condition admitted to the intensive care unit were enrolled by census. Electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter monitoring were used to diagnose arrhythmias. Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Results: The total number of eligible patients was 45, of whom 26 (57.8%) were men, and 19 (42.2%) were women. The mortality rate of arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients was 17.77% (8 out of 45 patients), and the recovery rate was 82.13% (37 out of 45 patients). Conclusion: Tachycardia and the lack of response to heart rate reducing drug be observed in patients with COVID-19.Owing to an overlap between these symptoms and those of heart diseases, there is a need to further evaluate patients with arrhythmias. Although arrhythmias are not common in COVID-19 patients, they can be fatal and inflict a high mortality rate, which can be prevented by early detection.","Mohammadyari, Elham; Ahmadi, Iraj; Mohammadyari, Anis; Tavan, Hamed; Norozi, Siros",New Microbes New Infect,,246

The purpose of this case report is to highlight the importance of proper selection of antibiotics for treatment of severe MPP and increase awareness concerning the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant MPP. PATIENT CONCERNS: A case of severe life-threatening pneumonia in a 26-year-old man with high fever and cough was non-responsive to azithromycin and fluoroquinolones. DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with MPP based on the test results of bronchoalveolar lavage using real-time quantitative PCR method. INTERVENTIONS: Tigecycline was given to the patient after azithromycin and fluoroquinolones failed. OUTCOMES: The patients fever subsided within the first day of tigecycline therapy.

212485,COVID-19 in a child with severe propionic acidemia,2021,"BACKGROUND: The role of portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters for supplemental aerosol mitigation during exercise testing is unknown and might be relevant during COVID-19 pandemic. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the effect of portable HEPA filtering on aerosol concentration during exercise testing and its efficiency in reducing room clearance time in a clinical exercise testing laboratory? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects were six healthy volunteers aged 20 to 56 years. In the first experiment, exercise was performed in a small tent with controlled airflow with the use of a stationary cycle, portable HEPA filter with fume hood, and particle counter to document aerosol concentration. Subjects performed a four-stage maximal exercise test that lasted 12 minutes plus 5 minutes of pretest quiet breathing and 3 minutes of active recovery. First, they exercised without mitigation then with portable HEPA filter running. In a separate experiment, room aerosol clearance time was measured in a clinical exercise testing laboratory by filling it with artificially generated aerosols and measuring time to 99.9% aerosol clearance with heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) only or HVAC plus portable HEPA filter running. RESULTS: In the exercise experiment, particle concentrations reached 1,722 ± 1,484/L vs 96 ± 124/L (P < .04) for all particles (>0.3 µm), 1,339 ± 1,281/L vs 76 ± 104/L (P < .05) for smaller particles (0.3 to 1.0 µm), and 333 ± 209/L vs 17 ± 19/L (P < .01) for larger particles (1.0 to 5.0 µm) at the end of the protocol in a comparison of mitigation vs portable HEPA filter. Use of a portable HEPA filter in a clinical exercise laboratory clearance experiment reduced aerosol clearance time 47% vs HVAC alone. INTERPRETATION: The portable HEPA filter reduced the concentration of aerosols generated during exercise testing by 96% ± 2% for all particle sizes and reduced aerosol room clearance time in clinical exercise testing laboratories. Portable HEPA filters therefore might be useful in clinical exercise testing laboratories to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Garzona-Navas, Andres; Sajgalik, Pavol; Csecs, Ibolya; Askew, J Wells; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco; Niven, Alexander S; Johnson, Bruce D; Allison, Thomas G",Chest,,246

212808,The diagnostic and prognostic role of myocardial injury biomarkers in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,2020,"Due to the SARS-CoV-2 infection-related severe pulmonary tissue damages associated with a relative specific widespread thrombotic microangiopathy, the pathophysiologic role of heart-lung interactions becomes crucial for the development and progression of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. The high resistance in the pulmonary circulation, as a result of small vessel thrombosis and hypoxemia, is the major cause of right heart failure associated with a particularly high mortality in severe COVID-19. Timely identification of patients at high risk for RV failure, optimization of mechanical ventilation to limit its adverse effects on RV preload and afterload, avoidance of medication-related increase in the pulmonary vascular resistance, and the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in refractory respiratory failure with hemodynamic instability, before RV failure develops, can improve patient survival. Since it was confirmed that the right-sided heart is particularly involved in the clinical deterioration of patients with COVID-19 and pressure overload-induced RV dysfunction plays a key role for patient outcome, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) received increasing attention. Limited TTE focused on the right heart appears highly useful in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and particularly beneficial for monitoring of critically ill patients. In addition to detection of right-sided heart dilation and RV dysfunction, it enables assessment of RV-pulmonary arterial coupling and evaluation of RV adaptability to pressure loading which facilitate useful prognostic statements to be made. The increased use of bedside TTE focused on the right heart could facilitate more personalized management and treatment of hospitalized patients and can contribute towards reducing the high mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Dandel, Michael",Heart fail. rev,,246

Accordingly, testing is crucial for mitigating the economic and public health effects. In order to facilitate point-of-care diagnosis, this study aims at presenting a label-free electrochemical biosensor as a powerful nanobiodevice for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein detection. Utilizing the IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody onto the electrode surface as a specific platform in an ordered orientation through staphylococcal protein A (ProtA) is highly significant in fabricating the designed nanobiodevice. In this sense, the screen-printed carbon electrode modified with Cu2O nanocubes (Cu2O NCs), which provide a large surface area in a very small space, was applied in order to increase the ProtA loading on the electrode surface. Accordingly, the sensitivity and stability of the sensing platform significantly increased. The electrochemical evaluations proved that there is a very good linear relationship between the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and spike protein contents via a specific binding reaction in the range 0.25 fg mL-1 to 1 µg mL-1. Moreover, the assay when tested with influenza viruses 1 and 2 was performed in 20 min with a low detection limit of 0.04 fg mL-1 for spike protein without any cross-reactivity. The designed nanobiodevice exhibited an average satisfactory recovery rate of ~ 97-103% in different artificial sample matrices, i.e., saliva, artificial nasal, and universal transport medium (UTM), illustrating its high detection performance and practicability. The nanobiodevice was also tested using real patients and healthy samples, where the results had been already obtained using the standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) procedure, and showed satisfactory results.

In order to identify the key vitamin D target genes involved in these processes, transcriptome-wide datasets were compared, which were obtained from a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated in vitro by 1,25(OH)2D3, filtered using different approaches, as well as from PBMCs of individuals supplemented with a vitamin D3 bolus. The led to the genes ACVRL1, CAMP, CD14, CD93, CEBPB, FN1, MAPK13, NINJ1, LILRB4, LRRC25, SEMA6B, SRGN, THBD, THEMIS2 and TREM1. Public epigenome- and transcriptome-wide data from THP-1 cells were used to characterize these genes based on the level of their VDR-driven enhancers as well as the level of the dynamics of their mRNA production. Both types of datasets allowed the categorization of the vitamin D target genes into three groups according to their role in (i) acute response to infection, (ii) infection in general and (iii) autoimmunity. In conclusion, 15 genes were identified as major mediators of the action of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity and their individual functions are explained based on different gene regulatory scenarios.","Koivisto, Oona; Hanel, Andrea; Carlberg, Carsten",Nutrients,,246
218601,"Treatment of severe COVID-19 with convalescent plasma in Bronx, NYC",2021,"Phenotyping is an effective way to identify cohorts of patients with particular characteristics within a population. In order to enhance the portability of a phenotype definition across institutions, it is often defined abstractly, with implementers expected to realise the phenotype computationally before executing it against a dataset. However, un-clear definitions, with little information about how best to implement the definition in practice, hinder this process. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-layer, workflow-based model for defining phenotypes, and a novel authoring architecture, Phenoflow, that supports the development of these structured definitions and their realisation as computable phenotypes. To evaluate our model, we determine its impact on the portability of both code-based (COVID-19) and logic-based (diabetes) definitions, in the context of key datasets, including 26,406 patients at North-western University. Our approach is shown to ensure the portability of phenotype definitions and thus contributes to the transparency of resulting studies.","Chapman, M.; Rasmussen, L. V.; Pacheco, J.

To facilitate international cooperation for pandemic governance, this paper applied the evolutionary game theory to analyze the factors influencing active cooperative governance and, based on the results, proposed a series of recommendations for promoting international cooperation. (1) leveraging the role of international organizations to reduce the cost of realizing the strategy of active cooperative governance, (2) promoting the international exchange of related experiences to lower the cost of active pandemic governance, (3) sustaining productive and daily activities during the pandemic in a classified and hierarchical manner to reduce the economic loss incurred by active pandemic governance, and (4) optimizing the incentive measures of international organizations to facilitate the selection of active cooperative governance. Finally, from the four aspects of resource management of pandemic treatment, supply management of living materials, population flow cooperation management, and governance fund cooperation management, this paper gives the path of international pandemic cooperative governance.","Lin, Xueyu; Yang, Hualei; Wu, Yuanyang; Zheng, Xiaodong; Xie, Lin; Shen, Zheng; Hu, Sen",Front Public Health,,246

To unbiasedly identify metrics associated with severe outcomes in COVID-19 patients, we conducted a retrospective study of 835 COVID-19 positive patients at a single academic medical center between March 10, 2020 and October 13, 2020. As of December 1, 2020, 656 (79%) patients required hospitalization and 149 (18%) died. Unbiased comparisons of all clinical characteristics and mortality revealed that abnormal pH (OR 8.54, 95% CI 5.34-13.6), abnormal creatinine (OR 6.94, 95% CI 4.22-11.4), and abnormal PTT (OR 4.78, 95% CI 3.11-7.33) were most significantly associated with mortality.

225827,The effectiveness and safety of traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of children with COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The progression of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant changes in the environment for outpatient and inpatient care in ophthalmology, with limitations on access to medical care but also new observations and challenges. We now describe major developments in recent months and provide an outlook on the expected consequences. METHODS: PubMed literature search, clinical survey. RESULTS: To date, the course of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by several new but overall rare ocular manifestations, the ophthalmological shared management of COVID-19 patients on intensive care units, and a significant decrease in case numbers, associated with an increase in case severity and relative proportion of emergencies, as a result of delayed presentation of patients and reduced treatment adherence. With the introduction of hygiene measures and infection control procedures, ophthalmic patient care was maintained - including emergencies and urgent treatments. Due to the extensive postponement of elective surgeries, scarce therapeutic and health care professional resources, and the prioritisation of critically ill patients from other specialties, there is a reasonable likelihood that urgent treatments will be delayed as infection rates rise. CONCLUSION: Outpatient and inpatient care in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily accompanied by additional organisational or medical challenges and a decline in case volume. Although to date emergency and urgent ophthalmic treatments have been maintained, long-term persistence of pandemic conditions will require additional strategies to provide continuation of ophthalmic care at the required level.","Hattenbach, Lars-Olof; Feltgen, Nicolas; Eter, Nicole; Al-Nawaiseh, Sami; Chronopoulos, Argyrios",Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,,246
226730,470 COVID-19 Experience in New South Wales (NSW) - A Case Series,2020,"BACKGROUND: In March 2020, South Africa implemented strict nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the spread of COVID-19. Over the subsequent 5 months, NPI policies were eased in stages according to a national strategy. COVID-19 spread throughout the country heterogeneously; the disease reached rural areas by July and case numbers peaked from July to August. A second COVID-19 wave began in late 2020. Data on the impact of NPI policies on social and economic well-being and access to health care are limited. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine how rural residents in three South African provinces changed their behaviors during the first COVID-19 epidemic wave. METHODS: The South African Population Research Infrastructure Network nodes in the Mpumalanga (Agincourt), KwaZulu-Natal, (Africa Health Research Institute) and Limpopo (Dikgale-Mamabolo-Mothiba) provinces conducted up to 14 rounds of longitudinal telephone surveys among randomly sampled households from rural and periurban surveillance populations every 2-3 weeks. Interviews included questions on the following topics: COVID-19-related knowledge and behaviors, the health and economic impacts of NPIs, and mental health. We analyzed how responses varied based on NPI stringency and household sociodemographics. RESULTS: In total, 5120 households completed 23,095 interviews between April and December 2020. Respondents' self-reported satisfaction with their COVID-19-related knowledge and face mask use rapidly rose to 85% and 95%, respectively, by August. As selected NPIs were eased, the amount of travel increased, economic losses were reduced, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms fell. When the number of COVID-19 cases spiked at one node in July, the amount of travel dropped rapidly and the rate of missed daily medications doubled. Households where more adults received government-funded old-age pensions reported concerns about economic matters and medication access less often. CONCLUSIONS: South Africans complied with stringent, COVID-19-related NPIs despite the threat of substantial social, economic, and health repercussions. Government-supported social welfare programs appeared to buffer interruptions in income and health care access during local outbreaks. Epidemic control policies must be balanced against the broader well-being of people in resource-limited settings and designed with parallel support systems when such policies threaten peoples' income and access to basic services.","Harling, Guy; Gómez-Olivé, Francesc Xavier; Tlouyamma, Joseph; Mutevedzi, Tinofa; Kabudula, Chodziwadziwa Whiteson; Mahlako, Ruth; Singh, Urisha; Ohene-Kwofie, Daniel; Buckland, Rose; Ndagurwa, Pedzisai; Gareta, Dickman; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Wong, Emily B; Kahn, Kathleen; Siedner, Mark J; Maimela, Eric; Tollman, Stephen; Collinson, Mark; Herbst, Kobus",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,246
227012,Endothelin receptor antagonists for pulmonary arterial hypertension and COVID-19: Friend or foe?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: A hypercoagulable condition was described in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and proposed as a possible pathogenic mechanism contributing to disease progression and lethality. AIM: We evaluated if in-hospital administration of heparin improved survival in a large cohort of Italian COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In a retrospective observational study, 2,574 unselected patients hospitalized in 30 clinical centers in Italy from February 19, 2020 to June 5, 2020 with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection were analyzed. The primary endpoint in a time-to event analysis was in-hospital death, comparing patients who received heparin (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin [UFH]) with patients who did not. We used multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression models with inverse probability for treatment weighting by propensity scores. RESULTS: Out of 2,574 COVID-19 patients, 70.1% received heparin. LMWH was largely the most used formulation (99.5%). Death rates for patients receiving heparin or not were 7.4 and 14.0 per 1,000 person-days, respectively. After adjustment for propensity scores, we found a 40% lower risk of death in patients receiving heparin (hazard ratio = 0.60; 95% confidence interval: 0.49-0.74; E-value = 2.04). This association was particularly evident in patients with a higher severity of disease or strong coagulation activation. CONCLUSION: In-hospital heparin treatment was associated with a lower mortality, particularly in severely ill COVID-19 patients and in those with strong coagulation activation. The results from randomized clinical trials are eagerly awaited to provide clear-cut recommendations.","Di Castelnuovo, Augusto; Costanzo, Simona; Antinori, Andrea; Berselli, Nausicaa; Blandi, Lorenzo; Bonaccio, Marialaura; Cauda, Roberto; Guaraldi, Giovanni; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Mennuni, Marco; Parruti, Giustino; Patti, Giuseppe; Santilli, Francesca; Signorelli, Carlo; Vergori, Alessandra; Abete, Pasquale; Ageno, Walter; Agodi, Antonella; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Aiello, Luca; Al Moghazi, Samir; Arboretti, Rosa; Astuto, Marinella; Aucella, Filippo; Barbieri, Greta; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Bonfanti, Paolo; Cacciatore, Francesco; Caiano, Lucia; Carrozzi, Laura; Cascio, Antonio; Ciccullo, Arturo; Cingolani, Antonella; Cipollone, Francesco; Colomba, Claudia; Colombo, Crizia; Crosta, Francesca; Danzi, Gian Battista; D039,; Ardes, Damiano; de Gaetano Donati, Katleen; Di Gennaro, Francesco; Di Tano, Giuseppe; Offizi, Gianpiero; Fantoni, Massimo; Fusco, Francesco Maria; Gentile, Ivan; Gianfagna, Francesco; Grandone, Elvira; Graziani, Emauele; Grisafi, Leonardo",Thromb. haemost,,246

229990,Increased B-cell activity with consumption of activated monocytes in severe COVID-19 patients,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate the computed tomography (CT) characteristics and diagnostic value of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP or COVID-19) in pregnancy. METHODS: This study included ten pregnant women infected with COVID-19, treated in the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University from January 20, 2020 to February 6, 2020. Clinical and chest CT data were collected and clinical symptoms, laboratory indicators, and CT images were analyzed to explore CT characteristics and diagnostic value for COVID-19 during pregnancy. RESULTS: Laboratory examination showed that white blood cell count was normal in nine patients, and slightly higher in one patient (10.23 × 109). The lymphocyte ratio decreased in two patients by 12% and 14%, respectively. The levels of C-reactive protein was elevated in seven patients (range, 21.16-60.3 mg/L) and the levels of D-dimer was increased in eight patients (range, 507-2141 ng/mL). Six patients had low levels of total protein (range, 35.3-56.5 mg/L). Two patients showed small patchy ground glass opacity (GGO) involving single lung, while eight patients showed multilobe GGO in both the lungs, with partial consolidation. Peripheral and non-peripheral lesion distributions were seen in ten (100%) and four (40%) patients, respectively. There were four patients who had signs of intra-bronchial air-bronchogram, six patients had small bilateral pleural effusions, while none had lymphadenopathy. Dynamic observations were performed in four patients after COVID-19 treatment. Among these four patients, one patient showed normal on the initial examination, and new lesions were observed after 3 days; 1 patient showed progression after 7 days of treatment, with expansion of the lesion area; and the other 2 patients showed improvement after 14 days of treatment, with reduction in the density and area of lesions and appearance of linear opacity. CONCLUSIONS: The CT characteristics of COVID-19 in pregnancy were mainly observed in early and progressive stages, and multiple new lesions were common. And there were consolidations of varying sizes and degrees within the lesion. Moreover, the original ground glass lesions could be fused or partially absorbed. Six patients had small bilateral pleural effusion. In summary, CT scans can play an important role in early screening, dynamic observation, and efficacy evaluation of suspected or confirmed cases of pregnant women with COVID-19.","Gong, XiaoMing; Song, Lu; Li, Hang; Li, Li; Jin, Wei; Yu, KaiHu; Zhang, Xiaochun; Li, Hongjun; Ke, HengNing; Lu, ZhiYan",PLoS One,,246
229991,Increased B-cell activity with consumption of activated monocytes in severe COVID-19 patients,2021,"Countries highly exposed to incoming traffic from China were expected to be at the highest risk of COVID-19 spread. However, COVID-19 case numbers (infection levels) are negatively correlated with incoming traffic-level. Moreover, infection levels are positively correlated with population-size, while the latter should only affect infection-level once herd immunity is reached. These could be explained if a low-virulence strain (LVS) began spreading a few months earlier from China, providing immunity from the later emerging known SARS-CoV-2 high-virulence strain (HVS). We find that the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic depend on the LVS and HVS spread doubling-times and the delay between their initial onsets. We find that LVS doubling-time to be $T_L\sim1.59\pm0.17$ times slower than the HVS ($T_H$), but its earlier onset allowed its global wide-spread to the levels required for herd-immunity. In countries exposed earlier to the LVS and/or having smaller population-size, the LVS achieved herd-immunity earlier, allowing less time for the spread of the HVS, and giving rise to lower HVS-infection levels. Such model accurately predicts a country's infection-level ({\rm R^{2}=0.74}; p-value of {\rm 5.2\times10^{-13}}), given only its population-size and incoming-traffic from China. It explains the negative correlation with incoming-traffic ($c_{exp}$), the positive correlation with the population size (n_{pop}) and their specific relations (${\rm N}_{{\rm cases}}\propto n_{pop}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}}}}\times c_{exp}^{{\rm T_{L}/{\rm T_{H}-1}}}$). We find that most countries should have already achieved herd-immunity. Further COVID-19-spread in these countries is limited and is not expected to rise by more than a factor of 2-3. We suggest tests/predictions to further verify the model and biologically identify the LVS, and discuss the implications.","Perets, Hagai B.; Perets, Ruth",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.07154v1.pdf,246
230206,The assessment of the relationship between abo blood groups and COVID-19 infection,2020,"The correct identification of change-points during ongoing outbreak investigations of infectious diseases is a matter of paramount importance in epidemiology, with major implications for the management of health care resources, public health and, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown, social live. Onsets, peaks, and inflexion points are some of them. An onset is the moment when the epidemic starts. A ""peak"" indicates a moment at which the incorporated values, both before and after, are lower: a maximum. The inflexion points identify moments in which the rate of growth of the incorporation of new cases changes intensity. In this study, after interpreting the concept of elasticity of a random variable in an innovative way, we propose using it as a new simpler tool for anticipating epidemic remission change-points. In particular, we propose that the ""remission point of change"" will occur just at the instant when the speed in the accumulation of new cases is lower than the average speed of accumulation of cases up to that moment. This gives stability and robustness to the estimation in the event of possible remission variations. This descriptive measure, which is very easy to calculate and interpret, is revealed as informative and adequate, has the advantage of being distribution-free and can be estimated in real time, while the data is being collected. We use the 2014-2016 Western Africa Ebola virus epidemic to demonstrate this new approach. A couple of examples analyzing COVID-19 data are also included.","Veres-Ferrer, Ernesto J; Pavía, Jose M",Stat. med,,246

Outlines of the torso in the frontal and anteroposterior planes were calculated from photographic images to determine continuous form gradients (m/m) for the anterior, posterior and lateral aspects of the torso. Torso cross-sectional areas at each vertical sample (0.001 m) were used to calculate maximal rate of change in cross-sectional area (m2/m) in the chest-waist and waist-hip segments. During the non-propulsive hand phase in middle-long distance front crawl, kicking propulsion is negligible and therefore the net force is equal to the drag. Drag coefficients were calculated at the instant of maximum horizontal deceleration of centre of mass during the non-propulsive hand phase of 400 m pace front crawl. Maximal rate of change in cross-sectional area (r = 0.44, p = 0.014) and posterior form gradient (r = 0.50, p = 0.006) of the waist-hip torso segment had moderate positive correlations with the maximal drag coefficient. A regression model including these variables explained 41% of the variance (p = 0.001). Indentation at the waist and curvature of the buttocks may result in greater drag force and influence swimming performance.","Papic, Christopher; McCabe, Carla; Gonjo, Tomohiro; Sanders, Ross",Sports Biomech,,246

233011,Convalescent Plasma and COVID-19,2020,"Background: International and UK data suggest that Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups are at increased risk of infection and death from COVID-19. We aimed to explore the risk of death in minority ethnic groups in England using data reported by NHS England. Methods: We used NHS data on patients with a positive COVID-19 test who died in hospitals in England published on 28th April, with deaths by ethnicity available from 1st March 2020 up to 5pm on 21 April 2020. We undertook indirect standardisation of these data (using the whole population of England as the reference) to produce ethnic specific standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) adjusted for age and geographical region. Results: The largest total number of deaths in minority ethnic groups were Indian (492 deaths) and Black Caribbean (460 deaths) groups. Adjusting for region we found a lower risk of death for White Irish (SMR 0.52; 95%CIs 0.45-0.60) and White British ethnic groups (0.88; 95%CIs 0.86-0.0.89), but increased risk of death for Black African (3.24; 95%CIs 2.90-3.62), Black Caribbean (2.21; 95%CIs 2.02-2.41), Pakistani (3.29; 95%CIs 2.96-3.64), Bangladeshi (2.41; 95%CIs 1.98-2.91) and Indian (1.70; 95%CIs 1.56-1.85) minority ethnic groups. Conclusion: Our analysis adds to the evidence that BAME people are at increased risk of death from COVID-19 even after adjusting for geographical region, but was limited by the lack of data on deaths outside of NHS settings and ethnicity denominator data being based on the 2011 census. Despite these limitations, we believe there is an urgent need to take action to reduce the risk of death for BAME groups and better understand why some ethnic groups experience greater risk. Actions that are likely to reduce these inequities include ensuring adequate income protection, reducing occupational risks, reducing barriers in accessing healthcare and providing culturally and linguistically appropriate public health communications.","Aldridge, Robert W; Lewer, Dan; Katikireddi, Srinivasa Vittal; Mathur, Rohini; Pathak, Neha; Burns, Rachel; Fragaszy, Ellen B; Johnson, Anne M; Devakumar, Delan; Abubakar, Ibrahim; Hayward, Andrew",Wellcome Open Res,,246

Avaliaram-se dez anos de registros oficiais de condenação em um abatedouro sob inspeção federal no Estado de São Paulo, obtendo-se informações a respeito de 24 causas de apreensão. Análises de tendência, sazonalidade e de componente cíclico foram efetuadas para 21 variáveis. Isto é discutido frente às dificuldades na obtenção sistemática e fidedigna de dados, propondo-se a utilização de programas informatizados para análise dos registros mensais em tempo real, o que possibilita a reavaliação dos programas de controle para as enfermidades desencadeantes das apreensões. Abordaram-se aspectos legislativos da inspeção de aves, enfocando limitações internacionais e particularidades de alguns processos patológicos, sugerindo adequação em determinados procedimentos sanitários. Destacou-se a comparação de dados locais com apreensões de vários países e o impacto interpretativo de diferentes metodologias de análise na concepção das ocorrências. As avaliações permitiram concluir que abordagens informatizadas para sazonalidade e ciclicidade nas séries temporais de apreensões podem incrementar o poder da verificação de programas HACCP.

234297,Nutritional and Gastroenterological Monitoring of Patients With Celiac Disease During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Emerging Role of Telemedicine and Point-of-Care Gluten Detection Tests,2021,"During the COVID-19 pandemic, despite many widespread calls for social distancing, recommendations have not been followed by some people and the high rate of non-compliance has significantly affected lives all around the world. It seems that the rate of non-compliance with the recommendations among medical students has been as high as the rest of the other youth. In the time that students are removed from clinical environments and most physician teachers are strained in providing services to patients, medical students can be trained in interdisciplinary behavior change counseling programs and they can be employed in delivering virtual consultations to the patients referred to medical centers.In this quick review, we provide an argument regarding the importance of integrating the topic of patients' social history into the undergraduate medical curriculum and the necessity of teaching theories of behavior change to medical students. Hypotheses are proposed that focus on the importance of integrating behavioral and social sciences into the medical curriculum and to teach theories or models of behavior change to students. Health professions educators can design and implement interventions to teach hypothesized models of behavioral change to medical students and evaluate the effectiveness of those interventions. The impacts of such educational interventions on increasing people's compliance with recommendations to improve public health can be evaluated as well.","McKinley, Danette Waller; Ghaffarifar, Saeideh",BMC Med Educ,,246

METHODS: Genotyping 2066 CL cases and 2046 controls using Illumina HumanCoreExomeBeadChips provided data for 4,498,586 imputed single nucleotide variants (SNVs). Genome-wide association testing using linear mixed models took account of genetic diversity/ethnicity/admixture. Post-GWAS positional, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL), and chromatin interaction mapping was performed in FUMA. Transcriptional data were compared between lesions and normal skin, and cytokines measured using flow cytometry and Bioplex assay. RESULTS: Positional mapping identified 32 genomic loci associated with CL, none achieving genome-wide significance (P&5x10 -8). Lead SNVs at 23 loci occurred at protein coding or non-coding RNA genes, 15 with eQTLs for functionally relevant cells/tissues and/or showed differential expression in lesions. Of these, the 6 most plausible genetic risk loci were: SERPINB10 (Pimputed_1000G=2.67x10 -6), CRLF3 (Pimputed_1000G=5.12x10 -6), STX7 (Pimputed_1000G=6.06x10 -6), KRT80 (Pimputed_1000G=6.58x10 -6), LAMP3 (Pimputed_1000G=6.54x10 -6) and IFNG-AS1 (Pimputed_1000G=1.32x10 -5). LAMP3 (Padjusted=9.25x10 -12; +6-fold), STX7 (Padjusted=7.62x10 -3; +1.3-fold) and CRLF3 (Padjusted=9.19x10 -9; +1.97-fold) were expressed more highly in CL biopsies compared to normal skin; KRT80 (Padjusted=3.07x10 -8; -3-fold) was lower. Multiple cis-eQTLs across SERPINB10 mapped to chromatin interaction regions of transcriptional/enhancer activity in neutrophils, monocytes, B cells and haematopoietic stem cells. Those at IFNG-AS1 mapped to transcriptional/enhancer regions in T, natural killer, and B cells. The percent peripheral blood CD3 + T cells making antigen-specific interferon-Î³ differed significantly by IFNG-AS1 genotype. CONCLUSIONS: This first GWAS for CL identified multiple genetic risk loci including a novel lead to understanding CL pathogenesis through regulation of interferon-Î³ by IFNG antisense RNA 1.","Castellucci, Léa C; Almeida, Lucas; Cherlin, Svetlana; Fakiola, Michaela; Francis, Richard W; Carvalho, Edgar M; Santos da Hora, Anadílton; do Lago, Tainã Souza; Figueiredo, Amanda B; Cavalcanti, Clara M; Alves, Natalia S; Morais, Katia L P; Teixeira-Carvalho, Andréa; Dutra, Walderez O; Gollob, Kenneth J; Cordell, Heather J; Blackwell, Jenefer M",Clin. infect. dis,,246

In a large multinational cohort of consecutive COVID-19 patients with stroke, we evaluated clinical predictors of cryptogenic stroke, short-term functional outcomes and in-hospital mortality among patients according to stroke etiology. Methods: We explored clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes of consecutively evaluated patients 18 years of age or older with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and laboratory-confirmed COVID- 19 from 31 hospitals in 4 countries (3/1/20-6/16/20). Results: Of the 14.483 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19, 156 (1.1%) were diagnosed with AIS. Sixty-one (39.4%) were female, 84 (67.2%) white, and 88 (61.5%) were between 60-79 years of age. The most frequently reported etiology of AIS was cryptogenic (55/129, 42.6%), which was associated with significantly higher white blood cell count, c-reactive protein, and D-dimer levels than non-cryptogenic AIS patients (p&lt;/=0.05 for all comparisons). In a multivariable backward stepwise regression model estimating the odds of in-hospital mortality, cryptogenic stroke mechanism was associated with a fivefold greater odds in-hospital mortality than strokes due to any other mechanism (adjusted OR 5.16, 95%CI 1.41-18.87, p=0.01). In that model, older age (aOR2.05 per decade, 95%CI 1.35-3.11, p&lt;0.01) and higher baseline NIHSS (aOR 1.12, 95%CI 1.02-1.21, p=0.01) were also independently predictive of mortality. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that cryptogenic stroke among COVID-19 patients may berelated to more severe disease and carries a significant risk of early mortality.","Ramos-Araque, M.

This essay, written in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 vigilante anti-democratic white supremacist assault on the US Capitol, calls attention to the two-edged sword of data at play, reflecting long histories of support for and opposition to white supremacy and scientific racism. As illustrated by both past and present examples, including COVID-19, at issue are both the non-use (Edge #1) and problematic use (Edge #2) of data on racialized groups. Recognizing that structural problems require structural solutions, in this essay I propose a new two-part institutional mandate regarding the reporting and analysis of publicly-funded work involving racialized groups and health data and documentation as to why the proposed mandates are feasible. Proposal/part 1 is to implement enforceable requirements that all US health data sets and research projects supported by government funds must explicitly explain and justify their conceptualization of racialized groups and the metrics used to categorize them. Proposal/part 2 is that any individual-level health data by membership in racialized groups must also be analyzed in relation to relevant data about racialized societal inequities. A new opportunity arises as US government agencies re-engage with their work, out of the shadow of white grievance politics cast by the Trump Administration, to move forward with this structural proposal to aid the work for health equity.","Krieger, Nancy",Front Public Health,,246

The aim of this study was to assess the possible roles of Jordanian pharmacists in minimizing the stage of community transmission. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey using Google forms targeting Jordanian pharmacists was conducted during March 2020 and distributed electronically by means of social media. Using the survey tool, we measured the pharmacists' knowledge, the educative activities they perform, and their perceptions regarding undertaking traditional and untraditional roles during the COVID-19 outbreak, as specified by the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP). Collected data were analyzed using SPSS version-19. RESULTS: Jordanian pharmacists (n = 449) reported performing various educative activities, and in general, they were knowledgeable about various aspects of the COVID-19 disease (median knowledge score: 20 [range, 13-25]), but certain gaps in knowledge were detected that must be addressed. Pharmacists had positive perceptions about both their traditional and untraditional roles specified by the FIP, the median perceptions score was 4 (range, 1-5). CONCLUSIONS: Jordanian pharmacists can be used to reduce community transmission of the outbreak. However, more actions are required to keep pharmacists knowledgeable with recent disease updates to enable them to perform their tasks effectively during times of crisis.","Abdel Jalil, Mariam; Alsous, Mervat M; Abu Hammour, Khawla; Saleh, Mais M; Mousa, Rimal; Hammad, Eman A",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,246

245251,Unusual case of acute cerebral infarction due to large proximal ICA floating thrombus in the setting of severe COVID-19 infection,2021,"Considering the issues of shortage of medical resources and the invasiveness and infection risk involved in the collection of nasopharyngeal swab specimens, there is a need for an effective alternative test specimen for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection. Here, we investigated suitability of saliva as a non-invasively obtained specimen for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in Japanese patients with COVID-19. In total, 28 paired clinical specimens of saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 12 patients at various time points after symptom onset. Each specimen was assayed using reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on the BD MAX open system using primers and probes targeting the N-gene. The saliva and nasopharyngeal swab specimens showed 19 and 15 positive results, respectively. No invalid (PCR inhibition) result was observed for any specimen. The qualitative results of each specimen obtained in the period immediately after symptom onset were similar. Three convalescent patients presented saliva-positive results, whereas their nasopharyngeal swabs were negative at four different time points, suggesting that saliva may be superior to nasopharyngeal swabs in terms of obtaining stable assay result of SARS-CoV-2. In conclusion, our results suggest that saliva can potentially serve as an alternative to nasopharyngeal swabs as a specimen for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR. As saliva can be collected by patients themselves, it may be an effective way to overcome the shortage of personal protective equipment and specimen sampling tools.","Sakanashi, Daisuke; Asai, Nobuhiro; Nakamura, Akiko; Miyazaki, Narimi; Kawamoto, Yuzuka; Ohno, Tomoko; Yamada, Atsuko; Koita, Isao; Suematsu, Hiroyuki; Hagihara, Mao; Shiota, Arufumi; Kurumiya, Ai; Sakata, Miki; Kato, Syunji; Muramatsu, Yuki; Koizumi, Yusuke; Kishino, Takaaki; Ohashi, Wataru; Yamagishi, Yuka; Mikamo, Hiroshige",J Infect Chemother,,246

248518,Coronary Cannulation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: The RE-ACCESS Study,2020,"We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as $50\times$, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate $R(t)$ is $0.20$. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing.","Shen, Chen; Mark, Ron; Kagetsu, Nolan J.; Becker, Anton S.; Bar-Yam, Yaneer",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.02140v1.pdf,246

Lower RTIs along with influenza, are the most common cause of death by infection. The fatality risk is doubled if the person is with other morbid conditions or in extremes of age. These seasonal respiratory infections caused by viruses are of more concern as their spread is very vast than we imagine. COVID-19 (corona virus disease 2019) is such a pandemic respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a strain of Corona virus. The emerging anti-microbial resistance and easy spread of respiratory pathogens has also increased the challenge for appropriate management of RTI like COVID-19. Drugs with anti-viral property and potency to prevent the co-morbidity stand are the need of the hour. This review article includes information on preclinical studies and clinical studies to add a scientific validation to formulations that are commonly used in Siddha system of Medicine. The ingredients of the Siddha drugs possessing anti-viral property and immune-modulatory effect particularly against respiratory pathogens are elaborated. Evidence of anti-viral property has been made out to the light for further clinical trials. © 2021, Informatics Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.","Radha, S.; Rajalakshmi, S.

250684,Evaluation of the economic effect of biological therapy in patients with severe COVID-19 and cytokine storm,2020,"BACKGROUND: Despite the proven value of multicriteria decision analysis in the health field, there is a lack of studies focused on prioritising victims in the Emergency Medical Service, EMS. With this, and knowing that the decision maker needs a direction on which choice may be the most appropriate, based on different and often conflicting criteria. The current work developed a new model for prioritizing victims of SAMU/192, based on the multicriteria decision methodology, taking into account the scarcity of resources. METHODS: An expert panel and a discussion group were formed, which defined the limits of the problem, and identified the evaluation criteria for choosing a victim, amongst four alternatives illustrated from hypothetical scenarios of emergency situations-clinical and traumatic diseases of absolute priority. For prioritization, an additive mathematical method was used that aggregates criteria in a flexible and interactive version, FITradeoff. RESULTS: The structuring of the problem led the researchers to identify twenty-five evaluation criteria, amongst which ten were essential to guide decisions. As a result, in the simulation of prioritization of four requesting victims in view of the availability of only one ambulance, the proposed model supported the decision by suggesting the prioritization of one of the victims. CONCLUSIONS: This work contributed to the prioritization of victims using multicriteria decision support methodology. Selecting and weighing the criteria in this study indicated that the protocols that guide regulatory physicians do not consider all the criteria for prioritizing victims in an environment of scarcity of resources. Finally, the proposed model can support crucial decision based on a rational and transparent decision-making process that can be applied in other EMS.","Frazão, Talita D C; Santos, Ana F A Dos; Camilo, Deyse G G; da Costa Júnior, João Florêncio; de Souza, Ricardo P",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,246
250765,COVID-19 in patients with chronic hepatitis c receiving daa therapy: Initial experience from a longitudinal survey,2020,"The recent epidemic of the new SARS-CoV-2 in the northern regions of Italy is putting the organization of the Italian health system under serious attack. The current emergency requires all possible efforts to stem the spread of the virus. In this context, it is clear that we have the urgent need to rely upon etiopathogenetic data, in order to do all possible efforts to block the epidemic. However, observing the trend of the infections in China and the geographic areas of the main outbreaks, it could be hypothesized that air pollution plays a role. In particular, it has been previously demonstrated, in specific populations, a role of particulate matter in worsening clinical presentation of virus infection in airways. Without prejudice to the ascertained virus spread by air droplets or contaminated surfaces, the factors that could have favored its spread remain to be investigated. Moreover, if these observations were to be confirmed, when the health emergency is resolved, it will be mandatory to redesign an economic-productive model in balance with the environment.","Sciomer, Susanna; Moscucci, Federica; Magrì, Damiano; Badagliacca, Roberto; Piccirillo, Gianfranco; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe",Environ Monit Assess,,246
250902,"Often forgotten, transport modality to dialysis may be life-saving",2020,"BACKGROUND: In the current COVID-19 pandemic there is mass screening of SARS-CoV-2 happening round the world due to the extensive spread of the infections. There is a high demand for rapid diagnostic tests to expedite identification of cases and to facilitate early isolation and control spread. Hence this study evaluates six different rapid nucleic acid detection assays that are commercially available for SARS- CoV- 2 virus detection. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 4981 participants and were tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus by the gold standard RT-PCR method and with one of these six rapid methods of detection. Evaluation of the rapid nucleic acid detection assays was done by comparing the results of these rapid methods with the gold standard RT-qPCR results for SARS-COV-2 detection. RESULTS: AQ-TOP had the highest sensitivity (98%) and strong kappa value of 0.943 followed by Genechecker and Abbot ID NOW. The POCKIT (ii RT-PCR) assay had the highest test accuracy of 99.29% followed by Genechecker and Cobas Liat. Atila iAMP showed the highest percentage of invalid reports (35.5%) followed by AQ-TOP with 6% and POCKIT with 3.7% of invalid reports. CONCLUSION: Genechecker system, Abbott ID NOW and Cobas Liat, were found to have best performance and agreement when compared to the standard RT-PCR for COVID-19 detection. With further research, these rapid tests have the potential to be employed in large scale screening of COVID-19. This article is protected by copyright.

Case series and mechanistic data,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To report outcomes on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and related disorders with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) illness. METHODS: From March 16 to April 30, 2020, patients with MS or related disorders at NYU Langone MS Comprehensive Care Center were identified with laboratory-confirmed or suspected COVID-19. The diagnosis was established using a standardized questionnaire or by review of in-patient hospital records. RESULTS: We identified 76 patients (55 with relapsing MS, of which 9 had pediatric onset; 17 with progressive MS; and 4 with related disorders). Thirty-seven underwent PCR testing and were confirmed positive. Of the entire group, 64 (84%) patients were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) including anti-CD20 therapies (n = 34, 44.7%) and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulators (n = 10, 13.5%). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were fever and cough, but 21.1% of patients had neurologic symptom recrudescence preceding or coinciding with the infection. A total of 18 (23.7%) were hospitalized; 8 (10.5%) had COVID-19 critical illness or related death. Features more common among those hospitalized or with critical illness or death were older age, presence of comorbidities, progressive disease, and a nonambulatory status. No DMT class was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization or fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with MS with COVID-19 do not require hospitalization despite being on DMTs. Factors associated with critical illness were similar to the general at-risk patient population. DMT use did not emerge as a predictor of poor COVID-19 outcome in this preliminary sample.","Parrotta, Erica; Kister, Ilya; Charvet, Leigh; Sammarco, Carrie; Saha, Valerie; Charlson, Robert Erik; Howard, Jonathan; Gutman, Josef Maxwell; Gottesman, Malcolm; Abou-Fayssal, Nada; Wolintz, Robyn; Keilson, Marshall; Fernandez-Carbonell, Cristina; Krupp, Lauren B; Zhovtis Ryerson, Lana",,,246

Here an attempt has been made to trace the number of notified Pediatric TB cases during and after COVID-19 lockdown and unlock period, and then compared with the same period of previous year. The epidemic data on notified pediatric TB cases for 2019 and 2020 were extracted from the Health Management Information System (HMIS) database. The absolute numbers of monthly pediatric TB notifications from January to September for the year 2020 were compared to 2019, and the percentage decrease was estimated. The HMIS data shows that there is a significant decrease in pediatric TB notifications during COVID-19 epidemic in India. Especially, when the lockdown and related restrictions in response to COVID-19 was imposed, notifications were significantly decreased compared to the same period during the previous year. Even, the reduction numbers of pediatric TB notifications during post-lockdown are still more worrying. Though, little improvements were observed suddenly after lockdown was removed, but then-after again consisted decrease was reported;and these numbers again substantially lower than the numbers of previous year.

254946,Potential Role of Xylitol Plus Grapefruit Seed Extract Nasal Spray Solution in COVID-19: Case Series,2020,"Trypsin-like proteases (TLPs) belong to a family of serine enzymes with primary substrate specificities for the basic residues, lysine and arginine, in the P1 position. Whilst initially perceived as soluble enzymes that are extracellularly secreted, a number of novel TLPs that are anchored in the cell membrane have since been discovered. Muco-obstructive lung diseases (MucOLDs) are characterised by the accumulation of hyper-concentrated mucus in the small airways, leading to persistent inflammation, infection and dysregulated protease activity. Although neutrophilic serine proteases, particularly neutrophil elastase, have been implicated in the propagation of inflammation and local tissue destruction, it is likely that the serine TLPs also contribute to various disease-relevant processes given the roles that a number of these enzymes play in the activation of both the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2). More recently, significant attention has focused on the activation of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 by host TLPs. The purpose of this review was to highlight key TLPs linked to the activation of ENaC and PAR2 and their association with airway dehydration and inflammatory signalling pathways, respectively. The role of TLPs in viral infectivity will also be discussed in the context of the inhibition of TLP activities and the potential of these proteases as therapeutic targets.","Carroll, Emma L; Bailo, Mariarca; Reihill, James A; Crilly, Anne; Lockhart, John C; Litherland, Gary J; Lundy, Fionnuala T; McGarvey, Lorcan P; Hollywood, Mark A; Martin, S Lorraine",Int. j. mol. sci.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate temporal changes of quantitative CT findings in patients with COVID-19 in three clinic types, including moderate, severe, and non-survivors, and to predict severe cases in the early stage from the results. METHODS: One hundred and two patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included in this study. Based on the time interval between onset of symptoms and the CT scan, four stages were defined in this study: Stage-1 (0 â¼7 days); Stage-2 (8 â¼ 14 days); Stage-3 (15 â¼ 21days); Stage-4 (> 21 days). Eight parameters, the infection volume and percentage of the whole lung in four different Hounsfield (HU) ranges, ((-, -750), [-750, -300), [-300, 50) and [50, +)), were calculated and compared between different groups. RESULTS: The infection volume and percentage of four HU ranges peaked in Stage-2. The highest proportion of HU [-750, 50) was found in the infected regions in non-survivors among three groups. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate rapid deterioration in the first week since the onset of symptoms in non-survivors. Higher proportion of HU [-750, 50) in the lesion area might be a potential bio-marker for poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19.","Chen, Xiaohui; Sun, Wenbo; Xu, Dan; Ma, Jiaojiao; Xiao, Feng; Xu, Haibo",Technol Health Care,,246

A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic led to an emergency scenario within all aspects of health care, determining reduction in resources for the treatment of other diseases. A literature review was conducted to identify published evidence, from 1 March to 1 June 2020, regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the care provided to patients affected by other diseases. The research is limited to the Italian NHS. The aim is to provide a snapshot of the COVID-19 impact on the NHS and collect useful elements to improve Italian response models. Data available for oncology and cardiology are reported. National surveys, retrospective analyses, and single-hospital evidence are available. We summarized evidence, keeping in mind the entire clinical pathway, from clinical need to access to care to outcomes. Since the beginning, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a reduced access to inpatient (-48% for IMA) and outpatient services, with a lower volume of elective surgical procedures (in oncology, from 3.8 to 2.6 median number of procedures/week). Telehealth may plays a key role in this, particularly in oncology. While, for cardiology, evidence on health outcome is already available, in terms of increased fatality rates (for STEMI: 13.7 vs. 4.1%). To better understand the impact of COVID-19 on the health of the population, a broader perspective should be taken. Reasons for reduced access to care must be investigated. Patients fears, misleading communication campaigns, re-arranged clinical pathways could had played a role.

It is intended to improve patient understanding of medicines and resolve adherence issues. Objective To explore MedsCheck from the community pharmacists' perspective, focusing on the perceived effectiveness of the program, barriers to its optimal delivery, and the integration with other services. Setting Individual interviews in one territory and a national online survey of Australian community pharmacists. Method Using a mixed-method triangulation design, the interviews and the survey were conducted concurrently. The interviews were semi-structured, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. The survey, comprising closed and open-ended questions, was quantitatively and thematically analysed. The findings were first analysed separately and finally integrated by searching for convergence, complementarity, and discrepancy. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' perceptions of the effectiveness and barriers of MedsCheck. Results Eight interviews were conducted, and 232 survey responses collected. In the interviews, themes related to perceived benefits (appreciation, reduced confusion, and strengthening relationships), barriers (lack of controls, lack of staff, lack of awareness, and lack of understanding of scope of services), and the integration with other services (strong link with dose administration aids) emerged, which mostly correlated with the survey's results. Ten percent of surveyed respondents did not provide the MedsCheck service; their main reason being insufficient staffing. Of the pharmacists offering the service, 76% strongly agreed that patients were benefitting. MedsCheck reviews were usually initiated by pharmacy staff. Fifty-three percent of respondent pharmacists never or only sometimes reported the review outcomes to the patient's general practitioner. Conclusion The pharmacists believed that MedsCheck is useful to improve patients' understanding and management of their medicines. However, there are currently barriers to the effective delivery of the service, including workload issues, lack of patient awareness, and the service's integration with the broader care of the patient. If these were appropriately addressed, the in-pharmacy medication review program could help pharmacists to better engage with patients and general practitioners and enhance understanding of medication and adherence.","Buss, Vera H; Shield, Alison; Kosari, Sam; Peterson, Gregory M; Naunton, Mark",Int. j. clin. pharm,,246

This planning phase requires not only looking into the spatiotemporal dynamics and impact of the pandemic using simulation models, but they also need to plan and ensure the availability of resources under different spread scenarios. To this end, we have developed a visual analytics environment that enables public health officials to model, simulate, and explore the spread of COVID-19 by supplying county-level information such as population, demographics, and hospital beds. This environment facilitates users to explore spatiotemporal model simulation data relevant to COVID-19 through a geospatial map with linked statistical views, apply different decision measures at different points in time, and understand their potential impact. Users can drill-down to county-level details such as the number of sicknesses, deaths, needs for hospitalization, and variations in these statistics over time. We demonstrate the usefulness of this environment through a use case study and also provide feedback from domain experts.

This has been particularly evident in tourism, one of the sectors most affected by uncoordinated mobility restrictions. The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less or more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in economic exposures to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this problem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model encompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic effects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes the individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments, including the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved in the game. By using tourism-based data, the model is enriched with actual heterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different economic cost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances cooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding parties (i.e., those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions). Furthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical simulations) that these cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each region or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the size of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games. Finally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to leverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the most relevant initial set of cooperators.","Chica, Manuel; Hernandez, Juan M.; Santos, Francisco C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00886v1.pdf,246

OBJECTIVE: Planning for the resumption of regular outpatient surgical care and preparing for future surges in COVID-19 cases requires identifying surrogate markers of health care demand. MATERIALS AND METHODS: United States national and state-based Google search data for ""Mohs surgery"" and other common elective surgical and cosmetic procedures were evaluated. These were compared with national and state-wide COVID-19 case number and death data from the Johns Hopkins University. Pearson correlation coefficients were generated to assess the association between COVID-19 cases and deaths with Google search trends. RESULTS: Search volume for ""Mohs surgery"" and other elective surgical and cosmetic procedures significantly decreased as the number of new deaths from COVID-19 increased. Statistically significant inverse correlation was noted between ""Mohs surgery"" search volume and new COVID-19 deaths on a national and state-based level. CONCLUSION: Search metric analysis may be used as part of a big data model to help predict health care demand during the reopening phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ratushny, V.; Moore, K.; Do, D.",Dermatologic Surgery,,246

National and international guidelines should consider its inclusion in their updates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mandatory social distancing and the lack of effective treatments has made telemedicine the safest interactive system between patients, both infected and uninfected, and clinicians. A few potential evidence-based scenarios for the application of telemedicine have been hypothesized. In particular, its use in diabetes and complication monitoring has been remarkably increasing, due to the high risk of poor prognosis. New evidence and technological improvements in telemedicine application in diabetic retinopathy (DR) have demonstrated efficacy and usefulness in screening. Moreover, despite an initial increase for devices and training costs, teleophthalmology demonstrated a good cost-to-efficacy ratio; however, no national screening program has yet focused on DR prevention and diagnosis. Lack of data during the COVID-19 pandemic strongly limits the possibility of tracing the real management of the disease, which is only conceivable from past evidence in normal conditions. The pandemic further stressed the importance of remote monitoring. However, the deployment of device and digital application used to increase screening of individuals and monitor progression of retinal disease needs to be easily accessible to general practitioners.","Galiero, Raffaele; Pafundi, Pia Clara; Nevola, Riccardo; Rinaldi, Luca; Acierno, Carlo; Caturano, Alfredo; Salvatore, Teresa; Adinolfi, Luigi Elio; Costagliola, Ciro; Sasso, Ferdinando Carlo",J Diabetes Res,,246

This review summarizes recently published studies that describe the clinical epidemiology and racial/ethnic disparities associated with SARS-CoV-2 in children. RECENT FINDINGS: Children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with a wide spectrum of disease. Most are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic with fever, gastrointestinal, and/or upper respiratory disease. Some children can progress to develop severe lower respiratory disease or a hyper-inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome leading to cardiovascular shock. Although SARS-CoV-2-related deaths in children are rare, more children died within the first nine months of the pandemic than have died during any influenza season over the last decade.Black and Hispanic children represent less than 41% of the US population but account for three out of every four SARS-CoV-2-related hospitalizations and deaths in the USA. The drivers of these disparities in children are complex and likely a combination of societal, biological, and behavioral influences. SUMMARY: This pandemic brought to light longstanding health disparities in historically marginalized populations, and minority children have suffered tremendously. It provides an opportunity to understand how a virus hijacked deep-rooted inequities, address these inequities, and work to prevent this outcome in future pandemics/epidemics.","Zirinsky, Elissa; Paintsil, Elijah; Oliveira, Carlos R",Curr Opin Pediatr,,246

The COVID-19 outbreak has caused immense stress and anxiety among the general public. Strict measures to counter COVID-19 emergency, including physical distancing have also taken a toll on physical and mental health. We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms of functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). METHODS: An online survey was conducted in Japan for a group of randomly assigned panelists from May 26 to 27, 2020. Each respondent answered a questionnaire on stress, physical distancing, and worries about COVID-19. Gastrointestinal symptoms were assessed to diagnose FD and IBS (Rome III), and psychological symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. RESULTS: A total of 5157 subjects were finally enrolled, with FD in 8.5%, IBS in 16.6%, and FD-IBS overlap in 4.0%. For both gastrointestinal and psychological symptoms, respondents with FD-IBS overlap showed the worst scores, followed by IBS-alone, then FD-alone respondents. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 11.9% of respondents reported deterioration and 2.8% reported improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms. FD-IBS overlap, psychological disease comorbidity, and stress at work/school were significantly associated with symptom deterioration. Younger age, commuting by public transport, and work/study from home were associated with symptom improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected FD/IBS subjects, with respondents showing FD-IBS overlap syndrome as the most important independent factor associated with deterioration in gastrointestinal symptoms. Physicians need to take extra care of FD/IBS patients in the post-COVID period.","Oshima, Tadayuki; Siah, Kewin Tien Ho; Yoshimoto, Takanori; Miura, Ko; Tomita, Toshihiko; Fukui, Hirokazu; Miwa, Hiroto",J. gastroenterol. hepatol,,246

As an essential service, community pharmacies remained open to provide care and service. The unprecedented nature and scale of the pandemic triggered considerable change in daily practice. In anticipation of future pandemic waves and similar mass-scale civil disruptions, it is important to understand how community pharmacies adapted and responded in the early weeks of COVID-19. Methods: A combination of convenience, snowball and purposive sampling methods was used to recruit staff from community pharmacies across Ontario, from a variety of different practice locations and types. A semistructured focus group interview protocol was used to elicit experiences. Data gathering was undertaken until the point of saturation. Thematic analysis was used to surface common experiences and to describe how community pharmacies adapted and responded. Results: A total of 39 participants (pharmacists, registered technicians and assistants) from 11 different pharmacies participated in this study. Data were coded based on 1) what happened, 2) how community pharmacies responded, and 3) what worked and did not work to support pharmacy staff in continued provision of service and care. Key findings included the collapse of provision of nondispensing remunerated services, the central role of managerial decisions in supporting resilience (e.g., change to 8-hour shifts from 12-hour shifts) and the central role of technology in supporting continuity of quality pharmacy services. Discussion: With anticipated future pandemic waves, preparedness of community pharmacy will be essential. This study provides important insights based on participants’ own experiences regarding ways employers can better support staff in provision of care and service to patients during times of mass-scale civil disruption.

Malaria parasite-infected mice were treated with artemisinin-loaded liposomes through the interstitial space and exhibited a better therapeutic response. Notably, compared with oral administration, interstitial administration showed an unexpectedly high activation and recruitment of immune cells, and resulted in better clearance of sequestered parasites from organs, and enhanced pathological recovery.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefits and feasibility of a double triage and telemedicine protocol in improving infection control in the emergency department (ED). METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited patients aged &#8805;20 years referred to the ED of the National Taiwan University Hospital between March 1 and April 30, 2020. A double triage and telemedicine protocol was developed to triage suggested COVID-19 cases and minimize health workers' exposure to this disease. We categorized patients attending video interviews into a telemedicine group and patients experiencing face-to-face interviews into a conventional group. A questionnaire was used to assess how patients perceived the quality of the interviews and their communication with physicians as well as perceptions of stress, discrimination, and privacy. Each question was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale. Physicians' total exposure time and total evaluation time were treated as primary outcomes, and the mean scores of the questions were treated as secondary outcomes. RESULTS: The final sample included 198 patients, including 93 cases (47.0%) in the telemedicine group and 105 cases (53.0%) in the conventional group. The total exposure time in the telemedicine group was significantly shorter than that in the conventional group (4.7 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was significantly longer than that in the conventional group (12.2 minutes vs 8.9 minutes, P<.001). After controlling for potential confounders, the total exposure time in the telemedicine group was 4.6 minutes shorter than that in the conventional group (95% CI -5.7 to -3.5, P<.001), whereas the total evaluation time in the telemedicine group was 2.8 minutes longer than that in the conventional group (95% CI -1.6 to -4.0, P<.001). The mean scores of the patient questionnaire were high in both groups (4.5/5 to 4.7/5 points). CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of the double triage and telemedicine protocol in the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic has high potential to improve infection control.","Lin, Chien-Hao; Tseng, Wen-Pin; Wu, Jhong-Lin; Tay, Joyce; Cheng, Ming-Tai; Ong, Hooi-Nee; Lin, Hao-Yang; Chen, Yi-Ying; Wu, Chih-Hsien; Chen, Jiun-Wei; Chen, Shey-Ying; Chan, Chang-Chuan; Huang, Chien-Hua; Chen, Shyr-Chyr",J Med Internet Res,,246

However, the pooled rate of this deadly and frequently underdiagnosed condition among COVID-19 patients remains largely unknown. Given the frequency with which pulmonary embolism has been reported as a fatal complication of severe coronavirus disease, we sought to ascertain the actual prevalence of this event in COVID-19 patients. Using PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and SCOPUS, a thorough literature search was performed to identify the studies reporting rate of PE among COVID-19. Random effects models were obtained to perform a meta-analysis, and I 2 statistics were used to measure inter-study heterogeneity. Among 3066 COVID-19 patients included from 9 studies, the pooled prevalence of PE was 15.8% (95% CI (6.0-28.8%), I 2 = 98%). The pooled rate in younger cohort (age < 65 years) showed a higher prevalence of 20.5% (95% CI (17.6-24.8%)) as compared to studies including relatively older cohort (age > 65 years) showing 14.3% (95% CI (2.9-30.1%)) (p < 0.05). Single-center studies showed a prevalence of 12.9% (95% CI 1.0-30.2%), while that of multicenter studies was 19.5% (95% CI 14.9-25.2%) (p < 0.05). Pulmonary embolism is a common complication of severe coronavirus disease and a high degree of clinical suspicion for its diagnosis should be maintained in critically ill patients.","Desai, Rupak; Gandhi, Zainab; Singh, Sandeep; Sachdeva, Sonali; Manaktala, Pritika; Savani, Sejal; Desai, Virmitra; Sachdeva, Rajesh; Kumar, Gautam",SN Compr Clin Med,,246

Microvesicular steatosis, inflammation, vascular congestion, and thrombosis in the liver have been described in autopsy samples from COVID-19 patients. Several factors, including direct cytopathic effect of the virus, immune-mediated collateral damage, or an exacerbation of preexisting liver disease may contribute to liver pathology in COVID-19. Due to its immunological functions, the liver is an organ likely to participate in the viral response against SARS-CoV-2 and this may predispose it to injury. A better understanding of the mechanism contributing to liver injury is needed to develop and implement early measures to prevent serious liver damage in patients suffering from COVID-19. This review summarizes current reports of SARS-CoV-2 with an emphasis on how direct infection and subsequent severe inflammatory response may contribute to liver injury in patients with and without preexisting liver disease.","Lizardo-Thiebaud, Maria J; Cervantes-Alvarez, Eduardo; Limon-de la Rosa, Nathaly; Tejeda-Dominguez, Farid; Palacios-Jimenez, Mildred; Méndez-Guerrero, Osvely; Delaye-Martinez, Marco; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Fatima; Romero-Morales, Beatriz; Liu, Wei-Hui; Huang, Christene A; Kershenobich, David; Navarro-Alvarez, Nalu",Semin Liver Dis,,246

272451,Lethal outcome of Covid-19 pneumonia in a new liver recipient with neurological manifestation,2020,"The World Health Organization (WHO) considers COVID-19 a great threat to humanity and, thus, declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To limit its transmission, governments announced lockdowns in their respective nations, and recommended control measures, including behavior change. Persons with disabilities (PwDs) are among the population that may be at a higher risk of becoming infected and may suffer serious illness due to COVID-19. Additionally, lockdowns pose immense challenges and have tremendous impacts on PwDs in terms of receiving their daily support. To mitigate these challenges, their impact, and to reduce the risk of infection, it is important to design strategies that can improve the overall outcome for PwDs. This study therefore intends to provide a uniform strategy or guideline using the person-centered approach principles which is perhaps the most feasible and implementable approach to circumvent the challenges faced by PwDs during emergency lockdowns. Two case studies are used as examples. This pandemic also provides an opportunity for health care planners and policymakers in the health sector to implement reforms to ensure disability inclusiveness in potential future emergency lockdowns.","Senjam, Suraj Singh",Front Public Health,,246

OBJECTIVE: We undertook a scoping review to evaluate what is known in the literature about how cancer treatment has been modified as a result of the COVID pandemic in patients receiving treatment for solid tumours, and what domains of quality of care are most impacted. METHODS: Citations were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE (from 1 January 2019 to 28 October 2020), utilizing search terms grouped by the key concept (oncology, treatment, treatment modifications and COVID). Articles were excluded if they dealt exclusively with management of COVID-positive patients, modifications to cancer screening, diagnosis or supportive care or were not in English. Articles reporting on guidelines, consensus statements, recommendations, literature reviews, simulations or predictive models, or opinions in the absence of accompanying information on experience with treatment modifications in practice were excluded. Treatment modifications derived from the literature were stratified by modality (surgery, systemic therapy (ST) and radiotherapy) and thematically grouped. To understand what areas of quality were most impacted, modifications were mapped against the Institute of Medicine's quality domains. Where reported, barriers and facilitators were abstracted and thematically grouped to understand drivers of treatment modifications. Findings were synthesized into a logic model to conceptualize the inter-relationships between different modifications, as well as their downstream impacts on outcomes. RESULTS: In the 87 retained articles, reductions in outpatients visits (26.4%) and delays/deferrals were commonly reported across all treatment modalities (surgery: 50%; ST: 55.8% and radiotherapy: 56.7%), as were reductions in surgical capacity (57.1%), alternate systemic regimens with longer treatment intervals or use of oral agents (19.2%) and the use of hypofractionated radiotherapy regimens (40.0%). Delivery of effective, timely and equitable care was the quality domains found to be the most impacted. The most commonly reported facilitator of maintaining cancer care delivery levels was the shift to virtual models of care (62.1%), while patient-initiated deferrals and cancellations (34.8%), often due to fear of contracting COVID (60.9%), was a commonly reported barrier. CONCLUSIONS: As it will take a considerable amount of time for the cancer system to resume capacity and adjust models of care in response to the pandemic, these treatment delays and modifications will likely be prolonged and will negatively impact the quality of care and patient outcomes.","Powis, Melanie; Milley-Daigle, Carissa; Hack, Saidah; Alibhai, Shabbir; Singh, Simron; Krzyzanowska, Monika K",Int. j. qual. health care,,246

Three crises - the 9/11 attacks, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic - forced American policymakers to diverge from this paradigm. At the time, these divergences were described as temporary departures from normalcy. In retrospect, it would be more accurate to regard the millennial paradigm itself as the abnormality: as a model of governance designed for rare moments of calm. In the last two decades, a different paradigm has emerged. American government has become the ultimate bearer of societal risks. Repeatedly, it has adopted extraordinary measures to protect public safety and the economy. However, the American state lacks the capacity to anticipate and manage these massive risks competently.

They were admitted to the third people’s Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed.@*Results@#Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities.@*Conclusions@#The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific.

284331,Adenovirus-Associated Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation,2021,"The sudden outburst of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) poses a massive threat to global public health. Currently, no therapeutic drug or vaccine exists to treat COVID-19. Due to the time taking process of new drug development, drug repurposing might be the only viable solution to tackle COVID-19. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) catalyzes SARS-CoV-2 RNA replication and hence, is an obvious target for antiviral drug design. Interestingly, several plant-derived polyphenols effectively inhibit the RdRp of other RNA viruses. More importantly, polyphenols have been used as dietary supplementations for a long time and played beneficial roles in immune homeostasis. We were curious to study the binding of polyphenols with SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and assess their potential to treat COVID-19. Herein, we made a library of polyphenols that have shown substantial therapeutic effects against various diseases. They were successfully docked in the catalytic pocket of RdRp. The investigation reveals that EGCG, theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3'-O-gallate (TF2a), theaflavin-3'-gallate (TF2b), theaflavin 3,3'-digallate (TF3), hesperidin, quercetagetin, and myricetin strongly bind to the active site of RdRp. Further, a 150-ns molecular dynamic simulation revealed that EGCG, TF2a, TF2b, TF3 result in highly stable bound conformations with RdRp. The binding free energy components calculated by the MM-PBSA also confirm the stability of the complexes. We also performed a detailed analysis of ADME prediction, toxicity prediction, and target analysis for their druggability. Overall, our results suggest that EGCG, TF2a, TF2b, TF3 can inhibit RdRp and represent an effective therapy for COVID-19. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

285425,Serum KL-6 can distinguish between different phenotypes of severe COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization. DESIGN: A national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Racial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.","Cho, Hyunyi; Li, Wenbo; Cannon, Julie; Lopez, Rachel; Song, Chi Chuck",Ethn Health,,246

Purpose: To examine the impact of COVID-19 and corresponding public health measures on the characteristics of common pediatric musculoskeletal injuries associated with sports. Study Design: Cohort study;Level of evidence, 3. Methods: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study comparing patients with sports injuries presenting to 3 geographically diverse level I pediatric trauma hospitals and outpatient orthopaedic surgery clinics in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and a prepandemic period at the same institutions. Patients were included if they presented for care between February 15 and July 15 in 2020 (pandemic cohort) or between March 15 and April 15 in 2018 and 2019 (prepandemic cohort). Results: Included were 1455 patients with an average age of 12.1 ± 4.5 years. When comparing patients presenting in 2018 and 2019 with those presenting in 2020, we observed a decrease in mean age during the pandemic (12.6 ± 4.0 vs 11.0 ± 5.2 years;P =.048). Additionally, a decrease in the proportion of injuries attributed to sports (48.8% vs 33.3%;P &lt;.001) and those occurring at school (11.9% vs 4.0%;P =.001) was observed. The proportion of injuries attributable to clavicle fractures increased during the early stages of the pandemic (13.2% vs 34.7%;P &lt;.001). There was no statistically significant delay to care in injuries presenting during the pandemic (41.5 ± 141.2 vs 19.23 ± 79.1 days;P =.175). Conclusion: Across 3 tertiary care institutions, patients were seen without significant delay during the pandemic. We observed a significant decline in pediatric musculoskeletal injuries associated with sports during the COVID-19 pandemic. This decrease has been accompanied by a shift in both injury type and mechanism.","Johnson, M. A.; Halloran, K.; Carpenter, C.; Pascual-Leone, N.; Parambath, A.; Sharma, J.; Seltzer, R.; Ellis, H.

288387,Better prognosis in females with severe COVID-19 pneumonia: possible role of inflammation as potential mediator,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus confers a risk of significant coagulopathy, with the resulting development of venous thromboembolism (VTE), potentially contributing to the morbidity and mortality. The purpose of the present review was to evaluate the potential mechanisms that contribute to this increased risk of coagulopathy and the role of anticoagulants in treatment. METHODS: A literature review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and/or SARS-CoV-2 and cell-mediated inflammation, clinical coagulation abnormalities, hypercoagulability, pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, and anticoagulation was performed. The National Clinical Trials database was queried for ongoing studies of anticoagulation and/or antithrombotic treatment or the incidence or prevalence of thrombotic events in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: The reported rate of VTE among critically ill patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has been 21% to 69%. The phenomenon of breakthrough VTE, or the acute development of VTE despite adequate chemoprophylaxis or treatment dose anticoagulation, has been shown to occur with severe infection. The pathophysiology of overt hypercoagulability and the development of VTE is likely multifactorial, with evidence supporting the role of significant cell-mediated responses, including neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, endothelialitis, cytokine release syndrome, and dysregulation of fibrinolysis. Collectively, this inflammatory process contributes to the severe pulmonary pathology experienced by patients with COVID-19. As the infection worsens, extreme D-dimer elevations, significant thrombocytopenia, decreasing fibrinogen, and prolongation of prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time occur, often associated with deep vein thrombosis, in situ pulmonary thrombi, and/or pulmonary embolism. A new phenomenon, termed pulmonary intravascular coagulopathy, has been associated with morbidity in patients with severe infection. Heparin, both unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, have emerged as agents that can address the viral infection, inflammation, and thrombosis in this syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: The overwhelming inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to a hypercoagulable state, microthrombosis, large vessel thrombosis, and, ultimately, death. Early VTE prophylaxis should be provided to all admitted patients. Therapeutic anticoagulation therapy might be beneficial for critically ill patients and is the focus of 39 ongoing trials. Close monitoring for thrombotic complications is imperative, and, if confirmed, early transition from prophylactic to therapeutic anticoagulation should be instituted. The interplay between inflammation and thrombosis has been shown to be a hallmark of the SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","Obi, Andrea T; Barnes, Geoffrey D; Napolitano, Lena M; Henke, Peter K; Wakefield, Thomas W",J Vasc Surg Venous Lymphat Disord,,246

The focus is on the Early Modern period (15th to 18th centuries) and the growing use of new ceramic forms for leisure activities. Although the conference itself could not be held, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the volume nevertheless brings together 28 contributions from authors from nine countries, from Portugal to Russia, from Italian Sardinia to Polish Stargard. A finds assemblage from the United Arab Emirates published by Portuguese colleagues, represents the tenth country. The volume comprises several subtopics which at first glance seem diverse. And yet, be they smoking, drinking coffee or alcohol, garden strolls or games, they share one thing in common: they are hobbies and vices enjoyed mainly in one's free time. In the Early Modern period, these were typically activities of a rather luxurious nature, initially reserved for those with loftier positions in society but which, over time, gradually filtered down to the lower economic classes. It is therefore not surprising that the greater demand for new activities was also reflected in pottery production. As such, new ceramic forms such as cups, pipes and flowerpots began to appear in Early Modern archaeological assemblages and form the basis of this anthology. The volume will provide readers with useful comparison assemblages and serve as a source of inspiration for subsequent research. © Authors and Archaeopress 2021.

In the realm of scientific conferences, with the requirement for social distancing, the importance of wearing face coverings, and travel restrictions, only virtual meetings have been possible during the pandemic. But many are asking: What is the new post‐pandemic normal likely to be? Do we still want to have in‐person meetings when the restrictions are eased? Assuming we do, when will they be possible again, and under what conditions? Regardless of what the benefits of virtual symposia might be, are they here to stay? These questions, and many more that are being asked around the world today, are the subject of this perspective. Herein, we attempt to provide useful context and insight into where scientific meetings have been, where they are today, where they are going, and how they will get there. Our conclusion is that the pandemic has created an accelerated opportunity to make the world of future scientific conferences better in a “both/and” collaborative in‐person/virtual scenario, not the more limited “pick one” choice.","Dua, Nick Fyrenius Mattias Johnson Deborah L.; Moos, Walter H.",FASEB BioAdvances,,246

289576,Beneficial Effect of Statins in COVID-19-Related Outcomes-Brief Report: A National Population-Based Cohort Study,2021,"ImportanceGiven the overwhelming worldwide rate of infection and the disappointing pace of vaccination, addressing reinfection is critical. Understanding reinfection, including protection longevity after natural infection, will allow us to better know the prospect of herd immunity, which hinges on the assumption that natural infection generates sufficient, protective immunity. The primary aim of this paper is to provide data on SARS-CoV-2 reinfection over a 10-month period. ObjectiveThe primary objective of this study is to establish the incidence of reinfection of COVID-19 among healthcare employees who experienced a prior COVID-19 infection. DesignThis observational cohort study followed a convenience sample of 2,625 participants who experienced a COVID-19 infection for subsequent COVID-19 infection. SettingHealthcare employees were recruited across a large Midwestern healthcare system. Positive PCR test results were administered and recorded by the system-affiliated lab serving Illinois and Wisconsin. ParticipantsAdult healthcare system employees who enrolled in a research study focused on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (N = 16,357) and had at least one positive PCR test result between March 1, 2020 and January 10, 2021 were included (N = 2,625). ExposurePositive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)The primary outcome is incidence of COVID-19 reinfection, defined by current CDC guidelines (i.e. subsequent COVID-19 infection [≥] 90 days from prior infection). COVID-19 recurrence, defined as subsequent COVID-19 infection after prior infection irrespective of time, is also described. ResultsOf 2,625 participants who experienced at least one COVID-19 infection during the 10-month study period, 156 (5.94%) experienced reinfection and 540 (20.57%) experienced recurrence after prior infection. Median days were 126.50 (105.50-171.00) to reinfection and 31.50 (10.00-72.00) to recurrence. Incidence rate of COVID-19 reinfection was 0.35 cases per 1,000 person-days, with participants working in COVID-clinical and clinical units experiencing 3.77 and 3.57 times, respectively, greater risk of reinfection relative to those working in non-clinical units. Incidence rate of COVID-19 recurrence was 1.47 cases per 1,000 person-days. Conclusions and RelevanceThis study supports the consensus that COVID-19 reinfection, defined as subsequent infection [≥] 90 days after prior infection, is rare, even among a sample of healthcare workers with frequent exposure.","Rivelli, Anne; Fitzpatrick, Veronica; Blair, Christopher; Richards, Jon; Copeland, Kenneth",,,246

Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.","Fantini, Jacques; Di Scala, Coralie; Chahinian, Henri; Yahi, Nouara",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,246

293237,How should we use convalescent plasma therapies for COVID-19?,2020,"The objective of the article is to substantiate the pre-nosological syndrome of mental immunodispersion (SMIDis), which reflects the violation of the autochthonous rhythm of the “evolutionary pendulum of consciousness” in the path of ontogenetic and phylogenetic development. SMIDis is characterized by multidirectional changes in the functions of mental immunity (MI) as a matrix of identity and interface of consciousness. SMIDis is the universal dysfunctional basis of all psychopathological (including addictogenic) and psychosomatic (including COVID-19) diatheses, the further possible development of which is determined by the balance of the genome/ epigenome and menom/epimenom. It substantiates the possibility of building the entire psychopathology according to a single gradi-ent of the dysontogenetic continuum, which is a counterfeit of mental evolution. Violation of the ontogenetic mechanism of mental immunomodulation, manifested by MI dysfunctions, triggers the symptom formation of epidemic (mental, psychosomatic and other) disorders. It is suggested to refer COVID-19 to a mental pandemic that is aimed to phylogenetically change the civilizational identity of humanity. The non-reducibility and non-supervenience of consciousness are increasingly becoming a mirror image of psychiatry’s supervenient reductionism in its crisis half-life into DSM and ICD. This requires a radical revision of the, figuratively speaking, neuro-navigation of Consciousness as the Brain of the World.","Sidorov, P. I.",Ekologiya Cheloveka (Human Ecology,,246
293238,How should we use convalescent plasma therapies for COVID-19?,2020,"Vaccination is the most effective and cost-efficient approach to protect both individual and community health. Decreased vaccination rates have been reported in many countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we compared the vaccination rates of the current year with those of the same period of 2019 in Ankara and presented the physicians' thoughts about effects of COVID-19 pandemic on vaccinations in Turkey. An online survey was sent to family practitioners, pediatricians, and pediatric infectious disease specialists to ascertain their thoughts on vaccination during the pandemic. A majority of family practitioners stated that, despite hesitations, families brought their children for vaccination. They noted that vaccination should be emphasized, physicians should be supported by health authorities, and all related media and social media channels should be used to promote maintaining vaccinations. In contrast, pediatricians and pediatric infectious disease specialists were of the opinion that families were expressing greater hesitation and would not bring their children for vaccination. Vaccination rates in Ankara have decreased 2-5% during the pandemic, and the greatest decrease was observed for vaccines administered after 18 months of age. Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases can threaten community health worldwide. Thus, vaccinations must continue, and effective regulations and recommendations need to be implemented by healthcare authorities to promote it.","Kara, Ates; Ilbay, Sare; Topaç, Osman; Arabulan, Elif Ayla; Tezer, Hasan; Tavukçu, Nilüfer; Simsek, Çigdem",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,246

Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared between patients with and without CLD. Postmortem examination of liver in 8 critically ill COVID-19 patients was performed. There was no significant difference in the incidence of CLD between critical and non-critical groups (4.1% vs 2.9%, p = 0.259), or COVID-19 related liver injury between patients with and without CLD (65.7% vs 49.7%, p = 0.065). Postmortem examination of liver demonstrated mild liver injury associated central vein outflow obstruction and minimal to moderate portal lymphocytic infiltrate without evidence of CLD. Patients with CLD were not associated with a higher risk of liver injury or critical/fatal outcomes.

We hypothesize that stroke code time metrics were significantly longer in the peri-COVID stroke code activations compared to pre-COVID activations. Methods: We analyzed data from an IRB-approved, prospectively collected stroke registry at a large academic, comprehensive stroke center (CSC). We included all patients that presented as stroke code activations from June 2009-August 2020, excluding spoke telestroke and in-house codes. Pre-COVID was defined as June 1, 2009-March 11, 2020 and peri-COVID March 12, 2020 to August 11, 2020. The pre-pandemic stroke code protocol began June 2009. We assessed The Joint Commission stroke code time metrics between groups. Demographic variables of baseline NIHSS, sex, race/ethnicity, age, smoking, pertinent past medical history, arrival mode, and baseline glucose were assessed. A t-test was used to compare stroke code time metrics in minutes. All analyses were done unadjusted. Results: We assessed 813 pre and 328 peri-COVID stroke code activations. Baseline demographics were significant only for an increased number of Hispanics in the pre-COVID group (22.9% vs 11.1%, p&lt;0.001). Onset to hospital arrival time was significantly longer in the peri-COVID compared to pre-COVID group (244 vs 110 min, p&lt;0.001). Onset to stroke code activation was significantly longer in the peri-COVID compared to pre-COVID group (243.8 vs 116.8 min, p&lt;0.009). Time from arrival to treatment decision was significantly decreased in the peri-COVID group (29.9 vs 39.6 min, p=0.04). Time from arrival to CT scan completed (p=0.37), arrival to treatment administration (p=0.06), and onset to treatment administration (p=0.48) were not significantly different between groups. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the volume and demographic of stroke patients seeking emergency care. This data supports the trend of patients delaying emergent stroke care. This academic, CSC developed and implemented a COVID-19 stroke code protocol within days of a statewide lockdown. The use of telestroke in this peri-pandemic protocol may have accounted for the significant decrease in time to treatment decision.","Meyer, D.

295271,CSF Leak After COVID-19 Nasopharyngeal Swab: A Case Report,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus causing an ongoing pandemic in 2020. Although the symptomatic patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 generally show respiratory distress, atypical manifestations such as conjunctivitis are also observed. A series of cases are reported in which reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing on tears had demonstrated the presence of the virus. However, the transmission of the virus through ocular fluids remains unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION: In this case report, the development of conjunctivitis is presented as the sole symptom of a new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in an emergency health care worker. The patient's first application was to the ophthalmology clinic due to redness, stinging, tearing, and photophobia for one day in the right eye. The patient had no symptoms of fever, cough, shortness of breath, or fatigue. Two days later, the RT-PCR test, blood analysis, and chest computed tomography (CT) were applied to the patient for being in contact with a COVID positive patient. Conjunctival swabs did not identify SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. However, nasopharyngeal swab and blood test confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. Chest CT did not show pneumonia. CONCLUSION: This phenomenon shows that conjunctivitis may occur as a sole manifestation of COVID-19 which needs to be carefully evaluated by health care workers and eye care professionals during the pandemic.","Ozturker, Zeynep Kayaarasi",Eur J Ophthalmol,,246

Families across the world have had to adapt to a new style of living, dominated by uncertainty, which is testing their resilience. Within this context, we have asked ourselves, as systemic therapists, what can be done to provide support and a sense of understanding to families. In this article, it is argued that therapeutic tools taken from a manualised intervention to promote resilience in couples can provide valuable help to families who are struggling in this difficult time. This intervention, developed at the Iscra Institute in Modena, Italy, is called Digital, Analogic, and Narrative (DAN). The tools used in the DAN model are described in this paper and their application in practice is illustrated through a case study.","Mariotti, Mauro; Muratori, Greco; Langella, Achille; Scaltriti, Nicoletta",Australian and New Zealand journal of family therapy,,246

Pakistan is quite vulnerable to such conspiracy narratives and has experienced failures of polio vaccination programs because of such claims. Recently, two well-known political figures raised conspiracy theories against COVID-19 vaccines in Pakistan, stating that COVID-19 is a grand illusion and a conspiracy against Muslim countries. This theory is much discussed in the local community, supporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We urge healthcare authorities in Pakistan to take necessary measures against such claims before they penetrate to the general community. Anti-vaccine movements could undermine efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that ethical and responsible behavior of mass media, a careful advisory from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, stern measures from healthcare authorities, effective maneuvers to increase public awareness on COVID-19, vigorous analysis of information by data or communications scientists, and publication of counter opinions from health professionals against such theories will go a long way in neutralizing such misleading claims. Because Pakistan is experiencing a large burden of disease, with a sharp rise in confirmed cases, immediate action is of paramount importance to eradicate any potential barriers to a future COVID-19 vaccination program.","Khan, Yusra Habib; Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Alzarea, Abdulaziz Ibrahim; Alanazi, Abdullah Salah; Tanveer, Nida; Hashmi, Furqan Khurshid",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,246

At present, there are no specific treatments for COVID-19. β-sitosterol is well known for its multiple biological actions. This research aims to isolate and study the binding affinity of β-sitosterol for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) main protease (Mpro). Methods: Extraction and column chromatography was performed to isolate the β-sitosterol from an n-hexane extract of Muntingia calabura bark followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance TLC (HPTLC), Fourier-Transform infrared (FTIR), and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. The molecular docking studies were performed on SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to determine the binding affinity of the β-sitosterol using PyRx Virtual Screening Tool. Results: In the present study, preliminary phytochemical screening showed the presence of carbohydrate, steroid, terpenoid, and flavonoid compounds. A total of 115 fractions was collected from column chromatography using benzene as a solvent by an isocratic elution technique. HPTLC fingerprinting analysis showed the presence of β-sitosterol under 366 nm. FTIR characterization was performed of the same fraction which gives the absorption peaks which resembles the β-sitosterol structure. Conclusion: The overall study concludes this method can be considered as a standard method for isolation of β-sitosterol from M. calabura bark. Favipiravir has a less binding affinity, i.e. -5.7 kcal/mol than β-sitosterol which has -6.9 kcal/mol. The number of hydrogen bonds formed by the favipiravir is much more, i.e., 4 than β-sitosterol which formed only 01 hydrogen bonds with SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.","Chaudhari, Rakesh N; Khan, Sharuk L.; Chaudhary, Ravindra S.; Jain, Shirish P.; Sidduqui, Falak A.",Asian J.

COVID-19 infection leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome in a subset of patients and is a primary driver of acute morbidity in infected persons. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that SARS-CoV-2 infection drives dysfunction and pathology outside the lungs, including reports of renal, cardiac, and neurological complications. In this study, we summarize the known incidence and evidence of neurological complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and other pathogenic coronaviruses. These studies describe a poorly understood spectrum of COVID-19 central nervous system symptoms, ranging from common and subclinical issues such as anosmia and headache to more concerning reports of stroke and encephalopathy. We discuss potential mechanisms of pathogenesis, including a discussion of how the understanding of neurological complications known to occur in HIV-1 patients may provide insight into SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. Specifically, three hypotheses are discussed that are informed by decades of knowledge about HIV pathogenesis in the brain, which include a potential direct viral effect, an indirect viral effect, and/or a neuroimmune axis effect. Individually or in combination these potential effects may contribute to COVID-19 neurological complications.","Al-Harthi, Lena; Campbell, Edward; Schneider, Julie A; Bennett, David A",AIDS res. hum. retroviruses,,246

All social, cultural and political activities cannot be carried out, including elections that are scheduled according to the constitution. E-voting technology that has been around for about 30 years can be the solution as an alternative method to carry out elections in the pandemic era. The contribution of this research is the ubiquitous voting model for general elections, changing traditional e-voting for elections in the pandemic era, so that in practice, voters do not need to go to the polling station. Elections use the existing technology in the community and are carried out wherever voters are located, so that elections will continue to take place during the pandemic.","Risnanto, S.; Abd Rahim, Y.; Mahatma, K.; Effendi, A.; Garnida, H.; Kusmadi, Ieee","Proceeding of 14th International Conference on Telecommunication Systems, Services, and Applications",,246

This was an observational study conducted at a single center to investigate serum cytokine and chemokine levels of COVID-19 patients, based on disease severity. We included 72 consecutive COVID-19 patients admitted to our hospital from March 21 to August 31, 2020. Patients were divided into Mild-Moderate I (mild) and Moderate II-Severe (severe) groups based on the COVID-19 severity classification developed by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan. We compared the patient characteristics as well as the serum cytokine and chemokine levels on the day of admission between the two groups. Our findings indicated that the severe group had significantly higher levels of serum fibrinogen, d-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, Krebs von den Lungen-6, surfactant protein (SP)-D, and SP-A than the mild group. Strikingly, the levels of interleukin (IL)-28A/interferon (IFN)-&#955;2 were significantly lower in the severe group than in the mild group. We believe that reduced levels of type III interferons (IFN-&#955;s) and alterations in the levels of other cytokines and chemokines may impact the severity of the disease.","Yosuke, Fukuda; Homma, Tetsuya; Inoue, Hideki; Onitsuka, Chisato; Ikeda, Hitoshi; Goto, Yuiko; Sato, Yoko; Kimura, Tomoyuki; Hirai, Kuniaki; Ohta, Shin; Yamamoto, Mayumi; Kusumoto, Sojiro; Suzuki, Shintaro; Tanaka, Akihiko; Sagara, Hironori",J Med Virol,,246

The aim of this systematic review was to explore the incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolism among COVID-19 patients requiring hospitalization. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Scopus, and grey literature were searched until June 2020. Observational studies reported on the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial thromboembolism (ATE) were included. The pool incidences and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 36 studies were included. In the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, the pooled incidence of VTE was 28% (95% CI, 22-34%). Subgroups based on compression ultrasound (CUS) screening revealed a higher incidence of DVT in the CUS screening group than in the no CUS screening group (32% [95% CI, 18-45%] vs. 6% [95% CI, 4-9%]). The pooled incidence of ATE in ICU was 3% (95% CI, 2-5%). In the non-ICU setting, the pooled incidence of VTE was 10% (95% CI, 6-14%,). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE in COVID-19 patients was higher in the ICU setting than in the non-ICU setting, and also significantly higher in studies that incorporated the CUS screening protocol. The incidence of ATE in the ICU setting was low.

303962,Laboratory and radiologic findings in pediatrics with COVID-19: A systematic review,2020,"Loneliness and social isolation are common sources of chronic stress in modern society. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that loneliness and social isolation increase mortality risk as much as smoking or alcohol consumption and more than physical inactivity or obesity. Loneliness in human is associated with higher blood pressure whereas enhanced atherosclerosis is observed in animal models of social isolation. Loneliness and social isolation lead to activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, enhanced sympathetic nerve activity, impaired parasympathetic function and a proinflammatory immune response. These mechanisms have been implicated in the development of cardiovascular disease conferred by social isolation although a causal relationship has not been established so far. There is evidence that oxidative stress is likely to be a key molecular mechanism linking chronic psychosocial stress to cardiovascular disease. NADPH oxidase-mediated oxidative stress in the hypothalamus has been shown to be required for social isolation-induced HPA axis activation in socially isolated rats. Oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla is also a key regulator of sympathetic nerve activity. In the vasculature, oxidative stress increases vascular tone and promote atherogenesis through multiple mechanisms. Thus, preventing oxidative stress may represent a therapeutic strategy to reduce the detrimental effects of social stress on health.","Li, Huige; Xia, Ning",Redox Biol,,246

The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with coronary heart disease. METHOD: Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched to collect the literature concerning coronary heart disease and COVID-19. The retrieval time was from inception to Nov 20, 2020, using Stata version 14.0 for meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 22,148 patients from 40 studies were included. The meta-analysis revealed that coronary heart disease was associated with poor prognosis of COVID-19 (OR=3.42, 95%CI [2.83, 4.13], P<0.001). After subgroup analysis, coronary heart disease was found to be related to mortality (OR=3.75, 95%CI [2.91, 4.82], P<0.001), severe/critical COVID-19 (OR=3.23, 95%CI [2.19, 4.77], P<0.001), ICU admission (OR=2.25, 95%CI [1.34, 3.79], P=0.002), disease progression (OR=3.01, 95%CI [1.46, 6.22], P=0.003); Meta-regression showed that the association between coronary heart disease and poor prognosis of COVID-19 was affected by hypertension (P=0.004), and subgroup analysis showed that compared with the proportion of hypertension >30% (OR=2.85, 95%CI [2.33, 3.49]), the proportion of hypertension <30% (OR=4.78, 95%CI [3.50, 6.51]) had a higher risk of poor prognosis.

Since then, the disease has evolved to become a global pandemic. Zimbabwe reported its first case on 20th March 2020, and the number has been increasing steadily. However, Zimbabwe has not witnessed the exponential growth witnessed in other countries so far, and the trajectory seems different. We set out to describe the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 in Zimbabwe from when the first case was confirmed to June 2020. Methods: data were collected from daily situation reports that were published by the Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Care from 20th March to 27th June 2020. Missing data on the daily situation reports was not imputed. Results: as of 27th June 2020, Zimbabwe had 567 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Eighty-two percent of these were returning residents and 18% were local transmission. The testing was heavily skewed towards returnees despite a comprehensive testing strategy. Of the confirmed cases, 142 were reported as recovered. However, demographic data for the cases were missing from the reports. It was not possible to estimate the probable period of infection of an active case, and case fatality in Zimbabwe was about 1% for the first 4 months of the pandemic. Conclusion: the epidemiological trends of COVID-19 experienced in Zimbabwe between March and June 2020 are somewhat different from what has been observed elsewhere. Further research to determine the reasons for the differences is warranted, to inform public health practice and tailor make suitable interventions.","Murewanhema, Grant; Burukai, Trouble; Mazingi, Dennis; Maunganidze, Fabian; Mufunda, Jacob; Munodawafa, Davison; Pote, William",Pan Afr Med J,,246
305067,Covid-19 Vaccine Acceptance in California State Prisons,2021,"The first severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in South Africa was identified on 5 March 2020, and by 26 March the country was in full lockdown (Oxford stringency index of 90)1. Despite the early response, by November 2020, over 785,000 people in South Africa were infected, which accounted for approximately 50% of all known African infections2. In this study, we analyzed 1,365 near whole genomes and report the identification of 16 new lineages of SARS-CoV-2 isolated between 6 March and 26 August 2020. Most of these lineages have unique mutations that have not been identified elsewhere. We also show that three lineages (B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56 and C.1) spread widely in South Africa during the first wave, comprising ~42% of all infections in the country at the time. The newly identified C lineage of SARS-CoV-2, C.1, which has 16 nucleotide mutations as compared with the original Wuhan sequence, including one amino acid change on the spike protein, D614G (ref. 3), was the most geographically widespread lineage in South Africa by the end of August 2020.

The purpose of this study was to explore how parents experienced the pandemic-related restrictions and how they impacted their children's movement behaviours. Methods: Twenty-nine semi-structured one-on-one interviews were conducted (June-July 2020) with parents of children (5-11 years old) in Ontario and British Columbia. Interviews lasted between 24-104 min, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed. Results: Findings emphasized various individual (e.g., motivation), interpersonal (e.g., parent work schedule), built (e.g., closure of parks) and natural environment (e.g., weather) factors related to children's movement behaviours. The findings highlighted the loss of structured activities and destinations for children's physical activity, and restricted opportunities for outdoor play exacerbated by shrinking childhood independent mobility. Conclusion: Families are adapting to many pandemic-related challenges including adhering to public health restrictions, parents juggling multiple roles, conducting work and school from home, as well as exacerbating factors like weather. It will be important to continue to encourage outdoor time, support policies and practice that facilitate independent mobility, and develop centralized resources that help families in the maintenance of healthy movement behaviours.","Riazi, Negin A; Wunderlich, Kelly; Gierc, Madelaine; Brussoni, Mariana; Moore, Sarah A; Tremblay, Mark S; Faulkner, Guy",,,246

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study in a cohort of 326 women who underwent POP repair and had a standardized preoperative POP assessment using the Baden-Walker classification. The distribution of POP grade was described for each vaginal compartment. The association between the involvement of each specific compartment and predictors was evaluated with a logistic regression model. RESULTS: The frequency of significant POP (grade &#8805; 2) was 79% in the anterior compartment, 49% in the middle/apical compartment and 31% in the posterior compartment. Combined significant anterior and apical defects were present in 25% of women. Increasing age was a significant risk factor for apical defect (between 60 and 70 years OR = 2.4, 95% CI 1.2-4.6; > 70 years OR = 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.6). Previous hysterectomy (OR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.6) was a significant risk factor for posterior defect. CONCLUSIONS: In a population undergoing POP surgery, anterior compartment involvement is the most common and serious defect and can often be associated with an apical defect, especially in older women. In case of previous hysterectomy, the posterior compartment may be weakened. These findings may help surgeons to select the appropriate POP reconstructive surgery, which often should address both anterior and apical defects.","Payebto Zoua, Emmanuel; Boulvain, Michel; Dällenbach, Patrick",Int. urogynecol. j.

311391,Sound Science before Quick Judgement Regarding RAS Blockade in COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown measures have disrupted educational and nutrition services globally. Understanding the overall and differential impacts of disruption of nutritional (school feeding) services is critical for designing effective post-COVID-19 recovery policies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19-induced disruption of school feeding services on household food security in Nigeria. METHODS: We combined household-level, pre-COVID-19 in-person survey data with postpandemic phone survey data, along with local government area (LGA)-level information on access to school feeding services. We used a difference-in-difference approach and examined temporal trends in the food security of households with and without access to school feeding services. Of the sampled households, 83% live in LGAs with school feeding services. RESULTS: Households experienced an increase in food insecurity in the post-COVID-19 survey round. The share of households skipping a meal increased by 47 percentage points (95% CI: 44-50 percentage points). COVID-19-induced disruptions of school feeding services increased households' experiences of food insecurity, increasing the probability of skipping a meal by 9 percentage points (95% CI: 3-17 percentage points) and the likelihood of going without eating for a whole day by 3 percentage points (95% CI: 2-11 percentage points). Disruption of school feeding services is associated with a 0.2 SD (95% CI: 0.04-0.41 SD) increase in the food insecurity index. Households residing in states experiencing strict lockdown measures reported further deterioration in food insecurity. Single mothers and poorer households experienced relatively larger deteriorations in food security due to disruption of school feeding services. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that COVID-19-induced disruptions in educational and nutritional services have exacerbated households' food insecurity in Nigeria. These findings can inform the designs of immediate and medium-term policy responses, including the designs of social protection policies and alternative programs to substitute nutritional services affected by the pandemic.","Abay, Kibrom A; Amare, Mulubrhan; Tiberti, Luca; Andam, Kwaw S",J. nutr,,246
311836,ACE2 and prognosis of COVID-19: Insights from Bartter's and Gitelman's syndromes patients,2020,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide an estimate of the costs of premature mortality caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: Using COVID-19 pandemic-derived mortality data for November 9, 2020 (globally 1,303,215 deaths) and applying a country-based value of statistical life (VSL), the worldwide cost of premature mortality was assessed. The cost was assessed based on income groups until November 9, 2020 and projected into the future until March 1, 2021 using three scenarios from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). Findings: The global cost of premature mortality is currently estimated at Int$5.9 trillion. For the high-income group, the current estimated cost is Int$ $4.4 trillion or $3,700 per person. Using IHME projections until March 1, 2021, global premature mortality costs will increase to Int$13.7 trillion and reach Int$22.1 trillion if policies are relaxed, while the cost with 95% universal masks is Int$10.9 trillion. The richest nations will bear the largest burden of these costs, reaching $15,500 per person by March 1, 2021 if policies are relaxed. Originality/value: The cost of human lives lost due to the pandemic is unprecedented. Preparedness in the future is the best policy to avoid many premature deaths and severe recessions in order to combat pandemics. © 2020, Jaime A.

312610,Does COVID-19 contribute to development of neurological disease?,2021,"Like severe influenza, coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has emerged as an important disease that predisposes patients to secondary pulmonary aspergillosis, with 35 cases of COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) published until June 2020. The release of danger-associated molecular patterns during severe COVID-19 results in both pulmonary epithelial damage and inflammatory disease, which are predisposing risk factors for pulmonary aspergillosis. Moreover, collateral effects of host recognition pathways required for the activation of antiviral immunity may, paradoxically, contribute to a highly permissive inflammatory environment that favors fungal pathogenesis. Diagnosis of CAPA remains challenging, mainly because bronchoalveolar lavage fluid galactomannan testing and culture, which represent the most sensitive diagnostic tests for aspergillosis in the ICU, are hindered by the fact that bronchoscopies are rarely performed in COVID-19 patients due to the risk of disease transmission. Similarly, autopsies are rarely performed, which may result in an underestimation of the prevalence of CAPA. Finally, the treatment of CAPA is complicated by drug–drug interactions associated with broad spectrum azoles, renal tropism and damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, which may challenge the use of liposomal amphotericin B, as well as the emergence of azole-resistance. This clinical reality creates an urgency for new antifungal drugs currently in advanced clinical development with more promising pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles.","Arastehfar, Amir; Carvalho, Agostinho; van de Veerdonk, Frank L.; Jenks, Jeffrey D.; Koehler, Philipp; Krause, Robert; Cornely, Oliver A.; Perlin, David S.; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Hoenigl, Martin",J.

RESULTS: Elevated neutrophil-to-LYM ratio (NLR), D-dimer(D-D), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, interferon-Y, and age were significantly associated with the severity of illness. However, significant and sustained decreases were observed in the LYM subset (p<0.05). D-D, T cell counts, and cytokine levels in severe COVID-19 patients who survived the disease gradually recovered at later time points to levels that were comparable to those of mild cases. Second, D-D increased from 0.5 to 8, and the risk ratio increased from 2.75 to 55, eventually leading to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Moreover, the acute renal function damage occurred earlier than abnormal heart and liver functions (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The degrees of lymphopenia and proinflammatory cytokine storm were higher in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild cases. The degree was associated with the disease severity. Advanced age, NLR, D-D, and cytokine levels may serve as useful prognostic factors for the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 93 confirmed COVID-19 patients. The samples were examined for lymphocyte (LYM) subsets by flow cytometry and cytokine profiles by specific immunoassays. The receiver operating characteristic curve was applied to determine the best diagnostic thresholds for laboratory results, and principal component analysis was used to screen the major risk factors. The prognostic values were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier curve and univariate and multivariate COX regression models.","Yang, Ai-Ping; Li, Hui-Ming; Tao, Wen-Qiang; Yang, Xue-Jing; Wang, Min; Yang, Wen-Juan; Liu, Jian-Ping",Aging (Albany NY),,246

315654,"[Covid-19 - Blood Groups, Antibodies and Convalescent Plasma]",2021,"One of the main challenges in higher education is promoting students' autonomous and self-regulated learning, which involves managing their own emotions and learning processes in different contexts and circumstances. Considering that online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic may be an opportunity for university students to take greater responsibility for their learning, it is essential to explore the strategies they have developed in the face of emotional and learning challenges during the health crisis. This study aimed at analyzing the relationships between students' emotions, coping strategies, and self-regulated learning in online learning during COVID-19 home confinement. The participants were 1,290 Mexican students from different universities throughout the country, who answered an online self-report questionnaire from standardized instruments adapted to the pandemic. Data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential analyses, including a structural equation model (SEM). Findings indicate that, although anxiety, boredom, and frustration were present among participants during confinement, the primary emotions were gratitude, joy, and hope. Second, the main coping strategies used by students participating were focused on facing and reassessing the situation. Furthermore, tranquility, hope, gratitude, and joy were positively related to self-regulated learning, although, loneliness and disinterest were negatively related. Finally, it was found that an approach to coping strategies mediated the relationship between emotions and self-regulated learning. Thus, teachers should help students understand the relevance of active coping strategies and use student-centered learning models that promote autonomous and self-regulated learning, considering each learner's needs, during and after confinement.","Gaeta, M.

The pandemic has posed special challenges to these federal systems. Although federal systems typically have many advantages—they can adapt policies to local conditions, for example, and experiment with different solutions to problems—pandemics and people cross regional borders, and controlling contagion requires a great deal of national coordination and intergovernmental cooperation. The four federal systems vary in their relative distribution of powers between regional and national governments, in the way that health care is administered, and in the variation in policies across regions. We focus on the early responses to COVID-19, from January through early May 2020. Three of these countries—Australia, Canada, and Germany—have done well in the crisis. They have acted quickly, done extensive testing and contact tracing, and had a relatively uniform set of policies across the country. The United States, in contrast, has had a disastrous response, wasting months at the start of the virus outbreak, with limited testing, poor intergovernmental cooperation, and widely divergent policies across the states and even within some states. The article seeks to explain both the relative uniform responses of these three very different federal systems, and the sharply divergent response of the United States.","Rozell, Mark J.; Wilcox, Clyde",Am.

The study of loneliness among young adults has become increasingly important considering the current state of isolation and stay-at-home orders issued to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Preliminary reports suggest an increase in loneliness as a result of the current health pandemic, especially among young adults, who have reported feeling lonelier than any other age group. Such findings warrant the study of ways to help reduce loneliness among young adults. The current study examined the efficacy of strategies that might be used to help young adults manage feelings of loneliness. Two hundred and seventy-eight young adults completed the study. Participants read one of four messages: mindfulness, social cognitions, coping behaviors, or a control. Participants in the mindfulness condition felt better equipped to manage future instances of loneliness and held better attitudes toward this intervention.

The severity of the global health burden, increasing mortality rate and the emergent economic crisis urgently demands the development of next generation vaccines. Amongst such emergent next generation vaccines are the multi-epitope subunit vaccines, which hold promise in combating deadly pathogens. In this study we have exploited immunoinformatics applications to delineate a vaccine candidate possessing multiple B and T cells epitopes by utilizing the SARS-CoV-2 non structural and structural proteins. The antigenicity potential, safety, structural stability and the production feasibility of the designed construct was evaluated computationally. Furthermore, due to the known role of human TLR-3 immune receptor in viral sensing, which facilitates host cells activation for an immune response, the vaccine construct was examined for its binding efficiency using molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies, which resulted in strong and stable interactions. Finally, the immune simulation studies suggested an effective immune response on vaccine administration. Overall, the immunoinformatics analysis advocates that the proposed vaccine candidate is safe and immunogenic and therefore can be pushed as a lead for in vitro and in vivo investigations.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Primary practice settings include home health care, hospice, hospital discharge planning, case management, and primary care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Precautions necessary in a COVID-19 era may add anxiety and stress to an already difficult situation of caring for loved ones at end-of-life and grieving with their loss. Utilization of CDC guidelines lessens the risk of infection while honoring loved ones' wishes and cultural traditions surrounding death and burial. Recognition of social and spiritual connections that comfort mourners must also be considered.

321062,Pediatric COVID-19-associated rhabdomyolysis: a case report,2020,"BACKGROUND: People with a recent history of homelessness are believed to be at high risk of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and, when infected, complications of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We describe and compare testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and hospital admission, receipt of intensive care and mortality rates related to COVID-19 for people with a recent history of homelessness versus community-dwelling people as of July 31, 2020. METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada, between Jan. 23 and July 31, 2020, using linked health administrative data among people who either had a recent history of homelessness or were dwelling in the community. People were included if they were eligible for provincial health care coverage and not living in an institutionalized facility on Jan. 23, 2020. We examined testing for SARS-CoV-2, test positivity and complication outcomes of COVID-19 (hospital admission, admission to intensive care and death) within 21 days of a positive test result. Extended multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) in 3 time periods: preshutdown (Jan. 23-Mar. 13), peak (Mar. 14-June 16) and reopening (June 17-July 31). RESULTS: People with a recent history of homelessness (n = 29 407) were more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 in all 3 periods compared with community-dwelling people (n = 14 494 301) (preshutdown adjusted HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22-2.11; peak adjusted HR 2.95, 95% CI 2.88-3.03; reopening adjusted HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.39-1.51). They were also more likely to have a positive test result (peak adjusted HR 3.66, 95% CI 3.22-4.16; reopening adjusted HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.15-2.71). In the peak period, people with a recent history of homelessness were over 20 times more likely to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 20.35, 95% CI 16.23-25.53), over 10 times more likely to require intensive care for COVID-19 (adjusted HR 10.20, 95% CI 5.81-17.93) and over 5 times more likely to die within 21 days of their first positive test result (adjusted HR 5.73, 95% CI 3.01-10.91). INTERPRETATION: In Ontario, people with a recent history of homelessness were significantly more likely to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, to have a positive test result, to be admitted to hospital for COVID-19, to receive intensive care for COVID-19 and to die of COVID-19 compared with community-dwelling people. People with a recent history of homelessness should continue to be considered particularly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection and its complications.","Richard, Lucie; Booth, Richard; Rayner, Jennifer; Clemens, Kristin K; Forchuk, Cheryl; Shariff, Salimah Z",CMAJ Open,,246

323591,CT Coronary Angiography at Dunedin Public Hospital – A Retrospective Clinical Audit,2020,"Polysorbate 20 (PS20) is a commonly used surfactant in biopharmaceutical formulations. It is a heterogeneous surfactant containing a distribution of fatty acid esters, which are subject to hydrolytic degradation, generating free fatty acids (FFAs). The FFAs can form visible or subvisible particles in drug product on stability. A previous FFA solubility model, developed by our group, predicts solubility limits for the three most prevalent FFA degradation products of PS20: lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid. The model takes into account two formulation parameters, pH and PS20 concentration, and their effect on FFA solubility. This work identifies a third parameter that has an impact on FFA solubility: PS20 ester distribution. When PS20 is hydrolytically degraded, the ester distribution of the remaining surfactant changes on stability. Ester distribution is known to influence the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PS20 such that the monoesters have a much higher CMC compared to the higher-order esters (HOE). We hypothesize that as PS20 degrades, the CMC changes, affecting the proportion of PS20 that is present in micelles and capable of sequestering and solubilizing FFAs in these micelles. Here, PS20 was separated into monoester, HOE, and polyol fractions. The monoester and HOE fractions were mixed together to generate the mock degradation profiles of hydrolytically degraded PS20. FFA solubility was measured as a function of the concentration of these mock-degraded (MD) PS20s. The results indicate that ester distribution does have an impact on FFA solubility, especially at higher MD PS20 concentrations. HOEs solubilize up to 30 µg/mL more lauric acid than an equivalent amount of monoesters at a MD PS20 level of 0.06% w/v. With the addition of % HOE peak area fraction as a third parameter representing the ester distribution of PS20, the refined FFA solubility model more accurately predicts FFA solubility in protein formulations at 5 °C. The refined model suggests that drug products containing trace levels of host cell proteins (HCPs) that preferentially degrade HOEs of PS20 are at a higher risk of particle formation.","Doshi, Nidhi; Martin, Joelle; Tomlinson, Anthony",Mol. pharm,,246
324245,Reducing Expectations for Antibiotics in Patients With Upper Respiratory Tract Infections: A Primary Care Randomized Controlled Trial,2021,"The global coronavirus pandemic (Covid 19) resulted in national lockdowns where individuals were asked to isolate in their homes to stop the spread of the disease. Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants (N = 620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.","Coulthard, Helen; Sharps, Maxine; Cunliffe, Louise; van den Tol, Annemieke",Appetite,,246

325872,Challenges of Convalescent Plasma Therapy on COVID-19,2020,"AIM: The study aims to examine groups at risk for psychological distress in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak, and the role of trust in the healthcare system as a possible moderator. METHODS: Data were collected from a large sample of the Norwegian population (n = 4008) through the Norwegian Citizen Panel (NCP). A linear regression was conducted to examine the effects of COVID-19 related risk factors on psychological distress, using the 10-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-10). Finally, we conducted a moderation analysis to examine the interaction of trust in the healthcare system and COVID-19 related risk factors. RESULTS: A linear regression showed that female gender, younger age, lower level of education, being infected with COVID-19, being medically vulnerable, working in the healthcare system, being in voluntary quarantine and having an immigrant background predicted mean HSCL-10 scores. The moderation analysis revealed that people in the medically vulnerable group, those below 61, and those in quarantine reported higher psychological distress when they also had lower trust in the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate important groups to take into consideration in mental healthcare strategies and policies. However, most participants in the current study reported psychological distress levels that were below the clinical cut-off, suggesting that the majority may have coped relatively well in the early stages of the pandemic.","Harris, Samantha M; Sandal, Gro M",Scand J Public Health,,246

The pandemic affected not only the health systems of the countries but also their education systems. To prevent the spread of the epidemic, schools were closed, and different practices were presented in this period. In this study, it was aimed to determine the teachers' views towards the effects of COVID-19 on the education process in Turkey. The case study was used in the research and it was carried out with the participation of 237 different branch teachers. In order to collect the data, structured interview form prepared by the researchers was used. Data were evaluated by using the content analysis technique. As a result of the research, it was determined that teachers have both positive and negative views about competencies, distance education, adaptation of students and teacher-parent communication. In addition, it was determined that teachers have varying concerns about health, economy and education. On the other hand, research results also have shown that the pandemic process provides positive acquisitions in technology use, awareness and skill development.","Karakaya, Ferhat Adigüzel Merve amp; Uuml,; çüncü, Göksen Çimen Osman Yilmaz Mehmet",Participatory Educational Research,,246

This inherent dynamic nature of language comes in stark contrast to the current static language modelling paradigm, which constructs training and evaluation sets from overlapping time periods. Despite recent progress, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art Transformer models perform worse in the realistic setup of predicting future utterances from beyond their training period -- a consistent pattern across three datasets from two domains. We find that, while increasing model size alone -- a key driver behind recent progress -- does not provide a solution for the temporal generalization problem, having models that continually update their knowledge with new information can indeed slow down the degradation over time. Hence, given the compilation of ever-larger language modelling training datasets, combined with the growing list of language-model-based NLP applications that require up-to-date knowledge about the world, we argue that now is the right time to rethink our static language modelling evaluation protocol, and develop adaptive language models that can remain up-to-date with respect to our ever-changing and non-stationary world.","Lazaridou, Angeliki; Kuncoro, Adhiguna; Gribovskaya, Elena; Agrawal, Devang; Liska, Adam; Terzi, Tayfun; Gimenez, Mai; d'Autume, Cyprien de Masson; Ruder, Sebastian; Yogatama, Dani; Cao, Kris; Kocisky, Tomas; Young, Susannah; Blunsom, Phil",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.01951v1.pdf,246
331331,P31.01 A False Alarm of COVID-19 Pneumonia in Lung Cancer: A Case Report of Anti-PD-1 Related Pneumonitis,2021,"The number of published PDF documents in both the academic and commercial world has increased exponentially in recent decades. There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to information retrieval tools. Achieving high-quality semantic searches demands that a document's structural components such as title, section headers, paragraphs, (nested) lists, tables and figures (including their captions) are properly identified. Unfortunately, the PDF format is known to not conserve such structural information because it simply represents a document as a stream of low-level printing commands, in which one or more characters are placed in a bounding box with a particular styling. In this paper, we present a novel approach to document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each printing command according to its structural function in the page. This approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average F-1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we achieved is currently served in production environments on our Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), which was presented at KDD18. This model enhances the capabilities of CCS significantly, as it eliminates the need for human annotated label ground-truth for every unseen document layout. This proved particularly useful when applied to a huge corpus of PDF articles related to COVID-19.","Livathinos, N.; Berrospi, C.; Lysak, M.; Kuropiatnyk, V.; Nassar, A.; Carvalho, A.; Dolfi, M.; Auer, C.; Dinkla, K.; Staar, P.; Assoc Advancement Artificial, Intelligence",35th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence / 33rd Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence / 11th Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence,,246

332672,Head of bed elevation in pediatric patients with severe traumatic brain injury,2020,"We study the allocative challenges that governmental and nonprofit organizations face when tasked with equitable and efficient rationing of a social good among agents whose needs (demands) realize sequentially and are possibly correlated. To better achieve their dual aims of equity and efficiency in such contexts, social planners intend to maximize the minimum fill rate across agents, where each agent's fill rate must be irrevocably decided upon its arrival. For an arbitrarily correlated sequence of demands, we establish upper bounds on both the expected minimum fill rate (ex-post fairness) and the minimum expected fill rate (ex-ante fairness) achievable by any policy. Our bounds are parameterized by the number of agents and the expected demand-to-supply ratio, and they shed light on the limits of attaining equity in dynamic rationing. Further, we show that for any set of parameters, a simple adaptive policy of projected proportional allocation achieves the best possible fairness guarantee, ex post as well as ex ante. Our policy is transparent and easy to implement; yet despite its simplicity, we demonstrate that this policy provides significant improvement over the class of non-adaptive target-fill-rate policies. We obtain the performance guarantees of (i) our proposed adaptive policy by inductively designing lower-bound functions on its corresponding value-to-go, and (ii) the optimal target-fill-rate policy by establishing an intriguing connection to a monopoly-pricing optimization problem.

The disease had spread quickly throughout the world causing extensive, widespread morbidity, over two million deaths, and economical and social devastation over the entire world. Researchers and pharmaceutical companies around the globe have been racing to develop potent and safe vaccines for the disease. Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine followed by Moderna COVID-19 mRNA-1273 vaccine were the first to receive FDA approval. These vaccines are based on messenger RNA novel technology and considered efficient in preventing contagion ensuring safety. Known side effects for this vaccine have been reported as very similar to those known for other vaccines. Specifically, lymphadenopathy has not been considered a common manifestation of COVID-19 vaccination. Israel has been cited as leading in the introduction of these vaccines, which are available for every citizen older than 16 years. Here, we present the cases of three patients who developed lymphadenopathy after the first dose of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Time elapsed from the injection until the appearance of the enlarged nodes, clinical symptoms, and sonographic features differed between the patients, but in all cases gradual regression was noted in the enlarged nodes until complete resolution. Accordingly, to our knowledge, this is the first report describing post-COVID-19 vaccine lymphadenopathy detailing the clinical aspects, sonographic features, and outcomes.","Hiller, Nurith; Goldberg, Shraga Nahum; Cohen-Cymberknoh, Malena; Vainstein, Vladimir; Simanovsky, Natalia",Cureus,,246
335253,Utilizing tocilizumab for the treatment of cytokine release syndrome in COVID-19,2020,"ABSTRACT: To investigate the relationship between damaged lung assessed by chest computed tomography (CT) scan and laboratory biochemical parameters with the aim of finding other diagnostic tools.Patients who underwent chest CT for suspected Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia at the emergency department admission in the first phase of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with both negative chest CT and absence of the novel coronavirus in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swabs were excluded from the study. A total of 462 patients with positive CT scans for interstitial pneumonia were included in the study (250 males and 212 females, mean age 57â±â17 years, range 18-89). Of these, 344 were positive to RT-PCR test, 118 were negative to double RT-PCR tests.CTs were analyzed for quantification of affected lung volume visually and by dedicated software. Statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between laboratory analyses and CT patterns and amount of damaged lung related with COVID-19 pneumonia was performed in 2 groups of patients: positive RT-PCR COVID-19 group and negative RT-PCR COVID-19 group, but both with positive CT scans for interstitial pneumonia.Lymphocytopenia, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), d-dimer, and fibrinogen increased levels occurred in most patients without statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with CT scans suggestive for COVID-19. In fact, in both groups the volume of lung damage was strongly associated with altered laboratory test results, even for patients with negative RT-PCR test.The decreased number of lymphocytes, and the increased levels of CRP, LDH, d-dimer, and fibrinogen levels are associated with SARS-CoV 2 related pneumonia. This may be useful as an additional diagnostic tool in patients with double negative RT-PCR assay and with highly suspected clinic and chest CT features for COVID-19 to isolate patients in a pandemic period.","Orlacchio, Antonio; Gasparrini, Fulvio; Roma, Silvia; Ravà, Matteo Santangelo; Salvatori, Eva; Morosetti, Daniele; Cossu, Elsa; Legramante, Jacopo Maria; Paganelli, Carla; Bernardini, Sergio; Minieri, Marilena",Medicine (Baltimore),,246

We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the efficacy and safety of bamlanivimab treatment in patients with COVID-19. MethodsWe searched articles from Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library and MedRxiv between 30 January 2020 and August 5, 2021. We selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and observational studies with a control group to assess the efficiency of bamlanivimab in treating patients with COVID-19. ResultsOur meta-analysis retrieved 3 RCTs and 7 cohort studies including 14461 patients. Bmlanivimab may help outpatients to prevent hospitalization or emergency department visit (RR 0.41 95%CI 0.29 to 0.58), reduce ICU admission (RR 0.47 95%CI 0.23 to 0.92) and mortality (RR 0.32 95%CI 0.13 to 0.77) from the disease.

339789,Intracranial Hemorrhage in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"Nepal is a low and medium-income country (LMIC), situated in South-east Asia, with a population of 29 million, of which, 40-50% are children and adolescents. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the lives of people around the world, including Nepal. The child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) needs and services in Nepal have a significant gap. CAMH in Nepal suffers from lack of specialized training in this field as well as scarcity of human resources and services. There is only one full-time child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) out-patient clinic in the country. Some recent activities have focused on CAMH in Nepal but the COVID-19 pandemic has produced new challenges. Access to mental health services for children and adolescents (C&A) across Nepal has been adversely affected. Factors such as closure of schools, confinement at home, lockdown, transportation problems, uncertainty, loss of usual routine and fear of infection have affected the mental health of C&A. This has highlighted a need to build capacity of available local human resources, enhance community support, teach measures of coping with stress and improve CAMH service delivery by strengthening the referral system, but these have to be addressed overcoming problems of travel restrictions and limited resources. To address these needs, online platform can be a suitable approach. With this view, a multi-tier CAMH intervention model was developed, which utilizes online platform for training mental health professionals across Nepal, who would then facilitate sessions for C&A, teachers, parents and caregivers; and link them to CAMH services locally, and remotely through teleconsultation. This started as a pilot from June 2020 and will continue till end of February 2021, with the aim to reach 40,000 C&A, parents, teachers and caregivers. As of Nov 2020, this model has been used to successfully conduct 1,415 sessions, with 28,597 population reached. Among them, 16,571 are C&A and 12,026 are parents, teachers and caregivers, across all 7 provinces of Nepal. In this paper, the multi-tier intervention to address the COVID-19 related CAMH problems has been discussed as a feasible framework for resource limited settings and LMICs like Nepal.","Dhonju, Gunjan; Kunwar, Arun Raj; Karki, Utkarsh; Devkota, Narmada; Bista, Isha; Sah, Rampukar",Front Public Health,,246

340183,Association of COVID-19 Infection and Juvenile Stroke: a Case Series,2021,"BACKGROUND: In light of the role that airborne transmission plays in the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as well as the ongoing high global mortality from well-known airborne diseases such as tuberculosis and measles, there is an urgent need for practical ways of identifying congregate spaces where low ventilation levels contribute to high transmission risk. Poorly ventilated clinic spaces in particular may be high risk, due to the presence of both infectious and susceptible people. While relatively simple approaches to estimating ventilation rates exist, the approaches most frequently used in epidemiology cannot be used where occupancy varies, and so cannot be reliably applied in many of the types of spaces where they are most needed. METHODS: The aim of this study was to demonstrate the use of a non-steady state method to estimate the absolute ventilation rate, which can be applied in rooms where occupancy levels vary. We used data from a room in a primary healthcare clinic in a high TB and HIV prevalence setting, comprising indoor and outdoor carbon dioxide measurements and head counts (by age), taken over time. Two approaches were compared: approach 1 using a simple linear regression model and approach 2 using an ordinary differential equation model. RESULTS: The absolute ventilation rate, Q, using approach 1 was 2407 l/s [95% CI: 1632-3181] and Q from approach 2 was 2743 l/s [95% CI: 2139-4429]. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate two methods that can be used to estimate ventilation rate in busy congregate settings, such as clinic waiting rooms. Both approaches produced comparable results, however the simple linear regression method has the advantage of not requiring room volume measurements. These methods can be used to identify poorly-ventilated spaces, allowing measures to be taken to reduce the airborne transmission of pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles, and SARS-CoV-2.","Deol, Arminder K; Scarponi, Danny; Beckwith, Peter; Yates, Tom A; Karat, Aaron S; Yan, Ada W C; Baisley, Kathy S; Grant, Alison D; White, Richard G; McCreesh, Nicky",PLoS One,,246

340398,Why will it never be known if convalescent plasma is effective for COVID-19,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Although COVID-19 is transmitted via respiratory droplets, there are multiple gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations of the disease, including abnormal liver-associated enzymes. However, there are not many published articles on the pathological findings in the liver of COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We collected the clinical data from 17 autopsy cases of COVID-19 patients including age, sex, BMI, liver function test (ALT, AST, ALP, direct bilirubin and total bilirubin), D-dimer and anticoagulation treatment. We examined histopathologic findings in postmortem hepatic tissue, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with antibody against COVID spike protein, CD68 and CD61, and electron microscopy. We counted the number of megakaryocytes in liver sections from these COVID-19 positive cases. RESULTS: Abnormal liver-associated enzymes were observed in 12/17 cases of COVID-19 infection. With the exception of three cases that had not been tested for D-dimer, all 14 patients' D-dimer levels were increased, including the cases that received varied doses of anticoagulation treatment. Microscopically, the major findings were widespread platelet-fibrin microthrombi, steatosis, histiocytic hyperplasia in the portal tract, mild lobular inflammation, ischemic-type hepatic necrosis and zone 3 hemorrhage. Rare megakaryocytes were found in sinusoids. COVID IHC demonstrates positive staining of the histiocytes in the portal tract. Under electron microscopy, histiocyte proliferation is present in the portal tract containing lipid droplets, lysosomes, dilated ribosomal endoplasmic reticulum (RER), micro-vesicular bodies and coronavirus. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic findings in COVID-19 patients' liver include numerous amounts of platelet-fibrin microthrombi as well as various degrees of steatosis and histiocytic hyperplasia in the portal tract.

340868,Is COVID-19 an Independent Risk Factor for Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is a powerful predictor of future progression inimmunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN). Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs), in concert with infiltrating macrophages, are regarded as the agents provocateurs for driving this fibrotic process. However, evidence is now emerging for a contributory role of the distal nephron. The aim of this study was to examine the potential influence of macrophages on collecting duct epithelial cells (CDECs) and their combined role in the progression of IgAN. METHODS: CDECs were cultured with macrophage-conditioned media (MCM) generated from human monocyte cell lines U937 and THP-1 stimulated with or without 100 µg/mL galactose-deficient IgA1. CDECs were analysed for evidence of inflammation and fibrosis. RESULTS: Staining of IgAN biopsies for CD68+ macrophages revealed the presence of macrophages juxtaposed to collecting ducts and within their lumina. CDEC exposed to MCM from IgA1-stimulated THP-1 cells (THP-1-IgA-MCM) exhibited markedly increased expression of neutrophil-associated gelatinase (NGAL) and proinflammatory cytokinesinterleukin (IL)-1ß, tumour necrosis factor-&#945;, IL-6 and IL-8 compared with MCM from non-IgA-stimulated THP-1 cells (THP-1-MCM). U937-IgA-MCM increased fibronectin levels and reduced E-cadherinmRNA expression. THP-1-IgA-MCM-derived exosomes induced similar increases in NGAL and cytokine expression while in cross-over experiments exosomes extracted from IL-1ß-exposed CDEC induced IL-1ß and IL-6 mRNA expression in both sets of macrophages. MiRnome analysis revealed that microRNA (miR)-146a, -155 and -200b exhibited a >2-fold increase in expression in CDEC treated with THP-1-IgA-MCM compared with THP-1-MCM. Enforced miR-146a suppression further enhanced NGAL expression, while ectopic miR-146a over-expression downregulated it. NGAL mRNA and miR-146a were upregulated in the biopsies of patients with progressive IgAN compared with non-progressive IgAN. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data suggest that CDEC-macrophage interactions potentially contribute to the tubulointerstitial fibrosis characteristic of progressive IgAN.","Pawluczyk, Izabella Z A; Soares, Maria S F; Barratt, William A; Brown, Jeremy R; Bhachu, Jasraj S; Selvaskandan, Haresh; Zeng, Yiqing; Sarania, Rishi; Molyneux, Karen; Roberts, Ian S D; Barratt, Jonathan",Nephrol. dial. transplant,,246
342184,Association between autoimmune diseases and COVID-19 as assessed in both a test-negative case–control and population case–control design,2020,"In the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become clear that primary healthcare systems play a critical role in clinical care, such as patient screening, triage, physical and psychological support and also in promoting good community advice and awareness in coordination with secondary healthcare and preventive care. Because of the role of social and environmental factors in COVID-19 transmission and burden of disease, it is essential to ensure that there is adequate coordination of population-based health services and public health interventions. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the primary and community healthcare (P&CHC) system's weaknesses worldwide. In many instances, P&CHC played only a minor role, the emphasis being on hospital and intensive care beds. This was compounded by political failures, in supporting local community resilience. Placing community building, social cohesion and resilience at the forefront of dealing with the COVID-19 crisis can help align solutions that provide a vision of 'planetary health'. This can be achieved by involving local well-being and participation in the face of any pervasive health and environmental crisis, including other epidemics and large-scale ecological crises. This paper proposes that P&CHC should take on two critical roles: first, to support local problem-solving efforts and to serve as a partner in innovative approaches to safeguarding community well-being; and second, to understand the local environment and health risks in the context of the global health perspective. We see this as an opportunity of immediate value and broad consequence beyond the control of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lauriola, Paolo; Martín-Olmedo, Piedad; Leonardi, Giovanni S; Bouland, Catherine; Verheij, Robert; Dückers, Michel L A; van Tongeren, Martie; Laghi, Ferdinando; van den Hazel, Peter; Gokdemir, Ozden; Segredo, Evelyn; Etzel, Ruth A; Abelsohn, Alan; Bianchi, Fabrizio; Romizi, Roberto; Miserotti, Giuseppe; Romizi, Francesco; Bortolotti, Paolo; Vinci, Emanuele; Giustetto, Guido; Santamaria, Mariagrazia; Serafini, Alice; Pegoraro, Samantha; Agius, Raymond; Zeka, Ariana",,,246

344343,Prolonged viral shedding and new mutations of COVID-19 could complicate the control of the pandemic,2020,"The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has made abundantly clear that Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases the risk of more frequent and more severe viral infections. At the same time, pro-inflammatory cytokines of an anti-viral Type-I profile promote insulin resistance and form a risk factor for development of T2D. What this illustrates is that there is a reciprocal, detrimental interaction between the immune and endocrine system in the context of T2D. Why these two systems would interact at all long remained unclear. Recent findings indicate that transient changes in systemic metabolism are induced by the immune system as a strategy against viral infection. In people with T2D, this system fails, thereby negatively impacting the antiviral immune response. In addition, immune-mediated changes in systemic metabolism upon infection may aggravate glycemic control in T2D. In this review, we will discuss recent literature that sheds more light on how T2D impairs immune responses to viral infection and how virus-induced activation of the immune system increases risk of development of T2D.","Turk Wensveen, Tamara; Gasparini, Dora; Rahelic, Dario; Wensveen, Felix M",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,246

344393,Is a Mobile Application Useful for Patients with Moderate-Severe Asthma?/ ¿Es útil una aplicación móvil para los pacientes con asma moderada-grave?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Health care professionals are at higher risk of developing stress-related problems during outbreaks, due to the overwhelming clinical workload, fear of contagion, and inadequate protective gears. So, in order to monitoring mental health issues and to understand the factors evidence-based interventions is important. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess perceived stress and associated factors among health care professionals working in the context of COVID-19, Southern Ethiopia. METHODS: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted among 798 health care professionals from the 1st May to 1st June 2020. The study participants were selected using simple random sampling technique after allocating a proportion to each health institute based on the size of health care professionals. A pre-tested and structured interviewer-administered questionnaire using KOBO collect survey tool was used to collect data. A total score of >20 points was considered as the cut off for experiencing perceived stress based on perceived stress scale. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify associated factors. The level of statistical significance was set at a p-value of less than 0.05 in multivariable logistic regression. RESULT: Nearly two-thirds 61.8% (95% CI: 58.4%, 65.2%) of HCPs had perceived stress. Not having COVID-19 updated information (AOR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.31, 4.43), not at all confident on coping with stress (AOR = 9.94, 95% CI:3.74, 26.41), somewhat confident in coping with stress (AOR = 4.69, 95% CI:2.81, 7.84), moderately confident on coping with stress (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI: 1.46, 3.82), and not getting along well with people (AOR = 4.88, 95% CI: 1.42, 16.72) were positively association with perceived stress. However, feeling overwhelmed by the demand of everyday life (AOR = 0.52 95% CI: 0.35, 0.77) and worrying about what other people think about them (AOR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.81) were negatively associated with perceived stress. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 update, confidence in coping with stress, getting along with people, worrying about what other people think about them, and feeling overwhelmed by the demand of everyday life were factors significantly associated with perceived stress. The provision of COVID-19 update to HCPs along with wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing is vital.","Teshome, Abinet; Shegaze, Mulugeta; Glagn, Mustefa; Getie, Asmare; Tekabe, Beemnet; Getahun, Dinkalem; Kanko, Tesfaye; Getachew, Tamiru; Yenesew, Nuhamin; Meskele, Simeon; Tolosie, Kabtamu; Temtem, Zebene; Yirgu, Teshome",PLoS One,,246
344394,Is a Mobile Application Useful for Patients with Moderate-Severe Asthma?/ ¿Es útil una aplicación móvil para los pacientes con asma moderada-grave?,2020,"A total of 1080 individual patient samples (158 positive serology samples from confirmed, predominantly mildly symptomatic COVID-19 patients and 922 serology negative including 496 collected pre-COVID) from four states in Australia were analysed on four commercial SARS-CoV-2 serological assays targeting antibodies to different antigens (Roche Elecsys and Abbott Architect: nucleocapsid; Diasorin Liaison and Euroimmun: spike). A subset was compared to immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) and micro-neutralisation. Sensitivity and specificity of the Roche (n = 1033), Abbott (n = 806), Diasorin (n = 1034) and Euroimmun (n = 175) were 93.7 %/99.5 %, 90.2 %/99.4 %, 88.6 %/98.6 % and 91.3 %/98.8 %, respectively. ROC analysis with specificity held at 99 % increased the sensitivity for the Roche and Abbott assays from 93.7% to 98.7% (cut-off 0.21) and 90.2 % to 94.0 % (cut-off 0.91), respectively. Overall seropositivity of samples increased from a maximum of 23 % for samples 0-7 days-post-onset of symptoms (dpos), to 61 % from samples 8-14dpos and 93 % from those >14dpos. IFA and microneutralisation values correlated best with assays targeting antibodies to spike protein with values >80 AU/mL on the Diasorin assay associated with neutralising antibody. Detectable antibody was present in 22/23 (96 %), 20/23 (87 %), 15/23 (65 %) and 9/22 (41 %) patients with samples >180dpos on the Roche, Diasorin, Abbott and microneutralisation assays respectively. Given the low prevalence in this community, two-step algorithms on initial positive results saw an increase in the positive predictive value (PPV) of positive samples (39 %-65 % to &#8805;98 %) for all combinations. Similarly accuracy increased from a range of 98.5 %-99.4 % to &#8805;99.8 % assuming a 1 % seroprevalence. Negative predictive value (NPV) was high (&#8805;99.8 %) regardless of which assay was used initially.","Wehrhahn, Michael C; Brown, Suzanne J; Newcombe, James P; Chong, Smathi; Evans, Jenny; Figtree, Melanie; Hainke, Laurence; Hueston, Linda; Khan, Sadid; Marland, Elizabeth; O039,; Sullivan, Matthew V N; Powell, Helen; Roy, Jhumur; Waring, Lynette; Yu, Megan; Robson, Jennifer",J Clin Virol,,246
344707,Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome in patients with COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: COVID-19 pandemics and cardiometabolic health are mutually interconnected. Chronic metabolic diseases are known risk factors for increased mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In turn, COVID pandemics imposed sudden changes in lifestyle and social isolation with consequent potential cardiometabolic sequelae. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of changes in lifestyle and social life on metabolic profile in hyperprolactinemic or osteoporotic patients without pre-existing cardiometabolic diseases at the time of COVID-19. METHODS: The primary study outcome measurement was the prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome after COVID-19 outbreak. Seventy-four patients (21 men and 53 women, aged 51.8 ± 17.8 years) were admitted to the outpatient clinic of the Neuroendocrine Disease Unit at University ""Federico II"" of Naples, Italy, as per their routine clinical practice because of tumoral and non-tumoral hyperprolactinemia in 52 patients (70.3%), and osteoporosis/osteopenia in 22 (29.7%). Among female patients, 25 (47.2%) were at menopausal age. RESULTS: At the end of lockdown, prevalence of obesity (from 37.8% to 51.3%, p < 0.0001), dyslipidemia (from 28.4 to 48.6%, p = 0.003) and metabolic syndrome (from 14.9 to 27%, p < 0.0001) significantly increased compared to pre-COVID evaluation. No significant change was found in the prevalence of arterial hypertension and IGT/DM. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has led to a rapid increase in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, potentially contributing to the increased COVID-19 related mortality.","Auriemma, R S; Pirchio, R; Liccardi, A; Scairati, R; Del Vecchio, G; Pivonello, R; Colao, A",J. endocrinol. invest,,246

348106,Perceived challenges of COVID-19 infection prevention and control preparedness: A multinational survey,2020,"BACKGROUND: The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection causing the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised serious concern for patients with chronic disease. A correlation has been identified between the severity of COVID-19 and a patient's preexisting comorbidities. Although COVID-19 primarily involves the respiratory system, dysfunction in multiple organ systems is common, particularly in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, immune, renal, and nervous systems. Patients with amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis represent a population particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity due to the multisystem nature of ATTR amyloidosis. MAIN BODY: ATTR amyloidosis is a clinically heterogeneous progressive disease, resulting from the accumulation of amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues. Amyloid deposition causes multisystem clinical manifestations, including cardiomyopathy and polyneuropathy, along with gastrointestinal symptoms and renal dysfunction. Given the potential for exacerbation of organ dysfunction, physicians note possible unique challenges in the management of patients with ATTR amyloidosis who develop multiorgan complications from COVID-19. While the interplay between COVID-19 and ATTR amyloidosis is still being evaluated, physicians should consider that the heightened susceptibility of patients with ATTR amyloidosis to multiorgan complications might increase their risk for poor outcomes with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with ATTR amyloidosis are suspected to have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality due to age and underlying ATTR amyloidosis-related organ dysfunction. While further research is needed to characterize this risk and management implications, ATTR amyloidosis patients might require specialized management if they develop COVID-19. The risks of delaying diagnosis or interrupting treatment for patients with ATTR amyloidosis should be balanced with the risk of exposure in the health care setting. Both physicians and patients must adapt to a new construct for care during and possibly after the pandemic to ensure optimal health for patients with ATTR amyloidosis, minimizing treatment interruptions.","Brannagan, Thomas H; Auer-Grumbach, Michaela; Berk, John L; Briani, Chiara; Bril, Vera; Coelho, Teresa; Damy, Thibaud; Dispenzieri, Angela; Drachman, Brian M; Fine, Nowell; Gaggin, Hanna K; Gertz, Morie; Gillmore, Julian D; Gonzalez, Esther; Hanna, Mazen; Hurwitz, David R; Khella, Sami L; Maurer, Mathew S; Nativi-Nicolau, Jose; Olugemo, Kemi; Quintana, Luis F; Rosen, Andrew M; Schmidt, Hartmut H; Shehata, Jacqueline; Waddington-Cruz, Marcia; Whelan, Carol; Ruberg, Frederick L",Orphanet J Rare Dis,,246

348969,Three-Dimensional CT for Quantification of Longitudinal Lung and Pneumonia Variations in COVID-19 Patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 pandemic had a great impact over all elective neurosurgical activity and important implications in management of neurosurgical urgencies. During the pandemic, some pediatric hospitals reported their experiences. After the emergency phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the health-care system needs to be reorganized in order to manage again all non-urgent activities, while ensuring safety of both patients and HCW. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We developed preventive measures to limit any possibility of COVID-19 spread, according to the principles of epidemiological prevention and suggestions from recent literature. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these measures, we retrospectively reviewed the neurosurgical activity at our Institution from May 4th to July 15th, 2020. RESULTS: 119 patients were admitted in the Neurosurgical ward and 80 surgical procedures were performed. Furthermore, 130 outpatient clinics were scheduled. A total of 258 nasopharyngeal swabs and 249 specific interview were performed. In our series, no cases of positivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection were found and no surgical cases were postponed. Discussion We present the management of the neurosurgical activity after the emergency phase at the Neurosurgical Department of Giannina Gaslini Children's Hospital of Genoa, Italy. CONCLUSION: Italian healthcare system is undertaking a process of reorganization of resources, in an attempt to restore all non urgent activities while ensuring safety. After the emergency phase, we are learning to live together with COVID-19 and, although epidemiological data are encouraging, we must be prepared for an eventual second peak.","Ceraudo, Marco; Balestrino, Alberto; Cama, Armando; Macrina, Gianni; Piatelli, Gianluca; Consales, Alessandro",World neurosurgery (Online),,246

It is necessary to understand the dynamics of the virus which was classified among the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) related coronaviruses and named as SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to manage testing in the right strategy and for interpretation of the results. However, much remains unclear about the virus and the immune response. SARS-CoV-2, which is an enveloped, RNA virus has been shown to attach to the host cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 with spike (S) protein and membrane fusion is provided by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cell. The most commonly used and reliable test for diagnosis of COVID-19 is reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) performed by using nasopharyngeal swabs or other respiratory tract specimens. Viral RNA is usually detected two three days before the onset of symptoms and in the first week from upper respiratory tract samples. If possible, the lower respiratory tract specimens are preferable in the second week, especially if former PCR is negative and pneumonia has developed. The clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests has been reported around 55-75%. Negative RT-PCR test result does not exclude COVID-19 or SARSCoV-2 infection. It should also be noted that viral RNA positivity is not an evidence of active or infectious virus. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be also detected indirectly by testing the host specific immune response to the virus. There is an increasing interest in the use of SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests both for the diagnosis and public health surveillance. However, the antibody tests should not be used as the sole test for diagnosis and case management. Antibody tests are valuable tools in seroepidemiological studies. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM, IgA and IgG antibodies have been shown to be detectable as early as 5th-14th days after the onset of symptoms and most of them become positive on the 21st day. False positivity has been reported more frequently with IgM and IgA tests due to low specificity. It was shown that clinical sensitivity of the diagnostic approach increases when RNA and total antibody tests were integrated as co-tests, especially after the second week of the disease. Specificity, sensitivity, positive and negative predictive values are needed to be evaluated with large and standard studies targeting populations with different prevalences. It is also necessary to create evidence with larger seroconversion studies. In this review article, the information and data obtained until today about SARS-CoV-2 and its microbiological diagnosis have been discussed.","Erensoy, Selda",Mikrobiyol Bul,,246

355517,Heart and lung involvement detected by native T1 and T2 mapping magnetic resonance imaging in a patient with coronavirus disease-19,2021,"The modeling of the viability decay of viruses in sessile droplets is addressed considering a droplet sitting on a smooth surface characterized by a specific contact angle. To investigate, at prescribed temperature, how surface energy of the material and ambient humidity cooperate to determine the virus viability, we propose a model which involves the minimum number of thermodynamically relevant parameters. In particular, by considering a saline water droplet (one salt) as the simplest approximation of real solutions (medium and natural/artificial saliva), the evaporation is described by a first-order time-dependent nonlinear differential equation properly rearranged to obtain the contact angle evolution as the sole unknown function. The analyses were performed for several contact angles and two typical droplet sizes of interest in real situations by assuming constant ambient temperature and relative humidity in the range 0–100%. The results of the simulations, given in terms of time evolution of salt concentration, vapor pressure, and droplet volume, elucidate some previously not yet well-understood dynamics, demonstrating how three main regimes—directly implicated in nontrivial trends of virus viability and to date only highlighted experimentally—can be recognized as the function of relative humidity. By recalling the concept of cumulative dose of salts (CD), to account for the effect of the exposition of viruses to salt concentration on virus viability, we show how the proposed approach could suggest a chart of a virus fate by predicting its survival time at a given temperature as a function of the relative humidity and contact angle. We found a good agreement with experimental data for various enveloped viruses and predicted in particular for the Phi6 virus, a surrogate of coronavirus, the characteristic U-shaped dependence of viability on relative humidity. Given the generality of the model and once experimental data are available that link the vulnerability of a certain virus, such as SARS-CoV-2, to the concentrations of salts or other substances in terms of CD, it is felt that this approach could be employed for antivirus strategies and protocols for the prediction/reduction of human health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses. © Copyright © 2021 Di Novo, Carotenuto, Mensitieri, Fraldi and Pugno.","Di Novo, N.

We construct a nanosensor based on SWCNTs noncovalently functionalized with ACE2, a host protein with high binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein elicits a robust, 2-fold nanosensor fluorescence increase within 90 min of spike protein exposure. We characterize the nanosensor stability and sensing mechanism and passivate the nanosensor to preserve sensing response in saliva and viral transport medium. We further demonstrate that these ACE2-SWCNT nanosensors retain sensing capacity in a surface-immobilized format, exhibiting a 73% fluorescence turn-on response within 5 s of exposure to 35 mg/L SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particles. Our data demonstrate that ACE2-SWCNT nanosensors can be developed into an optical tool for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection.","Pinals, Rebecca L; Ledesma, Francis; Yang, Darwin; Navarro, Nicole; Jeong, Sanghwa; Pak, John E; Kuo, Lili; Chuang, Yung-Chun; Cheng, Yu-Wei; Sun, Hung-Yu; Landry, Markita P",Nano Lett,,246

356682,Let's not forget our COVID-19-free cirrhotic patients!,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Up to fifteen percent of patients with novel pandemic coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have acute respiratory failure (ARF). Ratio between arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) and fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), P/F, is currently used as a marker of ARF severity in Covid-19. P/F does not reflect the respiratory efforts made by patients to maintain arterial blood oxygenation, such as tachypnea and hyperpnea, leading to hypocapnia. Standard PaO2, the value of PaO2 adjusted for arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) of the subject, better reflects the pathophysiology of hypoxemic ARF. We hypothesized that the ratio between standard PaO2 over FiO2 (STP/F) better predicts Covid-19 ARF severity compared to P/F. METHODS: Aim of this pilot prospectic observational study was to observe differences between STP/F and P/F in predicting outcome failure, defined as need of invasive mechanical ventilation and/or deaths in Covid-19 ARF. Accuracy was calculated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis and areas under the ROC curve (AUROC) were compared. RESULTS: 349 consecutive subjects admitted to our respiratory wards due to Covid-19 ARF were enrolled. STP/F was accurate to predict mortality and superior to P/F with, respectively, AUROC 0.710 versus 0.688, p = 0.012.Both STP/F and PF were accurate to predict outcome failure (AUROC respectively of 0.747 and 0.742, p = 0.590). DISCUSSION: This is the first study assessing the role of STP/F in describing severity of ARF in Covid-19. According to results, STP/F is accurate and superior to P/F in predicting in-hospital mortality.","Prediletto, Irene; D039,; Antoni, Letizia; Carbonara, Paolo; Daniele, Federico; Dongilli, Roberto; Flore, Roberto; Pacilli, Angela Maria Grazia; Pisani, Lara; Tomsa, Corina; Vega, María Laura; Ranieri, Vito Marco; Nava, Stefano; Palange, Paolo",Eur. j. intern. med,,246

359785,Cerebral Venous Sinus Thrombosis in the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"There has been praise of how female leaders have handled the Coronavirus pandemic relative to their male counterparts by presenting a more ""caring"" leadership. Of similar coverage has been the role of public trust for how successful governments have been in containing outbreaks. In this paper, we build on these two literatures to understand different determinants of trust during the pandemic between men and women. Following social role theory, we argue that female citizens' trust judgements are more likely to be driven by the perception that leaders are more caring than are men, whilst men's judgements are more likely to be driven by competence judgements than women's. We test this argument using original survey data from three countries. We find that this relationship holds in the United States, but not the United Kingdom or Italy. This adds to variation in gender gaps in the USA and Europe;at the same time, it also suggests that the propensity for women to be less trusting than men is not down to (perceived) leadership traits.

360130,Usefulness of the epidemiological survey and RT-PCR test in pre-surgical patients for assessing the risk of COVID-19,2020,"The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing worldwide and parallels comorbidities such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. Recent studies describe the presence of NAFLD in non-obese individuals, with mechanisms partially independent from excessive caloric intake. Increasing evidences, in particular, point towards a close interaction between dietary and environmental factors (including food contaminants), gut, blood flow, and liver metabolism, with pathways involving intestinal permeability, the composition of gut microbiota, bacterial products, immunity, local, and systemic inflammation. These factors play a critical role in the maintenance of intestinal, liver, and metabolic homeostasis. An anomalous or imbalanced gut microbial composition may favor an increased intestinal permeability, predisposing to portal translocation of microorganisms, microbial products, and cell wall components. These components form microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), with potentials to interact in the intestine lamina propria enriched in immune cells, and in the liver at the level of the immune cells, i.e., Kupffer cells and stellate cells. The resulting inflammatory environment ultimately leads to liver fibrosis with potentials to progression towards necrotic and fibrotic changes, cirrhosis. and hepatocellular carcinoma. By contrast, measures able to modulate the composition of gut microbiota and to preserve gut vascular barrier might prevent or reverse NAFLD.","Di Ciaula, Agostino; Baj, Jacek; Garruti, Gabriella; Celano, Giuseppe; De Angelis, Maria; Wang, Helen H; Di Palo, Domenica Maria; Bonfrate, Leonilde; Wang, David Q-H; Portincasa, Piero",,,246
360562,Late Breaking Abstract - 'Shielding': Patient experience of measures to reduce risk of COVID-19 in those with pre-existing respiratory conditions,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had huge effects on the daily lives of most individuals in the first half of 2020. Widespread lockdown and preventative measures have isolated individuals, affected the world economy, and limited access to physical and mental healthcare. While these measures may be necessary to minimize the spread of the virus, the negative physical, psychological, and social effects are evident. In response, technology has been adapted to try and mitigate these effects, offering individuals digital alternatives to many of the day-to-day activities which can no longer be completed normally. However, the elderly population, which has been worst affected by both the virus, and the lockdown measures, has seen the least benefits from these digital solutions. The age based digital divide describes a longstanding inequality in the access to, and skills to make use of, new technology. While this problem is not new, during the COVID-19 pandemic it has created a large portion of the population suffering from the negative effects of the crisis, and unable to make use of many of the digital measures put in place to help. This paper aims to explore the increased negative effects the digital divide is having in the elderly population during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aims to highlight the need for increased attention and resources to go toward improving digital literacy in the elderly, and the need to put in place measures to offer immediate solutions during the COVID-19 crisis, and solutions to close the digital divide for good in the long-term.","Martins Van Jaarsveld, Gabrielle",Front Psychiatry,,246

The objective of this study is to summarize China's countermeasures and experience in response to the COVID-19 emergence in order to serve as a warning for the global COVID-19 prevention and control, and further provide some suggestions for global fighting to COVID-19. Methods: Content analysis, expert consultation, and high frequency word analysis were applied in this study. Relevant data and information were collected from official websites, the experience accumulated in China during the fighting to the novel coronavirus, and suggestions from some experts. Results: As of March 29, 2020, China had accumulated 82 419 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.01%; in the mean time, the global had accumulated 596 042 confirmed diagnoses, and the mortality rate was 4.76%. Although the mortality of COVID-19 was not so high, its harmfulness couldn't be ignored. Ten facts during COVID-19 epidemic in China were summarized in the study, including: the COVID-19 is highly contagious and can be spread through many channels; although elderly people and people with underlying diseases are susceptible, young people can also be victims; isolation is the most effective way to reduce the risk of COVID-19, and secondary disasters induced by COVID-19 should be emphasized in advance. High frequent words of experts' suggestions mainly includes: material, prevention and control, pathogeny, propaganda, education, hygiene, technology, medical care, overall planning, policy, panic, etc. The main concerns of experts are from four aspects: publicity and education, various subjects, medical materials and law construction. Conclusions: COVID-19 is a new infectious disease worldwide, and its infectious source, transmission route, susceptible population, and therapy are not clear. In the face of the COVID-19 epidemic, no country can stand alone to maintain its own safety. People from all over the world should put aside their difference in ideology, religious belief, politics, economy, and culture, and only by global cooperation and globally unified actions, can we successfully overcome COVID-19 in the end.","Ding, Zhuqing; Xie, Lingling; Guan, Anchen; Huang, Dandan; Mao, Zongfu; Liang, Xiaohui",J Glob Health,,246

This evaluation looks at how COVID-19 impacted food literacy in a country affected by the global pandemic. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic research that would allow a better understanding of the impact of uncertainty or enhanced perceived risks generated by a global crisis on the prevalence of household food literacy. This study looks at food literacy from a perceptive of how an event that has domesticated many of them can alter knowledge and the relationship people have with food. A cross-national survey including 10,004 Canadians was conducted ten months after the start of the pandemic. Results show that Canadians have learned new recipes. Canadians have also taken up gardening and have relied on several sources to gather information. This study provides some evidence that Canadians have become more food literate because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but less significantly than anticipated. Practical and policy implications are presented as well as some future research directions.","Charlebois, Sylvain; Music, Janet; Faires, Shannon",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,246

This problem is particularly important during COVID-19, when medical entities provide telehealth services to patients. The objective of the study is to examine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the performance of the primary health care providers in Poland under a capitation payment scheme. In this study the authors use data from interviews with personnel of medical entities and financial and administrative reports of primary health care providers in order to identify how this crisis situation impacts the performance of primary health care entities, under capitation payment system. The performance indicators include both the financial and quality measures. Selected to the case study primary health care service providers significantly improved their profitability due to considerable costs savings and reduction of services provided to patients in a time of COVID-19 pandemic. Capitation payment system proved to be inefficient, in the studied pandemic period, in terms of the services provided by primary health care service providers to patients and the funds paid to them, in exchange, by the government entities.","Korneta, Piotr; Kludacz-Alessandri, Magdalena; Walczak, Renata",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,246

Each group has a different function, but during the pandemic they all became extremely important for their participants as a container for all that the pandemic stirred. The parents attending the clinical group found themselves, during Covid-19, at home, without support, caring full-time for children with complex care needs. The Greek observation seminar suffered an abrupt halt to their meetings with families, but soon the members realized that by meeting remotely as a seminar group they could think together of alternative ways to keep the connection with the infants and families. The peer supervision group, evocatively named the 'Town Hall Group', consists of a number of child therapists, working across different settings, who had a central point where they could meet and share their experiences. he Town Hall Group's shared history and geography felt important, as the group now had to come together remotely and set to work on building a collective understanding of how to navigate remote therapy.

Numerical results are presented by way of comparison. Autonomous and non-autonomous generalizations of SIR for interacting regions are also considered, including non-separability for two or more interacting regions. A reduction of simple SIR models to one variable leads us to a generalized logistic model, Richards model, which we use to fit Mexico's COVID-19 data up to day number 134. Forecasting scenarios resulting from various fittings are discussed. A critique to the applicability of these models to current pandemic outbreaks in terms of robustness is provided. Finally, we obtain the bifurcation diagram for a discretized version of Richards model, displaying period doubling bifurcation to chaos.","Sadurn'i, E.; Luna-Acosta, G.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02897v1.pdf,246

Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor protein that interacts with the spike glycoprotein of the host to facilitate the entry of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) hence causing the disease (COVID-19). Our experimental design is based on bioinformatics approach that combines sequence, structure and consensus based tools to label a protein coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) as damaging/deleterious or neutral. The interaction of wildtype ACE2-spike glycoprotein and their variants were analyzed using docking studies. The mutations W461R, G405E and F588S in ACE2 receptor protein and population specific mutations P391S, C12S and G1223A in the spike glycoprotein were predicted as highly destabilizing to the structure of the bound complex. So far, no extensive in silico study has been reported that identifies the effect of SNPs on Spike glycoprotein-ACE2 interaction exploring both sequence and structural features. To this end, this study conducted an in-depth analysis that facilitates in identifying the mutations that blocks the interaction of two proteins that can result in stopping the virus from entering the host cell.

Extensive epidemiological evidence documents maternal prenatal cigarette smoking as a major risk factor for SUID, but leaves unclear whether quitting reduces risk. This Commentary draws attention to a report by Anderson et al. (Pediatrics. 2019, 143[4]) that represents a breakthrough on this question and uses their data on SUID risk reduction to delineate potential economic benefits. Using a five-year (2007-11) U.S. CDC Birth Cohort Linked Birth/Infant Death dataset, Anderson et al. demonstrated that compared to those who continued smoking, women who quit or reduced smoking by third trimester decreased the adjusted odds of SUID risk by 23% (95% CI, 13%-33%) and 12% (95% CI, 2%-21%), respectively. We applied these reductions to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' recommended value of a statistical life in 2020 ($10.1 million). Compared to continued smoking during pregnancy, the economic benefits per woman of quitting or reducing smoking are $4700 (95% CI $2700-$6800) and $2500 (95% CI, $400-$4300), respectively. While the U.S. obtained aggregate annual economic benefits of $0.58 (95% CI, 0.35-0.82) billion from pregnant women who quit or reduced smoking, it missed an additional $1.16 (95%CI 0.71-1.60) billion from the women who continued smoking. Delineating the health and economic impacts of decreasing smoking during pregnancy using large epidemiological studies like Anderson et al. is critically important for conducting meaningful economic analyses of the benefits-costs of developing more effective interventions for decreasing smoking during pregnancy.","Higgins, Stephen T; Slade, Eric P; Shepard, Donald S",Prev Med,,246
371075,Liver injury in liver transplant patients with COVID-19: a histopathological confirmation,2021,"Adjusting for an unmeasured confounder is generally an intractable problem, but in the spatial setting it may be possible under certain conditions. In this paper, we derive necessary conditions on the coherence between the treatment variable of interest and the unmeasured confounder that ensure the causal effect of the treatment is estimable. We specify our model and assumptions in the spectral domain to allow for different degrees of confounding at different spatial resolutions. The key assumption that ensures identifiability is that confounding present at global scales dissipates at local scales. We show that this assumption in the spectral domain is equivalent to adjusting for global-scale confounding in the spatial domain by adding a spatially smoothed version of the treatment variable to the mean of the response variable. Within this general framework, we propose a sequence of confounder adjustment methods that range from parametric adjustments based on the Matern coherence function to more robust semi-parametric methods that use smoothing splines. These ideas are applied to areal and geostatistical data for both simulated and real datasets","Guan, Yawen; Page, Garritt L.; Reich, Brian J; Ventrucci, Massimo; Yang, Shu",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11767v1.pdf,246

373288,Treatment of B-cell depleted COVID-19 patients with convalescent plasma and plasma-based products,2021,"Traditionally, the regime of mental healthcare has followed an episodic psychotherapy model wherein patients seek care from a provider through a prescribed treatment plan developed over multiple provider visits. Recent advances in wearable and mobile technology have generated increased interest in digital mental healthcare that enables individuals to address episodic mental health symptoms. However, these efforts are typically reactive and symptom-focused and do not provide comprehensive, wrap-around, customized treatments that capture an individual's holistic mental health model as it unfolds over time. Recognizing that each individual is unique, we present the notion of Personalized Mental Health Navigation (MHN): a therapist-in-the-loop, cybernetic goal-based system that deploys a continuous cyclic loop of measurement, estimation, guidance, to steer the individual's mental health state towards a healthy zone. We outline the major components of MHN that is premised on the development of an individual's personal mental health state, holistically represented by a high-dimensional cover of multiple knowledge layers such as emotion, biological patterns, sociology, behavior, and cognition. We demonstrate the feasibility of the personalized MHN approach via a 12-month pilot case study for holistic stress management in college students and highlight an instance of a therapist-in-the-loop intervention using MHN for monitoring, estimating, and proactively addressing moderately severe depression over a sustained period of time. We believe MHN paves the way to transform mental healthcare from the current passive, episodic, reactive process (where individuals seek help to address symptoms that have already manifested) to a continuous and navigational paradigm that leverages a personalized model of the individual, promising to deliver timely interventions to individuals in a holistic manner.","Rahmani, Amir M.; Lai, Jocelyn; Jafarlou, Salar; Yunusova, Asal; Rivera, Alex.

A modelling and simulation framework is provided using SARS-CoV-2 as an example, considering applications for both treatment and prophylaxis. METHODS: A target cell-limited model was used to quantify the viral infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a pooled population of 105 infected patients. Parameter estimates from the resulting model were used to simulate and compare the impact of various interventions against meaningful viral load endpoints. RESULTS: Robust parameter estimates were obtained for the basic reproduction number, viral release rate and infected-cell mortality from the infection model. These estimates were informed by the largest dataset currently available for SARS-CoV-2 viral time course. The utility of this model was demonstrated using simulations, which hypothetically introduced inhibitory or stimulatory drug mechanisms at various target sites within the viral life-cycle. We show that early intervention is crucial to achieving therapeutic benefit when monotherapy is administered. In contrast, combination regimens of two or three drugs may provide improved outcomes if treatment is initiated late. The latter is relevant to SARS-CoV-2, where the period between infection and symptom onset is relatively long. CONCLUSIONS: The use of in silico models can provide viral load predictions that can rationalize therapeutic strategies against an emerging viral pathogen.","Patel, Kashyap; Dodds, Michael; Gonçalves, Antonio; Kamal, Mohamed A; Rayner, Craig R; Kirkpatrick, Carl M; Smith, Patrick F",,,246

376342,Orally Administered Cinnamon Extract Attenuates Cognitive and Neuronal Deficits Following Traumatic Brain Injury,2020,"The constancy of the activation energy of metabolism (E) for all living organisms is one of the most impressive, though controversial, statements of the modern metabolic theory of evolution. According to WBE-theory suggested by West, Brown, and Enquist, E should be in the range from -0.6 to -0.7 eV. However, there are many examples of significant deviations of E from the predictions of the theory. Now we have conducted a study of this value using rats in different types of pharmacological hypothermia: 1. Short-term (for several hours) hypothermia induced by anesthetic xylazine; 2. Daily torpor-like state induced by the pharmacological composition developed in our previous study. It has been found that in pharmacological daily hypothermia E = -0.56 ± 0.03 eV, which was close to that in daily heterotherms found in literature, E = -0.57 ± 0.04 eV. In short-term hypothermia E was substantially lower, E = -0.17 ± 0.071 eV. Our analysis revealed that in short-term hypothermia, changes in body temperature may lag behind changes in metabolic rate for a period &#916;t, affecting E. We propose an approach for estimating &#916;t and obtaining an adjusted E = -0.68 ± 0.17 eV, which corresponds to theoretical predictions. We assume that a similar consideration of &#916;t should be done when calculating E of daily heterotherms. We assume that in ectotherms, when the ambient temperature changes rapidly, changes in metabolic rate may lag behind changes in body temperature for a period (-) &#916;t, that should also be considered in E calculations. The proposed approach may contribute to the further development of the metabolic theory of evolution and may be useful in comparing artificial and natural hypothermia, as well as in studying the energy transformations in ecosystems.","Tarahovsky, Yury S; Khrenov, Maxim O; Kovtun, Anatoly L; Zakharova, Nadezhda M",J Therm Biol,,246

377614,Performance of preclinical models in predicting drug-induced liver injury in humans: a systematic review,2021,"Explosive epidemics of chikungunya, Zika, and COVID-19 have recently occurred worldwide, all of which featured large proportions of subclinical infections. Spatial studies of infectious disease epidemics typically use symptomatic infections (cases) to estimate incidence rates (cases/total population), often misinterpreting them as infection risks (infections/total population) or disease risks (cases/infected population). We examined these three measures in a pediatric cohort (N{approx}3,000) over two chikungunya epidemics and one Zika epidemic and in a household cohort (N=1,793) over one COVID-19 epidemic in Nicaragua. Across different analyses and all epidemics, case incidence rates considerably underestimated both risk-based measures. Spatial infection risk differed from spatial disease risk, and typical case-only approaches precluded a full understanding of the spatial seroprevalence patterns. For epidemics of pathogens that cause many subclinical infections, relying on case-only datasets and misinterpreting incidence rates, as is common, results in substantial bias, a general finding applicable to many pathogens of high human concern.","Carrillo, Fausto Andres Bustos; Mercado, Brenda Lopez; Monterrey, Jairo Carey; Collado, Damaris; Saborio, Saira; Miranda, Tatiana; Barilla, Carlos; Ojeda, Sergio; Sanchez, Nery; Plazaola, Miguel; Laguna, Harold Suazo; Elizondo, Douglas; Arguello, Sonia; Gajewski, Anna M.; Maier, Hannah E.; Latta, Krista; Carlson, Bradley; Coloma, Josefina; Katzelnick, Leah; Sturrock, Hugh; Balmaseda, Angel; Kuan, Guillermina; Gordon, Aubree; Harris, Eva",,,246

A sample of 849 participants from Georgia completed an online survey during the final stage of lockdown. To measure the main variables, we used the State Anxiety Inventory, the Horizontal and Vertical Individualism and Collectivism Scale, the Meaning of Life Questionnaire, the COVID-19 Worry Scale, and the Ways of Coping Scale tailored to COVID-19 pandemic. The latter measured rational coping via the subscales of information accessing/processing and action-planning coping, and affective coping - via the subscales of passive-submissive and avoidant coping. Results suggested that anxiety positively predicted both affective coping styles and negatively predicted the action-planning coping style, while COVID-19 worry predicted all coping styles;presence of meaning in life positively predicted both rational coping styles and negatively predicted the avoidant coping style, while search for meaning positively predicted all coping styles;individualism negatively predicted the passive-submissive style and positively predicted the action-planning style, whereas collectivism predicted all coping styles;furthermore, individualism and collectivism moderated the link between anxiety and the passive-submissive coping style, presence of meaning in life moderated the link between anxiety and avoidant coping style, while search for meaning in life moderated the link between anxiety and the action-planning coping style. Overall, the findings enrich the cultural transactional theory of stress and coping, and generate insights for the culture-sensitive approach to the meaning in life. The results were conceptualized vis-a-vis Georgia's intermediate position between clear-cut individualism and clear-cut collectivism.","Shekriladze, I.; Javakhishvili, N.; Chkhaidze, N.",Frontiers in Psychology,,246

We aimed to assess the clinical and epidemiological characteristics and the predicting factors related to COVID-19 among HCPs in Egypt. A comparative cross-sectional study was conducted among HCPs via an online questionnaire. Out of 440 responses, a total of 385 complete responses were analyzed. The responders' mean age was 37.5±9.4 years, 215 (55.8%) of the participants were males. They included 77 (20%) confirmed COVID-19 cases; most of them had mild (58.6%) or moderate symptoms (30%), and (9.1%) were asymptomatic. Almost all sustained infection while on duty (97.4%). The sources of infection were either infected patients (39%), colleagues (22.1%), household contacts (5.2%) or uncertain (33.8%). The sources were symptomatic in only 62.3% of cases. Asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic sources accounted for 37.7% of the cases. Exposure occurred during healthcare provision in 66.3% of the cases. The presence of co-morbidities (OR = 2.53, CI 1.47-4.38, P = 0.001), working more than 8 hours per day in isolation hospital (OR = 3.09, CI 1.02-9.35, P = 0.046), training on hand hygiene (OR = 2.31, CI 1.05-5.08, P = 0.038) and adherence to IPC measures (OR = 2.11, CI 1.16-3.81, P = 0.014) were the significant predictors of COVID-19.

386513,Prevalence of COVID-19 Infection in Hemodialysis Patients Detected Using Serologic Screening,2020,"In late 2019 a human coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, emerged, likely from a zoonotic reservoir. This virus causes COVID-19 disease, has infected millions of people, and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths across the globe. While the best interventions to control and ultimately stop the pandemic are prophylactic vaccines, antiviral therapeutics are important to limit morbidity and mortality in those already infected. At this time, only one FDA approved anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drug, remdesivir, is available and unfortunately, its efficacy appears to be limited. Thus, the identification of new and efficacious antivirals is of highest importance. In order to facilitate rapid drug discovery, flexible, sensitive, and high-throughput screening methods are required. With respect to drug targets, most attention is focused on either the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase or the main viral protease, 3CLpro 3CLpro is an attractive target for antiviral therapeutics as it is essential for processing newly translated viral proteins, and the viral lifecycle cannot be completed without protease activity. In this work, we present a new assay to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro Our reporter is based on a GFP-derived protein that only fluoresces after cleavage by 3CLpro This experimentally optimized reporter assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible protocols. Using this screening approach in combination with existing drug libraries may lead to the rapid identification of novel antivirals to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication and spread.IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic has already led to more than 700,000 deaths and innumerable changes to daily life worldwide. Along with development of a vaccine, identification of effective antivirals to treat infected patients is of the highest importance. However, rapid drug discovery requires efficient methods to identify novel compounds that can inhibit the virus. In this work, we present a method for identifying inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, 3CLpro This reporter-based assay allows for antiviral drug screening in human cell culture at biosafety level-2 (BSL2) with high-throughput compatible sample processing and analysis. This assay may help identify novel antivirals to control the COVID-19 pandemic.","Froggatt, Heather M; Heaton, Brook E; Heaton, Nicholas S",J. virol,,246

388145,Guillain Barré Syndrome and its variants as a manifestation of COVID-19: A systematic review of case reports and case series,2020,"Several genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens have been conducted to identify host factors regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication, but the models used have often relied on overexpression of ACE2 receptor. Additionally, such screens have yet to identify the protease TMPRSS2, known to be important for viral entry at the plasma membrane. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of these screens and showed a high level of cell-type specificity of the identified hits, arguing for the necessity of additional models to uncover the full landscape of SARS-CoV-2 host factors. We performed genome-wide knockout and activation CRISPR screens in Calu-3 lung epithelial cells, as well as knockout screens in Caco-2 intestinal cells. In addition to identifying ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as top hits, our study reveals a series of so far unidentified and critical host-dependency factors, including the Adaptins AP1G1 and AP1B1 and the flippase ATP8B1. Moreover, new anti-SARS-CoV-2 proteins with potent activity, including several membrane-associated Mucins, IL6R, and CD44 were identified. We further observed that these genes mostly acted at the critical step of viral entry, with the notable exception of ATP8B1, the knockout of which prevented late stages of viral replication. Exploring the pro- and anti-viral breadth of these genes using highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, seasonal HCoV-NL63 and -229E and influenza A orthomyxovirus, we reveal that some genes such as AP1G1 and ATP8B1 are general coronavirus cofactors. In contrast, Mucins recapitulated their known role as a general antiviral defense mechanism. These results demonstrate the value of considering multiple cell models and perturbational modalities for understanding SARS-CoV-2 replication and provide a list of potential new targets for therapeutic interventions.","Goujon, C.; Rebendenne, A.; Roy, P.; Bonaventure, B.; Valadao, A.

Here, we describe the clinical characteristics of and outcomes in patients with diabetes in whom COVID-19 was confirmed or clinically diagnosed (with typical features on lung imaging and symptoms) and their association with glucose-lowering or blood pressure-lowering medications. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study involving 904 patients with COVID-19 (136 with diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes), clinical and laboratory characteristics were collected and compared between the group with diabetes and the group without diabetes, and between groups taking different medications. Logistic regression was used to explore risk factors associated with mortality or poor prognosis. RESULTS: The proportion of comorbid diabetes is similar between cases of confirmed and of clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Risk factors for higher mortality of patients with diabetes and COVID-19 were older age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.09 [95% CI 1.04, 1.15] per year increase; P = 0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (aOR 1.12 [95% CI 1.00, 1.24]; P = 0.043). Insulin usage (aOR 3.58 [95% CI 1.37, 9.35]; P = 0.009) was associated with poor prognosis. Clinical outcomes of those who use an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type-I receptor blocker (ARB) were comparable with those of patients who do not use ACEI/ARB among COVID-19 patients with diabetes and hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: C-reactive protein may help to identify patients with diabetes who are at greater risk of dying during hospitalization. Older patients with diabetes were prone to death related to COVID-19. Attention needs to be paid to patients with diabetes and COVID-19 who use insulin. ACEI/ARB use showed no significant impact on patients with diabetes and hypertension who have COVID-19.","Chen, Yuchen; Yang, Dong; Cheng, Biao; Chen, Jian; Peng, Anlin; Yang, Chen; Liu, Chong; Xiong, Mingrui; Deng, Aiping; Zhang, Yu; Zheng, Ling; Huang, Kun",Diabetes Care,,246

We used an excerpt of a data set generated in May 2020 for reviewing the SARS-CoV-2 prevention concept of orchestras, singers and actors. People were sampled for droplet release for one-hour activities using a Grimm spectrometer covering a spectrum of 1 to 32 µm diameter. We estimated the number of ""quanta"" in the exhaled liquid from viral concentrations of 106 to 1011/mL, based on the Human Infective Dose 50 of 218 viral particles. We employed the Wells-Riley equation to estimate the risk of infection in typical meeting rooms for a one-hour meeting of 2, 4 and 6 people observing a 2 m distance. The four participating adults released a mean of 1.28 nLm3 while breathing, 1.68 nL/m3 while speaking normally, and two adults released a mean of 4.44 nL/m3 while talking with a raised voice. The combination of 50% breathing, 45% talking normally and 5% speaking with a raised voice increased the risk of infection above 5% for a one-hour meeting of two people. The result is based on 6 quanta released, corresponding to an initial virus concentration of 1000/nL (109/mL) in the fluid of the upper respiratory tract. Our data confirm the importance of using facemasks in combination with other measures to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at the workplace.","Eiche, Thomas; Kuster, Martin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,246

Additional mutations are found in these variants at residues 417 and 484 that appear to promote antibody evasion. In contrast, the Californian VoCs (B.1.427/429) lack the N501Y mutation, yet exhibit antibody evasion. We engineered spike proteins to express these RBD VoC mutations either in isolation, or in different combinations, and analyzed the effects using biochemical assays and cryo-EM structural analyses. Overall, our findings suggest that the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variant spikes can be rationalized as the result of mutations that confer either increased ACE2 affinity, increased antibody evasion, or both, providing a framework to dissect the molecular factors that drive VoC evolution.","Mannar, Dhiraj; Saville, James W.; Zhu, Xing; Srivastava, Shanti S.; Berezuk, Alison M.; Zhou, Steven; Tuttle, Katharine; Kim, Andrew; Li, Wei; Dimitrov, Dimiter S.; Subramaniam, Sriram",,,246

In premenopausal women increased signalling of angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7) via the Mas receptor has been linked to lower cardiovascular risk. Since stimulation of the Ang-(1-7)/Mas axis protects the endothelial barrier in acute lung injury (ALI), we hypothesised that increased Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling may protect females over males in ALI/ARDS.Clinical data were collected from Charité inpatients. Sex differences in ALI were assessed in wild-type (WT) and Mas-deficient (Mas-/- ) mice. Endothelial permeability was assessed as weight change in isolated lungs and as trans-endothelial electrical resistance in vitroIn 734â090 Charité inpatients (2005-2016), ARDS had a higher incidence in men as compared to women. In murine ALI, male WT mice had more lung edema, protein leak, and histological evidence of injury than female WT mice. Lung weight change in response to platelet-activating factor (PAF) was more pronounced in male WT and female Mas-/- mice than female WT, whereas Mas receptor expression was higher in female WT lungs. Ovariectomy attenuated protection in female WT mice and reduced Mas receptor expression. In vitro, estrogen increased Mas receptor expression and attenuated endothelial leak in response to thrombin; this effect was alleviated by Mas receptor blockade.Improved lung endothelial barrier function protects female mice from ALI-induced lung edema. This effect is partially mediated via enhanced Ang-(1-7)/Mas signalling as a result of estrogen-dependent Mas expression.","Erfinanda, Lasti; Ravindran, Krishnan; Kohse, Franziska; Gallo, Kathleen; Preissner, Robert; Walther, Thomas; Kuebler, Wolfgang M",Eur. respir. j,,246

As there is a paucity of evidence on which population is more likely to progress into severe conditions among cases, we looked into the first cluster of death cases, aiming to add to current evidence and reduce panic among the population. Methods: We prospectively collected the demographic and clinical data of the first 38 fatalities whose information was made public by the Health Commission of Hubei province and the official Weibo account of China Central Television news center, starting from 9 January through 24 January 2020. The death cases were described from four aspects (gender and age characteristics, underlying diseases, the time course of death, symptoms at the incipience of illness and hospital admission). Results: Among the 38 fatalities, 71.05% were male, and 28.95% were female, with the median age of 70 years (interquartile range (IQR) = 65-81). Persons aged 66-75 made up the largest share. Twenty-five cases had a history of chronic diseases. The median time between the first symptoms and death was 12.50 days (IQR = 10.00-16.25), while the median time between the admission and death was 8.50 (IQR = 5.00-12.00) days. In persons aged over 56 years, the time between the first symptoms and death decreased with age, and so did the time between the admission and death, though the latter increased again in persons aged over 85 years. The major first symptoms included fever (52.63%), cough (31.58%), dyspnea (23.68%), myalgia and fatigue (15.79%). Conclusions: Among the death cases, persons with underlying diseases and aged over 65 made up the majority. The time between the first symptoms and death decreased with the advanced age. In all the age groups, males dominated the fatalities.","Chen, Yifei; Zhao, Meizhen; Wu, Yifan; Zang, Shuang",J Glob Health,,246

Successful governance is only possible with a competent early warning system, which hinges upon efficient production, sharing, and use of relevant knowledge and information. In this process, functional scientific/professional communities are critical gatekeepers. Analyzing China’s failed early warning for the COVID-19 outbreak, we show that an epidemic governance system dominated by bureaucratic forces is doomed to failure. In particular, we identify the lack of autonomy of scientific/professional communities—in this case, virologists, physicians, and epidemiologists—as one of the major contributing factors to the malfunction of the early warning system. Drawing upon the idea of community governance, we argue that only by empowering scientific/professional groups to exert efficient community governance can a state modernize its early warning system and perform better in combatting epidemics.","Gu, Edward; Li, Lantian",J.

At the same time, it is also aimed to decide the best resource allocation in cargo services and to show the differences between both periods. This is the first study using the FIPIA method in determining the service quality priorities of consumers using cargo service. A total of 723 participants responded to the questionnaire consisting of 341 participants before the Covid-19 and 382 participants during the Covid-19 period. This study also examined whether there is a relationship between the sectors most frequently used in cargo service in both periods and service quality priorities and found the differences in consumers' sectors most frequently. According to data found in the study, the application of promotion and courteousness, and politeness of the personnel had the highest value in all service quality priorities before the Covid-19 outbreak. According to results, “evaluation of customer complaints in a short time” and “fast delivery” had the highest value in all service quality priorities after the Covid-19 outbreak. Evaluation of customer complaints in a short time and fast delivery had high importance values while performance and impact had relatively low importance, presenting a need to concentrate on these three-service qualities. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Özden, A.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature was to investigate the clinical outcomes associated with corticosteroid treatment of COVID-19. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, medRxiv, Web of Science, and Scopus databases through March 10, 2021 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of corticosteroid therapies for COVID-19 treatment. Outcomes of interest were mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, serious adverse events (SAEs), and superinfection. RESULTS: A total of 7737 patients from 8 RCTs were included in the quantitative meta-analysis, of which 2795 (36.1%) patients received corticosteroids plus standard of care (SOC) while 4942 (63.9%) patients received placebo and/or SOC alone. The odds of mortality were significantly lower in patients that received corticosteroids as compared to SOC (odds ratio [OR]â=â0.85 [95% CI: 0.76; 0.95], Pâ=â.003). Corticosteroid treatment reduced the odds of a need for mechanical ventilation as compared to SOC (ORâ=â0.76 [95% CI: 0.59; 0.97], Pâ=â.030). There was no significant difference between the corticosteroid and SOC groups with regards to SAEs and superinfections. CONCLUSION: Corticosteroid treatment can reduce the odds for mortality and the need for mechanical ventilation in severe COVID-19 patients.","Pulakurthi, Yashwitha Sai; Pederson, John M; Saravu, Kavitha; Gupta, Nitin; Balasubramanian, Prasanth; Kamrowski, Shelby; Schmidt, Megan; Vegivinti, Charan Thej Reddy; Dibas, Mahmoud; Reierson, Natalie L; Pisipati, Sailaja; Joseph, Betsy Ann; Selvan, Pragadeesh Thamarai; Dmytriw, Adam A; Keesari, Praneeth Reddy; Sriram, Varsha; Chittajallu, Spandana; Brinjikji, Waleed; Katamreddy, Rewanth R; Chibbar, Richa; Davis, Amber R; Malpe, Manashree; Mishra, Hemant K; Kallmes, Kevin M; Hassan, Ameer E; Evanson, Kirk W",Medicine (Baltimore),,246

METHODS: We studied 1,122 patients (mean age: 46 years) diagnosed by PCR. URT viral load, measured by PCR cycle threshold, was categorized as high, moderate or low. RESULTS: There were 336 (29.9%) patients with comorbidities; 309 patients (27.5%) had high, 316 (28.2%) moderate, and 497 (44.3%) low viral load. In univariate analyses, compared to patients with moderate or low viral load, patients with high viral load were older, had more often comorbidities, developed symptomatic disease, were intubated and died; in addition, patients with high viral load had longer stay in intensive care unit and longer intubation compared to patients with low viral load (p-values <0.05 for all). Patients with chronic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic pulmonary disease, immunosuppression, obesity and chronic neurological disease had more often high viral load (p-value<0.05 for all). Multivariate analysis found that a high viral load was associated with COVID-19. The level of viral load was not associated with any other outcome. CONCLUSIONS: URT viral load could be used to identify patients at higher risk for morbidity or severe outcome.","Maltezou, Helena C; Raftopoulos, Vasilios; Vorou, Rengina; Papadima, Kalliopi; Mellou, Kassiani; Spanakis, Nikolaos; Kossyvakis, Athanasios; Gioula, Georgia; Exindari, Maria; Froukala, Elisavet; Martinez-Gonzalez, Beatriz; Panayiotakopoulos, Georgios; Papa, Anna; Mentis, Andreas; Tsakris, Athanasios",J. infect. dis,,246

409680,No Systemic Lupus Erythematosus with COVID-19 in Hong Kong: The Effect of Masking?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The number of deaths from COVID-19 continues to surge worldwide. In particular, if a patient's condition is sufficiently severe to require invasive ventilation, it is more likely to lead to death than to recovery. OBJECTIVE: The goal of our study was to analyze the factors related to COVID-19 severity in patients and to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict the severity of COVID-19 at an early stage. METHODS: We developed an AI model that predicts severity based on data from 5601 COVID-19 patients from all national and regional hospitals across South Korea as of April 2020. The clinical severity of COVID-19 was divided into two categories: low and high severity. The condition of patients in the low-severity group corresponded to no limit of activity, oxygen support with nasal prong or facial mask, and noninvasive ventilation. The condition of patients in the high-severity group corresponded to invasive ventilation, multi-organ failure with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation required, and death. For the AI model input, we used 37 variables from the medical records, including basic patient information, a physical index, initial examination findings, clinical findings, comorbid diseases, and general blood test results at an early stage. Feature importance analysis was performed with AdaBoost, random forest, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost); the AI model for predicting COVID-19 severity among patients was developed with a 5-layer deep neural network (DNN) with the 20 most important features, which were selected based on ranked feature importance analysis of 37 features from the comprehensive data set. The selection procedure was performed using sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, balanced accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). RESULTS: We found that age was the most important factor for predicting disease severity, followed by lymphocyte level, platelet count, and shortness of breath or dyspnea. Our proposed 5-layer DNN with the 20 most important features provided high sensitivity (90.2%), specificity (90.4%), accuracy (90.4%), balanced accuracy (90.3%), and AUC (0.96). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed AI model with the selected features was able to predict the severity of COVID-19 accurately. We also made a web application so that anyone can access the model. We believe that sharing the AI model with the public will be helpful in validating and improving its performance.","Chung, Heewon; Ko, Hoon; Kang, Wu Seong; Kim, Kyung Won; Lee, Hooseok; Park, Chul; Song, Hyun-Ok; Choi, Tae-Young; Seo, Jae Ho; Lee, Jinseok",J Med Internet Res,,246

The challenges this poses for policymakers is formidable. ▪ Financial vulnerabilities were evident in the corporate sector in many economies even before the virus struck, with rising debt, declining credit quality and worsening liquidity positions. Consumer-facing sectors especially at risk from the impact of the virus tend to have weaker financial positions. ▪ There are also household fragilities. A large fraction of households - often 40%–50% - have limited liquid assets to tide them over if they cannot work. Access to sickness and unemployment benefits varies widely across economies. ▪ High levels of bad loans in some banking systems, most notably in Italy, could be exacerbated by the virus impact, threatening financial stability. High dollar debts in many economies outside the US are another risk factor. ▪ As well as containing the virus, policymakers need to consider imaginative approaches to prevent financial distress worsening the economic downturn, potentially including a need to rapidly backstop banks, firms, and households.",,Econ.

Most successful randomized controlled trials of early palliative care have used a model of specialized teams providing in-person palliative care in free-standing or embedded outpatient clinics. During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth has become a prominent model for palliative care delivery. This model of care has been well received by patients and palliative care providers, although evidence to date is limited. Despite evidence from trials that routine early integration of palliative care into oncology care improves patient outcomes, referral to palliative care still occurs mostly according to the judgment of individual oncologists. This hinders equitable access to palliative care and to its known benefits for patients and their caregivers. Automated referral based on triggering criteria is being actively explored as an alternative. In particular, routine technology-assisted symptom screening, combined with targeted needs-based automatic referral to outpatient palliative care, may improve integration and ultimately increase quality of life.","Mathews, Jean; Hannon, Breffni; Zimmermann, Camilla",Curr Treat Options Oncol,,246

417314,At least 156 reasons to prioritize COVID-19 vaccination in patients receiving in-centre haemodialysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent causing COVID-19, has infected more than 27 million people with over 894000 deaths worldwide since its emergence in December 2019. Factors for severe diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity have been identified however, the precise pathogenesis is poorly understood. To understand its pathophysiology and to develop effective therapeutic strategies, it is essential to define the prevailing immune cellular subsets. METHODS: We performed whole circulating immune cells scRNAseq from five critically ill COVID-19 patients, trajectory and gene ontology analysis. RESULTS: Immature myeloid populations, such as promyelocytes-myelocytes, metamyelocytes, band neutrophils, monocytoid precursors, and activated monocytes predominated. The trajectory with pseudotime analysis supported the finding of immature cell states. While the gene ontology showed myeloid cell activation in immune response, DNA and RNA processing, defense response to the virus, and response to type 1 interferon. Lymphoid lineage was scarce. Expression of genes such as C/EBPß, IRF1and FOSL2 potentially suggests the induction of trained immunity. CONCLUSIONS: Our results uncover transcriptomic profiles related to immature myeloid lineages and suggest the potential induction of trained immunity.","Vadillo, Eduardo; Taniguchi-Ponciano, Keiko; Lopez-Macias, Constantino; Carvente-Garcia, Roberto; Mayani, Hector; Ferat-Osorio, Eduardo; Flores-Padilla, Guillermo; Torres, Javier; Gonzalez-Bonilla, Cesar Raul; Majluf, Abraham; Albarran-Sanchez, Alejandra; Galan, Juan Carlos; Peña-Martínez, Eduardo; Silva-Román, Gloria; Vela-Patiño, Sandra; Ferreira-Hermosillo, Aldo; Ramirez-Renteria, Claudia; Espinoza-Sanchez, Nancy Adriana; Pelayo-Camacho, Rosana; Bonifaz, Laura; Arriaga-Pizano, Lourdes; Mata-Lozano, Carlos; Andonegui-Elguera, Sergio; Wacher, Niels; Blanco-Favela, Francisco; De-Lira-Barraza, Roberto; Villanueva-Compean, Humberto; Esquivel-Pineda, Alejandra; Ramírez-Montes-de-Oca, Rubén; Anda-Garay, Carlos; Noyola-García, Maura; Guizar-García, Luis; Cerbulo-Vazquez, Arturo; Zamudio-Meza, Horacio; Marrero-Rodríguez, Daniel; Mercado, Moises",Arch. med. res,,246

419966,"COVID-19 in a Veterans Affairs Hospital at Suffolk County, Long Island, New York",2021,"The epidemics of the first half of the 19th century made sanitation an essential point in the urban life. It laid the way for a city based on sunlight, ventilation and an urban planning of straight-lined, wide street and green areas. Until the beginning of 2020 we have lived in the belief that this urban model protected us. However, there were already many indications that the city was not capable of giving a satisfactory answer to the parameters of the 21st century, such as pollution, the heat island effect and the excessive consumption of energy and resources. Now, the coronavirus COVID-19, has put a stop to the city movement and with it, to the pollution it involves, revealing the level of contamination to which we were exposed. Therefore, it has become a priority to minimize energy consumption, energy dependence and pollution to improve the health and quality of life of its citizens. As answers to these demands, buildings with living organisms, such as microalgae, make the city a sustainable and Self-Sufficient environment. Giving an answer to the problem above, the design of the Park-Labyrinth proposes the installation of an intensive cultivation of microalgae that not only helps reduce CO2 emissions, transforming it into a product that generates interest, but also generates benefits to society in terms of recreation, energy production, reduction of polluting gases and use of space.","Cervera, Rosa Ma Rosa Villalba",IOP Conference Series.

This study aimed at measuring changes and patterns of national antimicrobial use for one year preceding and one year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Annual national antimicrobial consumption for 2019 and 2020 was obtained from the Jordan Food and Drug Administration (JFDA) following the WHO surveillance methods. The WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification was used. Total antibiotic consumption in 2020 (26.8 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) decreased by 5.5% compared to 2019 (28.4 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). There was an increase in the use of several antibiotics during 2020 compared with 2019 (third generation cephalosporins (19%), carbapenems (52%), macrolides (57%), and lincosamides (106%)). In 2020, there was a marked reduction in amoxicillin use (−53%), while the use of azithromycin increased by 74%. National antimicrobial consumption of the Access group decreased by 18% from 2019 to 2020 (59.1% vs. 48.1% of total consumption). The use of the Watch group increased in 2020 by 26%. The study highlighted an increase in the use of certain antibiotics during the pandemic period that are known to be associated with increasing resistance. Efforts to enhance national antimicrobial stewardship are needed to ensure rational use of antimicrobials.","Al-Azzam, Sayer Mhaidat Nizar Mahmoud Banat Hayaa A.; Alfaour, Mohammad Ahmad Dana Samih Muller Arno Al-Nuseirat Adi Lattyak Elizabeth A.; Conway, Barbara R.; Aldeyab, Mamoon A.",Antibiotics,,246
421236,High mortality in COVID-19 patients with mild respiratory disease,2020,"Epidemic prevention and control measures for the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has achieved significant results. As of 8 April 2020, 22,073 infection cases of COVID-19 among healthcare workers from 52 countries had been reported to WHO. COVID-19 has strong infectivity, high transmission speeds, and causes serious infection among healthcare worker. Burns are an acute-care condition, and burn treatment needs to be initiated before COVID-19 infection status can be excluded. The key step to infection prevention is to identify risk points of infection exposure, strengthen the protection against those risk points, and formulate an appropriate diagnosis and treatment protocol. Following an in-depth study of the latest literature on COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment, we reviewed the protocols surrounding hospitalization of patients with extensive burns (area&#8805;50 %) in our hospital from February 2009 to February 2019 and, in accordance with the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, developed an algorithm for protection during diagnosis and treatment of burns. Therefore, the aspects of medical protection and the diagnosis and treatment of burns appear to be particularly important during the prevention and control of the COVID-19. This algorithm was followed for 4 patients who received emergency treatment in February 2020 and were hospitalized. All healthcare worker were protected according to the three-tiered protective measures, and there was no nosocomial infection. During the COVID-19 epidemic, the early stages of emergency treatment for patients with extensive burns requiring the establishment of venous access for rehydration, endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, wound treatment, and surgery are the risk points for exposure to infection. The implementation of effective, appropriate-grade protection and formulation of practical treatment protocols can increase protection of healthcare worke and reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection exposure.","Huang, Zhifeng; Zhuang, Donglin; Xiong, Bing; Deng, David Xingfei; Li, Hanhua; Lai, Wen",Biomed Pharmacother,,246

424701,Convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19: Some considerations: Correspondence,2020,"Background: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) induces an antibody response targeting multiple antigens that changes over time. This study aims to take advantage of this complexity to develop more accurate serological diagnostics. Methods: A multiplex serological assay was developed to measure IgG and IgM antibody responses to seven SARS-CoV-2 spike or nucleoprotein antigens, two antigens for the nucleoproteins of the 229E and NL63 seasonal coronaviruses, and three non-coronavirus antigens. Antibodies were measured in serum samples collected up to 39 days after symptom onset from 215 adults in four French hospitals (53 patients and 162 health-care workers) with quantitative RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, and negative control serum samples collected from healthy adult blood donors before the start of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (335 samples from France, Thailand, and Peru). Machine learning classifiers were trained with the multiplex data to classify individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the best classification performance displayed by a random forests algorithm. A Bayesian mathematical model of antibody kinetics informed by prior information from other coronaviruses was used to estimate time-varying antibody responses and assess the sensitivity and classification performance of serological diagnostics during the first year following symptom onset. A statistical estimator is presented that can provide estimates of seroprevalence in very low-transmission settings. Findings: IgG antibody responses to trimeric spike protein (Stri) identified individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection with 91·6% (95% CI 87·5-94·5) sensitivity and 99·1% (97·4-99·7) specificity. Using a serological signature of IgG and IgM to multiple antigens, it was possible to identify infected individuals with 98·8% (96·5-99·6) sensitivity and 99·3% (97·6-99·8) specificity. Informed by existing data from other coronaviruses, we estimate that 1 year after infection, a monoplex assay with optimal anti-Stri IgG cutoff has 88·7% (95% credible interval 63·4-97·4) sensitivity and that a four-antigen multiplex assay can increase sensitivity to 96·4% (80·9-100·0). When applied to population-level serological surveys, statistical analysis of multiplex data allows estimation of seroprevalence levels less than 2%, below the false-positivity rate of many other assays. Interpretation: Serological signatures based on antibody responses to multiple antigens can provide accurate and robust serological classification of individuals with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. This provides potential solutions to two pressing challenges for SARS-CoV-2 serological surveillance: classifying individuals who were infected more than 6 months ago and measuring seroprevalence in serological surveys in very low-transmission settings.

Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The main outcome was the risk of ICU admission in diabetic patients with COVID-19 infection while the second was the mortality risk in overall diabetic COVID-19 patients. Data were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel random effects models with odds ratio (OR) as the effect measure with the related 95 % confidence interval (CI). Statistical heterogeneity between groups was measured using the Higgins I2 statistic. RESULTS: Among 1382 patients (mean age 51.5 years, 798 males), DM resulted to be the second more frequent comorbidities. Diabetic patients resulted to have a significant increased risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.79, 95 % CI 1.85-4.22, p < 0.0001, I2 = 46 %). In 471 patients (mean age 56.6 years, 294 males) analysed for the secondary outcome diabetic subjects resulted to be at higher mortality risk (OR 3.21, 95 % CI 1.82-5.64, p < 0.0001, I2 = 16 %). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetic patients with COVID-19 patients are at higher risk of ICU admission and show an higher mortality risk.","Roncon, Loris; Zuin, Marco; Rigatelli, Gianluca; Zuliani, Giovanni",J Clin Virol,,246
427526,"Rare Anaemias, Sickle-Cell Disease and COVID-19",2020,"OBJECTIVE: This review article gives an account of the development of the MR-encephalography (MREG) method, which started as a mere 'Gedankenexperiment' in 2005 and gradually developed into a method for ultrafast measurement of physiological activities in the brain. After going through different approaches covering k-space with radial, rosette, and concentric shell trajectories we have settled on a stack-of-spiral trajectory, which allows full brain coverage with (nominal) 3 mm isotropic resolution in 100 ms. The very high acceleration factor is facilitated by the near-isotropic k-space coverage, which allows high acceleration in all three spatial dimensions. METHODS: The methodological section covers the basic sequence design as well as recent advances in image reconstruction including the targeted reconstruction, which allows real-time feedback applications, and-most recently-the time-domain principal component reconstruction (tPCR), which applies a principal component analysis of the acquired time domain data as a sparsifying transformation to improve reconstruction speed as well as quality. APPLICATIONS: Although the BOLD-response is rather slow, the high speed acquisition of MREG allows separation of BOLD-effects from cardiac and breathing related pulsatility. The increased sensitivity enables direct detection of the dynamic variability of resting state networks as well as localization of single interictal events in epilepsy patients. A separate and highly intriguing application is aimed at the investigation of the glymphatic system by assessment of the spatiotemporal patterns of cardiac and breathing related pulsatility. DISCUSSION: MREG has been developed to push the speed limits of fMRI. Compared to multiband-EPI this allows considerably faster acquisition at the cost of reduced image quality and spatial resolution.","Hennig, Juergen; Kiviniemi, Vesa; Riemenschneider, Bruno; Barghoorn, Antonia; Akin, Burak; Wang, Fei; LeVan, Pierre",Magma,,246

We aimed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infection risk through respiratory transmission using a quantitative microbial risk assessment framework by retrieving SARS-CoV-2 concentrations from the swab tests of 251 Thai patients. Three virus-generating scenarios were investigated: an infector breathing, breathing with a cough, and breathing with a sneeze. Infection risk (97.5th percentile) was as high as 10-3 with breathing and increased to 10-1 with a cough or sneeze, thus all higher than the risk benchmark of 5 x 10-5 per event. No significant gender differences for toilet users (receptors) were noted. The highest risk scenario of breathing and a sneeze was further evaluated for risk mitigation measures. Risk mitigation to lower than the benchmark succeeded only when the infector and receptor simultaneously wore an N95 respirator or surgical mask and when the receptor wore an N95 respirator and the infector wore a denim fabric mask. Ventilation up to 20 air changes per hour (ACH), beyond the 12-ACH suggested by the WHO, did not mitigate risk. Virus concentration, volume of expelled droplets, and receptor dwell time were identified as the main contributors to transmission risk. Highlights- The use of public toilets poses a risk of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory transmission - Highest risks generated in the order of sneezing, coughing, and breathing - No gender differences in risk by counteracting dwell times and inhalation rates - Ventilation did not reduce risk even at 20 ACH, beyond the WHO-recommended value - N95 and surgical masks offer the most effective risk mitigation to toilet users Graphical abstract O_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=""FIGDIR/small/457245v1_ufig1.gif"" ALT=""Figure 1""> View larger version (36K): org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e25795org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e429eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c002aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ef001e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP M_FIG C_FIG","Denpetkul, Thammanitchpol; Sittipunsakda, Oranoot; Pumkaew, Monchai; Mongkolsuk, Skorn; sirikanchana, kwanrawee",,,246

The present study was aimed to evaluate whether MSCs could have a protective effect in hyperuricemic nephropathy (HN) and the underlying mechanisms. A rat HN model was established by oral administration of a mixture of potassium oxonate (PO, 1.5 g/kg) and adenine (Ad, 50 mg/kg) daily for 4 weeks. For MSCs treatment, MSCs (3 × 106 cells/kg per week) were injected via tail vein from the 2nd week for 3 times. The results showed that along with the elevated uric acid (UA) in HN rats, creatinine (CREA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), microalbuminuria (MAU) and 24-hour urinary protein levels were significantly increased comparing with the normal control rats, while decreased after MSCs treatment. Moreover, the mRNA levels of inflammation and fibrosis-related gene were reduced in UA + MSCs group. Consistently, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining results showed the destruction of kidney structure and fibrosis were significantly alleviated after MSCs administration. Similarly, in vitro, NRK-52Es cells were treated with high concentration UA (10 mg/dL) in the presence of MSCs, and we found that MSCs co-culture could inhibited UA-induced cell injury, characterized as improvement of cell viability and proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Collectively, MSCs treatment could effectively attenuate UA-induced renal injury, and thus it might be a potential therapy to hyperuricemia-related renal diseases.","Li, Lan; Cheng, Dongqi; An, Xingxing; Liao, Guangneng; Zhong, Ling; Liu, Jingping; Chen, Younan; Yuan, Yujia; Lu, Yanrong",Int Immunopharmacol,,246

Gastroenterology evaluations are being made to address the provision of chronic enteral feeding with the help of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placements in these patients. The placement of the PEG tube along with tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and prolonged VDRF may expedite discharge planning and increase the availability of ICU beds for other patients.

430426,Introducing APOA1 as a key protein in COVID-19 infection: A bioinformatics approach,2020,"The time-varying reproduction number (Rt: the average number of secondary infections caused by each infected person) may be used to assess changes in transmission potential during an epidemic. While new infections are not usually observed directly, they can be estimated from data. However, data may be delayed and potentially biased. We investigated the sensitivity of Rt estimates to different data sources representing COVID-19 in England, and we explored how this sensitivity could track epidemic dynamics in population sub-groups. We sourced public data on test-positive cases, hospital admissions and deaths with confirmed COVID-19 in seven regions of England over March through August 2020. We estimated Rt using a model that mapped unobserved infections to each data source. We then compared differences in Rt with the demographic and social context of surveillance data over time. Our estimates of transmission potential varied for each data source, with the relative inconsistency of estimates varying across regions and over time. Rt estimates based on hospital admissions and deaths were more spatio-temporally synchronous than when compared to estimates from all test positives. We found these differences may be linked to biased representations of subpopulations in each data source. These included spatially clustered testing, and where outbreaks in hospitals, care homes, and young age groups reflected the link between age and severity of the disease. We highlight that policy makers could better target interventions by considering the source populations of Rt estimates. Further work should clarify the best way to combine and interpret Rt estimates from different data sources based on the desired use.

We aimed to examine the impact of the lockdown caused by COVID-19 pandemic on both nutrition and exercise habits, as well as the psychological effects in patients with T2DM, compared to their usual diet and physical activity level previous to the complete home confinement. We also intended to analyse any potential variables that may have influenced these lifestyle modifications. A Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Food Craving Questionnaire-State (FCQ-S) and Food Craving Questionnaire-Trait (FCQ-T) were used. Our results showed an increase in vegetable, sugary food and snack consumption. An association between levels of foods cravings and snack consumption was also found. Data also showed a high percentage of physical inactivity before the COVID-19 lockdown, which was exacerbated during the home confinement. These findings emphasise the great importance to do further research with larger study samples to analyse and explore dietary habits and to develop public health policies to promote a healthy lifestyle in terms of diet and physical activity in these patients, especially after this strict period of lockdown.","Ruiz-Roso, María Belén; Knott-Torcal, Carolina; Matilla-Escalante, Diana C; Garcimartín, Alba; Sampedro-Nuñez, Miguel A; Dávalos, Alberto; Marazuela, Mónica",Nutrients,,246

Our goal was to determine whether co-infections with respiratory polyomaviruses, such as Karolinska Institutet polyomavirus (KIPyV) and Washington University polyomavirus (WUPyV) occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Oropharyngeal swabs from 150 individuals, 112 symptomatic COVID-19 patients and 38 healthcare workers not infected by SARS-CoV-2, were collected from March 2020 through May 2020 and tested for KIPyV and WUPyV DNA presence. Of the 112 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 27 (24.1%) were co-infected with KIPyV, 5 (4.5%) were positive for WUPyV, and 3 (2.7%) were infected simultaneously by KIPyV and WUPyV. Neither KIPyV nor WUPyV DNA was detected in samples of healthcare workers. Significant correlations were found in patients co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and KIPyV (p &lt;0.05) and between SARS-CoV-2 cycle threshold values and KIPyV, WUPyV and KIPyV and WUPyV concurrently detected (p &lt;0.05). These results suggest that KIPyV and WUPyV may behave as opportunistic respiratory pathogens. Additional investigations are needed to understand the epidemiology and the prevalence of respiratory polyomavirus in COVID-19 patients and whether KIPyV and WUPyV could potentially drive viral interference or influence disease outcomes by upregulating SARS-CoV-2 replicative potential.","Prezioso, Carla Moens Ugo Oliveto Giuseppe Brazzini Gabriele Piacentini Francesca Frasca Federica Viscido Agnese Scordio Mirko Guerrizio Giuliana Rodio Donatella Maria Pierangeli Alessandra d’Ettorre Gabriella Turriziani Ombretta Antonelli Guido Scagnolari Carolina Pietropaolo Valeria",Microorganisms,,246

437209,Heart Best Research Paper Award 2020,2020,"We present the design and analysis of a multi-level game-theoretic model of hierarchical policy-making, inspired by policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our model captures the potentially mismatched priorities among a hierarchy of policy-makers (e.g., federal, state, and local governments) with respect to two main cost components that have opposite dependence on the policy strength, such as post-intervention infection rates and the cost of policy implementation. Our model further includes a crucial third factor in decisions: a cost of non-compliance with the policy-maker immediately above in the hierarchy, such as non-compliance of state with federal policies. Our first contribution is a closed-form approximation of a recently published agent-based model to compute the number of infections for any implemented policy. Second, we present a novel equilibrium selection criterion that addresses common issues with equilibrium multiplicity in our setting. Third, we propose a hierarchical algorithm based on best response dynamics for computing an approximate equilibrium of the hierarchical policy-making game consistent with our solution concept. Finally, we present an empirical investigation of equilibrium policy strategies in this game in terms of the extent of free riding as well as fairness in the distribution of costs depending on game parameters such as the degree of centralization and disagreements about policy priorities among the agents.","Jia, Feiran; Mate, Aditya; Li, Zun; Jabbari, Shahin; Chakraborty, Mithun; Tambe, Milind; Wellman, Michael; Vorobeychik, Yevgeniy",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10646v1.pdf,246

We report qualitative and quantitative peripheral blood findings in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and compare them with a control group. METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records, complete blood counts, peripheral blood smears, and flow cytometry data in 12 patients with SARS-CoV-2. These were compared with 10 control patients with symptoms suspicious for SARS-CoV-2 but who tested negative. RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in blood counts, except that absolute lymphopenia was present frequently in the control group (P < .05). Acquired Pelger-Huët anomaly (APHA) was noted in all COVID-19 cases, in most cases affecting over 5% of granulocytes. This contrasted with APHA in only 50% of control cases, affecting fewer than 5% of granulocytes in all cases (P < .05). Monolobate neutrophils were exclusive to COVID-19 cases. COVID-19 patients had greater frequency of plasmacytoid lymphocytes (P < .05). Flow cytometry data revealed absolute CD3+ T-cell count reduction in 6 of 7 patients; all of them required mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphopenia was infrequent in our COVID-19 cohort; however, flow cytometric analysis revealed absolute T-cell count reduction in most cases.

438077,Type 1 diabetes and technology at time of COVID-19: A case report,2020,"Additive manufacturing (AM) is advantageous in terms of lower carbon emissions, less material-wastage, mobility of digital design, product customization and simpler supply chain management. Moreover, during the global COVID-19 crisis, a robust and IT-driven manufacturing technology was highly required to cope with the peak demands of medical and basic emergency supplies. 3D printing (3DP) enabled the manufacturers to fulfill the deficiencies of healthcare equipment for medical professionals and patients throughout the world. In this paper, some emerging applications and challenges incurred by 3D printing during COVID-19 were briefly summarized. 3D printed PLA-based biodegradable mask filters, medical face shields, respiratory protective equipment and 3D bioprinted tissue models for COVID research are some significant contributions of AM. In this paper, a CiteSpace based bibliometric investigation of 3DP-related literature was conducted, to identify the technology evolution pathways for 3D printing, using the data retrieved from Web of Science and published between 1986 and 2021. The main contributing forces including countries, journals, institutions and subject areas were determined. Knowledge clusters were established to identify networks of the most prolific keywords and documents. In addition, a hierarchical knowledge foundation and hotspots of 3DP were recommended for future research. It was revealed that the policy support of the USA, China, England and Germany was significantly favorable for the development of 3DP research. This article provides insights into the COVID-based applications of 3DP and the research dynamics of this field, which can help in the decision-making process to incorporate innovative and emerging technologies in the AM industry.","Ahmed, Ammar Azam Ali Aslam Bhutta Muhammad Mahmood Khan Farquleet Ahmad Aslam Rozeena Tahir Zunaira",Cleaner Environmental Systems,,246
438397,Late Breaking Abstract - Usefullness of diaphragmatic ultrasound to evaluate the efficacy of EzPAP during the respiratory rehabilitation in post extubated COVID-19 patients,2020,"The most widely used novel coronavirus (COVID-19) detection technique is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, RT-PCR kits are costly and take 6-9 hours to confirm infection in the patient. Due to less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it provides high false-negative results. To resolve this problem, radiological imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect and diagnose COVID-19. In this paper, chest X-rays is preferred over CT scan. The reason behind this is that X-rays machines are available in most of the hospitals. X-rays machines are cheaper than the CT scan machine. Besides this, X-rays has low ionizing radiations than CT scan. COVID-19 reveals some radiological signatures that can be easily detected through chest X-rays. For this, radiologists are required to analyze these signatures. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Hence, there is a need to automate the analysis of chest X-rays. The automatic analysis of chest X-rays can be done through deep learning-based approaches, which may accelerate the analysis time. These approaches can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine-tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. However, these approaches applied to chest X-rays are very limited. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to develop an automated deep transfer learning-based approach for detection of COVID-19 infection in chest X-rays by using the extreme version of the Inception (Xception) model. Extensive comparative analyses show that the proposed model performs significantly better as compared to the existing models.","Narayan Das, N; Kumar, N; Kaur, M; Kumar, V; Singh, D",,,246
438952,Pulmonary cavitation: an under-recognized late complication of severe COVID-19 lung disease,2021,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is a public health emergency with a high mortality rate and it reduces the patient's Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) significantly. This effect is measured in the current study. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study in Iran, 320 randomly selected treated patients from COVID-19 were studied. To collect the required data, we applied a questionnaire that included socio-demographic factors, clinical characteristics, and questions on the patients' HRQoL. Time trade-off (TTO) approach was used to measure the lost HRQoL attributed to COVID-19. Besides, we applied a two-limit Tobit regression model to determine the effects of the socio-demographic factors on patients' health utility and the visual analogue scale approach was used to estimate the perceived total current health status. RESULTS: The overall mean (SE) and median (IQR) of the health utility values were 0.863 (0.01) and 0.909 (0.21) respectively. These values for the traders (those who were willing to lose a part of their remaining time of life to avoid the disease) were estimated at 0.793 (0.01) and 0.848 (0.17), respectively. The lowest amount of utility value belonged to the elderly (mean (SE) = 0.742 (0.04); median (IQR) = 0.765 (0.42)) and those living in rural areas (mean (SE)) = 0.804 (0.03); median (IQR) = 0.877 (0.30)). The univariate analysis showed that age, place of residence, and household size had a statistically significant effect on health utility. Moreover, findings of the regression analysis indicated that the participants' age and hospitalization status were the key determinants of COVID-19 health utility value. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with a substantial and measurable decrease in HRQoL. This decline in HRQoL can be directly compared with that induced by systemic health states.","Alinia, Cyrus; Yaghmaei, Safura; Abdullah, Farman Zahir; Ahmadi, Asad; Samadi, Nasrin; Pourteimour, Sima; Safari, Hossein; Mahmoodi, Hassan; Moradi, Ghobad; Piroozi, Bakhtiar",BMC Infect Dis,,246
439024,Failure of Anticoagulation to Prevent Stroke in Context of Lupus-Associated Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome and Mild COVID-19,2021,"This paper reports the outcomes of a unique investigation coordinated by ASLERD that had the aim of comparing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on three learning ecosystems with different cultural backgrounds and settings: Iraq, Italy and Mexico. Using the same questionnaire translated from Italian to English, Arabic and Spanish, the study has investigated these ecosystems through the lens of University teachers. Despite cultural and infrastructural differences that unavoidably influenced the outcomes, we have detected common effects in the three samples, such as an increase of the working load and a better organization of the time at individual level. Network analysis methods also allowed us to identify some relationships between variables common to the three contexts. In particular, some variables clustered in all samples: a cluster related to the setting (infrastructure and technologies, competences and readiness to respond), one related to the characteristics of the didactic activities, and one related to expectations for the future about use of and involvement in on-line learning. In addition, the reproducibility of classroom dynamics seems to have high betweenness centrality in all three networks. In one case, that of Iraq, we have been also able to include in the causal networks the factors considered by the TAM (Technology Acceptance Model), but the networks appear not to be substantially influenced by the inclusion of TAM variables. On the basis of these results, we propose a Model for the Attitude to get Engaged in Technological Innovation (MAETI), to be used as possible reference framework for future investigation on the effects induced by technologies on use intentions. © 2021, Interaction Design and Architecture(s).

METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted from 2019-2020 within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation. Eligible patients included those with chronic low back pain and a SPADE (sleep disturbance, pain interference with activities, anxiety, depression, and low energy/fatigue) cluster score &#8805; 55 based on the relevant scales from the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System instrument with 29 items (PROMIS-29). Patients were randomized to the eHealth treatment group, which received a tailored HRQOL report and interpretation guide, or to a wait-list control group. The primary outcome was change in the SPADE cluster score, including its five component scales, over 3 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in low back pain intensity and back-related disability. Treatment effects were measured using the standardized mean difference (SMD) in change scores between groups. The eHealth intervention was also assessed by a survey of the experimental treatment group 1 month following randomization. RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were randomized, including 52 in the eHealth treatment group and 50 in the wait-list control group, and 100 (98%) completed the trial. A majority of patients agreed that the HRQOL report was easy to understand (86%), provided new information (79%), and took actions to read or learn more about self-management approaches to improve their HRQOL (77%). Although the eHealth intervention met the criteria for a small treatment effect in improving the overall SPADE cluster score (SMD = 0.24; p= 0.23) and anxiety (SMD = 0.24; p = 0.23), and for a small-to-medium treatment effect in improving depression (SMD = 0.37; p = 0.06) and back-related disability (SMD = 0.36; p = 0.07), none of these results achieved statistical significance because of limited sample size. CONCLUSION: Given the feasibility of rapid online deployment, low cost, and low risk of adverse events, this eHealth intervention for HRQOL may be useful for patients with chronic pain during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Licciardone, John C; Pandya, Vishruti",,,246

445436,Serial computed tomographic findings and specific clinical features of pediatric COVID-19 pneumonia: A case report,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 pandemic has strained the health infrastructure globally, providing an opportunity to identify cost-effective biomarkers. We aimed to identify simple hematological prognostic markers in hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients with and without diabetes. METHODS: Retrospective study of RT-PCR confirmed hospitalized severe COVID-19 patients (total: n = 154 patients, including diabetic subset n = 57) were analyzed. Clinically applicable cut-offs were derived using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for total leucocyte count (TLC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and derived neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (dNLR) in order to prognosticate the outcome. RESULTS: Among 154 severe COVID-19 patients, significant association with mortality was seen with respect to TLC(p < 0.001), ANC (p < 0.001), NLR(p < 0.001) and dNLR(p < 0.001). In the total cohort, applicable cut-offs based on ROC curve in predicting outcome were, for TLC 8950 cells/mm3 (area under curve (AUC)-0.764, odds ratio (OR)-7.53), ANC 7679 cells/mm3 (AUC-0.789, OR-8.14), NLR 5.13 (AUC-0.741, OR-4.77), dNLR 3.44 (AUC -0.741, OR-4.43) respectively.In diabetic subset, the cut-offs for TLC was 8950 cells/mm3 (AUC -0.762, OR-14.9), ANC 6510 cells/mm3 (AUC -0.773, OR-16.8), NLR 5.13(AUC -0.678, OR-6) and dNLR 3.25(AUC -0.685, OR-4.7) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In severe COVID-19 patients irrespective of diabetes, a simple, applicable total leucocyte count cut-off, 8950 cells/mm3 , together with easily derived cut-offs for ANC, NLR, dNLR may serve as cost-effective prognosticators of clinical outcome. A normal TLC may be misleading in the intensive care and the above applicable cut-off for TLC serves as an early warning tool for high-risk identification and better in-hospital management. Even with similar or lower cut-offs, diabetics had a higher mortality.","Ramesh, Jayanthy; Reddy, S L Sagar; Rajesh, Moganti; Varghese, Johann",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,246

Should We Perform a Liver Transplant?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Hand hygiene is key to preventing healthcare-associated infection and the spread of respiratory viruses like the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION: The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS: There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P < .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points). CONCLUSIONS: A multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates in physicians and nurses in Niigata, Japan; however, further improvement is necessary. Given the current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates in Japanese hospitals, the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital setting is a concern.","Saitoh, Akihiko; Sato, Kiyomi; Magara, Yoko; Osaki, Kakuei; Narita, Kiyoko; Shioiri, Kumiko; Fowler, Karen E; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay",J Hosp Med,,246

448274,COVID-19 and the digestive system: A comprehensive review,2021,"RATIONALE: Intermittent combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction may lead to multiple episodes of ascending cholangitis and pancreatitis, usually due to choledocholithiasis or periampullary mass. However, one of the rare causes is periampullary or juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. Although duodenal diverticula are relatively common in the general population, the overwhelming majority are asymptomatic. Duodenal diverticula can cause combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction through multiple mechanisms such as stasis-induced primary choledocholithiasis, stasis-induced intradiverticular enterolith, or longstanding diverticulitis, causing stenosing fibrosing papillitis or a combination of more than one of these mechanisms. Herein, I report a case of Lemmel syndrome due to a combination of multiple mechanisms and review the available literature on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostic work-up, and management of juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum. PATIENT CONCERNS: Multiple episodes of abdominal pain, jaundice, anorexia, fever, and significant unintentional weight loss. DIAGNOSES AND INTERVENTIONS: Primary choledocholithiasis, recurrent ascending cholangitis, recurrent acute pancreatitis, and pancreatic atrophy due to giant juxtapapillary duodenal diverticulum, with unsuccessful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that was completely resolved after open transduodenal sphincteroplasty and septoplasty, transampullary and transcystic common bile duct exploration and stone extraction, and duodenal diverticular inversion. OUTCOME: Complete resolution of combined pancreaticobiliary obstruction without recurrence for 2 years after surgery. LESSONS: Surgeons should be aware of such rare syndromes to avoid misdiagnosis and delayed or inappropriate management. Furthermore, they should understand the different available operative options for cases that are refractory to endoscopic approach.","Alzerwi, Nasser A N",Medicine (Baltimore),,246
450086,Association of COVID-19 with pregnancy outcomes in health-care workers and general women,2020,"Correctional services, both institutional and within the community, are impacted by COVID-19. In the current paper, we focus on the current situation and examine the tensions around how COVID-19 has introduced new challenges while also exacerbating strains on the correctional system. Here, we make recommendations that are directly aimed at how correctional systems manage COVID-19 and address the nature and structure of correctional systems that should be continued after the pandemic. In addition, we highlight and make recommendations for the needs of those who remain incarcerated in general, and for Indigenous people in particular, as well as for those who are serving their sentences in the community. Further, we make recommendations for those working in closed-custody institutions and employed to support the re-entry experiences of formerly incarcerated persons. We are at a critical juncture—where reflection and change are possible—and we put forth recommendations toward supporting those working and living in correctional services as a way forward during the pandemic and beyond.

450260,"A novel coronavirus, a novel disease: COVID-19",2020,"Widespread coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 is causing pneumonia, respiratory and multiorgan failure in susceptible individuals. Dysregulated immune response marks severe COVID-19, but the immunological mechanisms driving COVID-19 pathogenesis are still largely unknown, which is hampering the development of efficient treatments. Here we analyzed ~140 parameters of cellular and humoral immune response in peripheral blood of 41 COVID-19 patients and 16 age/gender-matched healthy donors by flow-cytometry, quantitative PCR, western blot and ELISA, followed by integrated correlation analyses with ~30 common clinical and laboratory parameters. We found that lymphocytopenia in severe COVID-19 patients (n=20) strongly affects T, NK and NKT cells, but not B cells and antibody production. Unlike increased activation of ICOS-1+ CD4+ T cells in mild COVID-19 patients (n=21), T cells in severe patients showed impaired activation, low IFN-Î³ production and high functional exhaustion, which correlated with significantly down-regulated HLA-DR expression in monocytes, dendritic cells and B cells. The latter phenomenon was followed by lower interferon responsive factor (IRF)-8 and autophagy-related genes expressions, and the expansion of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Intriguingly, PD-L1-, ILT-3-, and IDO-1-expressing monocytic MDSC were the dominant producers of IL-6 and IL-10, which correlated with the increased inflammation and accumulation of regulatory B and T cell subsets in severe COVID-19 patients. Overall, down-regulated IRF-8 and autophagy-related genes expression, and the expansion of MDSC subsets could play critical roles in dysregulating T cell response in COVID-19, which could have large implications in diagnostics and design of novel therapeutics for this disease.","Tomic, Sergej; Dokic, Jelena; Stevanovic, Dejan; Ilic, Natasa; Gruden-Movsesijan, Alisa; Dinic, Miroslav; Radojevic, Dusan; Bekic, Marina; Mitrovic, Nebojsa; Tomasevic, Ratko; Mikic, Dragan; Stojanovic, Dragos; Colic, Miodrag",Front Immunol,,246
450427,Pulmonary contusion mimicking COVID-19: A case report,2020,"In this review, we present the environmental perspectives of the viruses and antiviral drugs related to SARS-CoV-2. The present review paper discusses occurrence, fate, transport, susceptibility, and inactivation mechanisms of viruses in the environment as well as environmental occurrence and fate of antiviral drugs, and prospects (prevalence and occurrence) of antiviral drug resistance (both antiviral drug resistant viruses and antiviral resistance in the human). During winter, the number of viral disease cases and environmental occurrence of antiviral drug surge due to various biotic and abiotic factors such as transmission pathways, human behaviour, susceptibility, and immunity as well as cold climatic conditions. Adsorption and persistence critically determine the fate and transport of viruses in the environment. Inactivation and disinfection of virus include UV, alcohol, and other chemical-base methods but the susceptibility of virus against these methods varies. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are major reserviors of antiviral drugs and their metabolites and transformation products. Ecotoxicity of antiviral drug residues against aquatic organisms have been reported, however more threatening is the development of antiviral resistance, both in humans and in wild animal reservoirs. In particular, emergence of antiviral drug-resistant viruses via exposure of wild animals to high loads of antiviral residues during the current pandemic needs further evaluation.","Kumar, Manish; Mazumder, Payal; Mohapatra, Sanjeeb; Kumar Thakur, Alok; Dhangar, Kiran; Taki, Kaling; Mukherjee, Santanu; Kumar Patel, Arbind; Bhattacharya, Prosun; Mohapatra, Pranab; Rinklebe, Jörg; Kitajima, Masaaki; Hai, Faisal I; Khursheed, Anwar; Furumai, Hiroaki; Sonne, Christian; Kuroda, Keisuke",J Hazard Mater,,246
451839,Bacterial infections and patterns of antibiotic use in patients with COVID-19,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) have arisen independently at multiple locations1,2 and may reduce the efficacy of current vaccines that target the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-23. Here, using a live-virus neutralization assay, we compared the neutralization of a non-VOC variant with the 501Y.V2 VOC (also known as B.1.351) using plasma collected from adults who were hospitalized with COVID-19 during the two waves of infection in South Africa, the second wave of which was dominated by infections with the 501Y.V2 variant. Sequencing demonstrated that infections of plasma donors from the first wave were with viruses that did not contain the mutations associated with 501Y.V2, except for one infection that contained the E484K substitution in the receptor-binding domain. The 501Y.V2 virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from individuals who were infected during the second wave. The first-wave virus variant was effectively neutralized by plasma from first-wave infections. However, the 501Y.V2 variant was poorly cross-neutralized by plasma from individuals with first-wave infections; the efficacy was reduced by 15.1-fold relative to neutralization of 501Y.V2 by plasma from individuals infected in the second wave. By contrast, cross-neutralization of first-wave virus variants using plasma from individuals with second-wave infections was more effective, showing only a 2.3-fold decrease relative to neutralization of first-wave virus variants by plasma from individuals infected in the first wave. Although we tested only one plasma sample from an individual infected with a SARS-CoV-2 variant with only the E484K substitution, this plasma sample potently neutralized both variants. The observed effective neutralization of first-wave virus by plasma from individuals infected with 501Y.V2 provides preliminary evidence that vaccines based on VOC sequences could retain activity against other circulating SARS-CoV-2 lineages.","Cele, Sandile; Gazy, Inbal; Jackson, Laurelle; Hwa, Shi-Hsia; Tegally, Houriiyah; Lustig, Gila; Giandhari, Jennifer; Pillay, Sureshnee; Wilkinson, Eduan; Naidoo, Yeshnee; Karim, Farina; Ganga, Yashica; Khan, Khadija; Bernstein, Mallory; Balazs, Alejandro B; Gosnell, Bernadett I; Hanekom, Willem; Moosa, Mahomed-Yunus S; Lessells, Richard J; de Oliveira, Tulio; Sigal, Alex",Nature,,246
452353,Evaluation of Extended-Interval Dabigatran Dosing in Older Patients With Non-Valvular Atrial Fibrillation,2020,"Background: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a dreaded complication of Covid-19 infection with high morbidity and mortality. Limited data exists on Indian experience. In a tertiary care hospital situated in South India, we analysed the incidence, clinical profile and outcomes of patients diagnosed with AKI due to COVID-19. Methods: Retrospective data of Adult cases admitted with COVID-19 over a 8 month period from April – November 2020 was collected. Incidence, Demographics, Clinical profile, Management and Outcomes of COVID-19 associated AKI were analysed. Primary outcome was In- hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were Dialysis Requirement and Renal Recovery. Results: 52 (7%) out of a total 718 patients with COVID-19 developed AKI. Mean Age was 58 years (IQR 51-69) with a striking male predominance of 92%. (Male:Female -9.4:1) (P< 0.001). Co morbidities seen were Diabetes in 38 (73%) and Hypertension in 31(59%) and Coronary Artery Disease in 17(32%). Fever with myalgia was seen in 29 (46%), Respiratory symptoms in 31(59%), Oliguria in 26(50%) and Diarrhea in 2 (3%) patients. At admission, Hypoxemia and Hypotension were seen in 27 (51%) and 16 (30%) patients respectively. Urinalysis revealed > 2+ dipstick Proteinuria in 24 (46%) and Microscopic hematuria in 16(34%) patients. 25 (48%) were admitted in Stage 3 AKI with a mean S.Creatinine level of 4.4 + 3.4 mg/dl. CT chest showed > 50% lung involvement in 23 patients (44%). Mechanical ventilation was required in 20(38%). Hemodialysis was required in 12 (23%). The median duration of hospitalisation was 10 + 5 days. Primary Outcome of Mortality occurred in 44% of AKI cohort in comparison to 7% in Non AKI cohort (Relative Risk[RR]6.2;95% Confidence Interval[CI], 4.1 to 9.4) (P= 0.001). Hypoxemia [RR,3.76;95% CI,1.4-9.5], Hypotension [RR 2.54;CI,1.5-4 ], Low Serum albumin [RR1.6;CI,1.1 – 2.3] and Requirement for mechanical ventilation [RR,11.3;CI, 2.9 – 23 ] were significant risk factors for mortality. All 5 patients who required both mechanical ventilation and Dialysis died. 31 patients (59%) were treated with Remdesivir therapy without survival benefit. Significantly higher C-Reactive Protein, Interleukin -6, D-Dimer levels and lower serum albumin levels were seen in those who died. Among the 29 patients who survived, the estimated GFR (e GFR) had recovered in 12 (41%) at discharge. After further followup of 4-6 weeks, the total number of patients who recovered renal function rose to 21 (72%). Conclusion: Mortality in COVID associated AKI stood at 44%. Multiple factors contributed to high mortality such as Severe disease with hypotension and extensive pulmonary involvement, High Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio, Absolute Monocyte Count, inflammatory markers, d-Dimer and low serum albumin. It was encouraging to note that 72% of survivors recovered renal function by 4-6 weeks after discharge from hospital which means that it is worth the struggle to treat AKI in COVID-19. © 2021 Journal of Association of Physicians of India.

454312,Pneumomediastinum as a complication of COVID-19 disease: A case report,2021,"BACKGROUND: Dalbavancin, albeit indicated for the treatment of skin structure infections, is used for a much wider range of infections. This drug is characterized by a long half-life (more than 200 hours), a favorable safety profile, and an activity against a wide array of gram-positive organisms, including several strains of Staphylococci and Enterococci. METHODS: In this study, we presented 3 cases of critically ill patients treated with dalbavancin. All patients were therapeutically monitored for plasma dalbavancin concentrations; ultrafiltrate dalbavancin concentrations were assessed in a patient undergoing continuous renal-replacement therapy. Dalbavancin concentrations were measured using a validated liquid chromatographic method coupled with mass spectrometry. RESULTS: All 3 severely ill patients experiencing necrotizing fasciitis were successfully treated during the acute phase with dalbavancin. Dalbavancin clearance in patient 3 (0.334 L/h) was considerably increased compared with values measured in the other 2 patients (0.054 and 0.075 L/h) and with data reported in the literature (0.04-0.06 L/h). CONCLUSIONS: Our case reports presented preliminary evidence that dalbavancin can be considered a therapeutic option for necrotizing fasciitis in intensive care unit patients.

454720,"STAR evidence evaluation of viral fulminant myocarditis: Specificity, Timeliness, Accessibility, Risk",2020,"BACKGROUND: Specific diagnostic tests to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and resulting COVID-19 disease are not always available and take time to obtain results. Routine laboratory markers such as white blood cell count, measures of anticoagulation, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin, are used to assess the clinical status of a patient. These laboratory tests may be useful for the triage of people with potential COVID-19 to prioritize them for different levels of treatment, especially in situations where time and resources are limited. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID-19. SEARCH METHODS: On 4 May 2020 we undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included both case-control designs and consecutive series of patients that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine laboratory testing as a triage test to determine if a person has COVID-19. The reference standard could be reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) alone; RT-PCR plus clinical expertise or and imaging; repeated RT-PCR several days apart or from different samples; WHO and other case definitions; and any other reference standard used by the study authors. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from each included study. They also assessed the methodological quality of the studies, using QUADAS-2. We used the 'NLMIXED' procedure in SAS 9.4 for the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta-analyses of tests for which we included four or more studies. To facilitate interpretation of results, for each meta-analysis we estimated summary sensitivity at the points on the SROC curve that corresponded to the median and interquartile range boundaries of specificities in the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We included 21 studies in this review, including 14,126 COVID-19 patients and 56,585 non-COVID-19 patients in total. Studies evaluated a total of 67 different laboratory tests. Although we were interested in the diagnotic accuracy of routine tests for COVID-19, the included studies used detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection through RT-PCR as reference standard. There was considerable heterogeneity between tests, threshold values and the settings in which they were applied. For some tests a positive result was defined as a decrease compared to normal vaues, for other tests a positive result was defined as an increase, and for some tests both increase and decrease may have indicated test positivity. None of the studies had either low risk of bias on all domains or low concerns for applicability for all domains. Only three of the tests evaluated had a summary sensitivity and specificity over 50%. These were: increase in interleukin-6, increase in C-reactive protein and lymphocyte count decrease. Blood count Eleven studies evaluated a decrease in white blood cell count, with a median specificity of 93% and a summary sensitivity of 25% (95% CI 8.0% to 27%; very low-certainty evidence). The 15 studies that evaluated an increase in white blood cell count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. Four studies evaluated a decrease in neutrophil count. Their median specificity was 93%, corresponding to a summary sensitivity of 10% (95% CI 1.0% to 56%; low-certainty evidence). The 11 studies that evaluated an increase in neutrophil count had a lower median specificity and a lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of an increase in neutrophil percentage (4 studies) was 59% (95% CI 1.0% to 100%) at median specificity (38%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in monocyte count (4 studies) was 13% (95% CI 6.0% to 26%) at median specificity (73%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in lymphocyte count (13 studies) was 64% (95% CI 28% to 89%) at median specificity (53%; low-certainty evidence). Four studies that evaluated a decrease in lymphocyte percentage showed a lower median specificity and lower corresponding sensitivity. The summary sensitivity of a decrease in platelets (4 studies) was 19% (95% CI 10% to 32%) at median specificity (88%; low-certainty evidence). Liver function tests The summary sensitivity of an increase in alanine aminotransferase (9 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in aspartate aminotransferase (7 studies) was 29% (95% CI 17% to 45%) at median specificity (81%) (low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of a decrease in albumin (4 studies) was 21% (95% CI 3% to 67%) at median specificity (66%; low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in total bilirubin (4 studies) was 12% (95% CI 3.0% to 34%) at median specificity (92%; very low-certainty evidence). Markers of inflammation The summary sensitivity of an increase in CRP (14 studies) was 66% (95% CI 55% to 75%) at median specificity (44%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in procalcitonin (6 studies) was 3% (95% CI 1% to 19%) at median specificity (86%; very low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in IL-6 (four studies) was 73% (95% CI 36% to 93%) at median specificity (58%) (very low-certainty evidence). Other biomarkers The summary sensitivity of an increase in creatine kinase (5 studies) was 11% (95% CI 6% to 19%) at median specificity (94%) (low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in serum creatinine (four studies) was 7% (95% CI 1% to 37%) at median specificity (91%; low-certainty evidence). The summary sensitivity of an increase in lactate dehydrogenase (4 studies) was 25% (95% CI 15% to 38%) at median specificity (72%; very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although these tests give an indication about the general health status of patients and some tests may be specific indicators for inflammatory processes, none of the tests we investigated are useful for accurately ruling in or ruling out COVID-19 on their own. Studies were done in specific hospitalized populations, and future studies should consider non-hospital settings to evaluate how these tests would perform in people with milder symptoms.","Stegeman, Inge; Ochodo, Eleanor A; Guleid, Fatuma; Holtman, Gea A; Yang, Bada; Davenport, Clare; Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Dittrich, Sabine; Emperador, Devy; Hooft, Lotty; Spijker, René; Takwoingi, Yemisi; Van den Bruel, Ann; Wang, Junfeng; Langendam, Miranda; Verbakel, Jan Y; Leeflang, Mariska Mg",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,,246

The circumstances surrounding a suicide are fundamental to determining whether its characteristics will play a crucial role in the decision-making process. The state of emergency arising from the Covid-19 pandemic has introduced a new element, given the general concern and feelings of alarm which are global. The most suitable forensic method to analyse these cases is the psychological autopsy. This study's purpose is to analyse the application of the psychological autopsy method to evaluate the impact of the pandemic where government lockdowns impose restrictions on personal freedom. We set out to consider how far this together with other factors may induce suicide. The literature does not as yet offer us a retrospective analysis of the influence of the global pandemic state on rates of suicide.

455377,Evidence for increased circulating procoagulant phospholipids in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and their prognostic role,2020,"In response to the ongoing public health emergency of COVID-19, we investigate the disease dynamics to understand the spread of COVID-19 in the United States. In particular, we focus on the spatiotemporal dynamics of the disease, accounting for the control measures, environmental effects, socioeconomic factors, health service resources, and demographic conditions that vary from different counties. In the modeling of an epidemic, mathematical models are useful, however, pure mathematical modeling is deterministic, and only demonstrates the average behavior of the epidemic; thus, it is difficult to quantify the uncertainty. Instead, statistical models provide varieties of characterization of different types of errors. In this paper, we investigate the disease dynamics by working at the interface of theoretical models and empirical data by combining the advantages of mathematical and statistical models. We develop a novel nonparametric space-time disease transmission model for the epidemic data, and to study the spatial-temporal pattern in the spread of COVID-19 at the county level. The proposed methodology can be used to dissect the spatial structure and dynamics of spread, as well as to forecast how this outbreak may unfold through time and space in the future. To assess the uncertainty, projection bands are constructed from forecast paths obtained in bootstrap replications. A dashboard is established with multiple R shiny apps embedded to provide a 7-day forecast of the COVID-19 infection count and death count up to the county level, as well as a long-term projection of the next four months.

457532,Covid-19 manifesting as a gastroparesis flare: A case report,2020,"Although the current COVID-19 crisis is felt globally, at the local level, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected poor, highly segregated African American communities in Chicago. To understand the emerging pattern of racial inequality in the effects of COVID-19, we examined the relative burden of social vulnerability and health risk factors. We found significant spatial clusters of social vulnerability and risk factors, both of which are significantly associated with the increased COVID-19-related death rate. We also found that a higher percentage of African Americans was associated with increased levels of social vulnerability and risk factors. In addition, the proportion of African American residents has an independent effect on the COVID-19 death rate. We argue that existing inequity is often highlighted in emergency conditions. The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 in African American communities are a reflection of racial inequality and social exclusion that existed before the COVID-19 crisis.","Kim, Sage J; Bostwick, Wendy",Health Educ Behav,,246

457953,Unusual Pattern of Arterial Macrothrombosis Causing Stroke in a Young Adult Recovered from COVID-19,2020,"Fibrodyplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is a rare hereditary disease, which has a variable course characterized by occasional flare-ups of heterotopic ossification (HO) in soft tissues that are followed by swelling, stiffness, pain and warmth. Here, we report for the first time a case of a 45-year-old female patient with known FOP recovering from COVID-19 with disease progression potentially linked with the viral illness. In December 2020 the patient contracted a mild form of COVID-19 infection without need for hospital admission. Since January 2021, the patient felt unwell, with occasional abdominal pain which progressively intensified. In March 2021 she presented with new onset of HO, complaining of pain, swelling and thickening sensation in the lower abdomen and left part of the neck. Computerized tomography (CT) and cytokine analysis were performed. CT scan revealed new heterotopic bone formation in multiple soft tissue areas of the neck indicating clear radiological progression. Radiotherapy, which has proven to be an efficient tool to control HO in this patient, was not able to halt HO formation after COVID-19 infection. Cytokine analysis of a plasma sample obtained during a flare-up after COVID-19 infection showed a significantly elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to a flare-up panel prior to infection. Of the 23 analyzed levels of cytokines, a staggering number of 21 were above normal levels. This case is the first confirmation of uncontrolled post-COVID-19 effects in a FOP patient, which manifested with flare-ups followed by progressive HO, possibly caused by a thus far, never described form of post-COVID syndrome.","Grgurevic, Lovorka; Novak, Rudjer; Hrkac, Stela; Salai, Grgur; Grazio, Simeon",Rheumatol Int,,246
458376,Endothelial Dysfunction and Thrombosis in Patients With COVID-19-Brief Report,2020,"BACKGROUND: Accidental exposure to percutaneous needle stick and sharp injuries (NSSIs) and blood and other body fluids is the unintended contact with risky medical instruments or patient secretions during a medical intervention. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the significance of occupational injuries in healthcare professionals was revealed once again. To assess the occupational injuries, we compared rates, distribution and type of exposure to blood and body fluids and NSSIs of health care workers for 2019 (pre-pandemic era) and 2020 (pandemic era) years, respectively. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our study included data collected by the 'Hospital Infection Control Committee' for the years 2019-2020. Data collected using the active surveillance method were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During 2019 (pre-pandemic period) and 2020 (pandemic period), 112 (27.65%0) and 82 (21.4%0) NSSIs reported, respectively. Of the exposed HCWs in 2019 (pre-pandemic period), 16.8%0 (14) were doctor, 53.6%0 (60) were nurse and 47.4%0 (14) were intern doctors. In the 2020 (pandemic period), NSSIs were observed most frequently in nurses and cleaning staff, 50.24%0 and 33.64%0, respectively. Concerning the total percentage of exposure to blood and other body fluids, a slight increase was revealed from 1.48%0 to 2.62%0 in 2019 and 2020, respectively. A significant decrease in exposure rate was reported among the doctors between the pre-pandemic and pandemic era; 3.6%0 and 1.19%0 at 2019 and 2020, respectively. A significant increase in exposure rate was reported among the nurses between pre-pandemic and pandemic era; 0.8%0 and 6.89%0, respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the exposure to NSSIs during the pandemic period decreased; however, there was no severe difference at pre-pandemic and pandemic periods concerning exposure to blood and body fluids. Well-designed training and awareness programs can be effective in preventing exposure to NSSIs and blood and other body fluids and exposure to respiratory acquired viruses.","Diktas, Husrev; Oncul, Ahsen; Tahtasakal, Ceren Atasoy; Sevgi, Dilek Yildiz; Kaya, Ozlem; Cimenci, Nese; Uzun, Nuray; Dokmetas, Ilyas",J. infect. public health,,246

The role of the report of sadness or nervousness during the pandemic was also evaluated as a mediator of this association. Data from a behavior survey during COVID-19, conducted in Brazil with 45,161 people (18 years old or older), from April 24 to May 24, 2020, were used. The outcome variable was the onset or increase in sleep problems, and the exposure variable was the presence of CNCDs. The adjusted Odds Ratio of the association between CNCDs and sleep was estimated, and a mediation analysis was performed to test the effect of the report of sadness or nervousness on this association, using the Karlson Holm Breen method. The increase in sleep problems was reported by 44.9% of the population, and 33.9% reported at least one CNCD. The chance of sleep problems was higher among people with diabetes (1.34; 1.05-1.71), hypertension (1.26; 1.06-1.50), and with coronary heart diseases (1.36; 1.13-1.65) or respiratory diseases (1.42; 1.04-1.93). Compared to people without CNCDs, individuals with at least one CNCD had a 36% greater chance of impaired sleep (1.36; 1.19-1.55). The report of sadness or nervousness explained 45.1% of the association between CNCD and sleep. Our findings alert us to care for the emotional state and sleep of chronic patients during the waves of the COVID-19 pandemic, and indicate the need for sleep monitoring in this population.","Lima, Margareth Guimaraes; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Werneck, André de Oliveira; Szwarcwald, Célia Landmann; Souza, Donatila Barbieri de Oliveira; Gomes, Crizian Saar; Damacena, Giseli Nogueira; da Silva de Almeida, Wanessa; Barros, Marilisa Berti de Azevedo",Sleep medicine,,246

460547,[Guidelines for the Management of Traumatic Brain Injury:Updated in 2019],2020,"Cystathionine ß-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the condensation of serine and homocysteine to water and cystathionine, which is then hydrolyzed to cysteine, &#945;-ketobutyrate and ammonia by cystathionine Î³-lyase (CGL) in the reverse transsulfuration pathway. The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, the causative agent of toxoplasmosis, includes both CBS and CGL enzymes. We have recently reported that the putative T. gondii CGL gene encodes a functional enzyme. Herein, we cloned and biochemically characterized cDNA encoding CBS from T. gondii (TgCBS), which represents a first example of protozoan CBS that does not bind heme but possesses two C-terminal CBS domains. We demonstrated that TgCBS can use both serine and O-acetylserine to produce cystathionine, converting these substrates to an aminoacrylate intermediate as part of a PLP-catalyzed ß-replacement reaction. Besides a role in cysteine biosynthesis, TgCBS can also efficiently produce hydrogen sulfide, preferentially via condensation of cysteine and homocysteine. Unlike the human counterpart and similar to CBS enzymes from lower organisms, the TgCBS activity is not stimulated by S-adenosylmethionine. This study establishes the presence of an intact functional reverse transsulfuration pathway in T. gondii and demonstrates the crucial role of TgCBS in biogenesis of H2S.","Conter, Carolina; Fruncillo, Silvia; Fernández-Rodríguez, Carmen; Martínez-Cruz, Luis Alfonso; Dominici, Paola; Astegno, Alessandra",Sci Rep,,246

Las pruebas combinadas de IgM e IgG rápidas pueden tener un papel importante en la vigilancia de la COVID-19 y en su diagnóstico, así como en la evaluación de la respuesta inmunológica y la verificación de los avances hacia la inmunidad de rebaño. Objetivo. Evaluar el desempeño de las pruebas rápidas de anticuerpos en la vigilancia ocupacional de la COVID-19 en un grupo de empresas colombianas. Materiales y métodos. Se usaron datos de la vigilancia ocupacional de empresas que hicieron pruebas serológicas periódicas a todo el personal desde finales de abril hasta comienzos de julio de 2020. Los trabajadores laboraban en grupos pequeños (""burbujas sociales"") para evitar brotes y optimizar la vigilancia. La sensibilidad se estimó como si el muestreo respondiera a un diseño prospectivo. Se describieron, asimismo, los cambios en las pruebas serológicas por medio de rondas periódicas. Resultados. Se obtuvieron datos de 4.740 trabajadores, de los cuales solo 23 eran sintomáticos. En ellos se evidenciaron cambios de IgM(-)/IgG(-) a IgM(+), y luego a IgM(+)/ IgG(+) e IgG(+). La sensibilidad fue de 40,94 % para las IgM(+) y 47,95 % para las IgM(+)/ IgG(+), lo que implica que se pudo detectar un poco menos de la mitad de los casos. Conclusión. Las pruebas rápidas de anticuerpos tienen un papel en el proceso diagnóstico de la infección y deben evaluarse teniendo en cuenta el momento de la epidemia, el tipo de prueba comprada y las poblaciones de riesgo, dado que sus resultados dependen del número de contagios y de casos. En el contexto de la presente crisis sanitaria pueden optimizarse si se organizan los trabajadores en ""burbujas sociales"".","Idrovo, Álvaro J.; Moreno-Montoya, José; Pinzón-Flórez, Carlos E.",Biomédica (Bogotá),,246

This question could be best answered by blinded and placebo controlled clinical trials. However, a skin reaction occurs within days at the site of BCG injection, making it rather challenging to blind this vaccination. Here, we examined registered clinical trials in ClinicalTrials.gov on BCG against COVID-19 by October 9th 2020, and found that 94.7% of such trials were listed as placebo controlled (all with normal saline as placebo), and single to quadruple blinded. The mode of overcoming the natural unblinding by the BCG induced skin reaction was not clarified on the website in either of the trials. We conclude that detailed description of the strategy towards overcoming the BCG vaccination induced skin reaction associated unblinding hurdle will be important for the interpretation of the theoretically blinded COVID-19 directed clinical trials.","Szigeti, Reka; Kellermayer, Richard",Vaccine,,246

We collected paired longitudinal blood and respiratory tract samples (endotracheal aspirate, sputum or pleural fluid) from hospitalized COVID-19 patients and non-COVID-19 controls. Cellular, humoral and cytokine responses were analysed and correlated with clinical data. SARS-CoV-2-specific IgM, IgG and IgA antibodies were detected using ELISA and multiplex assay in both the respiratory tract and blood of COVID-19 patients, although a higher receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific IgM and IgG seroconversion level was found in respiratory specimens. SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity in respiratory samples was detected only when high levels of RBD-specific antibodies were present. Strikingly, cytokine/chemokine levels and profiles greatly differed between respiratory samples and plasma, indicating that inflammation needs to be assessed in respiratory specimens for the accurate assessment of SARS-CoV-2 immunopathology. Diverse immune cell subsets were detected in respiratory samples, albeit dominated by neutrophils. Importantly, we also showed that dexamethasone and/or remdesivir treatment did not affect humoral responses in blood of COVID-19 patients. Overall, our study unveils stark differences in innate and adaptive immune responses between respiratory samples and blood and provides important insights into effect of drug therapy on immune responses in COVID-19 patients.","Zhang, Wuji; Chua, Brendon; Selva, Kevin John; Kedzierski, Lukasz; Ashhurst, Thomas; Heycraft, Ebene; Shoffner, Suzanne; Hensen, Luca; Boyd, David; James, Fiona; Mouhtouris, Effie; Kwong, Jason C; Chua, Kyra; Drewett, George; Copaescu, Ana; Dobson, Julie; Rowntree, Louise; Habe, Jennifer; Allen, Lilith; Koay, Hui-Fern; Neil, Jessica; Gartner, Mattheew; Lee, Christina; Andersson, Patiyan; Seemann, Torsten; Sherry, Norelle; Amanat, Fatima; Krammer, Florian C; Londrigan, Sarah; Wakim, Linda; King, Nicholas; Godfrey, Dale; Mackay, Laura; Thomas, Paul; Nicholson, Suellen R; Arnold, Kelly; Chung, Amy; Holmes, Natasha; Smibert, Olivia; Trubiano, Jason A; Gordon, Claire; Nguyen, Thi HO; Kedzierska, Katherine",,,246

This study aimed to assess the acceptance and willingness to pay (WTP) for the COVID-19 vaccine among migrants in Shanghai, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 2126 migrants in Shanghai for the period 1–20 November 2020. Convenience sampling was used to recruit respondents in workplaces with large numbers of migrant workers. Multivariable (ordered) logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with acceptance and WTP of the COVID-19 vaccine. Most (89.1%) migrants would accept COVID-19 vaccination. Over 90.0% perceived the COVID-19 vaccine as important, while only 75.0% and 77.7% perceived vaccines safe and effective. Socio-demographic factors were not significantly associated with vaccine acceptance, but confidence in the importance (OR 8.71, 95% CI 5.89–12.89), safety (OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.24–2.61) and effectiveness (OR 2.66, 95% CI 1.83–3.87) of COVID-19 vaccine was significantly positively associated with vaccine acceptance. The top reasons for vaccine hesitancy were lack of vaccine information and confidence. The proportion of those definitely willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine was 20% lower if paid by themselves than free vaccination. Migrants were willing to pay a median amount of USD 46 for the COVID-19 vaccine. Results show that a high acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine was universal among migrants in Shanghai. Concerns about vaccine safety, effectiveness and high costs of the COVID-19 vaccine may hinder their uptake. Effective health communication to build confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine and subsidies toward the costs of these vaccines are needed to improve uptake.","Han, Kaiyi Francis Mark R.; Zhang, Ruiyun Wang Qian Xia Aichen Lu Linyao Yang Bingyi Hou Zhiyuan",Vaccines,,246

In this study, 1035 educators from 169 preschools reported their views and practices in an online survey, which we examined via multilevel mixed-response analysis and thematic analysis. More than half of the respondents (53%) expected future online teaching to continue, and only 11% of educators believed that parents would reject this form of delivery. Administrators and teaching assistants were more likely than teachers to expect online preschool teaching to continue in the future. In addition, respondents with existing online platform experience, who taught the upper levels of preschool, or incorporated specific teaching practices (eg, after the online lesson, they assessed children and assigned homework tasks), were more likely than others to expect online teaching in the future. Many of these respondents also reported (a) difficulty with engaging their children when online and (b) inadequate support from parents for learning activities, which reduced the respondents' perceived likelihood of future online teaching. Administrators and teaching assistants were more likely than teachers to believe that parents would accept online teaching in the future. Respondents who felt they had inadequate training to teach online, children in families with inadequate technical skills and parents who believed that online lessons harmed children's well-being, were less likely than others to believe that parents would accept online teaching in the future. These educators believed that online learning communities could connect parents and schools and foster interaction that could help align with educator's support for children's learning needs.","Hu, Xinyun; Chiu, Ming Ming; Leung, Wai Man Vivienne; Yelland, Nicola",British journal of educational technology,,246

This study reported the outcomes, multiple challenges, and broad recommendations associated with the impact of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on oncology early phase 1 trials-and on drug development in Asia-based on the experiences and perspectives of Asian oncology phase 1 centers. METHODS: Between March and April 2020 during the initial period of outbreak, the impact of COVID-19 across oncology phase 1 sites in five Asian countries-China (Hong Kong), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore-was retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There was no trial termination or treatment discontinuation in all five countries. Although the most common impact was new patient enrollment being placed on hold, which was based on pharmaceutical sponsors' decision-making, the situation varied per site. Most sites had no restrictions in place that would limit their ability to fully comply with the requirements of conducting the early phase studies. The number of protocol deviations during the pandemic was largely dependent on domestic transportation status during the outbreak rather than the ability of the clinical trial centers. CONCLUSION: Determining the risk to benefits ratio of patients with cancer who are enrolled in early phase 1 clinical trials under the unusual circumstances of a global pandemic is important. Specific guidance or guidelines on the conduct of early phase 1 clinical trials during public health emergencies that are based on the recent lessons learned is urgently required.","Shimizu, Toshio; Kim, Dong-Wan; Loong, Herbert H; Lin, Chia-Chi; Ng, Matthew Ch; Yamamoto, Noboru; Ma, Brigette; Tan, Daniel Sw",Asia Pac. j. clin.oncol,,246

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among HCWs during the COVID-19 epidemic and investigate the associations among negative coping, fatigue and PTSS. A total of 507 HCWs from Anhui province enrolled in the study and completed the cross-sectional survey including demographic data, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), 14-item Fatigue Scale (FS-14), and PTSD Checklist-civilian Version (PCL-C). Univariate linear regression, Pearson correlation and Mackinnon's four-step procedure were performed in the statistical analysis. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS among HCWs during the pandemic was 24%. Univariate linear regression showed HCWs aged 31-40 years exhibited significantly higher scores of PTSS than those aged 51-60 (ß = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.59 to 9.41). Having at least one child was associated with a higher risk of developing PTSS (ß = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.36 to 5.45). Negative coping and fatigue were positively correlated with all three PTSS (all P < 0.001), including re-experiencing, avoidance and hyper-arousal. Fatigue has mediated the association between negative coping and PTSS among HCWs during the pandemic (ab = 0.09, SE = 0.03, bootstrap 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.14). A considerable proportion of HCWs was traumatized during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, the institutions should screen out and pay close attention to HCWs who tend to use negative coping (e.g., withdrawal thinking, distraction and blaming others) and arrange work scientifically to avoid overfatigue and PTSS amid the public health crisis.","Hou, Tianya; Yin, Qianlan; Cai, Wenpeng; Song, Xiangrui; Deng, Wenxi; Zhang, Jianguo; Deng, Guanghui",Psychol Health Med,,246

In the future small companies do not expect inventory investment to grow that much either, and their transportation modes reaching China and Russia will not change in such great extent as what is the case with medium and large companies. However, it seems that railways will be preferred over other transportation modes in the following decade. Among small companies, transportation mode shares are taken from all other modes, while in medium and large they are mostly arising from air freight. © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

470408,Non-convulsive status epilepticus in a patient with COVID-19 infection,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on performance of neuroendovascular procedures has not been quantified. METHODS: We performed an audit of performance of neuroendovascular procedures at 18 institutions (seven countries) for two periods; January-April 2019 and 2020, to identify changes in various core procedures. We divided the region where the hospital was located based on the median value of total number of COVID-19 cases per 100,00 population-into high and low prevalent regions. RESULTS: Between 2019 and 2020, there was a reduction in number of cerebral angiograms (30.9% reduction), mechanical thrombectomy (8% reduction), carotid artery stent placement for symptomatic (22.7% reduction) and asymptomatic (43.4% reduction) stenoses, intracranial angioplasty and/or stent placement (45% reduction), and endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (44.6% reduction) and ruptured (22.9% reduction) and unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (66.4% reduction). There was an increase in the treatment of ruptured intracranial aneurysms (10% increase) and other neuroendovascular procedures (34.9% increase). There was no relationship between procedural volume change and intuitional location in high or low COVID-19 prevalent regions. The procedural volume reduction was mainly observed in March-April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We provided an international multicenter view of changes in neuroendovascular practices to better understand the gaps in provision of care and identify individual procedures, which are susceptible to change.","Qureshi, Adnan I; Agunbiade, Samiat; Huang, Wei; Akhtar, Iqra N; Abraham, Michael G; Akhtar, Naveed; Al-Mufti, Fawaz; Aytac, Emrah; Balgetir, Ferhat; Grigoryan, Mikayel; Gomez, Camilo R; Hassan, Ameer E; Jani, Vishal; Janjua, Nazli A; Jiao, Liqun; Khatri, Rakesh; Kirmani, Jawad F; Kobayashi, Adam; Kozak, Osman; Lee, Jun; Lobanova, Iryna; Mansour, Ossama Yassin; Maud, Alberto; Mazighi, Mikael; Piotin, Michel; Rodriguez, Gustavo J; Siddiq, Farhan; Suri, M Fareed K; Tekle, Wondwossen G",j. neuroimaging,,246

470611,Diagnostic Performance of Chest CT in Suspected COVID-19 Patients with a Negative First RT-PCR Testing,2020,"SUMMARY: Polymerase chain reaction-based assays are the current gold standard for detecting and diagnosing SARS-CoV-2. However, as SARS-CoV-2 mutates, we need to constantly assess whether existing PCR-based assays will continue to detect all known viral strains. To enable the continuous monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 assays, we have developed a web-based assay validation algorithm that checks existing PCR-based assays against the ever-expanding genome databases for SARS-CoV-2 using both thermodynamic and edit-distance metrics. The assay screening results are displayed as a heatmap, showing the number of mismatches between each detection and each SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence. Using a mismatch threshold to define detection failure, assay performance is summarized with the true positive rate (recall) to simplify assay comparisons. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The assay evaluation website and supporting software are Open Source and freely available at https://covid19.edgebioinformatics.org/#/assayValidation, https://github.com/jgans/thermonucleotideBLAST, and https://github.com/LANL-Bioinformatics/assay_validation.

471700,Infection Risk of COVID-19 in Dentistry Remains Unknown: A Preliminary Systematic Review,2021,"PURPOSE: To propose a way to safely perform endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy in ENT outpatient clinic during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This manuscript highlights the importance of endoscopy in daily ENT clinical practice, which is a pivotal procedure in the diagnosis of many head and neck pathologies. However, since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, the authors have witnessed a drastic reduction (91%) in the use of endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy at their institutions. In fact, it is considered at risk of contamination for healthcare professionals, as any upper airway manipulation procedure. RESULTS: In the ""Back approach to the patient"" for endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy, the operator positions himself behind the patient and faces the monitor. The endoscopist, not being positioned in front of the patient, should, therefore, be less exposed to airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. CONCLUSION: This simple variation of the physician's position during endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy could potentially reduce the risk of contagion since the operator is not in the trajectory of droplets and/or aerosols.","Di Maio, Pasquale; Traverso, Daniela; Iocca, Oreste; De Virgilio, Armando; Spriano, Giuseppe; Giudice, Marco",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,,246

472146,Serum prealbumin deserves more significance in the early triage of COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization, the disease has gained momentum with every passing day. Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a result, many information resources have been created globally and are available for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the right place. By implementing the proposed framework according to the stated guidelines, this study allows for the development of applications such as interactive dashboards to facilitate the contextual identification and tracking of interdependent COVID-19 knowledge resources.","Afzal, Muhammad; Hussain, Maqbool; Hussain, Jamil; Bang, Jaehun; Lee, Sungyoung",J Med Internet Res,,246

Evidences from the ground signal desperate times with women workers facing severe unemployment, reduced incomes and adverse conditions of work. The article argues that the crisis of women?s work caused by COVID-19 is not a sudden tragic consequence of the pandemic, but an outcome of pre-existing structural and systemic ruptures. For long, women have confronted, exclusion and precarious employment opportunities resulting from anti-women attitude at workplaces with lack of acknowledgement and attempts to address the deep-rooted structural fault lines leading to systemic failures. After giving the larger background that are important in the understanding of women?s employment in the context of the pandemic, the article gives an overview of women?s employment during the pandemic taking up two specific sectors that are particularly marked?paid domestic work and frontline community workers (ASHA and Anganwadi workers) are examined in detail. The article suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated and personalised the endemic context of crisis for women calling for state intervention at the time to correct systemic issues that have positioned women unequally in employment.JEL Codes: A14, B54, F66, J01, J21","Neetha, N.",The Indian Economic Journal,,246

There is an unknown relationship of which coagulation profile parameter at presentation has an association with poor outcome in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship between fibrinogen and FDP with poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of all observational studies or trials involving adult patients with COVID-19 that had any data fibrinogen or FDP on admission was carried out using the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We assessed the methodological quality assessment using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD). RESULTS: A total of 17 studies (1,654 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. It revealed a higher mean of fibrinogen levels on admission in patients with severe case compared to those with non-severe case (MDâ=â0.69, [95% CI: 0.44 to 0.94], pâ< â0.05; I2â=â72%, pâ< â0.05).

We compared the clinical course and outcomes of iTTP in women of reproductive age, between those with pregnancy- and non-pregnancy-related iTTP. A review of all reproductive-aged women diagnosed with iTTP during 2010-2019 in seven university hospitals in Israel. Of 42 cases of iTTP, 12 (28.6%) were pregnancy-related. At presentation, the laboratory profiles did not differ significantly between those with pregnancy- and non-pregnancy-related iTTP, including hemoglobin (median 8.4 vs 8.0 g/dL), platelet count (12.5 vs. 11.5 X 109/L); and levels of bilirubin (1.23 vs. 1.82 mg/dL), lactate dehydrogenase (1615 vs. 1701 U/L), creatinine (0.61 vs. 0.79 mg/dL) and anti-ADAMTS13 antibodies titer (75 vs. 82 U/mL).

This has been accompanied by a rise in interest in the ethics of 'passport' systems that allow low-risk individuals greater freedoms during lockdowns and exemptions to quarantines. Immunity and vaccination passports have been suggested to facilitate the greater movement of those with acquired immunity and who have been vaccinated. Another group of individuals who pose a low risk to others during pandemics are those with genetically mediated resistances to pathogens. In this paper, we introduce the concept of genomic passports, which so far have not been explored in the bioethics literature. Using COVID-19 as an illustrative example, we explore the ethical issues raised by genomic passports and highlight differences and similarities to immunity passports. We conclude that, although there remain significant practical and ethical challenges to the implementation of genomic passports, there will be ways to ethically use them in the future.","Gyngell, Christopher; Savulescu, Julian",J. med. ethics,,246

However, reduced specimen stability during extended transport, the absence of cold chain to centralized laboratories, and biosafety concerns surrounding specimen handling has limited this expansion. In the following study, we evaluated eNAT (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) as an alternative transport system to address the biosafety and stability challenges associated with expanding COVID-19 diagnostics to rural and remote regions. In this study, we demonstrated that high titer severe acute respiratory virus syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) lysate placed into eNAT medium cannot be propagated in cell culture, supporting viral inactivation. To account for off-site testing in these settings, we assessed the stability of contrived nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens stored for up to 14 days in various transport medium (eNAT, eSwab, viral transport media [VTM], saline and phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]) at 4°C, 22-25°C, and 35°C. Molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 was unaffected by sample storage temperature over the 2 weeks when stored in eNAT or PBS (change in cycle threshold [&#916;CT ] &#8804; 1). In contrast, variable stability was observed across test conditions for other transport media. As eNAT can inactivate SARS-CoV-2, it may support COVID-19 diagnostics at the point-of-care (POC). Evaluation of compatibility of eNAT with Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay demonstrated equivalent diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity compared to VTM. Taken together, these findings suggest that the implementation of eNAT as a collection device has the potential to expand COVID-19 testing to areas with limited healthcare access.","Richard-Greenblatt, Melissa; Comar, Courtney E; Flevaud, Laurence; Berti, Marina; Harris, Rebecca M; Weiss, Susan R; Glaser, Laurel",J. clin. microbiol,,246

The objective of the work is to identify SARS-CoV2 spike variants that emerged during the pandemic and evaluate their binding affinity with ACE2. Evolutionary analysis of 2178 SARS-CoV2 genomes identifies RBD variants that are under selection bias. The binding efficacy of these RBD variants to the ACE2 has been analyzed by using protein-protein docking and binding free energy calculations. Pan-proteomic analysis reveals 113 mutations among them 33 are parsimonious. Evolutionary analysis reveals five RBD variants A348T, V367F, G476S, V483A, and S494P are under strong positive selection bias. Variations at these sites alter the ACE2 binding affinity. A348T, G476S, and V483A variants display reduced affinity to ACE2 in comparison to the Wuhan SARS-CoV2 spike protein. While the V367F and S494P population variants display a higher binding affinity towards human ACE2. Reorientation of several crucial residues at the RBD-ACE2 interface facilitates additional hydrogen bond formation for the V367F variant which enhances the binding energy during ACE2 recognition. On the other hand, the enhanced binding affinity of S494P is attributed to strong interfacial complementarity between the RBD and ACE2.","Chakraborty, Sandipan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,246

Methods: A cross-sectional point-prevalence survey was developed and disseminated through the pediatric emergency medicine research networks for Europe (Research in European Pediatric Emergency Medicine) and the United Kingdom and Ireland (Paediatric Emergency Research in the United Kingdom and Ireland). We aimed to include 10 EDs for countries with greater than 20 million inhabitants and 5 EDs for less populated countries, unless the number of eligible EDs was less than 5. ED directors or their delegates completed the survey between March 20 and 21 to report practice at that time. We used descriptive statistics to analyze data. Results: Overall, 102 centers from 18 countries (86% response rate) completed the survey: 34% did not have an ED contingency plan for pandemics and 36% had never had simulations for such events. Wide variation on personal protective equipment (PPE) items was shown for recommended PPE use at pretriage and for patient assessment, with 62% of centers experiencing shortage in one or more PPE items, most frequently FFP2 and N95 masks. Only 17% of EDs had negative-pressure isolation rooms. Coronavirus disease 2019-positive ED staff was reported in 25% of centers. Conclusion: We found variation and identified gaps in preparedness and response to the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic across European referral EDs for children. A lack in early availability of a documented contingency plan, provision of simulation training, appropriate use of PPE, and appropriate isolation facilities emerged as gaps that should be optimized to improve preparedness and inform responses to future pandemics.","Bressan, Silvia; Buonsenso, Danilo; Farrugia, Ruth; Parri, Niccolo039; Oostenbrink, Rianne; Titomanlio, Luigi; Roland, Damian; Nijman, Ruud G; Maconochie, Ian; Da Dalt, Liviana; Mintegi, Santiago",Ann Emerg Med,,246
483451,Early and persistent viral clearance in COVID-19 patients treated with convalescent plasma,2021,"Prior research and the popular press have anecdotally reported inadequate nursing home staffing levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Maintaining adequate staffing levels is critical to ensuring high-quality nursing home care and an effective response to the pandemic. We therefore sought to examine nursing home staffing levels during the first nine months of 2020 (compared with the same period in 2019), using auditable daily payroll-based staffing data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. We found that the total number of hours of direct care nursing declined in nursing homes during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did the average nursing home census. When we accounted for changes in census, the number of nurse staff hours per resident day remained steady or, if anything, increased slightly during the pandemic. The observed increases in staff hours per resident day were small but concentrated in nursing homes operating in counties with high COVID-19 prevalence, in nursing homes with low Medicaid census (which typically have more financial resources), and in not-for-profit nursing homes (which typically invest more in staffing). These findings raise concerns that although the number of staff hours in nursing homes did not decline, the perception of shortages has been driven by increased stresses and demands on staff time due to the pandemic, which are harder to quantify.","Werner, Rachel M; Coe, Norma B",Health Aff (Millwood),,246

The goal of this study was to demonstrate the continued importance of Career Professional Development Center (CPDC) support (pre-pandemic to early stages of the pandemic) for business-related internships influencing student professional development engagement (PDE) and anticipated employment upon graduation. PDE encompasses typical CPDC resources (e.g., internship search support;involvement in student professional organizations (SPOs);professional development coaching;and job search assistance). A survey, the Senior Student Satisfaction Survey (SSSS) was deployed prior to graduation to business students. Using the SSSS, two separate samples of graduating business undergraduates at a Mid-Atlantic University in the United States were surveyed, in late Spring 2019 (pre-pandemic) and late Spring 2020 (early pandemic). Pre-pandemic survey results showed that students having at least one internship experience (versus none) were more likely to: join an SPO sooner;attend more SPO meetings/semester;complete their professional development sooner;and anticipate ""by graduation"" full-time employment. Despite the drop in survey participation due to the pandemic onset, results consistent with this were found with the early pandemic survey. Like other academic-related and campus services in the face of the pandemic, the business school CPDC is adapting to the new remote ways of operating and successfully transitioned their delivery mode to a 100% virtual model to meet the resource challenge of supporting student PDE. It is hoped that the ideas discussed will be useful to a wider audience.","Blau, Gary Snell Corinne Goldberg Daniel",Journal of Education and Learning,,246

485374,Characteristics of patients with atrial fibrillation prescribed edoxaban in Belgium and the Netherlands: insights from the ETNA-AF-Europe study,2021,"This study aimed to assess the awareness and performance of Qom citizens towards using disinfectants and compared its relationship with geographical distribution of COVID-19 outbreak in Qom, Iran. The study was conducted by a researcher-made questionnaire during April and May, 2020. COVID-19 incidence data for each district of city was obtained from health department of Qom province. Data were analyzed using Excel, SPSS and ArcView (GIS) softwares. It was found that the highest level of citizens' awareness (52%) was in the weak range while their performance (56%) was in the good range. According to Spearman's correlation analysis, there was a strong correlation (rho 0.95) between the total mean of awareness and performance (p < 0.01). The highest incidence rate of COVID-19 was in district 7 which had the lowest mean score in both awareness and performance. In addition, the results of ANOVA (LSD-least significant difference) showed that there was a significant difference (p < 0.05) between district 7-with lower mean scores in awareness and performance-and other districts. Overall, it is concluded that citizens' awareness level was lower than that of their performance. This conclusion not only calls for more training programs to be implemented in public places, schools, universities and governmental offices, but it also necessitates maintaining a proper and timely training about using disinfectants.","Safari, Zahra; Fouladi-Fard, Reza; Vahidmoghadam, Razieh; Hosseini, Mohammad Raza; Mohammadbeigi, Abolfazl; Omidi Oskouei, Alireza; Rezaali, Mostafa; Ferrante, Margherita; Fiore, Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,246

Objective: To evaluate the interferon (IFN)-&#945; levels in a cohort of COVID-19 patients in relation to severity, evolution of the clinical manifestations and immune/inflammatory profile. Methods: This is prospective study recruiting consecutive hospitalized patients with respiratory failure associated with SARS-COV-2 infection and matched controls. After enrollment, patients were assessed every 7 ± 2 days for additional 2 consecutive visits, for a total of 21 days. The severity of the clinical condition was ranked based on the level of respiratory support required. At each time-point blood samples were obtained to assess immune cells and mediators by multiplex immunoassay. Results: Fifty-four COVD-19 and 11 control patients matched for severity were enrolled. At recruitment, lower levels of blood IFN-&#945; were found in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (3.8-fold difference, p < 0.01). Improvements in COVID-19 severity were paralleled by a significant increase of blood IFN-&#945; levels. A significant increase in blood IFN-&#945; was found over the study period in survivors (70% of the study population). A similar trend was found for blood IFN-ß with IFN-ß levels below the threshold of detectability in a substantial proportion of subjects.

487377,Uniting infectious disease and physical science principles on the importance of face masks for COVID-19,2020,"Training the next generation of industrial engineers and managers is a constant challenge for academia, given the fast changes of industrial technology. The current and predicted development trends in applied technologies affecting industry worldwide as formulated in the Industry 4.0 initiative have clearly emphasized the needs for constantly adapting curricula. The sensible socioeconomic changes generated by the COVID-19 pandemic have induced significant challenges to society in general and industry. Higher education, specifically when dealing with Industry 4.0, must take these new challenges rapidly into account. Modernization of the industrial engineering curriculum combined with its migration to a blended teaching landscape must be updated in real-time with real-world cases. The COVID-19 crisis provides, paradoxically, an opportunity for dealing with the challenges of training industrial engineers to confront a virtual dematerialized work model which has accelerated during and will remain for the foreseeable future after the pandemic. The paper describes the methodology used for adapting, enhancing, and evaluating the learning and teaching experience under the urgent and unexpected challenges to move from face-to-face university courses distant and online teaching. The methodology we describe is built on a process that started before the onset of the pandemic, hence in the paper we start by describing the pre-COVID-19 status in comparison to published initiatives followed by the real time modifications we introduced in the faculty to adapt to the post-COVID-19 teaching/learning era. The focus presented is on Industry 4.0. subjects at the leading edge of the technology changes affecting the industrial engineering and technology management field. The manuscript addresses the flow from system design subjects to implementation areas of the curriculum, including practical examples and the rapid decisions and changes made to encompass the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on content and teaching methods including feedback received from participants.","Benis, Arriel; Amador Nelke, Sofia; Winokur, Michael",Sensors (Basel),,246
487526,Leveraging the United States Epicenter to Provide Insights on COVID-19 in Patients With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.","Elhai, Jon D; Yang, Haibo; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G",J Affect Disord,,246

489420,Reply to comment: Screening for active COVID-19 infection prior to biologic therapy in IBD patients: primum non nocere,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented disruption to how people live, work and travel. There has been a recent outburst of research on the short-term impacts that the pandemic has had on travel behaviour. However, the long-term impact of the pandemic on travel behaviour is still uncertain and difficult to predict. In particular, young adults are facing some of the most significant disruptions from the pandemic;these disruptions are likely to have long-term impacts on their lives. This study aims to unpack the direct and indirect effects that COVID-19 may have on the travel behaviour of young adults. It does this through in-depth interviews with 26 young adults living in Melbourne and Victoria, Australia. Interviews suggest that while the pandemic has had significant impacts on the short-term travel behaviour of all young adults, the long-term impacts are more complex and mediated by how they are moving through key life milestones. Many respondents are relatively unimpacted by the pandemic. Others have faced a significant disruption to their lives. Those who had planned to live or work overseas have found their life plans ‘accelerated’, which may also accelerate their dependence on the car. In contrast, those who have lost work are facing a significant delay to their life plans. We propose a framework for how COVID-19 may directly and indirectly impact travel behaviour in the short- and long-term. The strongest impacts on mobility, through changes to life stage transitions, are indirect and unevenly spread across the population of young adults.","Delbosc, Alexa McCarthy Laura",Transport Policy,,246
489733,COVID-19 and ethnicity: Spotlight on the global rheumatology issues in developing and developed countries,2020,"From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross-infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human-machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high-sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water-absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.","Lu, Lijun; Jiang, Chunpeng; Hu, Guosheng; Liu, Jingquan; Yang, Bin",Adv Mater,,246

The results defined as threshold levels for the damage of erythrocytes depend on the exposure time of the shear stress, but they are very different, depending on the used experimental methods or the calculation strategy. Here, the results are resumed and shown in curves. Different models for the calculation of the strengths of erythrocytes are discussed.

Although great efforts have been made to develop effective therapeutic interventions, only the nucleotide analog remdesivir was approved for emergency use against COVID-19. Remdesivir targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), an essential enzyme for viral RNA replication and a promising drug target for COVID-19. Recently, several structures of RdRp in complex with substrate RNA and remdesivir were reported, providing insights into the mechanisms of RNA recognition by RdRp. These structures also reveal the mechanism of RdRp inhibition by nucleotide inhibitors and offer a molecular template for the development of RdRp-targeting drugs.

OBJECTIVE: Herein, we evaluate the findings of chest computed tomography (CT) and radiography in patients with COVID-19 who were asymptomatic. METHODS: We retrospectively investigated patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 but who did not show any symptoms. Among the 139 patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Yeungnam University Hopistal in Daegu, South Korea, 10 (7.2%) were asymptomatic. Their chest CT and radiographic findings were analyzed. RESULTS: In the results, all patients (100%) had ground-glass opacity (GGO) on chest CT. Further, the GGO lesions were predominantly distributed peripherally and posteriorly in all patients. In 9 (90%) patients, the GGO lesions were combined with reticular opacity. Air bronchogram due to bronchiolectasis surrounded by GGO was observed in 8 patients (80%). Additionally, the lung lesions were dominant on the right side in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, considering our results that the lung is affected in asymptomatic patients, it will be necessary to extend the indications of COVID-19 testing for effective management of COVID-19 during the pandemic.","Chang, Min Cheol; Lee, Wonho; Hur, Jian; Park, Donghwi",Respiration,,246

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The ""reversed halo"" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.","Li, Yan; Xia, Liming",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,246
495251,Predictive Approaches for Acute Dialysis Requirement and Death in COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVE: This study addresses a very important problem in Neurology, distinguishing tremor and ataxia using quantitative methods. Specifically, we aimed to quantitatively separate dysmetria, a cardinal sign of ataxia, from tremor in Essential Tremor (ET). METHODS: In experiment 1, we compared nineteen participants diagnosed with ET undergoing thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS; ETDBS ) to 19 healthy controls (HC). We quantified tremor during postural tasks using accelerometry and dysmetria with fast, reverse-at-target goal-directed movements. To ensure that endpoint accuracy was unaffected by tremor, we quantified dysmetria in selected trials manifesting a smooth trajectory to the endpoint. Finally, we manipulated tremor amplitude by switching DBS ON and OFF to examine its effect on dysmetria. In experiment 2, we compared 10 ET participants (ET) with 10 HC to determine if we could identify and distinguish dysmetria from tremor in non-DBS ET. RESULTS: Three findings suggest that we can quantify dysmetria independent of tremor in ET. First, ETDBS and ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC and dysmetria did not correlate with tremor (R2 <0.01). Second, even for trials with tremor-free trajectories to the target, ET exhibited greater dysmetria than HC (p<0.01). Third, activating DBS reduced tremor (p<0.01) but had no effect on dysmetria (p>0.2). INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that dysmetria can be quantified independent of tremor using fast, reverse at target goal-directed movements. These results have important implications for the understanding of ET and other cerebellar and tremor disorders. Future research should examine the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying each symptom and characterize their independent contribution to disability. This article is protected by copyright.

495747,Sex-disaggregated data confirm serum ferritin as an independent predictor of disease severity both in male and female COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly around the world. In addition to common respiratory symptoms such as cough and fever, some patients also have cardiac injury, however, the mechanism of cardiac injury is not clear. In this study, we analyzed the RNA expression atlases of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin L (CTSL) in the human embryonic heart at single-cell resolution. RESULTS: The results showed that ACE2 was preferentially enriched in cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, serine protease transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) had less expression in cardiomyocytes, but CTSB and CTSL, which belonged to cell protease, could be found to be enriched in cardiomyocytes. The results of enrichment analysis showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ACE2-positive cardiomyocytes were mainly enriched in the processes of cardiac muscle contraction, regulation of cardiac conduction, mitochondrial respiratory chain, ion channel binding, adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes and viral transcription. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that both atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes are potentially susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2(SARS-CoV-2), and SARS-CoV-2 may enter ventricular cardiomyocytes using CTSB/CTSL for S protein priming. This may be the partial cellular mechanism of cardiac injury in patients with COVID-19.","Yang, Jing; Chen, Tan; Zhou, Yafeng",Hereditas,,246

496391,Management of early-stage breast cancer patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: The experience in China from a surgical standpoint,2021,"Industrial salespeople spend more time outside of the firm than inside of the firm. As a consequence, they may be particularly prone to salesperson social isolation - or feelings of being disconnected from coworkers and colleagues. Potentially magnified by the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the prevalence of social isolation may become a more common and modern-day challenge for salespeople. As part of this, managers must consider the notion of salesperson social isolation and its impact on job performance. To explore this phenomenon, we employ a multi-study, mixed-methods approach. In Study, 1 we conduct a quantitative survey-based study (with a sample of 233 industrial salespeople) investigating the relationship between salesperson social isolation and salesperson performance and the processes through which it occurs. In Study 2, we utilize a discovery-oriented theories-in-use qualitative approach (with a sample of 27 sales professionals) to investigate the nature of salesperson social isolation (with certain pandemic related factors), its consequences (also considering pandemic related factors), and important manager and salesperson actions that offset the negative effects of salesperson social isolation. Altogether, our findings shed some light into the if, how, what (in much more detail), and when aspects of salesperson social isolation. Theoretical and managerial implications are also discussed.","Chaker, Nawar N.; Nowlin, Edward L.; Walker, Doug Anaza Nwamaka A.",Industrial Marketing Management,,246
497330,How to handle patients with autoimmune rheumatic and inflammatory bowel diseases in the COVID-19 era: An expert opinion,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and airborne particulate matter (PM) pollution have posed a great threat to human health. Personal protective face masks have become an indispensable protective equipment in our daily lives. However, wearing conventional face masks for a long time cause swelter and discomfort on the face. Introducing thermal comfort into personal protective face masks becomes desirable. Herein, face masks that show excellent filtration performance and radiative heat dissipation effect are successfully designed and prepared by electrospining Nylon-6 (PA) nanofibers onto polyethylene (PE) meltblown nonwovens. The resultant PE/PA nonwovens have high PM filtration efficiency (&gt;99%) with a low pressure drop (&lt;100 Pa). Moreover, taking the advantage of the property of PE, the designed face mask posses high mid-infrared (mid-IR) transmittance and brings about high radiative cooling power, resulting in effective heat dissipation performance. This face mask design may provides new insights into the development of thermal comfort materials for personal protection.","Xu, Yuanqiang Zhang Xiaomin Hao Xibo Teng Defang Zhao Tienan Zeng Yongchun",Chemical Engineering Journal,,246

It is not known whether COVID-19 additionally affects arterial stiffness. METHODS: This case-control study compared brachial-ankle pulse wave (baPWV) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocities (cfPWV) of acutely ill patients with and without COVID-19. RESULTS: Twenty-two COVID-19 patients (50% females, 77 [67-84] years) were compared with 22 age- and sex-matched controls. In COVID-19 patients, baPWV (19.9 [18.4-21.0] vs. 16.0 [14.2-20.4], P = 0.02) and cfPWV (14.3 [13.4-16.0] vs. 11.0 [9.5-14.6], P = 0.01) were higher than in the controls. In multiple regression analysis, COVID-19 was independently associated with higher cfPWV (ß = 3.164, P = 0.004) and baPWV (ß = 3.532, P = 0.003). PWV values were higher in nonsurvivors. In survivors, PWV correlated with length of hospital stay. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 appears to be related to an enhanced PWV reflecting an increase in arterial stiffness. Higher PWV might be related to an increased length of hospital stay and mortality.","Schnaubelt, S; Oppenauer, J; Tihanyi, D; Mueller, M; Maldonado-Gonzalez, E; Zejnilovic, S; Haslacher, H; Perkmann, T; Strassl, R; Anders, S; Stefenelli, T; Zehetmayer, S; Koppensteiner, R; Domanovits, H; Schlager, O",J. intern. med,,246

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made microscopic surgery more challenging to perform. This work aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of the Vitom 3D system, which integrates a high-definition (4K) view and three-dimensional technology for ear surgery, within the context of the pandemic. METHOD: Combined approach tympanoplasty and ossiculoplasty were performed for cholesteatoma using the Vitom 3D system exclusively. RESULTS: Surgery was performed successfully. The patient made a good recovery, with no evidence of residual disease at follow up. The compact system has excellent depth of field, magnification and colour. It enables ergonomic work, improved work flow, and is ideal for teaching and training. CONCLUSION: The Vitom 3D system is considered a revolutionary alternative to microscope-assisted surgery, particularly in light of coronavirus disease 2019. It allows delivery of safe otological surgery, which may aid in continuing elective surgery.","Ally, M; Kullar, P; Mochloulis, G; Vijendren, A",J Laryngol Otol,,246

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of specialty education and work environment on of dentists' behavior, awareness and attitude regarding cross-infection control in COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: The study population consisted of Turkish dentists who work in private clinics, public clinics and university hospitals. Demographics of the participants, awareness of COVID-19 and clinical measures taken against cross-infection were evaluated with an online survey. Between 10th-20th of November 2020, 1,000 surveys were e-mailed to the dentists. RESULTS: A total 454 dentists answered the survey; 29.3% of the participants deliver only urgent care, 59.9% both urgent and routine treatments and personal protective equipment (PPE) were used at rates varying between 75.5% and 98.4%. 90.6% of the dentists stated that they were worried about aerosol generating dental procedures and there was no difference between sexes in this regard (p=0.119). The majority of participants, mainly specialists (p=0.16), applied strict cross-infection control methods during the COVID-19 pandemic (77.2%). The rate of PPE use was statistically higher by women compared to men (p=0.025) and by specialists compared to others (p=0.04). There was a weak positive correlation between level of PPE use and expertise (r=0.121, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Although participants' knowledge about the symptoms of COVID-19, transmission routes and following the guidelines were at a sufficient level, dental specialists apply protection equipment procedures more strictly. Although participants were concerned about dental practices that create microbial aerosols during the pandemic period, still they continue their dental routines using high levels of PPE and taking extra clinical precautions to avoid cross-infection.","Mutluay, Merve; Egil, Edibe",Braz J Infect Dis,,246

The CURB-65, A-DROP and expanded CURB-65 tools are known to predict the risk of mortality in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. In this retrospective single-center retrospective study, we aimed to assess the correlations of the A-DROP, CURB-65, and expanded CURB-65 scores on admission with an increase in oxygen requirement in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 207 patients who were hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia at the Self-Defense Forces Central Hospital in Tokyo, Japan. Performance of A-DROP, CURB-65, and the expanded CURB-65 scores were validated. In addition, we assessed whether there were any associations between an increase in oxygen requirement and known risk factors for critical illness in COVID-19, including elevation of liver enzymes and C-reactive protein (CRP), lymphocytopenia, high D-dimer levels and the chest computed tomography (CT) score. RESULTS: The areas under the curve for the ability of CURB-65, A-DROP, and the expanded CURB-65 scores to predict an increase in oxygen requirement were 0.6961, 0.6980 and 0.8327, respectively, and the differences between the three groups were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Comorbid cardiovascular disease, lymphocytopenia, elevated CRP, liver enzyme and D-dimer levels, and higher chest CT score were significantly associated with an increase in oxygen requirement CONCLUSIONS: The expanded CURB-65 score can be a better predictor of an increase in oxygen requirement in patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Kodama, Tatsuya; Obinata, Hirofumi; Mori, Hitoshi; Murakami, Wakana; Suyama, Yohsuke; Sasaki, Hisashi; Kouzaki, Yuji; Kawano, Shuichi; Kawana, Akihiko; Mimura, Satoshi",J Infect Chemother,,246
502508,Symptoms of Pleurisy as the Initial Presentation of COVID-19,2020,"The overlay of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pandemic of physical inactivity has be-come a great concern. Both types of pandemics can decrease the health protection capacity and consequently increase complexity in human lives. This cross-sectional study intended to examine changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students in a second-tier city of Bangladesh. Two hundred and nine students responded to an online questionnaire administered via Google Survey. In addition to descriptive statistics, parametric and non-parametric tests for comparing means, medians and distributions were used to assess differences in activity traits before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results show that the occurrence of COVID-19 has significantly reduced the practice of walking and physical activities among the students. They are commonly motivated by introjected regulation. Father’s occupation and the type of family of a student have significant influences on the total physical activity in either situation. Bangladeshi university students have, particularly, been perceived as not generally used to vigorous physical activities. They are inactive compared to students from other countries. Thus, the public health policymakers and the corresponding authority should inspire the students to be more physically active by implementing different strategies such as increasing bicycling and walking facilities on the campus. © 2021 by the authors.

However, in some infected individuals, this can progress to severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to multi-organ failure and death. This study explores the proteomic differences between mild, severe, and critical COVID-19 positive patients to further understand the disease progression, identify proteins associated with disease severity, and identify potential therapeutic targets. Blood protein profiling was performed on 59 COVID-19 mild (n = 26), severe (n = 9) or critical (n = 24) cases and 28 controls using the OLINK inflammation, autoimmune, cardiovascular and neurology panels. Differential expression analysis was performed within and between disease groups to generate nine different analyses. From the 368 proteins measured per individual, more than 75% were observed to be significantly perturbed in COVID-19 cases. Six proteins (IL6, CKAP4, Gal-9, IL-1ra, LILRB4 and PD-L1) were identified to be associated with disease severity. The results have been made readily available through an interactive web-based application for instant data exploration and visualization, and can be accessed at https://phidatalab-shiny.rosalind.kcl.ac.uk/COVID19/ .

The activity of SOD and ascorbic acid levels were significantly higher in tissues of RJX-P or RJX-B treated rats than vehicle-treated control rats (p < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between tissue SOD activity or ascorbic acid levels of rats treated with RJX-P vs. rats treated with RJX-B (p > 0.05). The observed elevations of the SOD and ascorbic acid levels were transient and were no longer detectable on day 28 following a 14-day recovery period. These results demonstrate that RJX-P and RJX-B are bioequivalent relative to their pharmacodynamic effects on tissue SOD and ascorbic acid levels. Furthermore, both formulations showed profound protective activity in a mouse model of sepsis. In agreement with the PD evaluations in rats and their proposed mechanism of action, both RJX-P and RJX-B exhibited near-identical potent and dose-dependent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in the LPS-GalN model of ARDS and multi-organ failure in mice.","Uckun, Fatih M; Orhan, Cemal; Powell, Joy; Sahin, Emre; Ozercan, Ibrahim H; Volk, Michael; Sahin, Kazim",Biomed Pharmacother,,246

Outpatient diagnosis and treatment of metabolically stable young persons with new-onset T1D have been shown to be equivalent to inpatient. We describe an approach to outpatient management of newly diagnosed T1D during the COVID-19 pandemic using an interdisciplinary team, telemedicine, and diabetes technologies including rapid implementation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Methods: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, new-onset cases of T1D were tracked. After laboratory confirmation of diagnosis and metabolic stability, patients and families were referred for ambulatory initiation of insulin therapy and diabetes education. These cases were reviewed using data extracted from the electronic health record, comments from multidisciplinary team members, and cloud-based glucose data. Results: We report on seven young people with new-onset T1D without diabetic ketoacidosis from April to June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ages ranged 9-23 years with presenting hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values 10-14.5%. Initial evaluation was generally face-to-face, followed by frequent telemedicine visits. Five patients had a family history of T1D. Two patients had access to at-home HbA1c kits prompting evaluation in the absence of symptoms. Four patients required emergency department evaluation. Five patients presented with ketosis. All patients were prescribed CGM at the first visit, most starting within 1 month. Conclusions: Technology is extraordinarily useful for the care of young persons with new-onset T1D in the ambulatory setting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: An online survey of patients awaiting surgery was undertaken, examining the physical and psychological impacts of pandemic isolation policies and postponing surgery, and exploring patient preferences regarding surgery during the pandemic. Results: Of 71 patients, 67.6% gained a median of 4 kg (interquartile range: 2.6-6.4), and 74.6% had adverse psychological effects;93.0% were keen to proceed with surgery. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed delays have worsened physical symptoms, increased anxiety, and delayed secondary life-altering treatments. Conclusion: From the patient's perspective, postponing surgery has been deleterious and efforts to safely reintroduce bariatric programs should be promoted.","Ahmed, B.; Altarawni, M.; Ellison, J.; Alkhaffaf, B.

Here we present a strategy for the COVID-19 vaccination rollout which can be rapidly embedded and would offer direct real-world evidence of vaccines on a large scale to generate otherwise unobtainable knowledge on the safety and perhaps efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. Such strategic rollouts leveraging randomization can provide important evidence, for COVID-19 and in future occasions, for vaccines and beyond.","Hemkens, Lars G; Goodman, Steven N",J. clin. epidemiol,,246

513394,Estimating Case Fatality and Case Recovery Rates of COVID-19: is this the right thing to do?,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Specific respiratory tract infections, including COVID-19, may cause smell and/or taste disorders (STDs) with increased frequency. The aim was to determine whether new-onset STDs are more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients. METHOD: This was a case-control study including hospitalized patients of two tertiary care centres. Consecutive patients positive for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (cases) and patients positive for influenza polymerase chain reaction (historical control sample) were assessed during specific periods, employing a self-reported STD questionnaire. RESULTS: Seventy-nine cases and 40 controls were included. No significant differences were found in basal features between the two groups. New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst cases (31, 39.2%) than in the control group (5, 12.5 %) [adjusted odds ratio 21.4 (2.77-165.4, P = 0.003)]. COVID-19 patients with new-onset STDs were significantly younger than COVID-19 patients without STDs (52.6 ± 17.2 vs. 67.4 ± 15.1, P < 0.001). Amongst COVID-19 patients who presented STDs, 22 (70.9%) recalled an acute onset and it was an initial manifestation in 11 (35.5%). Twenty-five (80.6%) presented smell disorders (mostly anosmia, 14, 45.2%) and 28 (90.3%) taste disorders (mostly ageusia, 14, 45.2%). Only four (12.9 %) reported concomitant nasal obstruction. The mean duration of STD was 7.5 ± 3.2 days and 12 patients (40%) manifested complete recovery after 7.4 ± 2.3 days of onset. CONCLUSION: New-onset STDs were significantly more frequent amongst COVID-19 patients than influenza patients; they usually had an acute onset and were commonly an initial manifestation. The use of STD assessment in anamnesis as a hint for COVID-19 and to support individuals' self-isolation in the current epidemic context is suggested.","Beltrán-Corbellini, Á; Chico-García, J L; Martínez-Poles, J; Rodríguez-Jorge, F; Natera-Villalba, E; Gómez-Corral, J; Gómez-López, A; Monreal, E; Parra-Díaz, P; Cortés-Cuevas, J L; Galán, J C; Fragola-Arnau, C; Porta-Etessam, J; Masjuan, J; Alonso-Cánovas, A",Eur. j. neurol,,246

Therefore, knowing the frequency and characteristics of these manifestations of COVID-19 is important for both clinicians and health policy makers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed. PubMed and Scopus databases and Google Scholar search engine were searched for published and unpublished preprint articles up to 10 April 2020. Original studies providing information on clinical digestive symptoms or biomarkers of liver function in patients with polymerase chain reaction confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. After quality appraisal, data were extracted. Prevalence data from individual studies were pooled using a random-effects model. Overall, 67 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis, comprising a pooled population of 13 251 patients with confirmed COVID-19. The most common gastrointestinal symptoms were anorexia (10.2%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.2%-16.4%), diarrhea (8.4%, 95% CI = 6.2%-11.2%), and nausea (5.7%, 95% CI = 3.7%-8.6%), respectively. Decreased albumin levels (39.8%, 95% CI = 15.3%-70.8%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (22.8%, 95% CI = 18.1%-28.4%), and alanine aminotransferase (20.6%, 95% CI = 16.7%-25.1%) were common hepatic findings. After adjusting for preexisting gastrointestinal (5.9%) and liver diseases (4.2%), the most common gastrointestinal findings were diarrhea (8.7%, 95% CI = 5.4%-13.9%), anorexia (8.0%, 95% CI = 3.0%-19.8%), and nausea (5.1%, 95% CI = 2.2%-14.3%). Gastrointestinal and liver manifestations are not rare in patients with COVID-19, but their prevalence might be affected by preexisting diseases. Diarrhea and mild liver abnormalities seem to be relatively common in COVID-19, regardless of comorbidities.","Zarifian, Ahmadreza; Zamiri Bidary, Mohammad; Arekhi, Soheil; Rafiee, Mahdi; Gholamalizadeh, Hanieh; Amiriani, Amirhosein; Ghaderi, Mohammad Sajjad; Khadem-Rezaiyan, Majid; Amini, Mahnaz; Ganji, Azita",J. med. virol,,246

We present the case of a 62-year-old Caucasian woman, who was previously treated with obinutuzumab and bendamustine for follicular lymphoma and showed a prolonged positive test for Covid-19. Since no improvement was observed with standard of care (including remdesivir), the possibility of hyperimmune plasma infusion was discussed. A first dose of hyperimmune plasma was administered, with subsequent onset of fever, increasing inflammatory indexes and worsening radiological findings. Three days later a second dose of plasma was administered. Within twelve hours cough and fever disappeared, and oxygen at rest was discontinued. The patient was discharged 5 days later, and nasopharyngeal swabs resulted negative 16 days after discharge.","Levi, Guido; Rocchetti, Chiara; Magri, Roberto; Uccelli, Silvia; Bottone, Damiano; Quadri, Federico; Novali, Mauro; Santin, Alessandro D; Bezzi, Michela",Monaldi arch. chest dis,,246

Methods: A review of primary data sources in the US was conducted. The data were summarized to describe national and state-level trends in the spread of COVID-19 and in policy and technology solutions. Results: COVID-19 cases and deaths initially peaked in late March and April, but after a brief reduction in June cases and deaths began rising again during July and continued to climb into early August. The US policy response is best characterized by its federalist, decentralized nature. The national government has led in terms of economic and fiscal response, increasing funding for scientific research into testing, treatment, and vaccines, and in creating more favorable regulations for the use of telemedicine. State governments have been responsible for many of the containment, testing, and treatment responses, often with little federal government support. Policies that favor economic re-opening are often followed by increases in state-level case numbers, which are then followed by stricter containment measures, such as mask wearing or pausing re-opening plans. Conclusions: While all US states have begun to ""re-open"" economic activities, this trend appears to be largely driven by social tensions and economic motivations rather than an ability to effectively test and surveil populations.","Bergquist, Savannah; Otten, Thomas; Sarich, Nick",Health Policy Technol,,246

Formation of perfect bonding between the stacked layers upon additive manufacturing (AM) consolidation and homogenous dispersion of developed nanoparticles between the layers characterized in correlation with the induced thermo-mechanical history during the deposition process. Subsequently, by conducting tensile, bending, and impact energy tests across different sections, the ultimate level and anisotropy in mechanical properties of produced 3D-layered nanocomposite structures were assessed. The results revealed the admirable dependency of mechanical properties on the testing plane specifically for the Z-section compared to the others, which indicates the strong vertical bonding between the layers as its impact effect significantly improved by the role of HA@Ag nanoparticles. The optimized consolidated nanocomposite material exhibited an excellent combination of various mechanical properties for a polymer-based structure that under the extreme state they can express as the tensile strength of up to ~120 MPa, bending strength of up to ~90 MPa, and absorbed impact energy of up to ~17 J/m.","Sharifabad, Saeed Sharifi; Derazkola, Hamed Aghajani; Esfandyar, Mehri; Elyasi, Majid; Khodabakhshi, Farzad",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,,246

One area of agreement among these reports is that front line health care workers, especially those who come into regular contact with Covid-19 patients, ought to be afforded highest priority. But this convergence, though significant, raises questions concerning the ethics of vaccine distribution among those highest-priority health care workers: If a hospital has inadequate supply to vaccinate its entire workforce, which of its essential workers should it prioritize? In this paper, we begin with a general overview of ethical questions of vaccine administration before narrowing our focus to some of the most pressing theoretical and practical issues hospital officials must face in building justifiable and actionable frameworks for vaccinating their workers. We discuss and assess some potential ambitions of hospital allocation plans, concentrating especially on the goal of protecting the community from catastrophic loss of life. Finally, we consider some specific questions hospitals will encounter when developing distribution guidelines that aim to realize this aspiration.","Reis-Dennis, Samuel; Applewhite, Megan K",Immunol Invest,,246

The consequences for global mental health due to COVID-19 are likely to be significant and may have a long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Besides physical vulnerability, pregnant women are at increased risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the consequences of social distancing. It can result in altered healthcare routines, less support from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during prenatal visits, labour and delivery. Higher than expected, rates of perinatal anxiety and depression have been already reported during the pandemic. Pregnant women may also feel insecure and worried about the effects of COVID-19 on their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to using internet services frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression, reducing the risk of serious mental health disorders, and lead to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes. OVERARCHING AIM: Our aim is to explore the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial peer-to-peer support intervention in reducing the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living in metropolitan urban settings. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We plan to conduct a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial, Mental health of Urban Mothers trial. Pregnant women living in large metropolitan cities will be recruited using internet-based application through non-profit organisations' websites. The women who consent will be randomised to receive a web-based peer-to-peer support intervention or usual care. Data will be analysed to identify the effects of intervention on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scores as well as pregnancy outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress will be assesed using Impact Event Scale-R. Any differences in outcomes between cities will be addressed in subgroup analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will follow the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

For most sports there are few recommendations based on scientific evidence for returning to team-game activities following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions, the extended duration of lockdown, and self-training or detraining in the COVID-19 environment, and this is especially true for basketball. A post-lockdown return to the basketball court ultimately depends on the teams—coaches, trainers, players, and medical staff. Nevertheless, our current scientific knowledge is evidently insufficient as far as safety and return-to-play timing are concerned. This situation presents a major challenge to basketball competition in terms of organization, prioritization, maintaining physical fitness, and decision-making. While preparing an adequate basketball return program, the players’ health is the major priority.

This inter-connectedness and factors like population growth, migration, urbanization, and climate change contribute significantly to the enhanced probability of emergence of previously unknown wildlife source pathogens at any place, any time, and without warning. Lurking in the background is the massive potential for the deliberate use of biological agents as weapons by State or non-State entities. Biological weapons have been used in wars since antiquity, however, newer research and techniques have led to these being real threats with a vast potential of harm to humans, animals, and crops. Over a period, it has become increasingly difficult to differentiate between deliberate and natural biothreat incidents. The response to both types is alike to safeguard lives, livestock, crops and the environment and reduce the consequent socio-economic ramifications. Biothreat may be targeted towards humans, animals, or crops, or all these concurrently. Every country including India is at risk of biothreat. The concept of one health is thus essential for responding to emerging infectious diseases or biothreats. Comprehensive surveillance for early detection, reporting and early concerted action is needed for prevention and blunting the effect of biothreats, which require close coordination and collaboration among various stakeholders within each country as well as globally.","Kotwal, A.; Yadav, A.",Indian Journal of Medical Research,,246

In July 2020, a project was facilitated by short‐term (6 weeks) access to an empty COVID stepdown facility built, in a hotel conference centre, commandeered by the Health Service Executive (HSE), Ireland. The aim of this study was to achieve the rapid roll‐out of an offsite OFC service, delivering high throughput of long waiting patients, while aligning with existing hospital policies and quality standards, international allergy guidelines and national social distancing standards. METHODS: The working group engaged key stakeholders to rapidly develop an offsite OFC facility. Consultant paediatric allergists, consultant paediatricians, trainees and allergy clinical nurse specialists were seconded from other duties. The facility was already equipped with hospital beds, bedside monitors (BP, pulse and oxygen saturation) and bedside oxygen. All medication and supplies had to be brought from the base hospital. Daily onsite consultant anaesthetic cover was resourced and a resuscitation room equipped. Standardized food challenge protocols were created. Access to the onsite hotel chef facilitated food preparation. A risk register was established. RESULTS: After 6 weeks of planning, the remote centre became operational on 7/9/2020, with the capacity of 27 OFC/day. 474 challenges were commenced: 465 (98%) were completed and 9 (2%) were inconclusive. 135 (29%) OFCs were positive, with 25 (5%) causing anaphylaxis. No child required advanced airway intervention. 8 children were transferred to the base hospital. The CHI allergy waiting list was reduced by almost 60% in only 24 days. CONCLUSIONS: Oral food challenges remain a vital tool in the care of allergic children, with their cost saving and quality‐of‐life benefits negatively affected by a delay in their delivery. This project has shown it is possible to have huge impacts on a waiting list efficiently, effectively and safely with good planning and staff buy‐in—even in a pandemic. Adoption of new, flexible and efficient models of service delivery will be important for healthcare delivery in the post–COVID‐19 era.","Byrne, Aideen M.; Trujillo, Juan; Fitzsimons, John; Mohammed, Tariq; Ghent, Robert; O’Carroll, Cathryn; Coghlan, David; Hourihane, Jonathan O’B; Alsalemi, Ali; Cassidy, Aoife; Corbet, Eva; Creighton, Rita; d’Art, Yvonne; Farren, Linda; Flanagan, Rachel; Flynn, Niamh; Franklin, Ruth; Gray, Claire; Harding, Paul; Hendrick, Ciara; Heraghty, Fionnuala; Hurley, Sadhbh; Kavanagh, Valerie; Lad, Dhanis; Leddy, Karen; Lewis, Sarah; McGlynn, Triona; O’Connor, Danielle; O’Neill, Phil; O’Shea, Orla; O’Toole, Ann; Quinn, Rachel; Reid, Aisling; Russell, Alison; Ruth, Emma; Rynne, Anne; Sanneerappa, P Bhusan; Sheehan, Mairead; Thompson, Claire; Tobin, Ciara; Trayer, James; Wallace, Alison; Walsh, Nicola; Wilson, Fiona",Pediatr Allergy Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152649/; https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13580,246

Despite an increased research interest into the interlink between sensemaking and strategizing, empirical evidence on how different limitations manifest in the sensemaking of individual managers in specific contexts is scarce. This study focuses on individual level sensemaking in a transforming business ecosystem as a microfoundation of strategizing. It explores the diverseness of managerial sensemaking by comparing noticed cues, moderating frames and sensemaking outcomes as reflected in different strategizing options. The empirical data derive from 52 semi-structured interviews with top managers in a local business ecosystem. Based on our analysis, we develop an empirically grounded model that unwraps the frames that influence how managers perceive and interpret the changing environment and the implications for their business. Our study provides important empirical corroboration to extant research on the cognitive microfoundations of strategizing in networked environments and adds detail to the underlying sensemaking mechanisms at play. The results highlight the local context and the identity embeddedness of focal actors herein, as factors that significantly influence managerial sensemaking in transforming business ecosystem contexts.","Penttilä, Kaisa; Ravald, Annika; Dahl, Johanna; Björk, Peter",Industrial Marketing Management,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019850120308397; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0019850120308397,246
591918,COVID‐19: some clinical questions after the first four months,2020-06-20,"Despite the importance of community health workers (CHWs) to health systems in resource-constrained environments, relatively little has been written about their contributions to pandemic preparedness. In this perspective piece, we draw from the response to the 2014 Ebola and 2015 Zika epidemics to review examples whereby CHWs contributed to health security and pandemic preparedness. CHWs promoted pandemic preparedness prior to the epidemics by increasing the access to health services and products within communities, communicating health concepts in a culturally appropriate fashion, and reducing the burdens felt by formal healthcare systems. During the epidemics, CHWs promoted pandemic preparedness by acting as community-level educators and mobilizers, contributing to surveillance systems, and filling health service gaps. Acknowledging the success CHWs have had in these roles and in previous interventions, we propose that the cadre may be better engaged in pandemic preparedness in the future. Some practical strategies for achieving this include training and using CHWs to communicate One Health information to at-risk communities prior to outbreaks, pooling them into a reserve health corps to be used during public health emergencies, and formalizing agreements and strategies to promote the early engagement of CHWs in response actions. Recognizing that CHWs already play a role in pandemic preparedness, we feel that expanding the roles and responsibilities of CHWs represents a practical means of improving pandemic and community-level resilience.","Boyce, Matthew R.; Katz, Rebecca",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972316/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2019.00062,246

The early identification of severe COVID-19 is of critical concern. Additionally, the correlation between the immunological features and clinical outcomes in severe cases needs to be explored. Objective To build a nomogram for identifying severe COVID-19 patients and explore the immunological features correlating with fatal outcomes. Methods We retrospectively enrolled 85 and 41 patients with COVID-19 in primary and validation cohorts, respectively. A predictive nomogram based on risk factors for severe COVID-19 was constructed using the primary cohort and evaluated internally and externally. Additionally, in the validation cohort, immunological features in patients with severe COVID-19 were analyzed and correlated with disease outcomes. Results The risk prediction nomogram incorporating age, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer for early identification of severe COVID-19 patients showed favorable discrimination in both the primary (AUC 0.807) and validation cohorts (AUC 0.902) and was well calibrated. Patients who died from COVID-19 showed lower abundance of peripheral CD45RO+CD3+ T cells and natural killer cells, but higher neutrophil counts than that in the patients who recovered (P=0.001, P=0.009, and P=0.009, respectively). Moreover, the abundance of CD45RO+CD3+ T cells, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-natural killer cell ratio were strong indicators of death in severe COVID-19 patients (AUC 0.933 for all three). Conclusion The novel nomogram aided the early identification of severe COVID-19 cases. Additionally, the abundance of CD45RO+CD3+ T cells and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and neutrophil-to-natural killer cell ratios may serve as useful prognostic predictors in severe patients.","Cai, Li; Zhou, Xi; Wang, Miao; Mei, Heng; Ai, Lisha; Mu, Shidai; Zhao, Xiaoyan; Chen, Wei; Hu, Yu; Wang, Huafang",J Allergy Clin Immunol Pract,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.10.043; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213219820311971; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213219820311971?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33160092/,246
593893,COVID-Induced Spontaneous Pneumothoraxes: Case Series,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND: Exome sequencing (ES) has probable utility for shortening the diagnostic odyssey of children with suspected genetic disorders. This report describes the design and methods of a study evaluating the potential of ES as a routine clinical tool for pediatric patients who have suspected genetic conditions and who are in the early stages of the diagnostic odyssey. METHODS: The North Carolina Clinical Genomic Evaluation by Next-generation Exome Sequencing (NCGENES) 2 study is an interdisciplinary, multi-site Phase III randomized controlled trial of two interventions: educational pre-visit preparation (PVP) and offer of first-line ES. In this full-factorial design, parent-child dyads are randomly assigned to one of four study arms (PVP + usual care, ES + usual care, PVP + ES + usual care, or usual care alone) in equal proportions. Participants are recruited from Pediatric Genetics or Neurology outpatient clinics in three North Carolina healthcare facilities. Eligible pediatric participants are < 16 years old and have a first visit to a participating clinic, a suspected genetic condition, and an eligible parent/guardian to attend the clinic visit and complete study measures. The study oversamples participants from underserved and under-represented populations. Participants assigned to the PVP arms receive an educational booklet and question prompt list before clinical interactions. Randomization to offer of first-line ES is revealed after a child’s clinic visit. Parents complete measures at baseline, pre-clinic, post-clinic, and two follow-up timepoints. Study clinicians provide phenotypic data and complete measures after the clinic visit and after returning results. Reportable study-related research ES results are confirmed in a CLIA-certified clinical laboratory. Results are disclosed to the parent by the clinical team. A community consultation team contributed to the development of study materials and study implementation methods and remains engaged in the project. DISCUSSION: NCGENES 2 will contribute valuable knowledge concerning technical, clinical, psychosocial, and health economic issues associated with using early diagnostic ES to shorten the diagnostic odyssey of pediatric patients with likely genetic conditions. Results will inform efforts to engage diverse populations in genomic medicine research and generate evidence that can inform policy, practice, and future research related to the utility of first-line diagnostic ES in health care.

A cross-sectional study using a web-based approach was conducted in the second week of April 2020 to examine the influence of the national social distancing on the quality of life and economic well-being of Vietnamese citizens under COVID-19 pandemic. The data included socio-economic characteristics, impact of COVID-19 on household income, health status, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Ordered logistic regression and multivariable Tobit regression model were employed to examine factors correlated to income change and HRQOL. Results showed that among 341 participants, 66.9% reported household income loss due to the impact of COVID-19. People holding undergraduate degrees, working in other sectors rather than healthcare, and having definite-term contract had a higher likelihood of income reduction. The mean score of EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS was 0.95 (± 0.07) and 88.2 (± 11.0), respectively. The domain of Anxiety/Depression had the highest proportion of reporting any problems among 5 dimensions of EQ-5D-5L (38.7%). Being female, having chronic conditions and living in the family with 3–5 members were associated with lower HRQOL scores.

This work quantifies the socioeconomic inequality, during the first wave of infections in Brazil, using available data on test diagnosis and related symptoms from the National Survey of Households - PNAD - Covid-19 /IBGE. We use the concentration curve and the concentration index, as well as a decomposition analysis to verify the factors that most influence the inequalities found in the health variables specified. The concentration index was positive for the incidence rate, indicating a greater concentration of diagnoses, number of tests, among groups with higher income levels. When considering symptoms similar to Covid-19 infection, inequality is practically non-existent. A pre-existing disease has a larger contribution to the concentration of Covid-19 in the presence of correlated symptoms, than in its diagnosis, among people with higher income. However, the results of the decomposition show that if the inequalities were explained only by race, and the fact of living in the most vulnerable regions of the country (North and Northeast), there would be a concentration of Covid-19 among the poorest.","de França, Natália Cecília; Campêlo, Guaracyane Lima; Santos de França, João Mário; Vale, Eleydiane Gomes; Badagnan, Thaísa França",EconomiA,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1517758021000163; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econ.2021.09.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1517758021000163?v=s5,246

Of particular interest are the daily rates and cumulative number of new infections, as they are monitored in infected societies, and the influence of non-pharmaceutical interventions due to different lockdown measures as well as their subsequent lifting on these infections. Estimating quantitatively the influence of a later lifting of the interventions on the resulting increase in the case numbers is important to discriminate this increase from the onset of a second wave. The recently discovered new analytical solutions of Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model allow for such forecast and the testing of lockdown and lifting interventions as they hold for arbitrary time dependence of the infection rate.

595622,COVID-19 vaccination and glomerulonephritis,2021-10-06,"The gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) are a special kind of gold nanomaterial containing several gold atoms. Because of their small size and large surface area, Au NCs possess macroscopic quantum tunneling and dielectric domain effects. Furthermore, Au NCs fluorescent materials have longer luminous time and better photobleaching resistance compared with other fluorescent materials. The synthetic process of traditional Au NCs is complicated. Traditional Au NCs are prepared mainly by using polyamide amine type dendrites, and sixteen alkyl trimethylamine bromide or sulfhydryl small molecule as stabilizers. They are consequently synthesized by the reduction of strong reducing agents such as sodium borohydride. Notably, these materials are toxic and environmental-unfriendly. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective methods for synthesizing Au NCs via a green approach. On the other hand, the self-assembly of protein gold cluster-based materials, and their biomedical applications have become research hotspots in this field.

598250,Case Report: Changes of Vascular Reactivity and Arterial Stiffness in a Patient With Covid-19 Infection,2021-05-12,"Severe COVID-19 is characterised by fever, cough, and dyspnoea. Symptoms affecting other organ systems have been reported. The clinical associations of different patterns of symptoms can influence diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making: for example, significant differential therapeutic effects in sub-groups of patients with different severities of respiratory failure have already been reported for the only treatment so far shown to reduce mortality in COVID-19, dexamethasone. We obtained structured clinical data on 68914 patients in the UK (the ISARIC Coronavirus Clinical Characterisation Consortium, 4C) and used a principled, unsupervised clustering approach to partition the first 33468 cases according to symptoms reported at recruitment. We validated our findings in a second group of 35446 cases recruited to ISARIC-4C, and in separate cohort of community cases. A core symptom set of fever, cough, and dyspnoea co-occurred with additional symptoms in three patterns: fatigue and confusion, diarrhoea and vomiting, or productive cough. Presentations with a single reported symptom of dyspnoea or confusion were common, and a subgroup of patients reported few or no symptoms. Patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms were more commonly female, had a longer duration of symptoms before presentation, and had lower 30-day mortality. Patients presenting with confusion, with or without core symptoms, were older and had a higher unadjusted mortality. Symptom clusters were highly consistent in replication analysis using a further 35446 individuals subsequently recruited to ISARIC-4C. Similar patterns were externally verified in 4445 patients from a study of self-reported symptoms of mild disease. The large scale of ISARIC-4C study enabled robust, granular discovery and replication of patient clusters. Clinical interpretation is necessary to determine which of these observations have practical utility. We propose that four patterns are usefully distinct from the core symptom groups: gastro-intestinal disease, productive cough, confusion, and pauci-symptomatic presentations. Importantly, each is associated with an in-hospital mortality which differs from that of patients with core symptoms. These observations deepen our understanding of COVID-19 and will influence clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and future mechanistic and clinical studies.","Millar, J.

598306,Analysis of the Clinical and Epidemiological Meaning of Screening Test for SARS-CoV-2: Considerations in the Chronic Kidney Disease Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-03-09,"Summary Background Bacteria and viruses are equally associated with the risk of acute episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting antibiotics as a potential treatment for such episodes. We aimed to assess the effect of azithromycin on the duration of respiratory episodes in young children with recurrent asthma-like symptoms, hypothesising that it reduces the duration of the symptomatic period. Methods In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited children aged 1–3 years, who were diagnosed with recurrent asthma-like symptoms from the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 cohort; a birth cohort consisting of the general Danish population of Zealand, including Copenhagen. Exclusion criteria were macrolide allergy, heart, liver, neurological, and kidney disease, and, before each treatment, one or more clinical signs of pneumonia (respiratory frequency of ≥50 breaths per min; fever of ≥39°C; C-reactive protein concentration of ≥476·20 nmol/L [≥50 mg/L]). Each episode of asthma-like symptoms lasting at least 3 days was randomly allocated to a 3-day course of azithromycin oral solution of 10 mg/kg per day or placebo after thorough examination by a study physician at the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma research unit. Each episode was randomly allocated independently of previous treatment from a computer-generated list of random numbers in blocks of ten (generated at the Pharmacy of Glostrup). Investigators and children were masked until the youngest child turned 3 years of age and throughout the data validation and analysis phases. The primary outcome was duration of the respiratory episode after treatment, verified by prospective daily diaries and analysed with Poisson regression. Analyses were per protocol (excluding those without a primary outcome measure or who did not receive treatment). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01233297. Findings Between Nov 17, 2010, and Jan 28, 2014, we randomly allocated 158 asthma-like episodes in 72 children (79 [50%] to azithromycin and 79 [50%] to placebo). The mean duration of the episode after treatment was 3·4 days for children receiving azithromycin compared with 7·7 days for children receiving placebo. Azithromycin caused a significant shortening of the episode of 63·3% (95% CI 56·0–69·3; p<0·0001). The effect size increased with early initiation of treatment, showing a reduction in episode duration of 83% if treatment was initiated before day 6 of the episode compared with 36% if initiated on or after day 6 (p<0·0001). We noted no differences in clinical adverse events between the azithromycin (18 [23%] of 78 episodes included in final analysis) and placebo (24 [30%] of 79) groups (p=0·30), but we did not investigate bacterial resistance patterns after treatment. Interpretation Azithromycin reduced the duration of episodes of asthma-like symptoms in young children, suggesting that this drug could have a role in acute management of exacerbations.

This systematic literature review aimed to strengthen the quality and completeness of evidence on infectious diseases following flooding, relevant to Europe. Methods A systematic literature review from 2004–2012 was performed. Focused searches of the following databases were conducted: Medline, Scopus, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Evidence Aid. Personal communications with key informants were also reviewed. Results Thirty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria. Evidence suggested that water-borne, rodent-borne, and vector-borne diseases have been associated with flooding in Europe, although at a lower incidence than developing countries. Conclusion Disease surveillance and early warning systems, coupled with effective prevention and response capabilities, can reduce current and future vulnerability to infectious diseases following flooding.","Brown, Lisa; Murray, Virginia",Disaster Health,https://doi.org/10.4161/dish.25216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28228994/,246

Viral infections in the ICU often involve the respiratory or the central nervous system and can cause significant morbidity and mortality especially in immunocompromised patients. The mainstay of therapy of viral infections is supportive care and antiviral therapy when available. Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral infection has provided great potential for the discovery of new antiviral agents that target viral proteins or host proteins that regulate immunity and are involved in the viral life cycle.

We investigated the experiences of frontline health care workers recovering from COVID-19 in Lagos State Nigeria. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study among frontline health workers recovering from COVID-19 in Lagos State, Nigeria. We interviewed 12 respondents before achieving data saturation. We used a checklist to guide the interview according to the phenomenon under study. Data obtained were analyzed using Colaizzi’s phenomenological method. RESULTS: The study was summarized under five themes: knowledge of COVID-19, exposure, reactions, challenges and recommendations. The respondents were quite knowledgeable on COVID-19, their reactions when informed of their status were denial, anxiety, distress, disorientation, crying for fear of stigmatization, while some were psychologically prepared. Reactions from colleagues, family and friends were encouraging and provided solace for them with a few colleagues and families that had negative reactions. Challenges include anosmia, movement restriction, loneliness, worries about the state of their families, nondisclosure of status to family members, non-conducive isolation centre with limited space, insomnia, stigmatization by health workers at the isolation centre, extended duration of stay, delay in the release of test results and use of ambulance for evacuation to the isolation centres. Coping strategies were watching movies, phone calls, use of social media, listening to music, attending webinars, working on projects and reading spiritual books. Recommendations were early laboratory testing of samples and conveying of results, increase testing capacity, the need of health care workers to be more compassionate, better method of evacuation of people that tested positive to COVID-19, aside the use of ambulance that increases the likelihood of stigmatization and standard guideline for the case management of people recovering from COVID-19 in Lagos state. CONCLUSIONS: Respondents felt stigmatized and psychologically and morally traumatized. Isolation is a difficult experience and some negative emotions as expressed by previous studies were experienced by the respondents. There is need for increased testing capacity, timely results dissemination, early evacuation and creation of more isolation centres in Lagos State due to the rising number of cases and shortage of bed space.

Movements ranged from simple actions to complex movements requiring executive functioning. In total, 110 fourth graders (60 boys, 50 girls) participated in this experiment. Body composition (BMI, % of body fat), physical activity (pedometer), physical fitness (muscular strength, endurance, power, flexibility, and VO(2)max), and complex movement abilities (Illinois Agility test, soda pop hand test, and soda pop foot test) were measured. Regression modeling of body composition and fitness/activity variables was able to account for 30.5% of the variation of total academic scores in females, but only 4.3% in males. No individual tests were reliably correlated with multiple academic outcomes in males. However, hand and foot soda pop times, as well as Illinois Agility scores, were repeatedly correlated with academic outcomes in females, each correlating with 4 of the 6 academic scores. Body composition and physical activity level did not correlate with academic achievement, and simple physical fitness showed a low correlation with academic achievement in both boys and girls. On the other hand, complex, cognitively demanding movements such as the Illinois Agility, soda pop hand, and soda pop foot tests had consistent correlations with academic achievement in girls, but not in boys.","Ryu, Jong-Sik; Chung, Hae Ryong; Meador, Benjamin M.; Seo, Yongsuk; Kim, Kyung-O",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33652565/,246

However, little is known about the nature of the illness in children. The reopening of schools underlines the importance of understanding the epidemiology of pediatric COVID-19 infections. We sought to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes in pediatric COVID-19 patients. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of pediatric patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from healthcare organizations in the United States. The study outcomes (hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, critical care) were assessed using logistic regression. The subgroups of sex and race were compared after propensity score matching. Among 12,306 children with lab-confirmed COVID-19, 16.5% presented with respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), 13.9% had gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain), 8.1% had dermatological symptoms (rash), 4.8% had neurological (headache), and 18.8% had other non-specific symptoms (fever, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia and disturbances of smell or taste). In the study cohort, the hospitalization frequency was 5.3%, with 17.6% needing critical care services and 4.1% requiring mechanical ventilation. Following propensity score matching, the risk of all outcomes was similar between males and females. Following propensity score matching, the risk of hospitalization was greater in non-Hispanic Black (RR 1.97 [95% CI 1.49–2.61]) and Hispanic children (RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.03–1.78]) compared with non-Hispanic Whites.

602319,Dynamic Changes in Coagulation Function in Patients With Pneumonia Under Admission and Non-admission Treatment,2021-05-24,"BACKGROUND: Isolation of hospitalized persons under investigation (PUIs) for COVID-19 reduces nosocomial transmission risk. Efficient PUI evaluation is needed to preserve scarce healthcare resources. We describe the development, implementation, and outcomes of an inpatient diagnostic algorithm and clinical decision support system (CDSS) to evaluate PUIs. METHODS: We conducted a pre-post study of CORAL (COvid Risk cALculator), a CDSS that guides frontline clinicians through a risk-stratified COVID-19 diagnostic workup, removes transmission-based precautions when workup is complete and negative, and triages complex cases to Infectious Diseases (ID) physician review. Pre-CORAL, ID physicians reviewed all PUI records to guide workup and precautions. Post-CORAL, frontline clinicians evaluated PUIs directly using CORAL. We compared pre- and post-CORAL frequency of repeat SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), time from NAAT result to PUI status discontinuation, total duration of PUI status, and ID physician work-hours, using linear and logistic regression, adjusted for COVID-19 incidence. RESULTS: Fewer PUIs underwent repeat testing after an initial negative NAAT post-CORAL than pre-CORAL (54% vs. 67%; aOR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.44-0.63, p<0.01). CORAL significantly reduced average time to PUI status discontinuation (adjusted difference: -7.4 [SE 0.8] hours/patient; p<0.01), total duration of PUI status (adjusted difference: -19.5 [SE 1.9] hours/patient; p<0.01), and average ID physician work-hours (adjusted difference: -57.4 [SE 2.0] hours/day; p<0.01). No patients had a positive NAAT within 7 days after discontinuation of precautions via CORAL. CONCLUSIONS: CORAL is an efficient and effective CDSS to guide frontline clinicians through the diagnostic evaluation of PUIs and safe discontinuation of precautions.","Dugdale, Caitlin M; Rubins, David M; Lee, Hang; McCluskey, Suzanne M; Ryan, Edward T; Kotton, Camille N; Hurtado, Rocio M; Ciaranello, Andrea L; Barshak, Miriam B; McEvoy, Dustin S; Nelson, Sandra B; Basgoz, Nesli; Lazarus, Jacob E; Ivers, Louise C; Reedy, Jennifer L; Hysell, Kristen M; Lemieux, Jacob E; Heller, Howard M; Dutta, Sayon; Albin, John S; Brown, Tyler S; Miller, Amy L; Calderwood, Stephen B; Walensky, Rochelle P; Zachary, Kimon C; Hooper, David C; Hyle, Emily P; Shenoy, Erica S",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33564833/,246

603192,Persistent viral RNA shedding after COVID‐19 symptom resolution in older convalescent plasma donors,2020-06-24,"BACKGROUND: It has been reported that virus-mediated brain tissue damage can lead to autoimmune encephalitis (AE) characterized by the presence of antibodies against neuronal surface antigens. In the study, we investigate the presence of viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with AE using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/PCR and shotgun metagenomics. METHODS: CSF samples collected from 200 patients with encephalitis were tested for the presence of antibodies against antiglutamate receptor (NMDAR), contactin-associated protein 2 (CASPR2), glutamate receptors (type AMPA1/2), leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1), dipeptidyl aminopeptidase-like protein 6 (DPPX), and GABA B receptor, and those found positive were further analyzed with real-time RT-PCR/PCR for common viral neuroinfections and shotgun DNA- and RNA-based metagenomics. RESULTS: Autoantibodies against neuronal cells were detected in CSF from 8 individuals (4% of all encephalitis patients): 7 (3.5%) had anti-NMDAR and 1 (0.5%) had anti-GABA B. RT-PCR/PCR identified human herpes virus type 1 (HSV-1; 300 copies/mL) and the representative of Enterovirus genus (550 copies/mL) in 1 patient each. Torque teno virus (TTV) was found in another patient using metagenomic analysis, and its presence was confirmed by specific PCR. CONCLUSIONS: We detected the presence of HSV, TTV, and Enterovirus genus in CSF samples from 3 out of 8 AE patients. These findings support the concept of viral involvement in the pathogenesis of this disease.","Perlejewski, Karol; Pawełczyk, Agnieszka; Bukowska-Ośko, Iwona; Rydzanicz, Małgorzata; Dzieciątkowski, Tomasz; Paciorek, Marcin; Makowiecki, Michał; Caraballo Cortés, Kamila; Grochowska, Marta; Radkowski, Marek; Laskus, Tomasz",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa468; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33209955/,246

METHODS: From January 2016 to June 2018, a total of 182 adult patients presented with symptoms of ARI and admitted to the hospital were tested for 15 respiratory viruses by multiplex reverse‐transcription polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were collected by retrospective analysis of the patient's chart. RESULTS: A virus was identified in 106 (58.5%) of the patients. The most commonly detected virus was influenza virus (41.5%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (13.8%), human metapneumovirus (13.0%), parainfluenza viruses (12.2%), rhinoviruses (11.4%), adenovirus and coronaviruses with equal frequencies (3.3%), and enterovirus (1.6%). The serum level of C‐reactive protein and white blood cell count were significantly lower in patients with respiratory viruses identified when compared with those in whom no virus was detected (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively). There were no differences in clinical symptoms according to the type of the detected virus, except for more frequent illness exposure recall for influenza infection ( P = 0.010). Influenza, parainfluenza, and pneumoviruses were detected mostly in winter months, while rhinoviruses in autumn and spring. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to influenza, pneumoviruses, rhinoviruses, and parainfluenza viruses play an important role in etiology of ARIs in adults. Fast and accurate laboratory diagnosis for respiratory viruses in routine practice is needed for clinicians optimally manage patients with ARI and potentially avoid the unnecessary use of antimicrobial drugs.","Civljak, Rok; Tot, Tatjana; Falsey, Ann R.; Huljev, Eva; Vranes, Jasmina; Ljubin‐Sternak, Suncanica",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30801727/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.25437,246

605238,The Evolving Role of Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-04-30,"Background: Due to the limited availability of rapid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, these tests are often reserved for those requiring urgent procedures or hospital admission and are often not available to emergency department (ED) patients. Complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein (CRP) and Ferritin levels can be easily obtained in the ED. Lymphopenia and high C-reactive protein and Ferritin levels are associated with poor outcome in COVID-19 illness. However, it is not known whether these biomarkers are useful for identifying persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of patients 18 years or older who were evaluated at an academic ED for suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection from March to May 2020. CBC, CRP and Ferritin levels were ordered at clinician’s discretion in patients who were suspected to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed using a number of PCR-based tests including the Cepheid Xpert Xpress and the Diasorin Simplexa. The discriminative values of the candidate biomarkers were estimated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: We studied a total of 1082 patients who had a median age of 59.5 (IQR: 46.0 – 71.0) years. A total of 431 (39.8%) of the subjects had PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median absolute lymphocyte count was 0.9 (IQR: 0.7 – 1.3) and 1.0 (0.7 – 1.6) in those with and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively (p=0.0004). The median CRP level in mg/L was 8.9 (IQR: 4.6 – 17.3) and 6.1 (IQR: 1.6 – 14.0) in those with and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively (p=0.0001). The median ferritin level in ng/mL was 782 (IQR: 299 – 1479) and 312 (IQR: 106 – 1015) in those with and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection respectively (p=0.0001). Lymphocyte count, CRP and Ferritin levels distinguished between those with and those without SARS-CoV-2 infection with AUCs of 0.56 (IQR: 0.53 – 0.60), 0.61 (IQR: 0.58 – 0.64) and 0.66 (IQR: 0.62 – 0.68).

605540,Reactive arthritis after COVID-19: a case-based review,2021-09-22,"COVID-19 virus can replicate in the infected individual's larynx independently, which is different from other viruses that replicate in lungs only, e.g. SARS. It might contribute to the fast spread of COVID-19. However, there are few scientific reports about quantitative comparison of COVID-19 exposure dose (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) for the susceptible individual when the viruses were released from the larynx or lungs. In this paper, a typical numerical model was built based on a breathing human model with real respiratory tract. By using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, two kinds of virus released sites in the infected individual's respiratory tract (larynx, lungs), seven kinds of particle sizes between 1 and 50 μm, three kinds of expiratory flow rates: calm (10 L/min), moderate (30 L/min) and intense (90 L/min) were used to compare the particle deposition proportion and escape proportion. The inhalation dose and the adhesion dose of the susceptible individual were quantified. The results showed that COVID-19 virus-containing droplets and aerosols might be released into the environment at higher proportions (39.1%–44.2%) than viruses that replicate in lungs only (15.3%–37.1%). The exposure doses (inhalation dose and adhesion dose) of the susceptible individual in different situations were discussed. The susceptible individual suffered a higher exposure dose when the viruses were released from the larynx rather than lungs (the difference for 1 μm particles was 1.2–2.2 times). This study provides a possible explanation for the higher transmission risk of COVID-19 virus compared to other viruses and some control advice of COVID-19 in typical indoor environments were also discussed.","Wu, Jialin; Weng, Wenguo",Environ Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935121006551?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0013935121006551; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34029546/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111361,246
605767,Cranial Nerve Involvement and Dysautonomia in Post-COVID-19 Guillain-Barré Syndrome.,2021-08-24,"Remote digital pathology allows healthcare systems to maintain pathology operations during public health emergencies. Existing Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments regulations require pathologists to electronically verify patient reports from a certified facility. During the 2019 pandemic of COVID-19 disease, caused by the SAR-CoV-2 virus, this requirement potentially exposes pathologists, their colleagues, and household members to the risk of becoming infected. Relaxation of government enforcement of this regulation allows pathologists to review and report pathology specimens from a remote, non-CLIA certified facility. The availability of digital pathology systems can facilitate remote microscopic diagnosis, although formal comprehensive (case-based) validation of remote digital diagnosis has not been reported. All glass slides representing routine clinical signout workload in surgical pathology subspecialties at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center were scanned on an Aperio GT450 at ×40 equivalent resolution (0.26 µm/pixel). Twelve pathologists from nine surgical pathology subspecialties remotely reviewed and reported complete pathology cases using a digital pathology system from a non-CLIA certified facility through a secure connection. Whole slide images were integrated to and launched within the laboratory information system to a custom vendor-agnostic, whole slide image viewer. Remote signouts utilized consumer-grade computers and monitors (monitor size, 13.3–42 in.; resolution, 1280 × 800–3840 × 2160 pixels) connecting to an institution clinical workstation via secure virtual private network. Pathologists subsequently reviewed all corresponding glass slides using a light microscope within the CLIA-certified department. Intraobserver concordance metrics included reporting elements of top-line diagnosis, margin status, lymphovascular and/or perineural invasion, pathology stage, and ancillary testing. The median whole slide image file size was 1.3 GB; scan time/slide averaged 90 s; and scanned tissue area averaged 612 mm(2). Signout sessions included a total of 108 cases, comprised of 254 individual parts and 1196 slides. Major diagnostic equivalency was 100% between digital and glass slide diagnoses; and overall concordance was 98.8% (251/254). This study reports validation of primary diagnostic review and reporting of complete pathology cases from a remote site during a public health emergency. Our experience shows high (100%) intraobserver digital to glass slide major diagnostic concordance when reporting from a remote site. This randomized, prospective study successfully validated remote use of a digital pathology system including operational feasibility supporting remote review and reporting of pathology specimens, and evaluation of remote access performance and usability for remote signout.","Hanna, Matthew G.; Reuter, Victor E.; Ardon, Orly; Kim, David; Sirintrapun, Sahussapont Joseph; Schüffler, Peter J.; Busam, Klaus J.; Sauter, Jennifer L.; Brogi, Edi; Tan, Lee K.; Xu, Bin; Bale, Tejus; Agaram, Narasimhan P.; Tang, Laura H.; Ellenson, Lora H.; Philip, John; Corsale, Lorraine; Stamelos, Evangelos; Friedlander, Maria A.; Ntiamoah, Peter; Labasin, Marc; England, Christine; Klimstra, David S.; Hameed, Meera",Mod Pathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32572154/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-020-0601-5,246

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have evaluated the comparative safety and efficacy of L/R combination. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comparative, observational studies and controlled clinical trials comparing L/R combination to standard of care (SOC)/control or any other antiviral agent/combinations were included. A total of 10 databases were searched to identify 13 studies that fulfilled the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. RESULTS: No discernible beneficial effect was seen in the L/R group in comparison to SOC/control in terms of “progression to more severe state” (4 studies, odds ratio [OR]: 1.446 [0.722–2.895]), “mortality” (3 studies, OR: 1.208 [0.563–2.592]), and “virological cure on days 7–10” (3 studies, OR: 0.777 [0.371–1.630]), while the L/R combination arm performed better than the SOC/control arm in terms of “duration of hospital stay” (3 studies, mean difference (MD): −1.466 [−2.403 to − 0.529]) and “time to virological cure” (3 studies, MD: −3.272 [−6.090 to − 0.454]). No difference in efficacy was found between L/R versus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and L/R versus arbidol. However, in a single randomized controlled trail (open label), chloroquine (CQ) performed better than L/R. The combination L/R with arbidol may be beneficial (in terms of virological clearance and radiological improvement); however, we need more dedicated studies. Single studies report efficacy of L/R + interferon (IFN, either alpha or 1-beta) combination. We need more studies to delineate the proper effect size. Regarding adverse effects, except occurrence of diarrhea (higher in the L/R group), safety was comparable to SOC. CONCLUSION: In our study, no difference was seen between the L/R combination and the SOC arm in terms of “progression to more severe state,” “mortality,” and virological cure on days 7–10;” however, some benefits in terms of “duration of hospital stay” and “time to virological cure” were seen. No significant difference in efficacy was seen when L/R was compared to arbidol and HCQ monotherapy. Except for the occurrence of diarrhea, which was higher in the L/R group, safety profile of L/R is comparable to SOC. Compared to L/R combination, CQ, L/R + arbidol, L/R + IFN-α, and L/R + IFN-1β showed better efficacy, but the external validity of these findings is limited by limited number of studies (1 study each).","Bhattacharyya, Anusuya; Kumar, Subodh; Sarma, Phulen; Kaur, Hardeep; Prajapat, Manisha; Shekhar, Nishant; Bansal, Seema; Avti, Pramod; Hazarika, Mythili; Sharma, Saurabh; Mahendru, Dhruv; Prakash, Ajay; Medhi, Bikash",Indian J Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33078733/; https://doi.org/10.4103/ijp.ijp_627_20,246

Despite considerable attention dedicated to COVID-19, the link between metabolic syndrome and SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unclear. Using data from the UK Biobank, we investigated the relationship between severity of COVID-19 and metabolic syndrome-related serum biomarkers measured prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Logistic regression analyses were used to test biomarker levels and biomarker-associated genetic variants with SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes. Among SARS-CoV-2-positive cases and negative controls, a 10mg/dL increase in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) levels was associated with ∼10% reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, after adjustment for age, sex, obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease. Evaluation of known genetic variants for HDL cholesterol revealed that individuals homozygous for ApoE4 alleles had ∼2-3-fold higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or mortality from COVID-19 compared to ApoE3 homozygotes, even after adjustment for HDL cholesterol levels. However, cumulative effects of all evaluated HDL cholesterol-raising alleles and Mendelian randomization analyses did not reveal association of genetically higher HDL cholesterol levels with decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results implicate serum HDL cholesterol and ApoA1 levels measured prior to SAR-CoV-2 exposure as clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection but do not provide evidence that genetically elevated HDL cholesterol levels are associated with SAR-CoV-2 infection.","Hilser, James R.; Han, Yi; Biswas, Subarna; Gukasyan, Janet; Cai, Zhiheng; Zhu, Ruowei; Tang, W.H.

606503,Delayed hospital presentation of acute central retinal artery occlusion during the COVID-19 crisis: the HORA study brief report No. 4,2021,"BACKGROUND: Unavailability or saturation of the intensive care unit may be associated with the fatality of COVID-19. Prioritizing the patients for hospitalization and intensive care may be critical for reducing the fatality of COVID-19. This study aimed to develop and validate a new integer-based scoring system for predicting patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, using only the predictors available upon triage. METHODS: This is a retrospective study using cohort data from the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that included all admitted patients with COVID-19 between January 19 and June 3, 2020, in South Korea. The primary outcome was patients requiring intensive care defined as actual admission to the intensive care unit; at any time use of an extracorporeal life support device, mechanical ventilation, or vasopressors; and death. Patients admitted until March 20 were included for the training dataset to develop the prediction models and externally validated for the patients admitted afterward. Two logistic regression models were developed with different predictors and the predictive performance was compared: one with patient-provided variables and the other with added radiologic and laboratory variables. An integer-based scoring system was developed based on the developed logistic regression model. RESULTS: A total of 5193 patients were considered, with 4663 patients included after excluding patients with age under 18 or insufficient data. For the training dataset, 3238 patients were included. Of the included patients, 444 (9.5%) patients required intensive care. The model developed with only the clinical variables showed an area under the curve of 0.884 for the validation set. The performance did not differ when radiologic and laboratory variables were added. Seven variables were selected for developing an integer-based scoring system: age, sex, initial body temperature, dyspnea, hemoptysis, history of chronic kidney disease, and activities of daily living. The area under the curve of the scoring system was 0.880. CONCLUSIONS: An integer-based scoring system was developed for predicting patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive care, with high performance. This system may aid decision support for prioritizing the patient for hospitalization and intensive care, particularly in a situation with limited medical resources.

In addition to its anti-malarial effect, artemisinin displays anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects in vivo and in vitro. Recently, much attention has been paid to the therapeutic role of artemisinin in liver diseases. Several studies suggest that artemisinin and its derivatives can protect the liver through different mechanisms, such as those pertaining to inflammation, proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and induction of apoptosis and autophagy. In this review, we provide a comprehensive discussion of the underlying molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways of artemisinin and its derivatives in treating liver diseases. Further pharmacological research will aid in determining whether artemisinin and its derivatives may serve as promising medicines for the treatment of liver diseases in the future.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been postulated that children’s play was affected, not only regarding the time children spent playing but also in terms of the qualitative characteristics of play. The aim of this review was to investigate how children’s play has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A review was conducted in the PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, SCOPUS, ERIC, PsycInfo, and JSTOR databases up to 6 December 2020. Furthermore, references of eligible studies as well as of relevant articles were searched using a snowballing technique. The search retrieved 17 eligible studies, conducted in Europe and North America. In general, outdoor play was reduced during the pandemic; on the other hand, there was an increase in indoor play and in videogames-screen time. COVID-19 was present in children’s pretend play. Children’s play was a key contributor to children’s mood and wellbeing. Furthermore, teachers were especially concerned about how children’s play was affected during the lockdown measures. There is evidence that children’s play habits were affected during the COVID-19 pandemic; further research is required, especially cross-culturally oriented.","Kourti, Anastasia; Stavridou, Androniki; Panagouli, Eleni; Psaltopoulou, Theodora; Tsolia, Maria; Sergentanis, Theodoros N.; Tsitsika, Artemis",Children (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34438597/; https://doi.org/10.3390/children8080706,246

Here, we present the first structure of a prokaryotic EndoU toxin in complex with its cognate immunity protein. The contact-dependent growth inhibition toxin CdiA-CT(STECO31) from Escherichia coli STEC_O31 adopts the eukaryotic EndoU fold and shares greatest structural homology with the nuclease domain of coronavirus Nsp15. The toxin contains a canonical His-His-Lys catalytic triad in the same arrangement as eukaryotic EndoU domains, but lacks the uridylate-specific ribonuclease activity that characterizes the superfamily. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that bacterial EndoU domains segregate into at least three major clades based on structural variations in the N-terminal subdomain. Representative EndoU nucleases from clades I and II degrade tRNA molecules with little specificity. In contrast, CdiA-CT(STECO31) and other clade III toxins are specific anticodon nucleases that cleave tRNA(Glu) between nucleotides C37 and m(2)A38. These findings suggest that the EndoU fold is a versatile scaffold for the evolution of novel substrate specificities. Such functional plasticity may account for the widespread use of EndoU effectors by diverse inter-bacterial toxin delivery systems.","Michalska, Karolina; Nhan, Dinh Quan; Willett, Julia L.

We characterized seven anti-SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) antibodies for binding activity, pairing capability, and neutralization activity to SARS-CoV-2 and three variant RBDs via lateral flow immunoassays. The results allowed us to group these antibodies into three distinct epitope bins. Our studies showed that two antibodies had broadly potent neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 and these variant RBDs and that one antibody did not neutralize the South African (SA) and Brazilian P.1 (BR P.1) RBDs. The antibody escaped by the SA and BR P.1 RBDs retained binding activity to SA and BR P.1 RBDs but was unable to induce neutralization. We demonstrated that lateral flow immunoassay could be a rapid and effective tool for antibody characterization, including epitope classification and antibody neutralization kinetics. The potential contributions of the mutations (N501Y, E484K, and K417N/T) contained in these variants’ RBDs to the antibody pairing capability, neutralization activity, and therapeutic antibody targeting strategy are discussed.","Tan, Enqing; Frew, Erica; Cooper, Jeff; Humphrey, John; Holden, Matthew; Mand, Amanda Restell; Li, Jun; Anderson, Shaya; Bi, Ming; Hatler, Julia; Person, Anthony; Mortari, Frank; Gould, Kevin; Barry, Shelly",Diagnostics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/diagnostics11071190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34208912/,246

Surprisingly, emergency activity also registered a reduction in frequency. METHODS: This multicentre retrospective study aims to investigate eventual changes in ENT surgical emergencies in a highly populated area of southern Italy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data concerning the period between the February 1 and the May 31, 2020 were collected from the main three hospitals in the district and compared with the same period of 2019. RESULTS: A substantial reduction was found in the number of ENT emergency interventions in 2020 compared to the same period of 2019, particularly in the main lockdown phase and in the tertiary referral centre. CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in the absolute number of emergency ENT interventions can be only partially explained by social distancing and home confinement. We have reason to believe that some of these patients may have not sought medical support due to fear of nosocomial SARS-CoV2 infection. This study could represent a trigger for further implementation of health system responses to emergencies in a period of transition that is likely to last for a prolonged period of time.","Pontillo, Vito; Iannuzzi, Lucia; Petrone, Paolo; Sciancalepore, Pasqua Irene; D’Auria, Carlo; Rinaldi, Massimo; Graziano, Giusi; Quaranta, Nicola",Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital,https://doi.org/10.14639/0392-100x-n1036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33231206/,246

Host-pathogen interactions during the infective phase of influenza are well studied, but little is known about the host’s response during the repair stage. Here, we show that influenza infection stimulated the expression of angiopoietin-like 4 (ANGPTL4) via a direct IL6-STAT3-mediated mechanism. ANGPTL4 enhanced pulmonary tissue leakiness and exacerbated inflammation-induced lung damage. Treatment of infected mice with neutralizing anti-ANGPTL4 antibodies significantly accelerated lung recovery and improved lung tissue integrity. ANGPTL4-deficient mice also showed reduced lung damage and recovered faster from influenza infection when compared to their wild-type counterparts. Retrospective examination of human lung biopsy specimens from infection-induced pneumonia with tissue damage showed elevated expression of ANGPTL4 when compared to normal lung samples. These observations underscore the important role that ANGPTL4 plays in lung infection and damage and may facilitate future therapeutic strategies for the treatment of influenza pneumonia.","Li, Liang; Chong, Han Chung; Ng, Say Yong; Kwok, Ka Wai; Teo, Ziqiang; Tan, Eddie Han Pin; Choo, Chee Chong; Seet, Ju Ee; Choi, Hyung Won; Buist, Martin Lindsay; Chow, Vincent Tak Kwong; Tan, Nguan Soon",Cell Rep,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211124715000248; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25660016/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124715000248; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2015.01.011,246

In April–May 2020, state governments started political discussions about whether it would be worth the risk to reduce protective measures. In a highly politicized environment, risk perceptions and preferences for risk mitigation may vary by political inclinations. In April–May 2020, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of 5517 members of the University of Southern California’s Understanding America Study. Of those, 37% identified as Democrats, 32% as Republican, and 31% as Third Party/Independent. Overall, Democrats perceived more risk associated with COVID-19 than Republicans, including for getting infected, being hospitalized and dying if infected, as well as running out of money as a result of the pandemic. Democrats were also more likely than Republicans to express concerns that states would lift economic restrictions too quickly, and to report mask use and social distancing. Generally, participants who identified as Third Party/Independent fell in between. Democrats were more likely to report watching MSNBC or CNN (vs. not), while Republicans were more likely to report watching Fox News (vs. not), and Third Party/Independents tended to watch neither. However, political inclinations predicted reported policy preferences, mask use, and social distancing, in analyses that accounted for differences in use of media sources, risk perceptions, and demographic background. In these analyses, participants’ reported media use added to the partisan divide in preferences for the timing of lifting economic restrictions and reported protective behaviors.

We conducted this survey to assess the quantitative and qualitative effects of this pandemic on the sleep of doctors. METHODS: A survey was created on Google Forms and it was circulated / sent through WhatsApp for voluntary participation amongst several groups of doctors and individually as well. RESULTS: We received 304 responses from doctors of various specialties, cadres and background. Our results showed that 52% of them were involved in direct clinical care of COVID-19 patients. 55.8% doctors reported changes in sleep pattern and 37.2% reported reduced duration of sleep, as compared to the time before the pandemic. More than 50% of them slept for less than 7 hours a night since the beginning of the pandemic. 37% had difficulty falling asleep and maintaining sleep. 30% had difficulty in concentration and functioning during day-time. Non-refreshing sleep was experienced by 36.3% of them and 18.8% of physicians had recollected having COVID-19 related dreams. 33% doctors’ last thought before sleep and first thought after waking up were about COVID-19. 36% doctors looked for information about COVID-19 on media immediately before going to sleep and immediately after waking up. More than 60% doctors started meditation, exercise, yoga or relaxation techniques for getting better sleep.

We show that IFITM expression reduces HIV-1 viral protein synthesis by preferentially excluding viral mRNA transcripts from translation and thereby restricts viral production. Codon-optimization of proviral DNA rescues viral translation, implying that IFITM-mediated restriction requires recognition of viral RNA elements. In addition, we find that expression of the viral accessory protein Nef can help overcome the IFITM-mediated inhibition of virus production.

612001,Multiple Presentations of LRBA Deficiency: a Single-Center Experience,2017-09-27,"Summary: The main functions of memory T cells are to provide protection upon re‐exposure to a pathogen and to prevent the re‐emergence of low‐grade persistent pathogens. Memory T cells achieve these functions through their high frequency and elevated activation state, which lead to rapid responses upon antigenic challenge. The significance and characteristics of memory CD8(+) T cells in viral infections have been studied extensively. In many of these studies of T‐cell memory, experimental viral immunologists go to great lengths to assure that their animal colonies are free of endogenous pathogens in order to design reproducible experiments. These experimental results are then thought to provide the basis for our understanding of human immune responses to viruses. Although these findings can be enlightening, humans are not immunologically naïve, and they often have memory T‐cell populations that can cross‐react with and respond to a new infectious agent or cross‐react with allo‐antigens and influence the success of tissue transplantation. These cross‐reactive T cells can become activated and modulate the immune response and outcome of subsequent heterologous infections, a phenomenon we have termed heterologous immunity. These large memory populations are also accommodated into a finite immune system, requiring that the host makes room for each new population of memory cell. It appears that memory cells are part of a continually evolving interactive network, where with each new infection there is an alteration in the frequencies, distributions, and activities of memory cells generated in response to previous infections and allo‐antigens.","Selin, Liisa K.; Brehm, Michael A.; Naumov, Yuri N.; Cornberg, Markus; Kim, Sung‐Kwon; Clute, Shalyn C.; Welsh, Raymond M.",Immunol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16824126/,246

This resulted in curbing the epidemic by reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a second peak in infections. More details on the specific circumstances that promote exponential spread (i.e. Rt>1) and the measures that contributed most to a reduction in Rt are needed. Here we show that in 33 of 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada), Rt fell to around or below one during lockdown (March - May 2020). One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. Country-wide compulsory usage of masks was implemented only in Slovakia 10 days into lockdown, and on its own reduced transmission by half. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower Rt during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. These results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that large recreational gatherings are super-spreading events, and may even suggest that infections during day-to-day contact at work are not sufficient to spark exponential growth. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use.","Deforche, K.; Vercauteren, J.; MuÌller, V.; Vandamme, A.-M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.20.20136382v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.20.20136382,246

On March 29th, Nigeria instituted a nationwide lockdown. It is pertinent to understand the pattern created by this lockdown. This could offer insights into how people perceive the hazard and the level of compliance across the States in Nigeria. Mobile phone-based mobility data and the number of new cases from the beginning to the end of the lockdown were utilised. The study examines space-time trends across different place categories at the state level. Place categories witnessed mobility reduction as high as 56%, 57%, 65%, 75%, 38% for retail and recreation (RtRc), Grocery and Pharmacy (GrPh), Park, and Transport Hubs (Trst) respectively. Most States recorded mobility uptrend towards workplace, retail and recreational areas. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified two dimensions from the Space-time trends. The first dimension (D1) accounted for 66% of the variance. Examination of the Object Scores from the MCA showed that there are two classes–two risk perception groups. The pattern of mobility recorded shows that there is a variation in mobility restriction compliance across the States. The trend groupings identified captured an aspect of risk perception within each State. Thus, pointing to difference in levels of risk acceptance. With the level of misinformation currently being experienced worldwide, concerted efforts should be made on improving risk perception to prevent the re-emergence of the disease.","Lawal, Olanrewaju; Nwegbu, Chidozie",GeoJournal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162644/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10708-020-10331-z,246
612668,White Blood Cell and Platelet Dynamics Define Human Inflammatory Recovery,2021-06-23,"INTRODUCTION: The role of telemedicine is rapidly evolving across medical specialties and orthopaedics. The utility of telemedicine to identify operative candidates and determine surgical plans has yet to be demonstrated. We sought to assess whether surgical plans proposed following telemedicine visits changed after subsequent in-person interaction across orthopaedic subspecialties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified all elective telemedicine encounters across two academic institutions from March 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020. We identified patients indicated for surgery with a specific surgical plan during the virtual visit. The surgical plans delineated during the telemedicine encounter were then compared to final pre-operative plans documented following subsequent in-person evaluation. Changes in the surgical plan between telemedicine and in-person encounters were defined using a standardised schema. Regression analysis was used to evaluate factors associated with a change in surgical plan between visits across specialties, including the number of virtual examination manoeuvres performed. RESULTS: We identified 303 instances of a patient being indicated for orthopaedic surgery during a telemedicine encounter. In 11 cases (4%), the plan was changed between telemedicine and subsequent in-person encounter. No plans were changed amongst patients indicated for joint arthroplasty and foot and ankle surgery, whilst 4% of plans were changed amongst sports surgery and upper extremity/shoulder surgery. Surgical plans had the highest rate of change amongst spine surgery patients (8%). There was notable variability in the conduct of virtual examinations across subspecialties. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate the capability of telemedicine to support development of accurate surgical plans for orthopaedic patients across several subspecialties. Our findings also highlight the substantial variation in the utilisation of physical examination manoeuvres conducted via telemedicine across institutions, subspecialties, and providers.

However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11–64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(−) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection, though not detected in semen of recovered men, can affect TSN in ejaculate in the acute setting. Whether SARS-CoV-2 can affect spermatogenic function long-term remains to be evaluated.","Best, Jordan C.; Kuchakulla, Manish; Khodamoradi, Kajal; Lima, Thiago Fernandes Negris; Frech, Fabio Stefano; Achua, Justin; Rosete, Omar; Mora, Belén; Arora, Himanshu; Ibrahim, Emad; Ramasamy, Ranjith",World J Mens Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33663031/; https://doi.org/10.5534/wjmh.200192,246

616251,Screening of COVID-19 in outpatient children with cancer or solid organ transplantation: preliminary report,2021-03-26,"OBJECTIVES: To compare different modalities of renal replacement therapy in critically ill adults with acute kidney injury. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 25 May, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of different renal replacement therapy modalities in critically ill patients with acute kidney injury. STUDY SELECTION: Ten reviewers (working in pairs) independently screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. DATA EXTRACTION: We performed random-effects frequentist network meta-analyses and used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to assess certainty of evidence. The primary analysis was a four-node analysis: continuous renal replacement therapy, intermittent hemodialysis, slow efficiency extended dialysis, and peritoneal dialysis. The secondary analysis subdivided these four nodes into nine nodes including continuous veno-venous hemofiltration, continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration, continuous arterio-venous hemodiafiltration, intermittent hemodialysis, intermittent hemodialysis with hemofiltration, slow efficiency extended dialysis, slow efficiency extended dialysis with hemofiltration, and peritoneal dialysis. We set the minimal important difference threshold for mortality as 2.5% (relative difference, 0.04). DATA SYNTHESIS: Thirty randomized controlled trials (n = 3,774 patients) proved eligible. There may be no difference in mortality between continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis (relative risk, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.93–1.18; low certainty), whereas continuous renal replacement therapy demonstrated a possible increase in mortality compared with slow efficiency extended dialysis (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.85–1.33; low certainty) and peritoneal dialysis (relative risk, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.92–1.49; low certainty). Continuous renal replacement therapy may increase renal recovery compared with intermittent hemodialysis (relative risk, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.91–1.45; low certainty), whereas both continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis may be worse for renal recovery compared with slow efficiency extended dialysis and peritoneal dialysis (low certainty). Peritoneal dialysis was probably associated with the shortest duration of renal support and length of ICU stay compared with other interventions (low certainty for most comparisons). Slow efficiency extended dialysis may be associated with shortest length of hospital stay (low or moderate certainty for all comparisons) and days of mechanical ventilation (low certainty for all comparisons) compared with other interventions. There was no difference between continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis in terms of hypotension (relative risk, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.72–1.16; moderate certainty) or other complications of therapy, but an increased risk of hypotension and bleeding was seen with both modalities compared with peritoneal dialysis (low or moderate certainty). Complications of slow efficiency extended dialysis were not sufficiently reported to inform comparisons. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this network meta-analysis suggest there is no difference in mortality between continuous renal replacement therapy and intermittent hemodialysis although continuous renal replacement therapy may increases renal recovery compared with intermittent hemodialysis. Slow efficiency extended dialysis with hemofiltration may be the most effective intervention at reducing mortality. Peritoneal dialysis is associated with good efficacy, and the least number of complications however may not be practical in all settings. Importantly, all conclusions are based on very low to moderate certainty evidence, limited by imprecision. At the very least, ICU clinicians should feel comfortable that the differences between continuous renal replacement therapy, intermittent hemodialysis, slow efficiency extended dialysis, and, where clinically appropriate, peritoneal dialysis are likely small, and any of these modalities is a reasonable option to employ in critically ill patients.","Ye, Zhikang; Wang, Ying; Ge, Long; Guyatt, Gordon H.; Collister, David; Alhazzani, Waleed; Bagshaw, Sean M.; Belley-Cote, Emilie P.; Fang, Fang; Hou, Liangying; Kolb, Philipp; Lamontagne, Francois; Oczkowski, Simon; Pyne, Lonnie; Rabbat, Christian; Scaum, Matt; Najafabadi, Borna Tadayon; Tangamornsuksan, Wimonchat; Wald, Ron; Wang, Qi; Walsh, Michael; Yao, Liang; Zeng, Linan; Algarni, Abdullah Mohammed; Couban, Rachel J.; Alexander, Paul Elias; Rochwerg, Bram",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079944/,246

Here, we address these challenges by combining Pegasys (IFNa) and nafamostat to effectively suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture and hamsters. Our results indicate that Serpin E1 is an important mediator of the antiviral activity of IFNa and that both Serpin E1 and camostat can target the same cellular factor TMPRSS2, which plays a critical role in viral replication. The low doses of the drugs in combination may have several clinical advantages, including fewer adverse events and improved patient outcome.

There is little guidance for training medical students to make such decisions in future practice. How students would make ventilator triage decisions remains unknown. Methods One hundred fifty-three medical students in 18 problem-based learning groups participated in a ventilator-rationing exercise in April 2020 as part of an ethics curriculum adapted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Students were provided with a prompt requiring fictional patients to be prioritized for ventilators in the face of scarce resources. The authors reviewed group responses, tallied triage criteria, and identified approaches to triage decisions. Results The most common triage criteria were patient comorbidities, clinical status, age/life stage, prognosis, life expectancy, and an individual’s role in pandemic response. Additional criteria included quality of life, ventilator availability, public perception, and patient need. Students approached triage decisions by developing systems for triage, appealing to empirical evidence and academic literature, making value judgments, and identifying adjuncts and alternatives to triage. Discussion With minimal input from educators, students learned key ethical principles in triage medicine, recapitulated approaches to triage described in the clinical and bioethics literature, and suggested methods for tolerating distress of complex ethical decisions. Medical education should equip students to critically consider bioethical concerns in triage and prepare for possible moral distress during public health crises.","Brodar, Canon; Muller, Carly; Brodar, Kaitlyn E; Brosco, Jeffrey P; Goodman, Kenneth W",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.16976; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34540386/,246

The development of aptamer-based sensing systems or strategies has been in vogue for the past few decades, because aptamers are smaller in size, stable, cheaper and undergo easier modifications. Owing to these advantages, several facile aptamer-based colorimetric strategies have been created by controlling the assembly and disassembly of aptamers on unmodified gold nanoparticle probes. As these kinds of assay systems are rapid and can be visualized unaided by instruments, they have recently become an attractive method of choice. The formation of purple-colored aggregates (attraction) from the red dispersed (repulsion) state of GNPs in the presence of mono- or divalent ions is the key principle behind this assay. Due to its simplicity and versatility, this assay can be an alternative to existing diagnostic assays.

SARS-CoV-2 infection causes damages to the lung and other organs. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 range widely from asymptomatic infection, mild respiratory illness to severe pneumonia with respiratory failure and death. Autopsy studies demonstrate that diffuse alveolar damage, inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, proteinaceous exudates, and vascular thromboembolism in the lung as well as extrapulmonary injuries in other organs represent key pathological findings. Herein, we hypothesize that GPR4 plays an integral role in COVID-19 pathophysiology and is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of COVID-19. GPR4 is a pro-inflammatory G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) highly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and serves as a “gatekeeper” to regulate endothelium-blood cell interaction and leukocyte infiltration. GPR4 also regulates vascular permeability and tissue edema under inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we hypothesize that GPR4 antagonism can potentially be exploited to mitigate the hyper-inflammatory response, vessel hyper-permeability, pulmonary edema, exudate formation, vascular thromboembolism and tissue injury associated with COVID-19.","Yang, Li V.; Oppelt, Karen A.; Thomassen, Mary Jane; Marie, Mona A.; Nik Akhtar, Shayan; McCallen, Justin D.",Front Med (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33553219/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.626796,246

From May 2020 a significant decline of the epidemic has been observed (phase 2); National Health Service protocols permitted elective BMS’ resumption. A new, more severe COVID-19 surge, the “second wave”, started on October 2020 (phase 3). AIM: the primary end point was to analyze the outcomes of any Sars-Cov-2 infection and related morbidity/mortality within 30 POD after laparoscopic BMS during phase 2-3; secondary end points were readmission and reoperation rates. METHODS: Study design prospective, multicenter, observational. Setting Eight Italian high-volume bariatric centers. All patients undergoing BMS from July 2020 through January 2021 were enrolled according to the following criteria: no Sars-Cov-2 infection; primary procedures; no concomitant procedure; age >18<60 years; compensated comorbidities; informed consent including COVID-19 addendum; adherence to specific admission, in-hospital and follow-up protocols. Data were collected in a prospective database. Patients undergone BMS during July-December 2019 were considered a control group. RESULTS: 1258 patients were enrolled and compared with 1451 operated on in 2019, with no differences for demographics, complications, readmission, and reintervention rates. Eight patients (0·6%) and 15 healthcare professionals tested positive for Sars-Cov-2 infection, with no related complications or mortality.

619273,Testing the Effects of Disease‐Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs on Vascular Inflammation in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Rationale and Design of the TARGET Trial,2021-05-01,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2, is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with epithelial cell and respiratory system proclivity. Like its predecessor, SARS-CoV, COVID-19 can lead to life-threatening disease. Due to wide geographic impact affecting an extremely high proportion of the world population it was defined by the World Health Organization as a global public health pandemic. The infection is known to readily spread from person-to-person. This occurs through liquid droplets by cough, sneeze, hand-to-mouth-to-eye contact and through contaminated hard surfaces. Close human proximity accelerates SARS-CoV-2 spread. COVID-19 is a systemic disease that can move beyond the lungs by blood-based dissemination to affect multiple organs. These organs include the kidney, liver, muscles, nervous system, and spleen. The primary cause of SARS-CoV-2 mortality is acute respiratory distress syndrome initiated by epithelial infection and alveolar macrophage activation in the lungs. The early cell-based portal for viral entry is through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor. Viral origins are zoonotic with genomic linkages to the bat coronaviruses but without an identifiable intermediate animal reservoir. There are currently few therapeutic options, and while many are being tested, although none are effective in curtailing the death rates. There is no available vaccine yet. Intense global efforts have targeted research into a better understanding of the epidemiology, molecular biology, pharmacology, and pathobiology of SARS-CoV-2. These fields of study will provide the insights directed to curtailing this disease outbreak with intense international impact.

619918,Chest CT features and their role in COVID-19,2020-04-16,"COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic that affected more than 200 countries. Predicting the epidemiological behavior of this outbreak has a vital role to prevent its spreading. In this study, long short-term memory (LSTM) network as a robust deep learning model is proposed to forecast the number of total confirmed cases, total recovered cases, and total deaths in Saudi Arabia. The model was trained using the official reported data. The optimal values of the model’s parameters that maximize the forecasting accuracy were determined. The forecasting accuracy of the model was assessed using seven statistical assessment criteria, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R(2)), mean absolute error (MAE), efﬁciency coefﬁcient (EC), overall index (OI), coefficient of variation (COV), and coefﬁcient of residual mass (CRM). A reasonable forecasting accuracy was obtained. The forecasting accuracy of the suggested model is compared with two other models. The first is a statistical based model called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA). The second is an artificial intelligence based model called nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARANN). Finally, the proposed LSTM model was applied to forecast the total number of confirmed cases as well as deaths in six different countries; Brazil, India, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, and USA. These countries have different epidemic trends as they apply different polices and have different age structure, weather, and culture. The social distancing and protection measures applied in different countries are assumed to be maintained during the forecasting period. The obtained results may help policymakers to control the disease and to put strategic plans to organize Hajj and the closure periods of the schools and universities.","Elsheikh, Ammar H.; Saba, Amal I.; Elaziz, Mohamed Abd; Lu, Songfeng; Shanmugan, S.; Muthuramalingam, T.; Kumar, Ravinder; Mosleh, Ahmed O.; Essa, F.A.; Shehabeldeen, Taher A.",Process Saf Environ Prot,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0957582020318516; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psep.2020.10.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33162687/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957582020318516?v=s5,246

OBJECTIVE: To estimate frequency of and reasons for reported forgone medical care from March to mid-July 2020 and examine characteristics of US adults who reported forgoing care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This survey study used data from the second wave of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey, fielded from July 7 to July 22, 2020. Respondents included a national sample of 1337 individuals aged 18 years or older in the US who were part of National Opinion Research Center’s AmeriSpeak Panel. EXPOSURES: The initial period of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, defined as from March to mid-July 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were missed doses of prescription medications; forgone preventive and other general medical care, mental health care, and elective surgeries; forgone care for new severe health issues; and reasons for forgoing care. RESULTS: Of 1468 individuals who completed wave 1 of the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Civic Life and Public Health Survey (70.4% completion rate), 1337 completed wave 2 (91.1% completion rate). The sample of respondents included 691 (52%) women, 840 non-Hispanic White individuals (63%), 160 non-Hispanic Black individuals (12%), and 223 Hispanic individuals (17%). The mean (SE) age of respondents was 48 (0.78) years. A total of 544 respondents (41%) forwent medical care from March through mid-July 2020. Among 1055 individuals (79%) who reported needing care, 544 (52%) reported forgoing care for any reason, 307 (29%) forwent care owing to fear of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission, and 75 (7%) forwent care owing to financial concerns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents who were unemployed, compared with those who were employed, forwent care more often (121 of 186 respondents [65%] vs 251 of 503 respondents [50%]; P = .01) and were more likely to attribute forgone care to fear of SARS-CoV-2 transmission (78 of 186 respondents [42%] vs 120 of 503 respondents [24%]; P = .002) and financial concerns (36 of 186 respondents [20%] vs 28 of 503 respondents [6%]; P = .001). Respondents lacking health insurance were more likely to attribute forgone care to financial concerns than respondents with Medicare or commercial coverage (19 of 88 respondents [22%] vs 32 of 768 respondents [4%]; P < .001). Frequency of and reasons for forgone care differed in some instances by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, and health status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study found a high frequency of forgone care among US adults from March to mid-July 2020.

This study aims to solve problems that generate the crowdsourcing concerns and to find better alternatives to increase trust for crowdfunding among donors, as this impacts their strategic sustainability in the conditions of turbulence and COVID-induced financial crisis. It was found that factors influence donor decisions in different ways, yet the common tendency for donor activity is non-monotonicity.

Here, we developed a new point-of-care, non-contact thermal imaging tool to detect COVID-19, based on advanced image processing algorithms. We captured thermal images of the backs of individuals with and without COVID-19 using a portable thermal camera that connects directly to smartphones. Our novel image processing algorithms automatically extracted multiple texture and shape features of the thermal images and achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 in COVID-19 detection with up to 92% sensitivity. Thermal imaging scores were inversely correlated with clinical variables associated with COVID-19 disease progression. In summary, we show, for the first time, that a hand-held thermal imaging device can be used to detect COVID-19. Non-invasive thermal imaging could be used to screen for COVID-19 in out-of-hospital settings, especially in low-income regions with limited imaging resources.","Brzezinski, Rafael Y.; Rabin, Neta; Lewis, Nir; Peled, Racheli; Kerpel, Ariel; Tsur, Avishai M.; Gendelman, Omer; Naftali-Shani, Nili; Gringauz, Irina; Amital, Howard; Leibowitz, Avshalom; Mayan, Haim; Ben-Zvi, Ilan; Heller, Eyal; Shechtman, Liran; Rogowski, Ori; Shenhar-Tsarfaty, Shani; Konen, Eli; Marom, Edith M.; Ironi, Avinoah; Rahav, Galia; Zimmer, Yair; Grossman, Ehud; Ovadia-Blechman, Zehava; Leor, Jonathan; Hoffer, Oshrit",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-96900-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34471180/,246
621163,The prognosis and short-term efficacy of corticosteroid therapy for COVID-19 patients,2020-08-21,"TOPIC: Chest Infections TYPE: Original Investigations PURPOSE: Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) can increase ACE2 in human tissues and increase the adhesion of Sars-CoV-2. In our study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between serum ACE level with antihypertensive drugs (especially ACEi) and clinical severity. METHODS: A total of 200 symptomatic Sars-CoV-2 patients who were hospitalized or diagnosed in an outpatient clinic were included in the study. The patients were divided into 4 groups as mild, moderate, severe and very severe. There were 43 patients in the mild, 54 patients in the moderate, 53 patients in the severe, and 50 patients in the very severe patient group. Later, 200 patients were divided into 2 groups as mild-moderate (n:97) and severe-very severe patient group (n:103). Serum ACE, complete blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and biochemical analysis were evaluated. The demographic data, comorbidities, medications and symptoms of the patients were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age of mild, moderate, severe and very severe patients was 50.4±21.51, 57.13±14.81, 64.34±13.02, 74.88±11.18 respectively (p <0.05). Males were more in the severe-very severe group than females (p <0.05). Those with at least 1 chronic disease were significantly more likely to be in the severe-very severe group than those in the mild-moderate group (p=0.000*). The rate of hypertension and coronary artery disease (CAD) was higher in patients in the severe-very severe group compared to the mild-moderate group. In the mild-moderate group, the number of those using ACEi was 9 and in the severe-very severe patient group was 21(p =0.028). Mean of serum ACE in the mild-moderate group was 28.12±15.83 IU/L and the severe-very severe group was 22.91±14.53 IU/L (p =0.016). A moderate correlation was found between the severity of the patients and their ACE levels. Patients with hypertension who used ACEi, beta blocker and calcium channel blocker were more in the severe-very severe patient group (p<0.05). This relationship was not seen in the use of ARB. Mean of serum ACE in 30 (15%) patients using ACEi and 170 (85%) patients not using ACEi were 11.8±12.93 IU/L and 27.84±14.5 IU/L respectively (p=0.000*). When 30 patients using ACEi were excluded, the remaining 170 patients were again divided into mild-moderate (n=88) and severe-very severe (n=82) patient groups, the mean serum ACE values were 30.1±15.02 IU/L and 25.41±13.6 IU/L respectively (p=0,035). No significant relationship was found with other antihypertensives. CONCLUSIONS: As a result, it was observed that low serum ACE developed with the use of ACEi. In addition an inverse correlation was observed between serum ACE level and clinical severity of COVID-19. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It was thought that serum ACE level may be useful in predicting clinical progression.

621829,Fatal Retroperitoneal Hematoma Associated with Covid-19 Prophylactic Anticoagulation Protocol,2021-04-15,"Background: A significant number of patients with severe respiratory failure related to COVID-19 require prolonged mechanical ventilation. Minimal data exists regarding the timing, safety, and efficacy of combined bedside percutaneous tracheostomy and endoscopy gastrostomy tube placement in these patients. The safety for healthcare providers is also in question. This study's objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of combined bedside tracheostomy and gastrostomy tube placement in COVID-19 patients. Design and Methods: This is a single arm, prospective cohort study in patients with COVID-19 and acute respiratory failure requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation who underwent bedside tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy placement. Detailed clinical and procedural data were collected. Descriptive statistics were employed and time to event curves were estimated and plotted using the Kaplan Meier method for clinically relevant prespecified endpoints. Results: Among 58 patients, the median total intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay was 29 days (24.7-33.3) with a median of 10 days (6.3-13.7) postprocedure. Nearly 88% of patients were weaned from mechanical ventilation postprocedure at a median of 9 days (6-12); 94% of these were decannulated. Sixty-day mortality was 10.3%. Almost 90% of patients were discharged alive from the hospital. All procedures were done at bedside with no patient transfer required out of the ICU. A median of 3.0 healthcare personnel total were present in the room per procedure. Conclusion: This study shows that survival of critically ill COVID-19 patients after tracheostomy and gastrostomy was nearly 90%. The time-to-event curves are encouraging regarding time to weaning, downsizing, decannulation, and discharge. A combined procedure minimizes the risk of virus transmission to healthcare providers in addition to decreasing the number of anesthetic episodes, transfusions, and transfers patients must undergo. This approach should be considered in critically ill COVID-19 patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation.","Oberg, Catherine L.; Keyes, Colleen; Panchabhai, Tanmay S.; Sajawal Ali, Muhammed; Oh, Scott S.; Grogan, Tristan R.; Mojica, James; Auchincloss, Hugh; Pulido, Natalie; Brait, Kelsey; Folch, Erik E.",J Intensive Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/08850666211038875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424096/,246

622840,Challenges of Diagnosing Viral Myocarditis in Adolescents in the Era of COVID-19 and MIS-C,2021-10-04,"Preclinical studies support an important role of dopamine D3 receptors (DRD3s) in alcohol use disorder (AUD). In animals, voluntary alcohol consumption increases DRD3 expression, and pharmacological blockade of DRD3s attenuates alcohol self-administration and reinstatement of alcohol seeking. However, these findings have yet to be translated in humans. This study used positron emission tomography (PET) and [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO to compare receptor levels in several dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and DRD3 regions of interest between AUD subjects in early abstinence (n = 17; 6.59 ± 4.14 days of abstinence) and healthy controls (n = 18). We recruited non-treatment seeking subjects meeting DSM-5 criteria for AUD. We examined the relationship between DRD2/3 levels and both alcohol craving and alcohol motivation/wanting, using a cue reactivity procedure and an intravenous alcohol self-administration (IVASA) paradigm, respectively. [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding levels in AUD subjects were significantly lower than binding in HCs when looking at all DRD2/3 ROIs jointly (Wilk’s Λ = .58, F(6,28) =3.33, p = 0.013, η(2)(p) = 0.42), however there were no region-specific differences. Binding values demonstrate −12.3% and −16.1% lower [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SMST and SN respectively, though these differences did not withstand Bonferroni corrections. There was a positive association between [(11)C]-(+)-PHNO binding in the SN (almost exclusively reflective of DRD3) and alpha (lower values reflect higher alcohol demand) in the APT after Bonferroni corrections (r = 0.66, p = 0.0080). This demonstrates that AUD subjects with lower DRD3 levels in the SN exhibit increased demand for alcohol. These results replicate previous findings demonstrating reduced DRD2/3 levels while also supporting a lack of DRD3 upregulation and potential downregulation in early abstinent AUD. Furthermore, the finding that binding in the SN is associated with alcohol demand warrants further examination.","Chukwueke, Chidera C.; Nona, Christina N.; McPhee, Matthew D.; Mansouri, Esmaeil; Rubin-Kahana, Dafna S.; Martinez, Diana; Boileau, Isabelle; Hendershot, Christian S.; Le Foll, Bernard",Neuropsychopharmacology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349232/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41386-021-01095-2,246

METHODS: Four main search engines were used to identify potential studies which included: (1) Google Scholar, (2) ScienceDirect, (3) PubMed, and (4) Cochrane. Studies in English and published from 2010 to 2020 were considered. Studies on efficacy were limited to those in unseeded hospital environments, examining environmental disinfection, and with true experimental, randomized controlled trial, or quasi-experimental study designs. No additional criterion was used for safety studies due to the scarcity of literature. In the end, a total of 17 studies were selected. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Risk of bias assessment and manual data extraction and tabulation were done. RESULTS: Twelve eligible efficacy studies were identified together with five safety studies. It was found that UV-C irradiation had positive results when used as an adjunct for existing cleaning protocols. The germicidal effect of UV-C is potent against microorganisms including viruses, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Safety study results showed dermal effects of UV-C exposure including DNA lesions, formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in cells, and effects on the skin’s stratum corneum. CONCLUSION: It was found that UV-C can be utilized as an adjunct to terminal manual cleaning because of its efficacy as a germicidal agent. Further studies must still be done to exact a standard for safe exposure dose, especially for 222 nm germicidal lamps.

In this study, we reanalyzed scRNA-seq data of cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluids of patients with COVID-19 with mild and severe symptoms, focusing on antibody-producing cells. In patients with severe disease, B cells seemed to be more activated and expressed more immunoglobulin genes compared with cells from patients with mild disease, and macrophages expressed higher levels of the TNF superfamily member B-cell activating factor but not of APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand). In addition, macrophages from patients with severe disease had increased pro-inflammatory features and pathways associated with Fc receptor-mediated signaling, compared with patients with mild disease. CCR2-positive plasma cells accumulated in patients with severe disease, probably because of increased CCL2 expression on macrophages from patients with severe disease. Together, these results support that different characteristics of B cells might affect the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Kim, Chae Won; Oh, Ji Eun; Lee, Heung Kyu",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.09.374272,246

During ICU admission, substantial venous and arterial thrombosis developed. Meanwhile the microcirculation showed more than double amount of organ perfusion with very high total vessel density. We hypothesize that this might be a compensatory mechanism for the generalized prothrombic state in which the microcirculation increases the oxygen extraction capacity preventing multi-organ failure.","Akin, Sakir; van Hooven, Daphne; Ince, Can; Jansen, Tim",Respir Med Case Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213007121000903?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmcr.2021.101428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996436/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213007121000903,246

Comparable analytical challenges are encountered in other data-intensive fields involving sequential data, such as signal processing, in which dimensionality reduction (i.e., compression) methods are routinely used to lessen the computational burden of analyses. In this work, we explored the application of dimensionality reduction methods to numerically represent high-throughput sequence data for three important biological applications of virus sequence data: reference-based mapping, short sequence classification and de novo assembly. Leveraging highly compressed sequence transformations to accelerate sequence comparison, our approach yielded comparable accuracy to existing approaches, further demonstrating its suitability for sequences originating from diverse virus populations. We assessed the application of our methodology using both synthetic and real viral pathogen sequences. Our results show that the use of highly compressed sequence approximations can provide accurate results, with analytical performance retained and even enhanced through appropriate dimensionality reduction of sequence data.","Tapinos, Avraam; Constantinides, Bede; Phan, My V.

A Case of Concomitant Acute Pericarditis and Subsegmental Pulmonary Embolism,2021-02-08,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has reached pandemic status. Drastic measures of social distancing are enforced in society and healthcare systems are being pushed to and beyond their limits. To help in the fight against this threat on human health, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest computed tomography (CT) exams. The detection model was developed on a dataset of 1381 patients (181 COVID-19 patients plus 1200 non COVID control patients). A second, independent dataset of 197 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 500 control patients was used to assess the performance of the model. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model had an AUC of 0.882 (95% CI: 0.851–0.913) in the independent test dataset (641 patients). The optimal decision threshold, considering the cost of false negatives twice as high as the cost of false positives, resulted in an accuracy of 85.18%, a sensitivity of 69.52%, a specificity of 91.63%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.46% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 59.44%. Benchmarked against RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19, our AI framework can accurately differentiate COVID-19 from routine clinical conditions in a fully automated fashion. Thus, providing rapid accurate diagnosis in patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, facilitating the timely implementation of isolation procedures and early intervention.","Guiot, Julien; Vaidyanathan, Akshayaa; Deprez, Louis; Zerka, Fadila; Danthine, Denis; Frix, Anne-Noëlle; Thys, Marie; Henket, Monique; Canivet, Gregory; Mathieu, Stephane; Eftaxia, Evanthia; Lambin, Philippe; Tsoutzidis, Nathan; Miraglio, Benjamin; Walsh, Sean; Moutschen, Michel; Louis, Renaud; Meunier, Paul; Vos, Wim; Leijenaar, Ralph T.

In Ecuador, the first case of COVID-19 was recorded on February 29th. Despite efforts to control its spread, SARS-CoV-2 overrun the Ecuadorian public health system which became one of the most affected in Latin America with 22,719 cases reported up to April, 24th. Public health control measures, including social distancing and lockdowns, were implemented at different times in the biggest cities of the country: Guayaquil and Quito. The Hospital General del Sur de Quito (HGSQ) had to transition from a general to a specific COVID-19 health center in a short period of time to fulfill the health demand from patients with respiratory afflictions. Here, we summarized the implementations applied in the HGSQ to become a COVID-19 exclusive hospital, including the rearrangement of hospital rooms and a triage strategy based on a severity score calculated through an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted chest computed tomography (CT).

The kinetics of infection in lymphatic organs and the lung were analysed by immunofluorescence detection of virus antigen, re‐isolation of the virus and reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) for PRRSV‐specific RNA. The kinetics of PRRSV infection proceeded in three phases, irrespective of the varying infestation of lymphatic organs within the first days post‐infection (p.i.). First, an early acute infection of lymphatic organs developed within the first week and was characterized by a high number of antigen‐positive macrophages. Second, a delayed acute infection of the lung was observed, which was most pronounced during the second and third week p.i. when a high number of infected alveolar macrophages was observed. The acute infection of lymphatic organs had resolved at this time. Infected cells in the lung were predominantly located in pneumonic lesions. Third, a persistent infection was demonstrated by RT‐PCR and immunohistology when the experiments were terminated at day 49 p.i. The virus persisted in lymphatic organs, especially in the tonsils, and in the lung. At this stage, indications for a re‐occurrence of acute infection were observed in restricted areas of the lung.","Beyer, J.; Fichtner, D.; Schirrmeir, H.; Polster, U.; Weiland, E.; Wege, H.",J Vet Med B Infect Dis Vet Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10780169/,246

In the last few years, novel Akt posttranslational modifications have been found. However, how these modification patterns affect Akt subcellular localization, target specificity and, in general, function is not thoroughly understood. Here, we postulate and experimentally demonstrate by acyl-biotin exchange (ABE) assay and (3)H-palmitate metabolic labeling that Akt is S-palmitoylated, a modification related to protein sorting throughout subcellular membranes. Mutating cysteine 344 into serine blocked Akt S-palmitoylation and diminished its phosphorylation at two key sites, T308 and T450. Particularly, we show that palmitoylation-deficient Akt increases its recruitment to cytoplasmic structures that colocalize with lysosomes, a process stimulated during autophagy. Finally, we found that cysteine 344 in Akt1 is important for proper its function, since Akt1-C344S was unable to support adipocyte cell differentiation in vitro. These results add an unexpected new layer to the already complex Akt molecular code, improving our understanding of cell decision-making mechanisms such as cell survival, differentiation and death.","Blaustein, Matías; Piegari, Estefanía; Martínez Calejman, Camila; Vila, Antonella; Amante, Analía; Manese, María Victoria; Zeida, Ari; Abrami, Laurence; Veggetti, Mariela; Guertin, David A.; van der Goot, F.

Knowledge of the incubation period distribution can be used directly to inform decision-making or as inputs into mathematical models. Objectives: The aim of this study was to conduct a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of estimates of the incubation periods of COVID-19. Design: Rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of observational research Data sources: Publications on the electronic databases PubMed, Google Scholar, MedRxiv and BioRxiv were searched. The search was not limited to peer-reviewed published data, but also included pre-print articles. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Studies were selected for meta-analysis if they reported either the parameters and confidence intervals of the distributions fit to the data, or sufficient information to facilitate calculation of those values. The majority of studies suitable for inclusion in the final analysis modelled incubation period as a lognormal distribution. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of the parameters of this distribution. Results: The incubation period distribution may be modelled with a lognormal distribution with pooled mu and sigma parameters of 1.63 (1.51, 1.75) and 0.50 (0.45, 0.55) respectively. The corresponding mean was 5.8 (5.01, 6.69 days). It should be noted that uncertainty increases towards the tail of the distribution: the pooled parameter estimates resulted in a median incubation period of 5.1 (4.5, 5.8) days, whereas the 95th percentile was 11.6 (9.5, 14.2) days. Conclusions and implications: The choice of which parameter values are adopted will depend on how the information is used, the associated risks and the perceived consequences of decisions to be taken. These recommendations will need to be revisited once further relevant information becomes available.

However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine-induced responses in immunosuppressed patients. We investigated induction of antigen-specific antibody, B cell and T cell responses longitudinally in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on anti-CD20 antibody monotherapy (n = 20) compared with healthy controls (n = 10) after BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 mRNA vaccination. Treatment with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (aCD20) significantly reduced spike-specific and receptor-binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody and memory B cell responses in most patients, an effect ameliorated with longer duration from last aCD20 treatment and extent of B cell reconstitution. By contrast, all patients with MS treated with aCD20 generated antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses after vaccination. Treatment with aCD20 skewed responses, compromising circulating follicular helper T (TFH) cell responses and augmenting CD8 T cell induction, while preserving type 1 helper T (TH1) cell priming. Patients with MS treated with aCD20 lacking anti-RBD IgG had the most severe defect in circulating TFH responses and more robust CD8 T cell responses. These data define the nature of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced immune landscape in aCD20-treated patients and provide insights into coordinated mRNA vaccine-induced immune responses in humans. Our findings have implications for clinical decision-making and public health policy for immunosuppressed patients including those treated with aCD20.","Apostolidis, Sokratis A; Kakara, Mihir; Painter, Mark M; Goel, Rishi R; Mathew, Divij; Lenzi, Kerry; Rezk, Ayman; Patterson, Kristina R; Espinoza, Diego A; Kadri, Jessy C; Markowitz, Daniel M; E Markowitz, Clyde; Mexhitaj, Ina; Jacobs, Dina; Babb, Allison; Betts, Michael R; Prak, Eline T Luning; Weiskopf, Daniela; Grifoni, Alba; Lundgreen, Kendall A; Gouma, Sigrid; Sette, Alessandro; Bates, Paul; Hensley, Scott E; Greenplate, Allison R; Wherry, E John; Li, Rui; Bar-Or, Amit",Nat. med,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-021-01507-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522051/,246

630334,Heightened Central Line-associated Blood Stream Infection Risk During a Pandemic,2020-04-09,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity. We developed a triage strategy including non-invasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. Objectives The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the intermediate care unit. Method Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28th and April 27th 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-days mortality and predictors of ICU admission. Results One hundred fifty seven patients with COVID-19 associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99) and Body Mass Index (OR 0.88; 95% CI 0.78 to 0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the intermediate care unit. Among the 72 patients transferred from the ICU, 60/72 (83%) presented neurological complications. Conclusions Non-invasive respiratory support including High-Flow Nasal Oxygen and continuous positive airway pressure prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID pandemic, intermediate care units may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","Grosgurin, O.; Leidi, A.; Darbellay-Farhoumand, P.; Carballo, S.; Reny, J.-l.; Adler, D.; Bollen Pinto, B.; Rossel, A.; Serratrice, J.; Agoritsas, T.; Stirnemann, J.; Marti, C.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.17.20155929; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.17.20155929v1?rss=1,246

With that have also come initiatives for guidance on how to develop “responsible AI” aligned with human and ethical values. Compared to sectors like energy, healthcare, or transportation, the use of AI-based techniques in the water domain is relatively modest. This paper presents a review of current AI applications in the water domain and develops some tentative insights as to what “responsible AI” could mean there. Building on the reviewed literature, four categories of application are identified: modeling, prediction and forecasting, decision support and operational management, and optimization. We also identify three insights pertaining to the water sector in particular: the use of AI techniques in general, and many-objective optimization in particular, that allow for a pluralism of values and changing values; the use of theory-guided data science, which can avoid some of the pitfalls of strictly data-driven models; and the ability to build on experiences with participatory decision-making in the water sector. These insights suggest that the development and application of responsible AI techniques for the water sector should not be left to data scientists alone, but requires concerted effort by water professionals and data scientists working together, complemented with expertise from the social sciences and humanities.","Doorn, Neelke",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.142561; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969720360903; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720360903?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33039891/,246

However, individual-level factors associated with social distancing are largely unknown. We sought to examine social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan, an infection “hotspot” state in the United States early in the pandemic. METHODS: Two surveys were distributed to Michigan residents via email lists and social media following COVID-19 related state mandates in March; 45,691 adults responded to the first survey and 8512 to the second. Staying home ≥ 3 out of 5 previous days defined having more social distancing. Logistic regression models were used to examine potential factors associated with more social distancing. RESULTS: Most respondents were women (86% in Survey 1, 87% in Survey 2). In Survey 1, 63% reported more social distancing, increasing to 78% in Survey 2. Female sex and having someone (or self) sick in the home were consistently associated with higher social distancing, while increasing age was positively associated in Survey 1 but negatively associated in Survey 2. Most respondents felt social distancing policies were important (88% in Survey 1; 91% in Survey 2). CONCLUSIONS: Michiganders responding to the surveys were both practicing and supportive of social distancing. State-level executive orders positively impacted behaviors early in the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan.

As we are facing growing numbers of COVID-19 cases caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, an understanding of the impact of air pollutants and meteorological variables on the incidence of respiratory infections is crucial. The incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) can be used as a close proxy for the circulation of influenza viruses. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 has also been detected in patients with ILI. Using distributed lag nonlinear models, we analyzed the association between ILI, meteorological variables and particulate matter concentration in Bialystok, Poland, from 2013–2019. We found an exponential relationship between cumulative PM(2.5) pollution and the incidence of ILI, which remained significant after adjusting for air temperatures and a long-term trend. Pollution had the greatest effect during the same week, but the risk of ILI was increased for the four following weeks. The risk of ILI was also increased by low air temperatures, low absolute humidity, and high wind speed. Altogether, our results show that all measures implemented to decrease PM(2.5) concentrations would be beneficial to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections.","Toczylowski, Kacper; Wietlicka-Piszcz, Magdalena; Grabowska, Magdalena; Sulik, Artur",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810283/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13040556,246
634014,Shared genetic etiology between idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and COVID-19 severity,2020-12-16,"Never before has the value of prevention science become so apparent to the populace, particularly in simultaneous fashion across all nations. A general understanding of what prevention represents in true form has lagged well behind the science and, in fact, few outside of the field recognize that there is actually a significant body of research that undergirds preventative practices, programs and policies. The current pandemic and the uneven impacts on underserved and marginalized populations has highlighted the need for proactive approaches to prevent underlying conditions that increase risk for infection, worsen the wide ranging harms from the virus, and significantly exacerbate disparities that characterize many nations. To ensure uptake of the science by end-users (e.g., community stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers), who operate the levers that determine whether resources and services are distributed equitably across societies’ sectors, prevention scientists have a unique and powerful role to play. This commentary on the special issue, focused on the “culture of prevention,” considers the broader issues covered in the set of original articles in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Toward that end, I also outline two interrelated “calls to action” for prevention scientists. The first call is to concertedly apply a race equity lens to all aspects of our research, a need that is particularly critical given that our field is inherently actionable and, as such, evidence amassed has potential to equalize the playing field for disadvantaged and marginalized groups. The second acknowledges the need for prevention scientists to learn how to effectively communicate scientific knowledge to the public and policymakers to compellingly advocate for reforms guided by the science.

Kidney transplant (KT) recipients are one of the vulnerable populations for infection. COVID‐19 infection in KT recipients might be a complicated and awkward situation, but there has been a lack of reports concerning this group. Herein, we demonstrated two distinct cases with different clinical progress. The first case was a 36‐year‐old man who underwent KT 3 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID‐19 expressing relevant symptoms. Following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine with reduced immunosuppressant, he recovered from COVID‐19. However, the unexpected fluctuations in tacrolimus trough levels needed to be managed because of drug‐to‐drug interaction. The second case was developed in a 56‐year‐old man without any symptoms. He received a second KT from an ABO‐incompatible donor 8 years ago. He was diagnosed with COVID‐19 by screening due to exposure history. During the hospitalization period, the chest infiltrative lesion showed a wax and wane, but he successfully recovered by administration of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin. These apparently different cases suggest that assertive screening and management could improve the clinical course. In addition, antiviral agents should be used cautiously, especially in patients on calcineurin inhibitors.","Kim, Yaerim; Kwon, Ohyun; Paek, Jin H.; Park, Woo Y.; Jin, Kyubok; Hyun, Miri; Lee, Ji Y.; Kim, Hyun A.; Han, Seungyeup",Am J Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32337859/; https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.15947,246

The outbreak of the virus along the time has become a massive threat to the global public health security and has been declared as a pandemic. Accounting the radical number of increases in the infected cases and the death due to COVID 19 infections around the globe, there is a need to predict the infections among the people by making proper optimization and using various Infectious Disease modelling (IDM) methods, in order to challenge the outcome. In comparison with previous diseases like SARS and Ebola viruses, the new corona virus (COVID 19) infections are infectious during the incubation period. In addition to that, naturally produced droplets from humans (e.g. droplets produced by breathing, talking, sneezing, coughing) and Person-to-person contact transmission are reported to be the foremost ways of transmission of novel corona virus. By considering the above two factors, a modified SEIR (Susceptibility Exposure Infection Recovery) method have been used for predicting the spread of the infections in the state of Tamil Nadu which is located in the southern part of India. Further, we have utilized the current surveillance data from Health and Family Welfare Department, Government of Tamil Nadu to accurately predict the spreading trend of the infection on a state level.","Ayubali, Arsath Abbasali; Satheesh, Sara Roshini",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054593,246

Aim of this pilot prospective study is to verify whether a peculiar hyperactivity, observed at baseline (T0) in early relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients, could represent a further prognostic marker. Here we report results collected at T0 and at a 24-month follow-up (T1). Eighteen RRMS patients (11 females, median Expanded Disability Status Scale-EDSS score 1.25, range EDSS score 0–2) were monitored at T0 (mean age 32.33 ± 7.51) and T1 (median EDSS score 1.5, range EDSS score 0–2.5). Patients were grouped into two groups: responders (R, 14 patients) and non-responders (NR, 4 patients) to treatment at T1. Each patient wore an actigraph for one week to record the 24-h motor activity pattern. At T0, NR presented significantly lower motor activity than R between around 9:00 and 13:00. At T1, NR were characterized by significantly lower motor activity than R between around 12:00 and 17:00. Overall, these data suggest that through the 24-h motor activity pattern, we can fairly segregate at T0 patients who will show a therapeutic failure, possibly related to a more active disease, at T1. These patients are characterized by a reduced morning level of motor activation. Further studies on larger populations are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.","Tonetti, Lorenzo; Camilli, Federico; Giovagnoli, Sara; Natale, Vincenzo; Lugaresi, Alessandra",Clocks Sleep,https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep3030023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34203507/,246
636993,The Assessment of Convalescent Plasma Efficacy against COVID-19,2020-12-18,"While the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing in a majority of countries, a wealth of literature published in reputable journals attempted to model the spread of the disease. A vast majority of these studies dealt with compartmental models such as susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Although these models are rather simple, intuitive, and insightful, we argue that they do not necessarily provide a good enough fit to the reported data, which are usually reported in the form of daily fatalities and cases during pandemics. This study proposes an alternative analytics approach that relies on diffusion models to predict the number of cases and fatalities in epidemics. After evaluating several of the well-known and widely used diffusion models in business literature, including ADBUDG, Gompertz, and Bass models, we developed and used a modified/improved version of the original Bass diffusion model to address the shortcomings of the ordinary compartmental models such as SIR and demonstrated its applicability on the portrayal of the COVID-19 pandemic incident data. The proposed model differentiates itself from other similar models by fitting the data without the need for preprocessing, requiring no initial conditions and assumptions, not involving in heavy parameterization, and also properly addressing the pressing issues such as undocumented cases, length of infectious or recovery periods.","Eryarsoy, Enes; Delen, Dursun; Davazdahemami, Behrooz; Topuz, Kazim",J Bus Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296320308079?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2020.11.054; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0148296320308079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281248/,246

This measure raises ethical issues that require documentation of the modalities of quarantine at the field level and its social effects for contact persons. In Senegal, 74 people were in contact with the Ebola case coming from Guinea in September 2014. Of these, 34 members of the case’s household were contained together at home and monitored by officers. The remaining 40 health care workers from two facilities were dispersed in their family households and monitored by telephone or during doctors’ visits. The study is based on in-depth interviews with 43 adult contacts about their experiences and perceptions, with additional observation for interpretation and contextualization. Containment at home was applied differently to contacts who lived with patient zero than to professional health care contacts. No coercion was used at first since all contacts adhered to surveillance, but some of them did not fully comply with movement restrictions. Contacts found biosafety precautions stigmatizing, especially during the first days when health workers and contacts were feeling an acute fear of contagion. The material support that was provided—food and money—was necessary since contacts could not work nor get resources, but it was too limited and delayed. The relational support they received was appreciated, as well as the protection from stigmatization by the police and follow-up workers. But the information delivered to contacts was insufficient, and some of them, including health workers, had little knowledge about EVD and Ebola transmission, which caused anxiety and emotional suffering. Some contacts experienced the loss of their jobs and loss of income; several could not easily or fully return to their previous living routines. Beyond its recommendations to enhance support measures, the study identifies the ethical stakes of quarantine in Senegal regarding informed consent and individual autonomy, non-maleficence and benevolence, and equity and adaptation to specific situations. Nevertheless, the balance between preventive benefits and individual inconveniences of quarantine should still be evaluated from a public health perspective.","Desclaux, A.; Ndione, A.

People suffering from chronic pain tend to develop psychological discomfort mostly due to lack of acceptance, disbelief, blame. The complexity of pain pathophysiology, plus a wide range of negative psychosocial factors, leads to a more complex suffering that deserves attention and multidisciplinary treatments. The possibility that chronic pain may occur following physical aggression, torture, or persecution raises the issue of evil as a major contributor to pain in its worst representation – when individuals or groups are attacked based on racial, social, gender, religious, political, or other grounds. To explore the complex issue of chronic pain following physical or psychological harm, and to underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach to reduce the burden of chronic pain, we discuss the biological mechanisms underlying pain state. We seek to clarify those factors leading to pain chronification, as well as personal and social attitudes that confound patients with chronic pain. The importance of family and social environment is also investigated, as well as personality traits of chronic pain patients that may further hamper successful treatment. The presence of chronic pain, modulated by, for example, acceptance of being a victim of premeditated physical and social violence, makes the issue more difficult to comprehend.","D’Ippolito, Mariagrazia; Purgato, Adriano; Buzzi, Maria Gabriella",J Pain Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s236507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32547177/,246

We present a clinical evaluation and real-world implementation of the INDICAID COVID-19 rapid antigen test (INDICAID rapid test). A multisite clinical evaluation of the INDICAID rapid test using prospectively collected nasal (bilateral anterior) swab samples from symptomatic subjects was performed. The INDICAID rapid test demonstrated a positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 85.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 75.6% to 91.6%) and 94.9% (95% CI, 91.6% to 96.9%), respectively, compared to laboratory-based reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) using nasal specimens. The INDICAID rapid test was then implemented at COVID-19 outbreak screening centers in Hong Kong as part of a testing algorithm (termed ""dual-track"") to screen asymptomatic individuals for prioritization for confirmatory RT-PCR testing. In one approach, preliminary positive INDICAID rapid test results triggered expedited processing for laboratory-based RT-PCR, reducing the average time to confirmatory result from 10.85 h to 7.0 h. In a second approach, preliminary positive results triggered subsequent testing with an onsite rapid RT-PCR, reducing the average time to confirmatory result to 0.84 h. In 22,994 asymptomatic patients, the INDICAID rapid test demonstrated a PPA of 84.2% (95% CI, 69.6% to 92.6%) and an NPA of 99.9% (95% CI, 99.9% to 100%) compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR using combined nasal/oropharyngeal specimens. The INDICAID rapid test has excellent performance compared to laboratory-based RT-PCR testing and, when used in tandem with RT-PCR, reduces the time to confirmatory positive result. IMPORTANCE Laboratory-based RT-PCR, the current gold standard for COVID-19 testing, can require a turnaround time of 24 to 48 h from sample collection to result. The delayed time to result limits the effectiveness of centralized RT-PCR testing to reduce transmission and stem potential outbreaks. To address this, we conducted a thorough evaluation of the INDICAID COVID-19 rapid antigen test, a 20-minute rapid antigen test, in both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations. The INDICAID rapid test demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity with RT-PCR as the comparator method. A dual-track testing algorithm was also evaluated utilizing the INDICAID rapid test to screen for preliminary positive patients, whose samples were then prioritized for RT-PCR testing. The dual-track method demonstrated significant improvements in expediting the reporting of positive RT-PCR test results compared to standard RT-PCR testing without prioritization, offering an improved strategy for community testing and controlling SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.","Chiu, Ricky Y T; Kojima, Noah; Mosley, Garrett L; Cheng, Kwok Kin; Pereira, David Y; Brobeck, Matthew; Chan, Tsun Leung; Zee, Jonpaul Sze-Tsing; Kittur, Harsha; Chang, Cheuk Yiu Tenny; Tsang, Eric; Maran, Kajal; Yung, Raymond Wai-Hung; Leung, Alex Chin-Pang; Siu, Ryan Ho-Ping; Ng, Jessica Pui-Ling; Choi, Tsz Hei; Fung, Mei Wai; Chan, Wai Sing; Lam, Ho Yin; Lee, Koon Hung; Parkin, Sean; Chao, Felix C; Ho, Stephen Ka-Nung; Marshak, Daniel R; Ma, Edmond Shiu-Kwan; Klausner, Jeffrey D",Microbiol Spectr,https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00342-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346748/,246

This study aimed to investigate the preoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in elective and emergency surgery and to calculate the patient contacts during hospital stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All surgeries defined by the German procedural classification (starting with a 5) from 1 June until 29 November 2020 were retrospectively evaluated regarding the preoperative SARS-CoV‑2 nasopharyngeal swab test. The results were then divided in emergency and elective surgeries. To show the personal contacts of the patients in a university hospital, we calculated the patient pathway within the department of urology and urosurgery for April 2020. Therefor we used the electronic patient records. RESULTS: Altogether 7745 surgical procedures in 5985 patients were performed, whereby 39 (0.5%) SARS-CoV‑2 tests were positive. 2833 (37%) surgical procedures were emergency cases and 4912 (63%) were elective procedures. 25 (0.9%) of the emergency group and 14 (0.3%) of the elective surgeries had a positive SARS-CoV‑2 test. The average number of contacts in the patient room was 12.83 (0–50) and 84.22 (0–249) at the ward level, not counting contacts with the clinic staff. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1% of the preoperative SARS-CoV‑2 tests of either emergency or elective surgeries tested positive in the 6 months prior to November 2020. Although the risk of undetected SARS-CoV‑2 infection appears to be low in terms of costs and personnel, preoperative screening is useful in high-risk areas to ensure further necessary surgeries, especially concerning cancer patients and to prevent virus spread in a hospital.","Rassweiler-Seyfried, M.-C.; Miethke, T.; Becker, K.-P.; Siegel, F.",Urologe A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33559693/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00120-021-01459-y,246

RESULTS: : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P=0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P=0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). LIMITATIONS: : All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. CONCLUSIONS: : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.","Wang, Zheng-He; Yang, Hai-Lian; Yang, Yun-Qing; Liu, Dan; Li, Zhi-Hao; Zhang, Xi-Ru; Zhang, Yu-Jie; Shen, Dong; Chen, Pei-Liang; Song, Wei-Qi; Wang, Xiao-Meng; Wu, Xian-Bo; Yang, Xing-Fen; Mao, Chen",J Affect Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734907/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165032720323922; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165032720323922?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.034,246

In this Essay we share how an area‐specific approach is “calling in” the community so that it can act to address EDI issues, and support those who are marginalised. Women In Supramolecular Chemistry (WISC) is an international network that aims to support equality, diversity, and inclusion within supramolecular chemistry. WISC has taken a field‐specific approach using qualitative research methods with scientists to identify the support that is needed and the problems the supramolecular community needs to address. Herein, we present survey data from the community which highlight the barriers that are faced by those who take career breaks for any reason, a common example is maternity leave, and the importance of mentoring to aid progression post‐PhD. In conclusion, we set out an interdisciplinary and creative approach to addressing EDI issues within supramolecular chemistry.","Caltagirone, Claudia; Draper, Emily R.; Hardie, Michaele J.; Haynes, Cally J.

Through semi‐structured interviews, making an in‐depth comparative study of three differently situated cases (Muslim women), this study argues that the abnormal situation that has ensued from the pandemic has reinforced the vulnerability of women's nascent negotiated identity by landing them in a space where they are supposed by the normative structures to step back to carrying out their traditional responsibilities as ‘good’ wife and mother during the crisis. It has found that the pandemic has similarity in its impacts for the women in their familial lives, despite their being variously situated and resistive, due to the general religio‐culturally defined patriarchal social behaviour of the place (Pakistan) toward women and lack of action on the part of the state for implementing its laws of women's empowerment.","Safdar, Muhammad; Yasmin, Musarat",Gend Work Organ,https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837000/,246
646032,Functional Exhaustion of Type I and II Interferons Production in Severe COVID-19 Patients,2021-01-27,"High meat and meat-products consumption has been related to degenerative diseases. In addition to their saturated fatty acids and cholesterol contents, oxidation products generated during their production, storage, digestion, and metabolization have been largely implicated. This review begins by summarizing the concept of meat and meat-products by the main international regulatory agencies while highlighting the nutritional importance of their consumption. The review also dials in the controversy of white/red meat classification and insists in the need of more accurate classification based on adequate scores. Since one of the negative arguments that meat receives comes from the association of its consumption with the increase in oxidative stress, main oxidation compounds (malondialdehyde, thermaloxidized compounds, 4-hydroxy-nonenal, oxysterols, or protein carbonyls) generated during its production, storage, and metabolization, are included as a central aspect of the work. The review includes future remarks addressed to study the effects meat consumption in the frame of diet–gene interactions, stressing the importance of knowing the genetic variables that make individuals more susceptible to a possible oxidative stress imbalance or antioxidant protection. The importance of consumed meat/meat-products in the frame of a personalized nutrition reach in plant-food is finally highlighted considering the importance of iron and plant biophenols on the microbiota abundance and plurality, which in turn affect several aspects of our physiology and metabolism.","Macho-González, Adrián; Garcimartín, Alba; López-Oliva, María Elvira; Bastida, Sara; Benedí, Juana; Ros, Gaspar; Nieto, Gema; Sánchez-Muniz, Francisco José",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32698505/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9070638,246
646508,"COVID-19 and Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Risk Assessment, Shared Molecular Pathways, and Therapeutic Challenges",2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND: While convalescent plasma (CP) may benefit patients with COVID‐19, fundamental questions remain regarding its efficacy, including the components of CP that may contribute to its therapeutic effect. Most current serological evaluation of CP relies on examination of total immunoglobulin or IgG‐specific anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody levels. However, IgA antibodies, which also circulate and are secreted along the respiratory mucosa, represent a relatively uncharacterized component of CP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Residual samples from patients and CP donors were assessed for IgM, IgG, and IgA anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody titers against the receptor‐binding domain responsible for viral entry. Symptom onset was obtained by chart review. RESULTS: Increased IgA anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody levels correlated with clinical improvement and viral clearance in an infant with COVID‐19, prompting a broader examination of IgA levels among CP donors and hospitalized patients. Significant heterogeneity in IgA levels was observed among CP donors, which correlated weakly with IgG levels or the results of a commonly employed serological test. Unlike IgG and IgM, IgA levels were also more likely to be variable in hospitalized patients and this variability persisted in some patients >14 days following symptom onset. IgA levels were also less likely to be sustained than IgG levels following subsequent CP donation. CONCLUSIONS: IgA levels can be very heterogenous among CP donors and hospitalized patients and do not necessarily correlate with commonly employed testing platforms. Examining isotype levels in CP and COVID‐19 patients may allow for a tailored approach when seeking to fill specific gaps in humoral immunity.","Verkerke, Hans; Saeedi, Bejan J.; Boyer, Darra; Allen, Jerry W.; Owens, Joshua; Shin, Sooncheon; Horwath, Michael; Patel, Kashyap; Paul, Anu; Wu, Shang‐Chuen; Wang, Jianmei; Ho, Alex; Maier, Cheryl L.; Zerra, Patricia E.; Chonat, Satheesh; Arthur, Connie M.; Roback, John D.; Neish, Andrew S.; Lough, Christopher; Josephson, Cassandra D.; Stowell, Sean R.",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16435; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34041759/,246

Nearly half of intubated patients with COVID-19 eventually die. High-Flow Nasal Oxygen (HFNO) and Noninvasive Ventilation (NIV) constitute valuable tools to avert endotracheal intubation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia who do not respond to conventional oxygen treatment. Sparing Intensive Care Unit beds and reducing intubation-related complications may save lives in the pandemic era. The main drawback of HFNO and/or NIV is intubation delay. Cautious selection of patients with severe hypoxemia due to COVID-19 disease, close monitoring and appropriate employment and titration of HFNO and/or NIV can increase the rate of success and eliminate the risk of intubation delay. At the same time, all precautions to protect the healthcare personnel from viral transmission should be taken. In this review, we summarize the evidence supporting the application of HFNO and NIV in severe COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure, analyse the risks associated with their use and provide a path for their proper implementation.","Akoumianaki, Evangelia; Ischaki, Eleni; Karagiannis, Konstantinos; Sigala, Ioanna; Zakyn-thinos, Spyros",J Pers Med,https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11090884; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575661/,246
649713,Delayed COVID-19 Respiratory Failure in Lymphoma Patients on Rituximab-based Chemoimmunotherapy,2021-02-27,"Transcriptionally active chromatin is marked by tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) located after first exons and around transcription start sites. This epigenetic mark is typically restricted to narrow regions at the 5`end of the gene body, though a small subset of genes have a broad H3K4me3 domain which extensively covers the coding region. Although most studies focus on the H3K4me3 mark, the broad H3K4me3 domain is associated with a plethora of histone modifications (e.g., H3 acetylated at K27) and is therein termed broad epigenetic domain. Genes marked with the broad epigenetic domain are involved in cell identity and essential cell functions and have clinical potential as biomarkers for patient stratification. Reducing expression of genes with the broad epigenetic domain may increase the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Enhancers and super-enhancers interact with the broad epigenetic domain marked genes forming a hub of interactions involving nucleosome-depleted regions. Together, the regulatory elements coalesce with transcription factors, chromatin modifying/remodeling enzymes, coactivators, and the Mediator and/or Integrator complex into a transcription factory which may be analogous to a liquid–liquid phase-separated condensate. The broad epigenetic domain has a dynamic chromatin structure which supports frequent transcription bursts. In this review, we present the current knowledge of broad epigenetic domains.","Beacon, Tasnim H.; Delcuve, Geneviève P.; López, Camila; Nardocci, Gino; Kovalchuk, Igor; van Wijnen, Andre J.; Davie, James R.",Clin Epigenetics,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13148-021-01126-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34238359/,246

Recently we estimated the prevalence of unscheduled absences in a cohort of certified registered nurse anesthetists at the University of Miami. We performed a historical cohort study for all types of anesthesia practitioners at the University of Iowa. METHODS: : Two-years of person-assignment days were studied. The total population was 62,951 regular operating room days among 293 people. There were 56,437 days among 203 practitioners with multiple workdays over multiple quarters. RESULTS: : In the total population, the 91 nurse anesthetists had 1.48% person-days with an unscheduled absence, comparable to the 1.74% from University of Miami. Most unscheduled absences (99% lower confidence limit 80.1%) resulted in the person being absent from an operating room clinical assignment for just 1 day. Compared with nurse anesthetists, residents and fellows had proportionately fewer unscheduled absences (odds ratio 0.24 [0.13-0.45], P<.0001), as did anesthesiologists (0.49 [0.30-0.79], P=.0002). Among all practitioners, Mondays, Fridays, and days adjacent to holidays had significantly more unscheduled absences than Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays (1.45 [1.19-1.76], P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: : To have an adequate daily workforce, anesthesia clinical directors need to estimate the daily expected percentage of assigned anesthesia practitioners who will be absent.

It is important for clinical physicians to differentiate COVID-19 from other respiratory infectious diseases caused by viruses, such as human adenovirus. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study. We analyzed and compared the clinical manifestations, laboratory findings and radiological features of two independent cohorts of patients diagnosed with either COVID-19 (n=36) or adenovirus pneumonia (n=18). RESULTS: COVID-19 did not show a preference in males or females, whereas 94.4% of patients with adenovirus pneumonia were males. Fever and cough were common in both COVID-19 and adenovirus pneumonia. But the median maximal body temperature of the adenovirus pneumonia cohort was significantly higher than in COVID-19 (P<0.001). Furthermore, 77.8% of patients with adenovirus pneumonia had a productive cough versus only 13.9% of COVID-19 patients (P<0.001). Compared with adenovirus pneumonia, constitutional symptoms were less common in COVID-19, including headache (16.7% vs 38.9%, P=0.072), sore throat (8.3% vs 27.8%, P=0.058), myalgia (8.3% vs 61.1%, P<0.001) and diarrhea (8.3% vs 44.4%, P=0.002). Furthermore, patients with COVID-19 were less likely to develop respiratory failure (8.3% vs 83.3%, P<0.001) and showed less prominent laboratory abnormalities, including lymphocytopenia (61.1% vs 88.9%, P=0.035), thrombocytopenia (2.8% vs 61.1%, P<0.001), elevated procalcitonin (2.8% vs 77.8%, P<0.001) and elevated C-reactive protein (36.1% vs 100%, P<0.001). Besides, a higher percentage of patients with adenovirus pneumonia showed elevated transaminase, myocardial enzymes, creatinine and D-dimer compared with COVID-19 patients. On chest CT, the COVID-19 cohort was characterized by peripherally distributed ground-glass opacity and patchy shadowing, while the adenovirus pneumonia cohort frequently presented with consolidation and pleural effusion.

A major barrier limiting broad-based screening is the lack of a simple, rapid, and cost-effective COVID-19 testing method. We evaluated the feasibility and utility of facemask sampling in a cohort of 42 COVID-19-positive and 36 COVID-19-negative patients. We used a prototype of Steri-Strips™ (3 M) applied to the inner surface of looped surgical facemasks (Assure), which was worn by patients for a minimum wear time of 3 h, then removed and sent for SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing. Baseline demographics and symptomatology were also collected. Facemask sampling positivity was highest within the first 5 days of symptomatic presentation. Patients with nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 PCR Ct values < 25.09 had SARS-CoV-2 detected on facemask sampling, while patients with Ct values ≥ 25.2 had no SARS-CoV-2 detected on facemask sampling. Facemask sampling can identify patients with COVID-19 during the early symptomatic phase or those with high viral loads, hence allowing timely identification and isolation of those with the highest transmission risk.

This study examines whether there was an increase in the prevalence and incidence of common mental disorders (CMD) in the UK adult population during the first months of lockdown and whether changes in CMD were associated with stressors related to the pandemic and lockdown. METHODS: Longitudinal data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study waves 10–11: 2019–2020 and waves 1–4 of the COVID-19 monthly surveys in April (n = 17 761) to July 2020 (n = 13 754), a representative sample of UK adult population, were analysed. CMD was measured using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) (cut-off >2). Changes in CMD were analysed in relation to COVID-19 and social stressors. RESULTS: Around 29% of adults without CMD less than a year earlier had a CMD in April 2020. However, by July 2020, monthly incidence of CMD had reduced to 9%. Most employment, financial and psychological ‘shocks’ were at their highest levels in April and reduced steadily in later months. Despite the lifting of some lockdown conditions by July, stressors related to loneliness, unemployment, financial problems and domestic work continued to influence CMD. CONCLUSION: Some COVID-19 policy responses such as furloughing may have been effective in mitigating the increase in CMD for some groups of employees. Despite some reduction in levels of pandemic and lockdown-related stressors by the middle of 2020, loneliness and financial stressors remained key determinants of incidence in CMD among the UK adult population.","Chandola, Tarani; Kumari, Meena; Booker, Cara L.; Benzeval, Michaela",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291720005048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33280639/,246

655119,Convalescent plasma therapy in the treatment of COVID-19: some considerations: correspondence,2020-06-22,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory disease which caused global health emergency and announced as pandemic disease by World Health Organization. Lack of specific drug molecules or treatment strategy against this disease makes it more devastating. Thus, there is an urgent need of effective drug molecules to fight against COVID-19. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS CoV-2, a key component of this viral replication, is considered as a prime target for anti-COVID-19 drug development. In order to find potent Mpro inhibitors, we have selected eight polyphenols from green tea, as these are already known to exert antiviral activity against many RNA viruses. We have elucidated the binding affinities and binding modes between these polyphenols including a well-known Mpro inhibitor N3 (having binding affinity −7.0 kcal/mol) and Mpro using molecular docking studies. All eight polyphenols exhibit good binding affinity toward Mpro (−7.1 to −9.0 kcal/mol). However, only three polyphenols (epigallocatechin gallate, epicatechingallate and gallocatechin-3-gallate) interact strongly with one or both catalytic residues (His41 and Cys145) of Mpro. Molecular dynamics simulations (100 ns) on these three Mpro–polyphenol systems further reveal that these complexes are highly stable, experience less conformational fluctuations and share similar degree of compactness. Estimation of total number of intermolecular H-bond and MM-GBSA analysis affirm the stability of these three Mpro–polyphenol complexes. Pharmacokinetic analysis additionally suggested that these polyphenols possess favorable drug-likeness characteristics. Altogether, our study shows that these three polyphenols can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS CoV-2 Mpro and are promising drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment.

Also, the optical properties were examined by evaluating several factors such as molar refraction (R(m)), metallization criterion (M), molar polarizability (α(m)), dielectric coefficients (static and optical), optical transmission (T), and reflection loss (R(L)). The radiation shielding properties of the tested glasses was estimated by determining the mass attenuation coefficient, and other related factors such as the tenth value layer (TVL), the mean free path (MFP), the electron total stopping powers (Ψ(e)) and the electron continuous slowing down approximation range (CSDA) (Φ(e)) for different energy values. The results of Geant4 Monte Carlo were compared with the theoretical values calculated by XCOM platform. The results revealed that the TiO(2)/V(2)O(5) substitution had a remarkable influence on the gamma shielding properties for the tested glasses. On the other hand, the optical properties slightly changed by the TiO(2)/V(2)O(5) substitution. The gamma shielding properties of the tested glasses were compared with many samples in terms of MFP. The present glasses showed superior features to apply for optical and radiation shielding applications.","Kebaili, Imen; Boukhris, Imed; Sayyed, M.I.; Tonguc, Baris; Al-Buriahi, M.S.",Ceram Int,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.07.042; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272884220320423?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32836654/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272884220320423,246

Yet, variation in the magnitude of response to corticosteroids has been observed. There is increasing evidence that preschool-aged children with viral-induced asthma may display a certain degree of corticosteroid resistance, requiring higher doses of corticosteroids to overcome it. The identification of determinants of responsiveness is complicated by design issues, including heterogeneous populations of children with asthma and bronchiolitis or of children with viral-induced and multi-trigger asthma phenotypes in published trials. Potential key determinants of responsiveness may include age, trigger, phenotype, tobacco smoke exposure and genotype. The mechanistic pathway for corticoresistance may originate from a gene-environment interaction, leading to non-eosinophilic airway inflammation. The clinician should carefully confirm the diagnosis of asthma and ascertain the phenotype to select appropriate phenotype-specific therapy.","Ducharme, Francine M.; Krajinovic, Maja",Paediatr Respir Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21722845/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526054211000212; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526054211000212; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prrv.2011.02.007,246

The data set reveals a rapid increase in trade policy activism in February and March 2020 in tandem with the rise in COVID‐19 cases but also uncovers extensive heterogeneity across countries in both their use of trade policy and the types of measures used. Some countries acted to restrict exports and facilitate imports, others targeted only one of these margins, and many did not use trade policy at all. The observed heterogeneity suggests numerous research questions on the drivers of trade policy responses to COVID‐19, on the effects of these measures on trade and prices of critical products, and on the role of trade agreements in influencing the use of trade policy.","Evenett, Simon; Fiorini, Matteo; Fritz, Johannes; Hoekman, Bernard; Lukaszuk, Piotr; Rocha, Nadia; Ruta, Michele; Santi, Filippo; Shingal, Anirudh",World Econ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821084/; https://doi.org/10.1111/twec.13119,246
656722,Assessing Clinical Effects of Traditional Chinese Medicine Interventions: Moving Beyond Randomized Controlled Trials,2021-09-07,"Shear horizontal surface acoustic wave (SH-SAW) biosensors measure the reaction of capture antibodies immobilized on the sensing surface to capture test molecules (antigens) by using the change in SH-SAW propagation characteristics. SH-SAW displacement exists not only on the SH-SAW propagating surface, but also partially penetrates the specimen liquid to a certain depth, which is determined by the liquid properties of the specimen and the operating frequency of the SH-SAW. This phenomenon is called viscosity penetration. In previous studies, the effect of viscosity penetration was not considered in the measurement of SH-SAW biosensors, and the mass or viscosity change caused by the specific binding of capture antibodies to the target antigen was mainly used for the measurement. However, by considering the effect of viscosity penetration, it was found that the antigen–antibody reaction could be measured and the detection characteristics of the biosensor could be improved. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the detection properties of SH-SAW biosensors in the surface height direction by investigating the relationship between molecular dimensions and SH-SAW propagation characteristics, which are pseudo-changed by varying the diameter of gold nanoparticles. For the evaluation, we introduced a layer parameter defined by the ratio of the SH-SAW amplitude change to the SH-SAW velocity change caused by the antigen–antibody reaction. We found a correlation between the layer parameter and pseudo-varied molecular dimensions. The results suggest that SH-SAW does not only measure the mass and viscosity but can also measure the size of the molecule to be detected. This shows that SH-SAW biosensors can be used for advanced functionality.","Kano, Koji; Yatsuda, Hiromi; Kondoh, Jun",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300665/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21144924,246

Yet, description of acute invasive fungal sinusitis with its management in those patients is still scarce. This study aims to describe this recently increasing clinical entity in relation to COVID‐19 patients. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective study. METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study included patients diagnosed with acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis after a recent COVID‐19 infection. Antifungal agents given included amphotericin B, voriconazole, and/or posaconazole. Surgical treatment was restricted to patients with PCR negative results for COVID‐19. Endoscopic, open, and combined approaches were utilized to eradicate infection. Follow‐up for survived patients was maintained regularly for the first postoperative month. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients with a mean age of 52.92 ± 11.30 years old were included. Most common associated disease was diabetes mellitus (27.8%). Mycological analysis revealed infection with Mucor and Aspergillus species in 77.8% and 30.6% of patients, respectively. Sino‐nasal, orbital, cerebral, and palatine involvement was found in 100%, 80.6%, 27.8%, and 33.3% of patients, respectively. The most common reported symptoms and signs are facial pain (75%), facial numbness (66.7%), ophthalmoplegia, and visual loss (63.9%). All patients were treated simultaneously by surgical debridement with antifungal medications except for two patients with PCR‐positive swab for COVID‐19. These two patients received antifungal therapy alone. Overall survival rate was 63.89% (23/36).

Therefore, centralized isolation of close contacts and suspected patients is an important measure to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. At present, the quarantine duration in most countries is 14 d due to the fact that the incubation period of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is usually identified as 1-14 d with median estimate of 4-7.5 d. Since COVID-19 patients in the incubation period are also contagious, cases with an incubation period of more than 14 d need to be evaluated. CASE SUMMARY: A 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the Department of Respiratory Medicine of The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University on April 5 due to a cough with sputum and shortness of breath. On April 10, the patient was transferred to the Fever Clinic for further treatment due to close contact to one confirmed COVID-19 patient in the same room. During the period from April 10 to May 6, nucleic acid and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were tested 7 and 4 times, respectively, all of which were negative. On May 7, the patient developed fever with a maximum temperature of 39℃, and his respiratory difficulties had deteriorated. The results of nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 were positive. On May 8, the nucleic acid and antibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 by Heilongjiang Provincial Center for Disease Control were also positive, and the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the importance of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period. Further epidemiological investigations and clinical observations are urgently needed to identify the optimal incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 and formulate rational and evidence-based quarantine policies for COVID-19 accordingly.","Du, Xue; Gao, Yang; Kang, Kai; Chong, Yang; Zhang, Mei-Ling; Yang, Wei; Wang, Chang-Song; Meng, Xiang-Lin; Fei, Dong-Sheng; Dai, Qing-Qing; Zhao, Ming-Yan",World J Clin Cases,https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i21.5955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34368314/,246

However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these ""exit strategies"" entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures. Methods: We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database. Results: We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe. Conclusions: We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.","Leclerc, Quentin J; Fuller, Naomi M; Knight, Lisa E; Funk, Sebastian; Knight, Gwenan M",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15889.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32656368/,246

Since spontaneous reporting heavily relies on both health care professionals and patients, an understandable question is whether the stress of the pandemic diminished spontaneous reporting. Herein we assess the hypothesis that the COVD-19 pandemic negatively impacted spontaneous reporting of adverse drug events. Methods We analyzed 119 weeks of spontaneous report counts from the Pfizer Safety database (January 1, 2018 to April 12, 2020). We fitted autoregressive integrated moving average models to aggregated and disaggregated time series and charted the model residuals on Individual value-moving range and exponentially weighted moving average charts to identify statistically unexpected changes associated with the pandemic. Results Overall reporting of serious adverse events showed no unexpected decline, Total global reporting declined, driven by health care professional reporting (both serious and non-serious), starting after week 8, 2020, exceeding model expectations by week 15, 2020, suggesting the pandemic as an assignable cause. However, reporting remained within longer term historic ranges. The Japan time series was the one individual country time series showing a significant decline, and unusual periodicity related to national holidays. A few countries, notably Taiwan, showed statistically unexpected reporting increases associated with the pandemic commencing as early as week 3, 2020. Literature reporting of adverse drug events was stable. Ancillary findings included prevalent year-end/beginning reporting minima, more with health professional than consumer reports. Implications In a large and diverse pharmaceutical company database we did detect a significant global decline in total reporting, driven by healthcare professionals, not consumers, and non-serious reports, consistent with the pandemic as an assignable cause, but the reporting remained within long term ranges. suggesting a relative durability. Importantly, our analyses found no unexpected decline in overall serious reporting. Future avenues for research include assessing whether these effects impaired signal detection, performing the same analysis on large public spontaneous reporting system data to assess generalizability of our findings, and follow-up analysis to assess if impacts on spontaneous reporting abate.","Hauben, Manfred; Hung, Eric",Clin Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33509646/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2020.12.008; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291820305579; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291820305579?v=s5,246

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and incidence of viral genome detection by qPCR in the equine airways, and their association with respiratory clinical signs. METHODS: Both NS and tracheal washes (TW) were collected monthly on 52 Standardbred racehorses at training, over 27 consecutive months (581 samples). Equid herpesviruses (EHV)-1, −4, −2 and −5, equine rhinitis virus-A and -B (ERBV), equine adenovirus-1 and −2, equine coronavirus and equine influenza virus were systematically investigated in both NS and TW. Nasal discharge, coughing, tracheal mucus score and TW neutrophil proportions were simultaneously recorded. RESULTS: Genome for 7/10 viruses were detected at least once throughout the study; up to 4 different viruses being also concomitantly detected. Monthly incidence in TW was respectively 27.9% (EHV-5), 24.8% (EHV-2), 7.1% (ERBV), 3.8% (EHV-4), 1.9% (EAdV1) and 0.2% (EHV-1; ERAV). Neither agreement nor correlation between NS and TW was found for respectively genome detection and viral loads. Detection of viral genome in NS was not associated with any clinical sign. Coughing was significantly associated with TW detection of EHV-2 DNA (OR 3.1; P = 0.01) and ERBV RNA (OR 5.3; P < 0.001). Detection of EHV-2 DNA in TW was also significantly associated with excess tracheal mucus (OR 2.1; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Detection and quantification of EHV-2 and ERBV by qPCR in TW, but not in NS, should be considered when investigating horses with IAD.

658778,A Case Report for Severe COVID-19 in a 9-Year-Old Child Treated with Remdesivir and Dexamethasone,2021-07-13,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of acute lung injury, is a devastating clinical syndrome with a high mortality rate (30–60%) (refs 1–3). Predisposing factors for ARDS are diverse(1,3) and include sepsis, aspiration, pneumonias and infections with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus(4,5). At present, there are no effective drugs for improving the clinical outcome of ARDS(1,2,3). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are homologues with different key functions in the renin–angiotensin system(6,7,8). ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 inactivates angiotensin II and is a negative regulator of the system. ACE2 has also recently been identified as a potential SARS virus receptor and is expressed in lungs(9,10). Here we report that ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT(2)) protect mice from severe acute lung injury induced by acid aspiration or sepsis. However, other components of the renin–angiotensin system, including ACE, angiotensin II and the angiotensin II type 1a receptor (AT(1)a), promote disease pathogenesis, induce lung oedemas and impair lung function.

659202,Increased B‐cell activity with consumption of activated monocytes in severe COVID‐19 patients,2021-04-19,"BACKGROUND: The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is taking a toll on the world’s health care infrastructure as well as the social, economic, and psychological well-being of humanity. Individuals, organizations, and governments are using social media to communicate with each other on a number of issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Not much is known about the topics being shared on social media platforms relating to COVID-19. Analyzing such information can help policy makers and health care organizations assess the needs of their stakeholders and address them appropriately. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the main topics posted by Twitter users related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Leveraging a set of tools (Twitter’s search application programming interface (API), Tweepy Python library, and PostgreSQL database) and using a set of predefined search terms (“corona,” “2019-nCov,” and “COVID-19”), we extracted the text and metadata (number of likes and retweets, and user profile information including the number of followers) of public English language tweets from February 2, 2020, to March 15, 2020. We analyzed the collected tweets using word frequencies of single (unigrams) and double words (bigrams). We leveraged latent Dirichlet allocation for topic modeling to identify topics discussed in the tweets. We also performed sentiment analysis and extracted the mean number of retweets, likes, and followers for each topic and calculated the interaction rate per topic. RESULTS: Out of approximately 2.8 million tweets included, 167,073 unique tweets from 160,829 unique users met the inclusion criteria. Our analysis identified 12 topics, which were grouped into four main themes: origin of the virus; its sources; its impact on people, countries, and the economy; and ways of mitigating the risk of infection. The mean sentiment was positive for 10 topics and negative for 2 topics (deaths caused by COVID-19 and increased racism). The mean for tweet topics of account followers ranged from 2722 (increased racism) to 13,413 (economic losses). The highest mean of likes for the tweets was 15.4 (economic loss), while the lowest was 3.94 (travel bans and warnings). CONCLUSIONS: Public health crisis response activities on the ground and online are becoming increasingly simultaneous and intertwined. Social media provides an opportunity to directly communicate health information to the public. Health systems should work on building national and international disease detection and surveillance systems through monitoring social media. There is also a need for a more proactive and agile public health presence on social media to combat the spread of fake news.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alhuwail, Dari; Househ, Mowafa; Hamdi, Mounir; Shah, Zubair",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/19016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287039/,246
659318,Silent hypoxia: higher NO in red blood cells of COVID-19 patients,2020-10-16,"To investigate the immune status of people who previously had COVID-19 infections, we recruited patients 2 weeks post-recovery and analyzed circulating cytokines and lymphocyte subsets. We measured levels of total lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, CD56+ NK cells, and the serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-), and interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) by flow cytometry. We found that in most post-recovery patients, levels of total lymphocytes (66.67%), CD3+ T cells (54.55%), CD4+ T cells (54.55%), CD8 + T cells (81.82%), CD19+ B cells (69.70%), and CD56+ NK cells(51.52%) remained lower than normal, whereas most patients showed normal levels of IL-2 (100%), IL-4 (80.88%), IL-6 (79.41%), IL-10 (98.53%), TNF- (89.71%), IFN-{gamma} (100%) and IL-17 (97.06%). Compared to healthy controls, 2-week post-recovery patients had significantly lower absolute numbers of total lymphocytes, CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells, and CD56+ NK cells, along with significantly higher levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-, IFN-{gamma} and IL-17. Among post-recovery patients, T cells, particularly CD4+ T cells, were positively correlated with CD19+ B cell counts. Additionally, CD8+ T cells positively correlated with CD4+ T cells and IL-2 levels, and IL-6 positively correlated with TNF- and IFN-{gamma}. These correlations were not observed in healthy controls. By ROC curve analysis, post-recovery decreases in lymphocyte subsets and increases in cytokines were identified as independent predictors of rehabilitation efficacy. These findings indicate that the immune system has gradually recovered following COVID-19 infection; however, the sustained hyper-inflammatory response for more than 14 days suggests a need to continue medical observation following discharge from the hospital. Longitudinal studies of a larger cohort of recovered patients are needed to fully understand the consequences of the infection.","None, H.; Zhang, X.; Li, X.; Li, D.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.22.20160259; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.22.20160259v1?rss=1,246

However, due to their ecological design, based on large spatial units, they neglect the strong localised air-pollution patterns, and potentially lead to inadequate confounding adjustment. We investigated the effect of long-term exposure to NO(2) and PM(2·5) on COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 in England using high geographical resolution. METHODS: We included 38 573 COVID-19 deaths up to June 30, 2020 at the Lower Layer Super Output Area level in England (n=32 844 small areas). We retrieved averaged NO(2) and PM(2·5) concentration during 2014–2018 from the Pollution Climate Mapping. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to quantify the effect of air-pollution while adjusting for a series of confounding and spatial autocorrelation. FINDINGS: We find a 0·5% (95% credible interval: −0·2%−1·2%) and 1·4% (−2·1%−5·1%) increase in COVID-19 mortality rate for every 1 μg/m(3) increase in NO(2) and PM(2·5) respectively, after adjusting for confounding and spatial autocorrelation. This corresponds to a posterior probability of a positive effect of 0·93 and 0·78 respectively. The spatial relative risk at LSOA level revealed strong patterns, similar for the different pollutants. This potentially captures the spread of the disease during the first wave of the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Our study provides some evidence of an effect of long-term NO(2) exposure on COVID-19 mortality, while the effect of PM(2·5) remains more uncertain.

661359,Acute Liver Injury in COVID‐19: Prevalence and Association with Clinical Outcomes in a Large US Cohort,2020-05-30,"BACKGROUND: A novel paediatric disease, multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children, has emerged during the 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To describe the short-term evolution of cardiac complications and associated risk factors in patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. METHODS: Retrospective single-centre study of confirmed multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children treated from 29 March, 2020 to 1 September, 2020. Cardiac complications during the acute phase were defined as decreased systolic function, coronary artery abnormalities, pericardial effusion, or mitral and/or tricuspid valve regurgitation. Patients with or without cardiac complications were compared with chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank sum. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children with median (interquartile range) age 7.8 (3.6-12.7) years were included. Nineteen (49%) patients developed cardiac complications including systolic dysfunction (33%), valvular regurgitation (31%), coronary artery abnormalities (18%), and pericardial effusion (5%). At the time of the most recent follow-up, at a median (interquartile range) of 49 (26-61) days, cardiac complications resolved in 16/19 (84%) patients. Two patients had persistent mild systolic dysfunction and one patient had persistent coronary artery abnormality. Children with cardiac complications were more likely to have higher N-terminal B-type natriuretic peptide (p = 0.01), higher white blood cell count (p = 0.01), higher neutrophil count (p = 0.02), severe lymphopenia (p = 0.05), use of milrinone (p = 0.03), and intensive care requirement (p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children had a high rate of cardiac complications in the acute phase, with associated inflammatory markers. Although cardiac complications resolved in 84% of patients, further long-term studies are needed to assess if the cardiac abnormalities (transient or persistent) are associated with major cardiac events.","Harahsheh, Ashraf S; Krishnan, Anita; DeBiasi, Roberta L; Olivieri, Laura J; Spurney, Christopher; Donofrio, Mary T; Cross, Russell R; Sharron, Matthew P; Frank, Lowell H; Berul, Charles I; Christopher, Adam; Dham, Niti; Srinivasalu, Hemalatha; Ronis, Tova; Smith, Karen L; Kline, Jaclyn N; Parikh, Kavita; Wessel, David; Bost, James E; Litt, Sarah; Austin, Ashley; Zhang, Jing; Sable, Craig A",Cardiol Young,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1047951121003024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34348808/,246

A questionnaire was mailed in 1997 to all pilots in a Scandinavian airline company (N = 622); 577 (93%) participated. The same questionnaire was sent to the participants 3 years later, 436 participated (76%). There were questions on asthma, respiratory symptoms and infections, allergies, the cabin environment, psychosocial environment and the home environment. Associations were analyzed by multiple logistic regression, calculating odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). The incidence of doctors’ diagnosed asthma and atopy were 2.4 and 16.6 per 1000 person years, respectively. Pilots changing type of flight during follow-up got more airway infections (OR = 11.27; 95% CI 2.39–53.14). Those reporting decreased work control (OR = 1.85; 95% CI 1.03–3.31 for 1 unit change) and those with environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) at home (OR = 3.73; 95% CI 1.09–12.83) had a higher incidence of atopy during follow up. Dampness or mould at home was associated with a higher prevalence of asthma symptoms (OR = 3.55; 95% CI 1.43–8.82) and airway infections (OR = 3.12 95% CI 1.27–7.68). Window pane condensation in winter at home, reported at baseline, was associated with increased incidence of asthma symptoms (OR = 4.14; 95% CI 1.32–12.97) and pilots living in newer buildings at baseline had a higher incidence of airway infections (OR = 5.23; 95% CI 1.43–19.10). In conclusion, lack of work control and ETS at home can be a risk factors for development of allergic symptoms in pilots. Window pane condensation at home can be a risk factor for incidence of asthma symptoms. Dampness and mould at home can be a risk factor for prevalence of asthma symptoms and airway infections and living in newer buildings can be a risk factor for incidence of airway infections.","Fu, Xi; Lindgren, Torsten; Wieslander, Gunilla; Janson, Christer; Norbäck, Dan",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0164954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27741314/,246

Although preliminary evidence suggests that cannabis use has increased during the pandemic, there has been little research on the impact of cannabis use on COVID-related psychological outcomes. Cannabis use among college students is associated with problematic psychosocial outcomes; thus, it follows that cannabis users during the pandemic may experience more functional impairment problems with daily living as a result of increased psychological distress from the pandemic and difficulty with regulating that distress. METHODS The current study tested whether cannabis use status was related to functional impairment in daily activities and whether this was due to difficulty with emotion regulation and COVID-related distress. The sample comprised of 727 (184 current cannabis users) young adults in Louisiana, a state that had some of the highest rates of COVID-19 deaths and infections in the U.S. RESULTS Cannabis use was related to greater functional impairment in daily activities and this relation was mediated by the sequential effects of difficulty with emotion regulation and COVID-related distress. CONCLUSIONS Results indicated that cannabis users during the COVID-19 pandemic are experiencing problematic psychosocial outcomes further highlighting the need for the development of interventions to help target COVID-related distress and improve psychosocial functioning during the pandemic.","Abarno, Cristina N; Glover, Nina I; Morris, Paige E; Zvolensky, Michael J; Buckner, Julia D",Substance use & misuse,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34608833/; https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2021.1981389,246
661966,Unique case of Central Retinal Artery Occlusion secondary to COVID-19 Disease,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: Although modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are commonly used for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) control, there have been safety concerns due to the quick reversion of MLV to virulence during replication in pigs. Previous studies have demonstrated that mutant viruses emerged from lethal mutagenesis driven by antiviral mutagens and that those viruses had higher genetic stability compared to their parental strains because they acquired resistance to random mutation. Thus, this strategy was explored to stabilize the PRRSV genome in the current study. RESULTS: Four antiviral mutagens (ribavirin, 5-fluorouracil, 5-azacytidine, and amiloride) were evaluated for their antiviral effects against VR2332, a prototype of type 2 PRRSV. Among the mutagens, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil had significant antiviral effects against VR2332. Consequently, VR2332 was serially passaged in MARC-145 cells in the presence of ribavirin at several concentrations to facilitate the emergence of ribavirin-resistant mutants. Two ribavirin-resistant mutants, RVRp13 and RVRp22, emerged from serial passages in the presence of 0.1 and 0.2 mM ribavirin, respectively. The genetic stability of these resistant mutants was evaluated in MARC-145 cells and compared with VR2332. As expected, the ribavirin-resistant mutants exhibited higher genetic stability compared to their parental virus. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, ribavirin and 5-fluorouracil effectively suppressed PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. However, ribavirin-resistant mutants emerged when treated with low concentrations (≤0.2 mM) of ribavirin, and those mutants were genetically more stable during serial passages in cell culture.","Khatun, Amina; Shabir, Nadeem; Yoon, Kyoung-Jin; Kim, Won-Il",BMC Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25890207/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-015-0330-z,246

However, the definition on “computable knowledge object” remains controversial so far in different fields. For example, it is defined as (1) quantitative scientific concept in natural science and engineering, (2) knowledge point in the field of education research, and (3) semantic predications, i.e., Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triples in biomedical fields. The Semantic MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB), a high-quality public repository of SPO triples extracted from medical literature, provides a basic data infrastructure for measuring medical knowledge. In general, the study of extracting SPO triples as computable knowledge unit from unstructured scientific text has been overwhelmingly focusing on scientific knowledge per se. Since the SPO triples would be possibly extracted from hypothetical, speculative statements or even conflicting and contradictory assertions, the knowledge status (i.e., the uncertainty), which serves as an integral and critical part of scientific knowledge has been largely overlooked. This article aims to put forward a framework for Medical Knowmetrics using the SPO triples as the knowledge unit and the uncertainty as the knowledge context. The lung cancer publications dataset is used to validate the proposed framework. The uncertainty of medical knowledge and how its status evolves over time indirectly reflect the strength of competing knowledge claims, and the probability of certainty for a given SPO triple. We try to discuss the new insights using the uncertainty-centric approaches to detect research fronts, and identify knowledge claims with high certainty level, in order to improve the efficacy of knowledge-driven decision support.","Li, Xiaoying; Peng, Suyuan; Du, Jian",Scientometrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33612884/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-03880-8,246

666782,More Than Just Heartburn: Does Famotidine Effectively Treat Patients with COVID-19?,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Cambodia has made significant progress in controlling malaria in the past decade. It now aims to eliminate malaria from the country by 2025. It launched the Malaria Elimination Action Framework (MEAF 2016-2020) in 2015 with strong political commitment targeting appropriate interventions on high-risk populations, particularly mobile and migrant groups. METHODS: In 2020, the household-level Cambodia Malaria Survey 2020 (CMS 2020) was conducted with the objective to assess the performance of malaria control activities using the indicators outlined in MEAF 2016-2020. The survey used a cross-sectional probability proportional to size approach drawing 4,000 households from 100 villages across the malaria-endemic districts of the country. RESULTS: A total of 3,996 households with 17,415 inhabitants were interviewed. Of the surveyed households, 98.4% owned a long-lasting insecticide-treated bednet or hammock (LLIN/LLIHN). However, only 79.5% of these reported sleeping under a net the previous night, with only 45.7% sleeping under an insecticide treated net (ITN). Given that forest visitors are at the highest risk of getting malaria, the survey also targeted this group. Of the forest visitor respondents, 89.3% brought an ITN along and 88.9% reported to have used a net during their forest stay. About 10.8% of forest goers had received a forest kit for malaria prevention from mobile malaria workers the last time they went to the forest. Knowledge about mosquito repellents was high among forest goers (62.5%) but the actual use thereof during the last visit to the forest was low (22%). While awareness about malaria prevention with LLINs remained high among most respondents, knowledge about malaria diagnosis and treatment was not universal. Source of malaria knowledge and its treatment was usually from a household member, followed by a village malaria worker or a primary health care center staff. Of those who had fever during the previous two weeks, 93.6% sought advice or treatment outside the home, and the most commonly reported source for advice or treatment was private providers (39.4%) followed by health center/district hospital (31.3%). CONCLUSIONS: ITN distribution and other malaria prevention interventions have largely benefited the high-risk groups including the forest visitors. Comparing the CMS 2020 results with the 2017 CMS results, it is clear that forest visitors’ use of LLIN/LLIHN has improved considerably. However, more needs to be done to ensure forest visitors be protected either through using LLINs or repellents while working and staying in the forest areas. Also, given that sleeping under LLINs has decreased over the past several years among the at-risk populations, the programme will have to develop strategies to ensure that the communities do not lower their guard against malaria as cases further dwindle in malaria prone areas.

Nevertheless, studies have not explored specifically gender disparities on access to healthcare. Aim: To evaluate disparities in access to care in Chile during the COVID-19 pandemic from a gender-based perspective. Methods: We conducted a quasi-experimental design using a difference-in-difference approach. We compared the number of weekly confirmed cases of a set of oncologic and cardiovascular time-sensitive conditions at a national level. We defined weeks 12 to 26 as an intervention period and the actual year as a treatment group. We selected this period because preventive interventions, such as school closures or teleworking, were implemented at this point. To test heterogeneity by sex, we included an interaction term between difference-in-difference estimator and sex. Results: A sizable reduction in access to care for patients with time-sensitivity conditions was observed for oncologic (IRR 0.56; 95% CI 0.50-0.63) and cardiovascular diseases (IRR 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.66). Greater reduction occurred in women compared to men across diseases groups, particularly marked on myocardial infarction (0.89; 95% CI 0.85-0.93), stroke (IRR 0.88 IC95% 0.82-0.93), and colorectal cancer (IRR 0.79; 95% CI 0.69-0.91). Compared to men, a greater absolute reduction in women for oncologic diseases (782; 95% CI 704-859) than cardiovascular diseases (172; 95% CI 170-174) occurred over 14 weeks. Conclusion: We confirmed a large drop in new diagnosis for time-sensitive conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Chile. This reduction was greater for women. Our findings should alert policy-makers about the urgent need to integrate a gender perspective into the pandemic response and its aftermath.","Pacheco, J.; Crispi, F.; Alfaro, T.; Martinez, M.

670582,The Molecular Basis of Gender Variations in Mortality Rates Associated With the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Outbreak,2021-09-17,"PURPOSE: The novel Coronavirus SARS-coV-2 outbreak late in 2019 and early 2020, known today as the COVID-19 pandemic, has spread fast throughout the world. It has considerably affected the lives of all people around the globe while the number of deaths related to the pandemic keeps increasing worldwide. Being able to predict the spread of the pandemic has been very helpful to governments to decide on actions. Statistical prediction models are capable of modeling a single snapshot but have several well-known weaknesses, such as linear assumptions between pandemic variables, while they cannot confirm the actual causality between studied factors. In the present work, the authors propose a state space Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (AFCM) approach model to predict the spread of the pandemic, using dynamic cause and effect relationships between pre-defined factors. METHODS: State-Space Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Maps are proposed for modeling the spread of the pandemic, utilizing several social, policy, and healthcare factors. Statistical data from Greece, South Korea, and Germany are gathered to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. RESULTS: The proposed methodology was able to predict the pandemic trend in the studied countries, in terms of the total number of confirmed patient cases, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.99, 0.94, and 0.97 respectively. The Pearson’s correlation coefficient was found to be 0.99, 0.97, and 0.98 respectively. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the advantages of the proposed methodology when modeling uncertain and dynamic situations, like novel pandemics.","Groumpos, Peter P.; Apostolopoulos, Ioannis D.",Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s42600-021-00182-z,246

671158,Clinical efficacy of Early Administration of Convalescent Plasma among COVID-19 Cases in Egypt,2021-04-04,"BACKGROUND: It is crucial that nursing homes have adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and staff to protect residents and staff from COVID‐19. Some states have taken actions to mitigate shortages of PPE and staffing in nursing homes, including creating dedicated long‐term care (LTC) teams and supporting staffing capacity. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether state actions and nursing home characteristics are associated with shortages of PPE and staffing. DESIGN AND SETTING: Facility‐level data, released July 31, 2020, from the Nursing Home COVID‐19 Public File, were combined with data from other sources. Our sample was the 13,445 facilities with information about PPE and staffing shortages for each of the 5 weeks between the week ending June 21, 2020, and the week ending July 19, 2020. Associations between facility characteristics and shortages were examined using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. MEASUREMENTS: Outcome variables were whether or not a facility lacked a 1‐week supply of PPE (“PPE shortage”) and whether or not a facility had a staffing shortage during 1 or more weeks over the 5‐week study period. RESULTS: Over the 5‐week study period, 27.6% of facilities reported 1 or more weeks of PPE shortage, 30.2% of facilities reported at least 1 week of staffing shortage, and 46.5% of facilities lacked PPE and/or staff. Facilities located in states in the Northeast PPE Consortium or with LTC teams were modestly less likely to have had a PPE shortage, and facilities located in states that implemented processes to match job seekers with LTC facilities were marginally significantly less likely to have had a staffing shortage. CONCLUSION: Given that nearly half of U.S. nursing homes recently faced a shortage of PPE and/or staff, and that state budget deficits may limit further state actions, ongoing federal assistance with PPE and staffing of nursing homes is needed.","Gibson, Diane M.; Greene, Jessica",J Am Geriatr Soc,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.16883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33022757/,246
671635,MR‐proADM as marker of endotheliitis predicts COVID‐19 severity,2021-02-20,"BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) is important in respiratory physiology and airway defense. Although the paranasal sinuses are the major source of nasal NO, transport dynamics between the sinuses and nasal cavities are poorly understood. METHODS: Exhaled nasal NO tracings were measured in two non-asthmatic subjects (one with allergic rhinitis, one without) using NO analyzer connected via face mask. We subsequently performed computational fluid dynamics NO emission simulations based on individual CT scans and compared to the experimental data. RESULTS: Simulated exhaled NO tracings match well with experimental data (r > 0.84, p < 0.01) for both subjects, with measured peaks reaching 319.6 ppb in one subject (allergic-rhinitis), and 196.9 ppb in the other. The CFD simulation accurately captured the peak differences, even though the initial sinus NO concentration for both cases was set to the same 9000 ppb based on literature value. Further, the CFD simulation suggests that ethmoid sinuses contributed the most (>67%, other sinuses combined <33%) to total nasal NO emission in both cases and that diffusion contributes more than convective transport. By turning off diffusion (setting NO diffusivity to ~0), the NO emission peaks for both cases were reduced by >70%. CONCLUSION: Historically, nasal NO emissions were thought to be contributed mostly by the maxillary sinuses (the largest sinuses) and active air movement (convection). Here, we showed that the ethmoid sinuses and diffusive transport dominate the process. These findings may have a substantial impact on our view of nasal NO emission mechanisms and sinus physiopathology in general.","Spector, Barak M; Shusterman, Dennis J; Goldberg, Andrew N; Weaver, Edward M; Farag, Alexander A; Otto, Bradley A; Zhao, Kai",Comput Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34388459/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104723,246
671822,COVID-19 Associated With Life-Threatening Apnea in an Infant Born Preterm: A Case Report,2020-09-15,"OBJECTIVES: Respiratory co‐infections have the potential to affect the diagnosis and treatment of COVID‐19 patients. This meta‐analysis was performed to analyze the prevalence of respiratory pathogens (viruses and atypical bacteria) in COVID‐19 patients. METHODS: This review was consistent with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA). Searched databases included: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and grey literature. Studies with a series of SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients with additional respiratory pathogen testing were included. Independently, 2 authors extracted data and assessed quality of evidence across all studies using Cochrane's Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and within each study using the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Data extraction and quality assessment disagreements were settled by a third author. Pooled prevalence of co‐infections was calculated using a random‐effects model with univariate meta‐regression performed to assess the effect of study subsets on heterogeneity. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot inspection, Begg's correlation, and Egger's test. RESULTS: Eighteen retrospective cohorts and 1 prospective study were included. Pooling of data (1880 subjects) showed an 11.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.9–17.4, I (2) = 0.92) pooled prevalence of respiratory co‐pathogens. Studies with 100% co‐pathogen testing (1210 subjects) found a pooled prevalence of 16.8% (95% CI = 8.1–27.9, I (2) = 0.95) and studies using serum antibody tests (488 subjects) found a pooled prevalence of 26.8% (95%, CI = 7.9–51.9, I (2) = 0.97). Meta‐regression found no moderators affecting heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: Co‐infection with respiratory pathogens is a common and potentially important occurrence in patients with COVID‐19. Knowledge of the prevalence and type of co‐infections may have diagnostic and management implications.","Davis, Bennett; Rothrock, Ava N.; Swetland, Sarah; Andris, Halle; Davis, Phil; Rothrock, Steven G.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12128; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838380/,246
672568,Cytokine storm in severe COVID‐19 pneumonia,2021-05-15,"BACKGROUND: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is known to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in the current pandemic. Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) concentrations are elevated in patients with various cardiovascular disorders including heart failure. METHODS: In a total of 182 consecutive adult patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) and 63 healthy controls, sACE2 concentrations were measured in serum using the Human ACE2(®) assay by Cloud-Clone Corporation and associated with clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic parameters. RESULTS: Median sACE2 levels were increased in patients with complex CHD as compared to healthy controls (761.9 pg/ml vs 365.2 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Moreover, sACE2 concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with a higher NYHA class ≥ III (1856.2 pg/ml vs 714.5 pg/ml in patients with NYHA class I/II, p < 0.001). Using linear regression analysis, higher sACE2 levels were associated with a higher NYHA class ≥ III, more severe CHD, a morphological left systemic ventricle, higher creatinine and the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) in the univariable model. The use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) was associated with lower sACE2 levels. In the multivariable model, higher sACE2 levels were independently associated with a higher NYHA class ≥ III (p = 0.002) and lower sACE2 levels with the use of ACE inhibitors or ARB (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Soluble ACE2 concentrations were significantly increased in all types of complex CHD with highest levels found in patients with NYHA class ≥ III. Moreover, a higher NYHA class ≥ III was the most significant determinant that was independently associated with elevated sACE2 concentrations.

672983,Peripheral blood inflammatory markers in predicting prognosis in patients with COVID‐19. Some differences with influenza A,2020-11-22,"Aiming to assist the environmental sustainability of the Brazilian Amazonian agriculture, this article developed an eco-efficiency index, indicating the possible limits to maximize economic and environmental objectives, taking into account the best practices in the municipalities of the region. Shadow prices of degraded areas and forest preservation were also estimated using data envelopment analysis with directional distance functions. The results indicate that, on average, the analyzed municipalities are able to expand the production and the forest areas by 38% and reduce degraded areas and their inputs in the same proportion. The shadow prices allowed the estimation of the annual opportunity cost of the degraded areas and the preservation of the forest on the farms. The first, US$ 3,131,571, represented 0.04% of the annual output value, indicating that the internalization of that cost should be a low burden for the eco-efficient producer. The second, the total cost of preserving 80% of the area of property, represented US$ 120,890,662 or 1.7% of the annual income of the biome producers studied. Therefore, the main conclusion of this work is that the internalization of negative and positive externalities of agricultural production in the Amazonian biome does not make agricultural production economically unfeasible in the region. In addition, the reimbursement of damages avoided by carbon sequestration, through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) established by the Kyoto Conference, should further increase the economic and environmental sustainability of agriculture in the area.","Rosano-Peña, Carlos; Teixeira, Joanílio Rodolpho; Kimura, Herbert",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34196866/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-14867-6,246
673224,The Convalescent Plasma Craze! Where Does India Stand?,2021-06-16,"PURPOSE: We aimed to evaluate utilization of inpatient hospital and critical care services in critically ill neurologic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized based on prior observations in ischemic stroke patients, that there would be significant decline in critically ill neurologic patients presenting to hospitals during the pandemic which may impact outcomes. METHODS: We used TriNetX, a large research network, collecting real-time electronic medical records data. We extracted data on utilization of critical care and hospital inpatient services among cohorts of patients with common neurocritical conditions between January-June 2020 compared to similar time-frame in previous years. We also compared the prevalence and clinical outcomes comprising need for intubation and 30-day mortality among these cohorts. RESULTS: We found a 28.1% reduction in intensive care unit (ICU) admissions with critical neurologic illnesses in 2020 when compared to 2019 (8568 vs. 11917 patients, p<0.0001) and a 34.4% reduction compared to 2018 (8568 vs. 13064 patients, p<0.0001). However, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality (2020: 12.2 vs. 2019: 12.4% ; p=0.7; vs. 2018: 12.6%; p=0.62) or intubation rates across the years among patients using critical care services. There was 1% increase in mortality among non-ICU patients with similar diagnoses in 2020 compared to previous years (2020: 3.9% vs. 2019: 2.9% vs. 2018: 3.1%; p<0.0001, p=0.0001), but no difference in intubation rates. CONCLUSION: There was a significant reduction in hospital and ICU admissions among patients with acute neurologic emergencies in 2020, after onset of COVID-19 pandemic, compared to previous years. While we did not find a significant difference in mortality among patients admitted to the ICU, there was slightly higher mortality among non-ICU patients with same diagnoses in 2020 compared to previous years.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature using databases such as Medline, Pubmed, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science Core Collection, CNKI, the National Central Library Online Catalog and dissertation databases to identify studies in the English or Chinese language published between January 2003 to May 2020 which reported psychological distress and mental health morbidities among SARS patients, healthcare workers, and the general public in regions with major SARS outbreaks. RESULTS: The literature search yielded 6984 titles. Screening resulted in 80 papers for the review, 35 of which were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of post-recovery probable or clinician-diagnosed anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among SARS survivors were 19, 20 and 28%, respectively. The prevalence of these outcomes among studies conducted within and beyond 6 months post-discharge was not significantly different. Certain aspects of mental health-related quality of life measures among SARS survivors remained impaired beyond 6 months post-discharge. The prevalence of probable depressive disorder and PTSD among healthcare workers post-SARS were 12 and 11%, respectively. The general public had increased anxiety levels during SARS, but whether there was a clinically significant population-wide mental health impact remained inconclusive. Narrative synthesis revealed occupational exposure to SARS patients and perceived stigmatisation to be risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among healthcare workers, although causality could not be determined due to the limitations of the studies. CONCLUSIONS: The chronicity of psychiatric morbidities among SARS survivors should alert us to the potential long-term mental health complications of covid-19 patients. Healthcare workers working in high-risk venues should be given adequate mental health support. Stigmatisation against patients and healthcare workers should be explored and addressed. The significant risk of bias and high degree of heterogeneity among included studies limited the certainty of the body of evidence of the review.

674435,Revised meta-analysis and pooled estimate of audio-vestibular symptoms associated with COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND It is unclear how, when and where health care workers (HCW) working in hospitals are infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS Prospective cohort study comprising 4-weekly measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies and questionnaires from March to June 2020. We compared SARS-CoV-2 incidence between HCW working in Covid-19 patient care, HCW working in non-Covid-19 patient care and HCW not in patient care. Phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 samples from patients and HCW were performed to identify potential transmission clusters. RESULTS We included 801 HCW: 439 in the Covid-19 patient care group, 164 in the non-Covid-19 patient care group and 198 in the no patient care group. SARS-CoV-2 incidence was highest in HCW working in Covid-19 patient care (13.2%), as compared with HCW in non-Covid-19 patient care (6.7%, hazard ratio [HR] 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 4.3) and in HCW not working in patient care (3.6%, HR 3.9, 95% CI 1.8 to 8.6). Within the group of HCW caring for Covid-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 cumulative incidence was highest in HCW working on Covid-19 wards (25.7%), as compared with HCW working on intensive care units (7.1%, HR 3.6, 95% CI 1.9 to 6.9), and HCW working in the emergency room (8.0%, HR 3.3, 95% CI 1.5 to 7.1). Phylogenetic analyses on Covid-19 wards identified multiple potential HCW-to-HCW transmission clusters while no patient-to-HCW transmission clusters were identified. CONCLUSIONS HCW working on Covid-19 wards are at increased risk for nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with an important role for HCW-to-HCW transmission.","Sikkens, J. J.; Buis, D. T. P.; Peters, E.

The associated disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid‐19), has now involved virtually all 200 countries. The total number of confirmed cases has been much more than in the two previous outbreaks of human coronaviruses, that is, SARS‐CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. In line with the outbreak escalation, false information about SARS‐CoV‐2 and its associated disease disseminated globally, particularly through online and social media. Believers in conspiracy theories promote misinformation that the virus is not contagious, is the result of laboratory manipulation or is created to gain profit by distributing new vaccines. The most dangerous effect of this widely disseminated misinformation is it will negatively influence the attitudes and behaviours for preventive measures to contain the outbreak.

Methods: Infants undergoing congenital cardiac surgery were randomly divided into an intervention group (n = 27) and a control group (n = 27). Infants in the intervention group received HMF, and those in the control group were exclusively breastfed. The nutritional indicators at discharge, the postoperative recovery status, and nutritional-related complications were recorded. Results: Compared with the control group at the time of discharge, the weight and albumin and prealbumin levels of the intervention group were significantly increased (P < 0.05). The length of hospital stay of the intervention group was significantly reduced compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). Although the length of ICU stay for the intervention group was shorter than that of the control group, the difference was not significant (P > 0.05). No significant difference in the incidence of postoperative nutrition-related complications was noted between the two groups (P > 0.05).

676351,Liver impairment associated with disease progression in COVID‐19 patients,2020-04-15,"BACKGROUND: The long-term repercussions of critical COVID-19 on pulmonary function and imaging studies remains unexplored. In this study, we investigated the pulmonary function and computed tomography (CT) findings of critical COVID-19 patients approximately 100 days after symptom onset. METHODS: We retrospectively extracted data on critical COVID-19 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization from April to December 2020 and evaluated their pulmonary function, residual respiratory symptoms, and radiographic abnormalities on CT. RESULTS: We extracted 17 patients whose median age was 63 (interquartile range [IQR], 59–67) years. The median lengths of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were 23 (IQR, 18–38) and 9 (IQR, 6–13) days, respectively. At 100 days after symptom onset, the following pulmonary function abnormalities were noted in 8 (47%) patients: a diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (%DL(CO)) of <80% for 6 patients (35%); a percent vital capacity (%VC) of <80% for 4 patients (24%); and a percent forced expiratory volume (FEV(1)%) of <70%for 1 patient (6%) who also presented with %DL(CO) and %VC abnormalities. Twelve (71%) patients reported residual respiratory symptoms and 16 (94%) showed abnormalities on CT. CONCLUSIONS: Over 90% of the critical COVID-19 patients who underwent invasive mechanical ventilation continued presenting with abnormal imaging studies and 47% of the patients presented with abnormal pulmonary function 100 days after symptom onset.

DENV infects cells directly or via antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in Fc-receptor-bearing cells, a process thought to contribute to severe disease in a secondary infection. Here we investigated whether ADE-mediated DENV infection bypasses IFITM-mediated restriction or whether IFITM proteins can be protective in a secondary infection. We observed that IFITM proteins restricted ADE-mediated and direct infection with comparable efficiencies in a myelogenous leukemia cell line.

678554,Convalescent Plasma for the Treatment of Severe COVID-19,2021-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infectious disease, which is pandemic, infectious, and high mortality. Many commonly discussed medications being used to treat COVID-19 are not without potentially harmful side effects such as heart, liver, kidney problems, or other clinical symptoms. Acupuncture is a nonpharmacological method. When a needle is inserted into an acupuncture point, traumatic physical stimulation occurs, and then the neuroendocrine immune regulation network is activated. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments. METHODS: From their inception to December 10, 2020, the following electronic databases will be searched to identify relevant studies: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), without any language restrictions. Randomized controlled trials and credible clinical observations without randomization include patients diagnosed with COVID-19, and receiving western medicine treatments or acupuncture, with no restrictions on disease stage, age, sex, or ethnicity. Primary outcomes would be used to evaluate the mortality rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), creatine, troponin, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), blood pressure, clinical symptoms (including fever, fatigue, myalgia, cough, skin rash, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea), and serum cytokine levels. Secondary outcome would be used to evaluate the adverse events of acupuncture. Risk of bias will be assessed by 2 review authors independently according to the guidelines set out in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. DISCUSSION: This is the first to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture for improving the side effects of COVID-19 western medicine treatments. A longer follow-up should be considered in future studies. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis would provide evidence of acupuncture specifically focused on its effectiveness and safety for patients with COVID-19 western medications adverse effects.

678778,Estimating case fatality rates of COVID-19,2020-03-31,"As the science of wellbeing has grown, universities have adopted the challenge of prioritizing the wellbeing of students. Positive psychology interventions (PPIs), activities designed to increase the frequency of positive emotions and experiences, which help to facilitate the use of actions and thoughts that lead to human flourishing, are being increasingly used worldwide. Known to boost wellbeing and a number of other variables, it nonetheless remains unknown whether their use can influence other variables in non-Western cultures. In this study, we determined the impact of PPIs on a variety of wellbeing outcomes. The 6-week PPI program was conducted in the United Arab Emirates on Emirati university students (n = 120) who reported more positive emotion and overall balance of feelings that favored positivity over time relative to a control group. Yet, there was no effect found on negative emotions, life satisfaction, perceived stress, fear of happiness, locus of control, or somatic symptoms, and no effect on levels of collectivism or individualism. Our findings nonetheless support the use of PPIs in higher education as they show an increase in the experience of positive emotion, with this in itself bringing positive life outcomes, and no negative impact on culture. Our findings serve to build a foundation for understanding for whom PPIs work best - and least - around the world.","Lambert, Louise; Warren, Meg A.; Schwam, Allison; Warren, Michael T.",Curr Psychol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-02080-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305364/,246

Methods From December 2019 to April 2020, we recruited all eligible hospitalized adults with respiratory infection to a prospective observational study at the HUS Jorvi Hospital, Finland. Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections were confirmed by RT-PCR. Follow-up lasted for at least 30 days from admission. Results We included 61 patients, of whom 28 were COVID-19 and 33 influenza patients with median ages of 53 and 56 years. Majority of both COVID-19 and influenza patients were men (61% vs 67%) and had at least one comorbidity (68% vs 85%). Pulmonary diseases and current smoking were less common among COVID-19 than influenza patients (5 [18%] vs 15 [45%], P=0.03 and 1 [4%] vs 10 [30%], P=0.008). In chest x-ray at admission, ground-glass opacities and consolidations were more frequent among COVID-19 than influenza patients (19 [68%] and 7 [21%], P < 0.001). Severe disease and intensive care unit (ICU) admission occurred more often among COVID-19 than influenza patients (26 [93%] vs 19 [58%], P=0.003 and 8 [29%] vs 2 [6%], P=0.034). COVID-19 patients were hospitalized longer than influenza patients (6 days [IQR 4-21] vs 3 [2-4], P<0.001). Conclusion Bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidations in chest X-ray may help to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients had more severe disease, required longer hospitalization and were admitted to ICU more often than influenza patients, which has important implications for public health policies.","Auvinen, R.; Nohynek, H.; SyrjaÌnen, R.; Ollgren, J.; Kerttula, T.; MaÌntylaÌ, J.; Ikonen, N.; Loginov, R.; Haveri, A.; Kurkela, S.; Skogberg, K.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.20140632; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.29.20140632v1?rss=1,246

The authors hypothesized that the effects of the pandemic would indicate differences based on the ethnicity of the participating dentist. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The survey was available online between June 1, 2020 and July 10, 2020, a period when many dental offices remained closed, and for the most part, unable to provide non‐emergency dental care. The link to the survey was made available to dentists through outreach to several national dental organizations. Descriptive statistics summarized the characteristics of the entire sample and Fisher's exact test was used to examine respondents' answers stratified by ethnicity using frequencies and percentages. RESULTS: All ethnic groups reported decreased revenue and African American dentists were the least likely to report a decrease in revenue compared to White and Other ethnic groups (84.2%, 87.2% and 92.9%). African American dentists were the most likely to report willingness to contribute to a task force to address the new challenges resulting from COVID‐19 when compared to White and Other ethnic groups (46.4%, 18.8%, and 29.6%, respectively). African American dentists were more likely to indicate a need for a stronger connection to academic programs as compared to White or Other dentists in order to address current and future challenges (12.3%, 0.0%, and 9.1%). CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 pandemic has affected dental practices differently, highlighting racial disparities, and strategies that factor in the race or ethnicity of the dentist and the communities in which they practice need to be considered to ensure that underserved communities receive needed resources.","Diab, Zeid; Shara, Nawar; Chou, Jiling; Libin, Alexander; Kuhn, Alexander; Farmer‐Dixon, Cherae; Jackson, Andrea; Hughes, Bertram; Laurence, Brian",Clin Exp Dent Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/cre2.398; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496042/,246
680738,Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis Induced by Moderna COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine,2021-08-27,"The COVID-19 pandemic has swept over the world in the past months, causing significant loss of life and consequences to human health. Although numerous drug and vaccine development efforts are underway, there are many outstanding questions on the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral association to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its main host receptor, and host cell entry. Structural and biophysical studies indicate some degree of flexibility in the viral extracellular spike glycoprotein and at the receptor binding domain-receptor interface, suggesting a role in infection. Here, we perform explicitly solvated all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the glycosylated, full-length membrane-bound ACE2 receptor, in both an apo and spike receptor binding domain (RBD) bound state, in order to probe the intrinsic dynamics of the ACE2 receptor in the context of the cell surface. A large degree of fluctuation in the full length structure is observed, indicating hinge bending motions at the linker region connecting the head to the transmembrane helix, while still not disrupting the ACE2 homodimer or ACE2-RBD interfaces. This flexibility translates into an ensemble of ACE2 homodimer conformations that could sterically accommodate binding of the spike trimer to more than one ACE2 homodimer, and suggests a mechanical contribution of the host receptor towards the large spike conformational changes required for cell fusion. This work presents further structural and functional insights into the role of ACE2 in viral infection that can potentially be exploited for the rational design of effective SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics.","Barros, Emilia P.; Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Dommer, Abigail C.; Wang, Yuzhang; Fallon, Lucy; Raguette, Lauren; Belfon, Kellon; Simmerling, Carlos; Amaro, Rommie E.",Biophys J,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349520308626?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349520308626; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.10.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189680/,246

Flattening of epidemic curve Current analysis was carried out to observe a pattern in the rise of CoVID-19 cases along with concurrent announcements of strategies to control the spread of disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data in from of daily number of cases and issued notifications were studied from the official website of Government of India from 30/01/2020 to 03/05/2020. Qualitative assessment with thematic analysis was carried out for notifications issued by the government. The fit to data on cumulative cases was observed with R(2) and checked for linearity, logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential growth. Daily growth fraction (G(t)) was calculated based on the difference between current and previous number of cases, thereafter daily doubling time (T(d(t))) was estimated. RESULTS: Daily reported cases were entered and cumulative growth of cases observed with a polynomial increasing pattern (third-order) with better fit (R(2): 0.999). Total 108 notifications were issued, and as compared to phase-0 and 1 (87.0%), few (12.9%) notifications were issued in phase-2 of study period. As compared to phase-0 and 1, rising trend of cumulative cases and T(d(t)) was high in phase-2.

To contextualise these findings, comparisons were made against 36 non-COVID-19 consecutive patients requiring RRT on ICU. METHODS We conducted a retrospective single centre observational cohort study of patients requiring acute RRT between 1st March and 30th June 2020. Comparison was made against those receiving RRT in the pre-COVID-19 period from January 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS Of 154 COVID-19 patients, 47 (30.5%) received continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVHF), all of whom required mechanical ventilation and vasopressor support. The requirement for RRT was related to fluid balance rather than azotaemia. Compared to 36 non-COVID-19 patients, those with COVID-19 were younger (p=0.016) with a lower serum creatinine on hospital admission (p=0.049), and lesser degrees of metabolic acidosis (p<0.001) and lactataemia (p<0.001) before initiation of RRT. In addition, the duration of RRT requirement was longer (p<0.001). Despite lower CVVHF exchange rates with higher serum creatinine levels following RRT initiation in the COVID-19 patients, metabolic abnormalities were corrected. Hospital mortality was 60% among COVID-19 patients requiring RRT, compared to 67% in non-COVID patients (p=0.508), and renal recovery among survivors without pre-existing CKD was similar (p=0.231). CONCLUSIONS The requirement for RRT in COVID-19 patients was primarily related to fluid balance and using lower CVVHF exchange rates was effective to correct metabolic abnormalities. Renal recovery occurred in all but one patient by 60 days in the 40% of patients who survived.","Ryan, Rebecca; Taylor, Isabel; Laing, Chris; Singer, Mervyn; Gondongwe, Dereck; MacCALLUM, Niall; Arulkumaran, Nishkantha",Minerva anestesiologica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34337912/; https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15595-6,246

Addictive-like eating behavior, or food addiction, has been associated with an array of problematic eating behaviors, which may suggest heightened susceptibility to poorer outcomes. In this online, cross-sectional study, adults (ages 18–78; M = 42.36, SD = 13.08) living in the United States (n = 288) completed questionnaires assessing food addiction and reported changes to their weight, eating, and physical activity before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with food addiction gained an average of 12.42 lb (5.63 kg) since March 2020, compared to an average weight gain of 2.14 lb (0.97 kg) for those without food addiction (p < .001). Linear regression analyses controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) showed that food addiction was independently associated with higher weight gain (B = 9.28, t = 4.97, p < .001), greater intake of ultra-processed foods before and during COVID-19 (B = 1.08, t = 5.71, p < .001; B = 1.18, t = 6.42, p < .001, respectively), greater attribution of their overall current eating behaviors to COVID-19 circumstances (B = 23.19, t = 4.62, p < .001), and higher distress about their overall current eating behaviors (B = −22.12, t = −2.50, p = .01). Interaction effects demonstrated that individuals with food addiction who are older may be at particularly high risk for weight gain and distress. The present research suggests that food addiction is a uniquely meaningful phenotype, beyond the effects of BMI, to identify risk for the negative consequences of COVID-19. Individuals with food addiction, particularly those who are older, may benefit from support with weight management and addictive-like eating as the COVID-19 pandemic persists and resolves.","Schulte, Erica M.; Kral, Tanja V.E.; Allison, Kelly C.",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105740; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195666321006474; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321006474?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627980/,246

AIM: To explore the oral hygiene-related knowledge, attitude and practices of transgenders residing in the Bhubaneswar during COVID-19. METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional study was conducted among the transgenders residing in Bhubaneswar using a self-structured questionnaire containing questions on knowledge, attitude and practices related to oral hygiene. Mann–Whitney U test was applied to find any significant differences between different variables in groups. RESULTS: A total of 205 transgenders participated in the study. Around 43.9% of the transgenders in rural areas felt they had bad breath and there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Majority of the participants in the rural areas did not know how to describe the health of their teeth and gums while 43% of the participants in the urban areas felt their oral health was good. There was statistically significant difference between the two groups in the type of material used for cleaning teeth [p = 0.020].

The spread could be more or less well-controlled and fatalities could partly be avoided by obligatory wearing of masks, contact restrictions and since the beginning of the year by vaccinations. Patients with chronic inflammatory diseases and organ transplant patients under immunosuppression, are somewhat more at risk to become ill with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The probability and severity of an infection depends on the ability of the humoral and cellular immune systems to effectively combat the virus. This can be substantially improved by vaccination. The B cell depleting monoclonal antibody rituximab (RTX) is frequently employed in rheumatic diseases, whereby antibody formation against the new pathogen within the framework of vaccination is restricted. Recent study results in patients treated with RTX indicate that an effective cellular immune response can be developed despite the impaired humoral response.","Braun, J.; Westhoff, T.; Baraliakos, X.; Babel, N.",Z Rheumatol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00393-021-01083-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529110/,246

Psychological preparedness, the primed cognitive awareness and anticipation of dealing with emotional responses in an adverse situation, has assumed a compelling relevance during a health disaster of this magnitude. METHODS: An anonymized eSurvey was conducted in India to assess psychological preparedness toward the ongoing pandemic with a focus on knowledge, management of own and others’ emotional response, and anticipatory coping mechanisms among the survey population. An adapted version of the qualitative Psychological Preparedness for Natural Disaster Scale validated by the World Health Organization was widely circulated over the Internet and various social media platforms for assessment. Results are expressed as median ± standard deviation. Descriptive statistics were used and figures downloaded from surveymonkey.com. RESULTS: Of the 1120 respondents (M:F 1.7:1, age 35 years ±14.1), most expressed a high level of perceived knowledge and confidence of managing COVID-19, such as awareness of the symptoms of the illness (95.1%), actions needed (94.4%), hospital to report to (88.9%), and emergency contact number (89.1%). A majority (95%) monitored regularly the news bulletins and scientific journals regarding COVID-19. However, nearly one-third (29.2%) could not assess their likelihood of developing COVID-19, and 17.5% were unaware of the difference between a mild and severe infection. Twenty-three percent (23.3%) were unfamiliar with the materials needed in an acute illness situation.

However, many of the earlier GT-based studies include potential statistical fallacies by measuring the correlation between non-stationary time sequences without adjusting for multiple comparisons or the confounding of media coverage, leading to concerns about the increased risk of obtaining false-positive results. In this study, we aimed to apply statistically more favorable methods to validate the earlier GT-based COVID-19 study results. METHODS: We extracted the relative GT search volume for keywords associated with COVID-19 symptoms, and evaluated their Granger-causality to weekly COVID-19 positivity in eight English-speaking countries and Japan. In addition, the impact of media coverage on keywords with significant Granger-causality was further evaluated using Japanese regional data. RESULTS: Our Granger causality-based approach largely decreased (by up to approximately one-third) the number of keywords identified as having a significant temporal relationship with the COVID-19 trend when compared to those identified by Pearson or Spearman’s rank correlation-based approach. “Sense of smell” and “loss of smell” were the most reliable GT keywords across all the evaluated countries; however, when adjusted with their media coverage, these keyword trends did not Granger-cause the COVID-19 positivity trends (in Japan). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that some of the search keywords reported as candidate predictive measures in earlier GT-based COVID-19 studies may potentially be unreliable; therefore, caution is necessary when interpreting published GT-based study results.

684429,Early safety indicators of COVID-19 convalescent plasma in 5000 patients,2020,"At institutions with an emphasis on authentic research experiences as an integral part of the biology curriculum, COVID created a huge challenge for course instructors whose learning objectives were designed for such experiences. Moving such laboratory experiences online when remote learning became necessary has resulted in a new model for CUREs that utilizes free online databases to provide not only a novel research experience for students, but also the opportunity to engage in big data analysis. Cancer BioPortal (cBioPortal) is an open-access collective cancer research resource for storing and exploring clinical, genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic data. cBioPortal eliminates the computational barrier of interpreting complex genomic data by providing easily understandable visualization that can be interpreted and translated into relevant biological insights. Because no prior computational knowledge is required, cBioPortal is an ideal educational tool for either in-person or distance learning environments. We developed a pedagogical approach, video tutorials, and data analysis workflows centered on using cBioPortal. Pedagogically, students develop an initial research outline that is continually updated and graded throughout the project. Progress during the project or course is assessed by a series of student presentations that are 5 to 15 minutes in length and are aimed at explaining the approach used in data acquisition, interpretation of the data, and relevance to the initial hypothesis. While cancer-specific, this analysis platform appeals to a wide range of classes and student interests. Further, the project has been successfully done both as an independent research experience and as part of a virtual class-based research project.","Barnes, Chassidy N.; Johnson, Blake P.; Leacock, Stefanie W.; Ceballos, Ruben M.; Hensley, Lori L.; Reyna, Nathan S.",J Microbiol Biol Educ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33884053/; https://doi.org/10.1128/jmbe.v22i1.2315,246
684740,Sinonasal pathophysiology of SARS‐CoV‐2 and COVID‐19: A systematic review of the current evidence,2020-04-16,"In physiology and pathophysiology the molecules involved in blood cell–blood cell and blood cell–endothelium interactions have been identified. Platelet aggregation and adhesion to the walls belonging to vessels involve glycoproteins (GP), GP llb and GP llla and the GP Ib–IX–V complex. Red blood cells (RBCs) in normal situations have little interaction with the endothelium. Abnormal adhesion of RBCs was first observed in sickle cell anemia involving vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, α4β1, Lu/BCAM, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-4. More recently RBC adhesion was found to be increased in retinal-vein occlusion (RVO) and in polycythemia vera (PV). The molecules which participate in this process are phosphatidylserine and annexin V in RVO, and phosphorylated Lu/BCAM and α5 laminin chain in PV. The additional adhesion in diabetes mellitus occurs due to the glycated RBC band 3 and the advanced glycation end-product receptors. The multiligand receptor binds advanced glycation end products (AGEs) or S100 calgranulins, or β-amyloid peptide. This receptor for advanced glycation end products is known as RAGE. The binding to RAGE-activated endothelial cells leads to an inflammatory reaction and a prothrombotic state via NADPH activation and altered gene expression. RAGE blockade is a potential target for drugs preventing the deleterious consequences of RAGE activation.","Wautier, Jean-Luc; Wautier, Marie-Paule",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21155315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32727002/,246

Recently, several countries have reported on the widespread and regular consumption of WFPs, particularly by rural and indigenous communities but also in urban contexts. They are reported as critical for livelihood resilience and for providing essential micronutrients to people enduring food shortages or other emergency situations. However, threats derived from changes in land use and climate, overexploitation and urbanization are reducing the availability of these biological resources in the wild and contributing to the loss of traditional knowledge associated with their use. Meanwhile, few policy measures are in place explicitly targeting their conservation and sustainable use. This can be partially attributed to a lack of scientific evidence and awareness among policymakers and relevant stakeholders of the untapped potential of WFPs, accompanied by market and non-market barriers limiting their use. This paper reviews recent efforts being undertaken in several countries to build evidence of the importance of WFPs, while providing examples of cross-sectoral cooperation and multi-stakeholder approaches that are contributing to advance their conservation and sustainable use. An integrated conservation approach is proposed contributing to secure their availability for future generations.","Borelli, Teresa; Hunter, Danny; Powell, Bronwen; Ulian, Tiziana; Mattana, Efisio; Termote, Céline; Pawera, Lukas; Beltrame, Daniela; Penafiel, Daniela; Tan, Ayfer; Taylor, Mary; Engels, Johannes",Plants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33019632/; https://doi.org/10.3390/plants9101299,246

Outreach clinics may represent tools to assist in this reduction by optimizing patient related travel. Therefore, we sought to estimate the carbon footprint savings associated with a head and neck surgery outreach clinic. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional survey of patient travel patterns to a surgical outreach clinic compared to a regional cancer treatment centre from December 2019 to February 2020. Participants completed a self-administered survey of 12 items eliciting travel distance, vehicle details, and ability to combine medical appointments. Canadian datasets of manufacturer provided vehicular efficiency were used to estimate carbon emissions for each participant. Geographic information systems were used for analyses. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen patients were included for analysis. The majority of patients (85.8%) used their own personal vehicle to travel to the outreach clinic. The median distance to the clinic and regional centre were 29.0 km (IQR 6.0–51.9) and 327.0 km (IQR 309.0–337.0) respectively. The mean carbon emission reduction per person was therefore 117,495.4 g (SD: 29,040.0) to 143,570.9 g (SD: 40,236.0). This represents up to 2.5% of an average individual’s yearly carbon footprint. Fewer than 10% of patients indicated they were able to carpool or group their appointments. CONCLUSION: Surgical outreach clinics decrease carbon footprints associated with patient travel compared to continued care at a regional centre. Further research is needed to determine possible interventions to further reduce carbon emissions associated with the surgical care of patients.

686852,Riding the COVID-19 Tsunami in India – A nephrologist’s perspective,2021-06-26,"BackgroundUnderstanding community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission is crucial to inform public health decisions. Research on SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households and other close settings using serological testing is scarce. MethodsWe invited COVID-19 cases diagnosed between February 27 and April 1, 2020 in canton of Vaud, Switzerland, to participate, along with household members and other close contacts. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were measured using a Luminex immunoassay. We estimated factors associated with serological status using generalized estimating equations. FindingsOverall, 219 COVID-19 index cases, 302 household members, and 69 other close contacts participated between May 4 and June 27, 2020. More than half of household members (57{middle dot}2%, 95%CI 49{middle dot}7-64{middle dot}3) had developed a serologic response to SARS-CoV-2, while 19{middle dot}0% (95%CI 10{middle dot}0-33{middle dot}2) of other close contacts were seropositive. After adjusting for individual and household characteristics, infection risk was higher in household members aged 65 or more than in younger adults (aOR 3{middle dot}63, 95%CI 1{middle dot}05-12{middle dot}60), and in those not strictly adhering to simple hygiene rules like hand washing (aOR 1{middle dot}80, 95%CI 1{middle dot}02-3{middle dot}17). The risk was lower when more than 5 people outside home were met during the semi-confinement, compared to none (aOR 0{middle dot}35, 95%CI 0{middle dot}16-0{middle dot}74). The individual risk of household members to be seropositive was lower in large households (22% less per each additional person). InterpretationWe find that, during semi-confinement, household members of a COVID-19 case were at very high risk of getting infected, 3 times more than close contacts outside home. This highlights the need to provide clear messages on specific protective measures applicable at home. For elderly couples, who were especially at risk, providing them external support for daily basic activities is essential.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is considered a risk modifier in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that the absence of CAC might have an additional predictive value for an improved cardiovascular outcome of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and methods: We prospectively included 310 consecutive hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Thirty patients with history of coronary artery disease were excluded. Chest computed tomography (CT) was performed in all patients. Demographics, medical history, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, imaging data, in-hospital treatment, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. A composite endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was defined. Results: Two hundred eighty patients (63.2 ± 16.7 years old, 57.5% male) were included in the analysis. 46.7% patients had a CAC score of 0. MACE rate was 21.8% (61 patients). The absence of CAC was inversely associated with MACE (OR 0.209, 95% CI 0.052–0.833, p = 0.027), with a negative predictive value of 84.5%. Conclusion: The absence of CAC had a high negative predictive value for MACE in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, even in the presence of cardiac risk factors. A semi-qualitative assessment of CAC is a simple, reproducible, and non-invasive measure that may be useful to identify COVID-19 patients at a low risk for developing cardiovascular complications.","Luchian, Maria-Luiza; Lochy, Stijn; Motoc, Andreea; Belsack, Dries; Magne, Julien; Roosens, Bram; de Mey, Johan; Tanaka, Kaoru; Scheirlynck, Esther; Boeckstaens, Sven; Van den Bussche, Karen; De Potter, Tom; von Kemp, Berlinde; Galloo, Xavier; François, Clara; Weytjens, Caroline; Droogmans, Steven; Cosyns, Bernard",Front Cardiovasc Med,https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2021.684528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307498/,246

This was the second novel swine enteric coronavirus detected in the US since May 2013. In this study, we conducted retrospective testing of samples submitted to three veterinary diagnostic laboratories where qualifying biological samples were derived from previously submitted diagnostic case submissions from US commercial swine farms with a clinical history of enteric disease or from cases that had been previously tested for transmissible gastroenteritis virus, PEDV, or rotavirus. Overall, 2286 banked samples were tested from 27 States. Samples were collected in 3 separate years and in 17 different months. Test results revealed 4 positive samples, 3 collected in August 2013 and 1 collected in October 2013. In addition, a case series including 42 operations in 10 States was conducted through administration of a survey. Survey data collected included information on characteristics of swine operations that had experienced PDCoV clinical signs. Special emphasis was placed on obtaining descriptive estimates of biosecurity practices and disease status over time of each operation. Clinical signs of PDCoV were reported to be similar to those of PEDV. The average number of animals on each operation exhibiting clinical signs (morbidity) and the average number of case fatalities was greatest for suckling and weaned pigs. Average operation-level weaned pig morbidity was greatest in the first week of the outbreak while average operation-level suckling pig case fatality was greatest in the second week of the outbreak. The survey included questions regarding biosecurity practices for visitors and operation employees; trucks, equipment and drivers; and feed sources. These questions attempted to identify a likely pathway of introduction of PDCoV onto the operations surveyed.","McCluskey, Brian J.; Haley, Charles; Rovira, Albert; Main, Rodger; Zhang, Yan; Barder, Sunny",Prev Vet Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26603048/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167587715300398; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167587715300398; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.prevetmed.2015.10.018,246

687633,Long COVID presenting with intermittent fever after COVID-19 pneumonia,2021-06-04,"Housing is a paradigmatic example of a social determinant of health, as it influences and is influenced by structural determinants, such as social, macroeconomic, and public policies, politics, education, income, and ethnicity/race, all intersecting to shaping the health and well-being of populations. It can therefore be argued that housing policy is critically linked to health policy. However, the extent to which this linkage is understood and addressed in public policies is limited and highly diverse across and within countries. This analysis seeks to describe the linkages between housing policies and health and well-being using examples from three countries at different levels of the wealth spectrum: Singapore, the UK, and Kenya. We conducted a comparative policy analysis across three country contexts (Singapore, the UK, and Kenya) to document the extent to which housing policies address health and well-being, highlighting commonalities and differences among them. To guide our analysis, we used the United Nations (UN) definition of adequate housing as it offers a broad framework to analyze the impact of housing on health and well-being. The anatomy of housing policies has a strong correlation to the provision of adequate housing across Singapore, the UK, and Kenya, especially for vulnerable groups. The paper demonstrates that contextual factors including population composition (i.e., aging versus youthful), political ideologies, legal frameworks (i.e., welfare versus market-based provision of housing), and presence (or absence) of adequate, quality, timely, reliable, robust data systems for decision-making, which are taken up by stakeholders/state, have strong implications of the type of housing policies developed and implemented, in turn directly and indirectly impacting the overall health and well-being of populations. This analysis demonstrates the value of viewing housing policies as public health policies that could significantly impact the health and well-being of populations, especially vulnerable groups. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of the Health in All Policies approach to facilitate integrated policy responses to address social determinants of health such as housing. This is more critical than ever, given the context of the global pandemic that has led to worsening overall health and well-being.","Mwoka, Meggie; Biermann, Olivia; Ettman, Catherine K.; Abdalla, Salma M; Ambuko, Jane; Pearson, Mark; Rashid, Sabina Faiz; Zeinali, Zahra; Galea, Sandro; Valladares, Laura Magaña; Mberu, Blessing",J Urban Health,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11524-021-00557-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34480327/,246
687650,Primary pulmonary artery sarcoma versus pulmonary thromboembolism: a multimodal imaging comparison,2021-05-07,"BACKGROUND: Consumer-based physical activity trackers have increased in popularity. The widespread use of these devices and the long-term nature of the recorded data provides a valuable source of physical activity data for epidemiological research. The challenges include the large heterogeneity between activity tracker models in terms of available data types, the accuracy of recorded data, and how this data can be shared between different providers and third-party systems. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop a system to record data on physical activity from different providers of consumer-based activity trackers and to examine its usability as a tool for physical activity monitoring in epidemiological research. The longitudinal nature of the data and the concurrent pandemic outbreak allowed us to show how the system can be used for surveillance of physical activity levels before, during, and after a COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: We developed a system (mSpider) for automatic recording of data on physical activity from participants wearing activity trackers from Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, Oura, Polar, Samsung, and Withings, as well as trackers storing data in Google Fit and Apple Health. To test the system throughout development, we recruited 35 volunteers to wear a provided activity tracker from early 2019 and onward. In addition, we recruited 113 participants with privately owned activity trackers worn before, during, and after the COVID-19 lockdown in Norway. We examined monthly changes in the number of steps, minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and activity energy expenditure between 2019 and 2020 using bar plots and two-sided paired sample t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. RESULTS: Compared to March 2019, there was a significant reduction in mean step count and mean activity energy expenditure during the March 2020 lockdown period. The reduction in steps and activity energy expenditure was temporary, and the following monthly comparisons showed no significant change between 2019 and 2020. A small significant increase in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was observed for several monthly comparisons after the lockdown period and when comparing March-December 2019 with March-December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: mSpider is a working prototype currently able to record physical activity data from providers of consumer-based activity trackers.

METHODS: To evaluate the effect of Pleurotus ostreatus on co-transformation of oxo-degradable low-density polyethylene (LDPE(oxo)) sheets and lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), were assembled two 0.75 L microcosm systems in vertical (VMS) and horizontal (HMS) position. The pre-treated sheets with luminescent O(2) plasma discharges were mixed with pine bark, hydrolyzed brewer’s yeast and paper napkin fragments and incubated for 135 days at 20 ± 1.0 °C in the presence of the fungus. With the co-transformation residues, biochar (BC) was produced at 300 ± 1.0 °C (BC300) for 1 h, then used to carry out adsorption studies, using the malachite green dye (MG) at pH 4.0, 7.0 and 9.0 ± 0.2. Finally, the biochar was the substrate for the germination of carnation seeds (Dianthus caryophyllus) and Ray-grass (Lolium sp.) in vitro. RESULTS: For HMS, the decrease in static contact angle (SCA) was 63.63% (p = 0.00824) and for VMS 74.45% (p = 0.00219), concerning the pristine. Plastic roughness in VMS was higher (26%) concerning the control. Throughout the 135 days, there were fungal growth and consequently laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and lignin peroxidase (LiP) activities. During the first 75 days, CO(2) production increased to 4.78 ± 0.01 and 4.98 ± 0.01 mg g-1 for HMS and VMS, respectively. In MG adsorption studies, the highest amount of the colourant adsorbed at both pH 4.0 and 7.0 ± 0.2. CONCLUSIONS: Finally, the biochar or the biochar enriched with low concentrations of plant growth-promoting microorganisms and inorganic fertilizer favours the germination of Dianthus caryophyllus and Lolium sp., seeds.

Most disagreement was seen in women coded as mixed in either data set. Rates of obstetrical events and complications by ethnicity were similar regardless of data set used, with the most differences seen in women coded as mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Levels of accuracy in ethnicity coding in administrative hospital records support the use of ethnicity collapsed into groups (white/South Asian/black/mixed/other), but findings for mixed and other groups, and more granular classifications, should be treated with caution. Robustness of results of analyses for associations with ethnicity can be improved by using additional primary data sources.","Jardine, Jennifer Elizabeth; Frémeaux, Alissa; Coe, Megan; Gurol Urganci, Ipek; Pasupathy, Dharmintra; Walker, Kate",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34426472/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-051977,246
690577,HMPV in Immunocompromised Patients: Frequency and Severity in Pediatric Oncology Patients,2020-01-10,"Viral outbreaks can be experienced as disruptive and can be associated with trauma-related stress symptoms. In the current study, we adjusted the Dutch version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to assess traumatic stress symptoms related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychometric properties of this Impact of Event Scale with modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19) were investigated by administering the IES-COVID19 to 380 university students who participated during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, upon invitation via e-mail. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-COVID19 was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, χ(2)(85) = 147.51, CFI = .92, TLI = .90, RMSEA = .044, SRMR = .049. Cronbach’s alpha showed acceptable internal consistency of the total IES-COVID19, α = .75. Pearson’s correlations of the IES-COVID19 over time were also sufficient, demonstrating adequate test–retest reliability, r = .62. Significant correlations (ranging between .15 and .50) between the IES-COVID19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, stress-related rumination, as well as negative social interactions, demonstrate adequate convergent validity. Overall, the IES-COVID19 shows to be a valid and reliable measure that can be utilized to investigate trauma-related stress symptoms of intrusion and avoidance related to the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Scheveneels, Sara; Belmans, Eline; Hermans, Dirk",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00738; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32848918/,246
