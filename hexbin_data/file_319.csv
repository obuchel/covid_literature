1727,A Bayesian Inferential Approach to Quantify the Transmission Intensity of Disease Outbreak,2015-02-15,"Background. Emergence of infectious diseases like influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 has become great concern, which posed new challenges to the health authorities worldwide. To control these diseases various studies have been developed in the field of mathematical modelling, which is useful tool for understanding the epidemiological dynamics and their dependence on social mixing patterns. Method. We have used Bayesian approach to quantify the disease outbreak through key epidemiological parameter basic reproduction number (R (0)), using effective contacts, defined as sum of the product of incidence cases and probability of generation time distribution. We have estimated R (0) from daily case incidence data for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 in India, for the initial phase. Result. The estimated R (0) with 95% credible interval is consistent with several other studies on the same strain. Through sensitivity analysis our study indicates that infectiousness affects the estimate of R (0). Conclusion. Basic reproduction number R (0) provides the useful information to the public health system to do some effort in controlling the disease by using mitigation strategies like vaccination, quarantine, and so forth.","Kadi, Adiveppa S.; Avaradi, Shivakumari R.",Comput Math Methods Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4345055/,319
2635,Building the road to a regional zoonoses strategy: A survey of zoonoses programmes in the Americas,2017-03-23,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, global public health security has been threatened by zoonotic disease emergence as exemplified by outbreaks of H5N1 and H1N1 influenza, SARS, and most recently Ebola and Zika. Additionally, endemic zoonoses, such as rabies, burden countries year after year, placing demands on limited finances and personnel. To survey the baseline status of the emerging and endemic zoonoses programmes of the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) conducted a survey of priority emerging and endemic zoonoses, countries´ prioritization criteria and methodologies, and suggestions to strengthen countries capacities and regional approaches to zoonoses control. METHODS: A fillable online questionnaire was sent to the zoonoses programme managers of the Ministries of Health (MOH) and Ministries of Agriculture (MAg) of 33 LAC countries from January to April of 2015. The questionnaire comprised 36 single, multiple choice and open-ended questions to inform the objectives of the survey. A descriptive exploratory analysis was completed. RESULTS: Fifty-four ministries (26 MOH, 25 MAg, and 3 combined responses) in 31 LAC countries responded to the survey. Within the ministries, 22 (85%) MOH, 5 (20%) MAg, and 2 (67%) combined entities indicated they had specialized zoonoses units. For endemic zoonoses, 32 of 54 ministries responded that they conduct formal prioritization exercises, most of them annually (69%). The three priority endemic zoonoses for the MOHs were leptospirosis, rabies, and brucellosis while the three priorities for the MAgs were brucellosis, rabies, and tuberculosis. Diagnosis for rabies and leptospirosis were cited as the capacities most in need of development. The most needed cross-cutting capacity was coordination between stakeholders. For emerging zoonoses, 28 ministries performed formal prioritization exercises. The top prioritization criteria were probability of introduction into the country and impact. The three priority emerging zoonoses for the MOHs were Ebola viral disease, avian influenza, and Chikungunya while for the MAgs were avian influenza, bovine spongiform encephalopathy and West Nile virus disease. Surveillance for avian influenza and Ebola, and diagnosis for BSE were quoted as the capacities most needed. For all zoonoses, the majority of respondents (69%) ranked their relationship with the other Ministry as productive or very productive, and 31% minimally productive. Many countries requested a formal regional network, better regional communication and collaboration, and integrated surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: The survey is the first comprehensive effort to date to inform the status of zoonoses programmes in LAC. The information collected here will be used to develop a regional strategy for zoonoses (both endemic and emerging), increase efforts, advocacy, and promote prompt identification and management of EIDs and improvement of endemic programmes.","Maxwell, Melody J.; Freire de Carvalho, Mary H.; Hoet, Armando E.; Vigilato, Marco A.

3795,Beyond buzz‐pollination – departures from an adaptive plateau lead to new pollination syndromes,2018-10-12,"Pollination syndromes describe recurring adaptation to selection imposed by distinct pollinators. We tested for pollination syndromes in Merianieae (Melastomataceae), which contain bee‐ (buzz‐), hummingbird‐, flowerpiercer‐, passerine‐, bat‐ and rodent‐pollinated species. Further, we explored trait changes correlated with the repeated shifts away from buzz‐pollination, which represents an ‘adaptive plateau’ in Melastomataceae. We used random forest analyses to identify key traits associated with the different pollinators of 19 Merianieae species and estimated the pollination syndromes of 42 more species. We employed morphospace analyses to compare the morphological diversity (disparity) among syndromes. We identified three pollination syndromes (‘buzz‐bee’, ‘mixed‐vertebrate’ and ‘passerine’), characterized by different pollen expulsion mechanisms and reward types, but not by traditional syndrome characters. Further, we found that ‘efficiency’ rather than ‘attraction’ traits were important for syndrome circumscription. Contrary to syndrome theory, our study supports the pooling of different pollinators (hummingbirds, bats, rodents and flowerpiercers) into the ‘mixed‐vertebrate’ syndrome, and we found that disparity was highest in the ‘buzz‐bee’ syndrome. We conclude that the highly adaptive buzz‐pollination system may have prevented shifts towards classical pollination syndromes, but provided the starting point for the evolution of a novel set of distinct syndromes, all having retained multifunctional stamens that provide pollen expulsion, reward and attraction.","Dellinger, Agnes S.; Chartier, Marion; Fernández‐Fernández, Diana; Penneys, Darin S.; Alvear, Marcela; Almeda, Frank; Michelangeli, Fabián A.; Staedler, Yannick; Armbruster, W.

4411,Concurrency and reachability in treelike temporal networks,2019-12-10,"Network properties govern the rate and extent of various spreading processes, from simple contagions to complex cascades. Recently, the analysis of spreading processes has been extended from static networks to temporal networks, where nodes and links appear and disappear. We focus on the effects of accessibility, whether there is a temporally consistent path from one node to another, and reachability, the density of the corresponding accessibility graph representation of the temporal network. The level of reachability thus inherently limits the possible extent of any spreading process on the temporal network. We study reachability in terms of the overall levels of temporal concurrency between edges and the structural cohesion of the network agglomerating over all edges. We use simulation results and develop heterogeneous mean-field model predictions for random networks to better quantify how the properties of the underlying temporal network regulate reachability.","Lee, Eun; Emmons, Scott; Gibson, Ryan; Moody, James; Mucha, Peter J.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6989038/,319

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of different cell surface molecules on human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPEC) following viral infection, with special emphasis on those having immuneregulatory functions. • Methods: Cultured RPEC were infected with cytomegalovirus (CMV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) or herpes simplex virus type I (HSV). Double-staining fluorescence technique was used for visualization of virus infection and cell surface markers in the same cells by laser microscopy. • Results: CMV down-regulated MHC class I antigens on RPEC, whereas CVB and HSV did not alter MHC class I antigen expression. No induction of class 11 antigens was observed in RPEC infected with CVB, HSV or CMV. The intercellular adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (CD54) was strongly expressed in uninfected RPEC, and a slight increase was observed after virus infection. Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) was expressed in low amounts in both uninfected and infected RPEC. No expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2), E-selectin ELAM-1 or lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) was observed on RPEC before or after virus infection. • Conclusion: Down-modulation of immune-regulating cell surface antigens has been suggested to provide a means of long-term survival of viruses in the infected cell, favoring establishment of persistent infection. Our observation in cultured human RPEC indicates that this mechanism might indeed contribute to the development of disease affecting retinal tissue.","Larcher, Clara; Recheis, Heidrun; Sgonc, Roswitha; Göttinger, Wolfgang; Huemer, Hartwig P.; Irschick, Eveline U.",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7087854/,319

5203,Time evolution of non-lethal infectious diseases: a semi-continuous approach,2006-05-05,"Serious illnesses such as Ebola are often highly publicized in the mass media and can be associated with varying levels of anxiety and compensatory safety behavior (e.g., avoidance of air travel). The present study investigated psychological processes associated with Ebola-related anxiety and safety behaviors during the outbreak in late 2014. Between October 30 and December 3, 2014, which encompassed the peak of concerns and of the media’s attention to this particular outbreak, 107 university students completed a battery of measures assessing fear of Ebola, performance of safety behaviors, factual knowledge of the virus, and psychological variables hypothesized to predict Ebola-related fear. We found that while our sample was generally not very fearful of contracting Ebola, the fear of this disease was correlated with general distress, contamination cognitions, disgust sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety sensitivity-related physical concerns. Regression analyses further indicated that anxiety sensitivity related to physical concerns and the tendency to overestimate the severity of contamination were unique predictors of both Ebola fear and associated safety behaviors. Implications for how concerns over serious illness outbreaks can be conceptualized and clinically managed are discussed.","Blakey, Shannon M.; Reuman, Lillian; Jacoby, Ryan J.; Abramowitz, Jonathan S.",Cognit Ther Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7088101/,319

5957,First past the post,2003,"OBJECTIVE: To describe the time course of high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis. DESIGN: Retrospective charts review. SETTING: A tertiary paediatric intensive care unit. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Infants with respiratory failure due to RSV infection. INTERVENTION: HFOV. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Pattern of lung disease, ventilatory settings, blood gases, infant’s vital parameters, sedation and analgesia during the periods of conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV, 6 infants), after initiation of HFOV (HFOVi, 9 infants), in the middle of its course (HFOVm), at the end (HFOVe) and after extubation (Post-Extub) were compared. All infants showed a predominant overexpanded lung pattern. Mean airway pressure was raised from a mean (SD) 12.5 (2.0) during CMV to 18.9 (2.7) cmH(2)O during HFOVi (P < 0.05), then decreased to 11.1(1.3) at HFOVe (P < 0.05). Mean FiO(2) was reduced from 0.68 (0.18) (CMV) to 0.59 (0.14) (HFOVi) then to 0.29 (0.06) (P < 0.05) at HFOVe and mean peak to peak pressure from 44.9 (12.4) cmH(2)O (HFOVi) to 21.1 (7.7) P < 0.05 (HFOVe) while mean (SD) PaCO(2) showed a trend to decrease from 72 (22) (CMV) to 47 (8) mmHg (HFVOe) and mean infants respiratory rate a trend to increase from 20 (11) (HFOVi) to 34 (14) (HFOVe) breaths/min. With usual doses of sedatives and opiates, no infant was paralysed and all were extubated to CPAP or supplemental oxygen after a mean of 120 h.

5970,Fear of human pandemic grows as bird flu sweeps through Asia,2004,"PURPOSE: To determine clinical predictors associated with corticosteroid administration and its association with ICU mortality in critically ill patients with severe influenza pneumonia. METHODS: Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of critically ill patients with confirmed influenza pneumonia admitted to 148 ICUs in Spain between June 2009 and April 2014. Patients who received corticosteroid treatment for causes other than viral pneumonia (e.g., refractory septic shock and asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] exacerbation) were excluded. Patients with corticosteroid therapy were compared with those without corticosteroid therapy. We use a propensity score (PS) matching analysis to reduce confounding factors. The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Cox proportional hazards and competing risks analysis was performed to assess the impact of corticosteroids on ICU mortality. RESULTS: A total of 1846 patients with primary influenza pneumonia were enrolled. Corticosteroids were administered in 604 (32.7%) patients, with methylprednisolone the most frequently used corticosteroid (578/604 [95.7%]). The median daily dose was equivalent to 80 mg of methylprednisolone (IQR 60–120) for a median duration of 7 days (IQR 5–10). Asthma, COPD, hematological disease, and the need for mechanical ventilation were independently associated with corticosteroid use. Crude ICU mortality was higher in patients who received corticosteroids (27.5%) than in patients who did not receive corticosteroids (18.8%, p < 0.001). After PS matching, corticosteroid use was associated with ICU mortality in the Cox (HR = 1.32 [95% CI 1.08–1.60], p < 0.006) and competing risks analysis (SHR = 1.37 [95% CI 1.12–1.68], p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Administration of corticosteroids in patients with severe influenza pneumonia is associated with increased ICU mortality, and these agents should not be used as co-adjuvant therapy.

6432,Global dynamics for a class of discrete SEIRS epidemic models with general nonlinear incidence,2016-05-06,"BACKGROUND: Public health surveillance is based on the continuous and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. This informs the development of early warning systems to monitor epidemics and documents the impact of intervention measures. The introduction of digital data sources, and specifically sources available on the internet, has impacted the field of public health surveillance. New opportunities enabled by the underlying availability and scale of internet-based sources (IBSs) have paved the way for novel approaches for disease surveillance, exploration of health communities, and the study of epidemic dynamics. This field and approach is also known as infodemiology or infoveillance. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to assess research findings regarding the application of IBSs for public health surveillance (infodemiology or infoveillance). To achieve this, we have presented a comprehensive systematic literature review with a focus on these sources and their limitations, the diseases targeted, and commonly applied methods. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted targeting publications between 2012 and 2018 that leveraged IBSs for public health surveillance, outbreak forecasting, disease characterization, diagnosis prediction, content analysis, and health-topic identification. The search results were filtered according to previously defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Spanning a total of 162 publications, we determined infectious diseases to be the preferred case study (108/162, 66.7%). Of the eight categories of IBSs (search queries, social media, news, discussion forums, websites, web encyclopedia, and online obituaries), search queries and social media were applied in 95.1% (154/162) of the reviewed publications. We also identified limitations in representativeness and biased user age groups, as well as high susceptibility to media events by search queries, social media, and web encyclopedias. CONCLUSIONS: IBSs are a valuable proxy to study illnesses affecting the general population; however, it is important to characterize which diseases are best suited for the available sources; the literature shows that the level of engagement among online platforms can be a potential indicator. There is a necessity to understand the population’s online behavior; in addition, the exploration of health information dissemination and its content is significantly unexplored. With this information, we can understand how the population communicates about illnesses online and, in the process, benefit public health.","Barros, Joana M; Duggan, Jim; Rebholz-Schuhmann, Dietrich",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101503/,319
7564,Variability of contact process in complex networks,2011-12-07,"We study changes in the bifurcations of seasonally driven compartmental epidemic models, where the transmission rate is modulated temporally. In the presence of periodic modulation of the transmission rate, the dynamics varies from periodic to chaotic. The route to chaos is typically through period doubling bifurcation. There are coexisting attractors for some sets of parameters. However in the presence of quasiperiodic modulation, tori are created in place of periodic orbits and chaos appears via finite torus doublings. Strange nonchaotic attractors (SNAs) are created at the boundary of chaotic and torus dynamics. Multistability is found to be reduced as a function of quasiperiodic modulation strength. It is argued that occurrence of SNAs gives an opportunity of asymptotic predictability of epidemic growth even when the underlying dynamics is strange.","Bilal, Shakir; Singh, Brajendra K.; Prasad, Awadhesh; Michael, Edwin",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112454/,319

In this paper, we systematically study how the recovery rate affects the susceptible-infected-removed spreading dynamics on complex networks, where synchronous and asynchronous updating processes are taken into account. We derive the theoretical effective epidemic threshold and final outbreak size based on the edge-based compartmental theory. To validate the proposed theoretical predictions, extensive numerical experiments are implemented by using asynchronous and synchronous updating methods. When asynchronous updating method is used in simulations, recovery rate does not affect the final state of spreading dynamics. But with synchronous updating, we find that the effective epidemic threshold decreases with recovery rate, and final outbreak size increases with recovery rate. A good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the numerical results are observed on both synthetic and real-world networks. Our results extend the existing theoretical studies and help us to understand the phase transition with arbitrary recovery rate.","Shu, Panpan; Wang, Wei; Tang, Ming; Zhao, Pengcheng; Zhang, Yi-Cheng",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112458/,319

In real networks, the dependency relations between networks are neither identical nor completely random. Thus in this paper, we study the influence of randomness for dependency maps on the robustness of interdependent lattice networks. We introduce approximate entropy(ApEn) as the measure of randomness of the dependency maps. We find that there is critical ApEn(c) below which the percolation is continuous, but for larger ApEn, it is a first-order transition. With the increment of ApEn, the p(c) increases until ApEn reaching [Formula: see text] and then remains almost constant. The time scale of the system shows rich properties as ApEn increases. Our results uncover that randomness is one of the important factors that lead to cascading failures of spatially interdependent networks.","Yuan, Jing; Li, Lixiang; Peng, Haipeng; Kurths, Jürgen; Xiao, Jinghua; Yang, Yixian",Chaos,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112464/,319

We also find that there exists a mobility rate threshold q(c). The epidemic will survive when q > q(c) and die when q < q(c).

7581,Cooperative spreading processes in multiplex networks,2016-06-14,"In a feeding trial, sows and piglets were fed with the probiotic bacterium Bacillus cereus var. toyoi as a feed additive, and the effects on immune cell populations were examined. The development of the gut immune system was determined for piglets at the ages of 14, 28, 35 and 56 days post partum. Tissue samples of the Jejunum and the continuous Peyer's patch were used for enumeration of intraepithelial lymphocyte populations by fluorescence activated flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Both independent methods of investigation led to similar results: the population of intraepithelial CD8+ T cells was significantly enhanced in the probiotic group piglets (p ≤ 0.05), and the numbers of γδ T cells tended to be higher in the intestinal epithelium (p < 0.1) at the time of weaning (day 28). Lamina propria lymphocytes were also influenced by the treatment. Application of B. cereus var. toyoi resulted in significantly more CD25+ lymphocytes and γδ T cells in the probiotic group post-weaning. The occurrence of pathogenic Escherichia coli serogroups was also less frequent in the feces of piglets from the probiotic group. The finding that the CD8+ T cell population in the intestinal mucosa showed changes on day 28 indicated that the influence of B. cereus var. toyoi supplementation on the intestinal immune system started before weaning, an observation supported by changes in the intestinal microflora observed during the suckling-period. The results suggest that feeding of B. cereus var. toyoi to sows may result in beneficial effects on piglet health status independent of their feed supplementation.","Scharek, L.; Altherr, B.J.; Tölke, C.; Schmidt, M.F.G.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7112577/,319
7618,Impact of degree heterogeneity on the behavior of trapping in Koch networks,2010-11-10,"Mechanical ventilation practices in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have progressed with a growing understanding of the disease pathophysiology. Paramount to the care of affected patients is the delivery of lung-protective mechanical ventilation which prioritizes tidal volume and plateau pressure limitation. Lung protection can probably be further enhanced by scaling target tidal volumes to the specific respiratory mechanics of individual patients. The best procedure for selecting optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS remains uncertain; several relevant issues must be considered when selecting PEEP, particularly lung recruitability. Noninvasive ventilation must be used with caution in ARDS as excessively high respiratory drive can further exacerbate lung injury; newer modes of delivery offer promising approaches in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Airway pressure release ventilation offers an alternative approach to maximize lung recruitment and oxygenation, but clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit of this mode over conventional ventilation strategies. Rescue therapy with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is an important option in refractory hypoxemia.

METHOD: This prospective cohort analysis allowed us to collect data on infections among 70 consecutive recipients of haplo‐HSCT affected by various hematologic malignancies. RESULTS: After a median follow‐up of 23 months, cumulative incidence of viral infections was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI] 59–81) at 100 days and 77% (95% CI 67–87) at 1 year; 35 of 65 patients at risk had CMV reactivation (54%) and the rate of polyomavirus‐virus‐associated cystitis was 19% (13/70). Cumulative incidence of bacterial and fungal infections at 1 year were 63% (95% CI 51–75) and 12% (95% CI 4–19), respectively. Of note, only 1 invasive fungal infection occurred beyond 1 year after transplant (day +739). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, despite a high rate of viral infections in the early period, present data suggest a satisfactory infectious profile after T‐cell replete haplo‐HSCT using post‐transplant Cy.

10595,A Strategic Plan for Strengthening America’s Families: A Brief from the Coalition of Behavioral Science Organizations,2020-04-28,"BACKGROUND: Reduced response to hepatitis B vaccines is associated with aging, confounding and comorbid conditions, as well as inadvertent subcutaneous (SC) inoculation. We hypothesized that the antibody and T cell-mediated immune responses (T-CMI) of elderly adults to a vaccine intended for intramuscular (IM) administration would be attenuated when deposited into SC fat, independent of confounding conditions. RESULTS: Fifty-two healthy, community dwelling elderly adults (65–82 years), seronegative for HBV, were enrolled in the SENIEUR protocol as a strictly healthy population. These seniors were randomized to receive a licensed alum-adjuvanted recombinant HBV vaccine either SC or IM, with the inoculum site verified by imaging. The response rates, defined as hepatitis B surface antibodies (HBsAb) ≥10 IU/L, were significantly lower in the elderly than in young adults, a group of 12, healthy, 21–34-year-old volunteers. Moreover, elderly participants who received the vaccine IM were significantly more likely to be responders than those immunized SC (54% versus 16%, p = 0.008). The low seroconversion rate in the IM group progressively declined with increasing age, and responders had significantly lower HBsAb titers and limited isotype responses. Moreover, T-CMI (proliferation and cytokine production) were significantly reduced in both percentage of responders and intensity of the response for both Th1 and Th2 subsets in the elderly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate the blunted immunogenicity of SC inoculation as measured by peak titers and response rates. Further, the qualitative and quantitative deficits in B- and T-CMI responses to primary alum adjuvanted protein antigens persisted even in strictly healthy elderly populations with verified IM placement compared to younger populations.

10895,Sampling methods for the quasistationary regime of epidemic processes on regular and complex networks,2016-10-14,"The spread of an infectious disease can, in some cases, promote the propagation of other pathogens favoring violent outbreaks, which cause a discontinuous transition to an endemic state. The topology of the contact network plays a crucial role in these cooperative dynamics. We consider a susceptible-infected-removed-type model with two mutually cooperative pathogens: An individual already infected with one disease has an increased probability of getting infected by the other. We present a heterogeneous mean-field theoretical approach to the coinfection dynamics on generic uncorrelated power-law degree-distributed networks and validate its results by means of numerical simulations. We show that, when the second moment of the degree distribution is finite, the epidemic transition is continuous for low cooperativity, while it is discontinuous when cooperativity is sufficiently high. For scale-free networks, i.e., topologies with diverging second moment, the transition is instead always continuous. In this way we clarify the effect of heterogeneity and system size on the nature of the transition, and we validate the physical interpretation about the origin of the discontinuity.","Cui, Peng-Bi; Colaiori, Francesca; Castellano, Claudio",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217514/,319
10899,Efficiency of prompt quarantine measures on a susceptible-infected-removed model in networks,2017-08-11,"We investigate three aspects of the importance of nodes with respect to susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) disease dynamics: influence maximization (the expected outbreak size given a set of seed nodes), the effect of vaccination (how much deleting nodes would reduce the expected outbreak size), and sentinel surveillance (how early an outbreak could be detected with sensors at a set of nodes). We calculate the exact expressions of these quantities, as functions of the SIR parameters, for all connected graphs of three to seven nodes. We obtain the smallest graphs where the optimal node sets are not overlapping. We find that (i) node separation is more important than centrality for more than one active node, (ii) vaccination and influence maximization are the most different aspects of importance, and (iii) the three aspects are more similar when the infection rate is low.","Holme, Petter",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217518/,319
10909,Epidemic spreading on activity-driven networks with attractiveness,2017-10-26,"The study of complex networks, and in particular of social networks, has mostly concentrated on relational networks, abstracting the distance between nodes. Spatial networks are, however, extremely relevant in our daily lives, and a large body of research exists to show that the distances between nodes greatly influence the cost and probability of establishing and maintaining a link. A random geometric graph (RGG) is the main type of synthetic network model used to mimic the statistical properties and behavior of many social networks. We propose a model, called REDS, that extends energy-constrained RGGs to account for the synergic effect of sharing the cost of a link with our neighbors, as is observed in real relational networks. We apply both the standard Watts-Strogatz rewiring procedure and another method that conserves the degree distribution of the network. The second technique was developed to eliminate unwanted forms of spatial correlation between the degree of nodes that are affected by rewiring, limiting the effect on other properties such as clustering and assortativity. We analyze both the statistical properties of these two network types and their epidemiological behavior when used as a substrate for a standard susceptible-infected-susceptible compartmental model. We consider and discuss the differences in properties and behavior between RGGs and REDS as rewiring increases and as infection parameters are changed. We report considerable differences both between the network types and, in the case of REDS, between the two rewiring schemes. We conclude that REDS represent, with the application of these rewiring mechanisms, extremely useful and interesting tools in the study of social and epidemiological phenomena in synthetic complex networks.","Iotti, Bryan; Antonioni, Alberto; Bullock, Seth; Darabos, Christian; Tomassini, Marco; Giacobini, Mario",Phys Rev E,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217528/,319

Current asthma medications are ineffective in treating fibrosis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the mitochondrial phenotype in fibroblasts isolated from airway biopsies of non-asthmatic and severe asthmatic subjects by examining mitophagy as a mechanism contributing to fibroblast persistence and thereby, fibrosis in severe asthma. METHODS: Bioinformatics analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data was performed to identify the top enriched pathways in asthmatic fibroblasts. Endogenous expression of mitophagy markers in severe asthmatic and non-asthmatic fibroblasts was determined using qRT-PCR, western blot and immunofluorescence. Mitophagy flux was examined by using lysosomal protease inhibitors, E64d and pepstatin A. Mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity were also evaluated using JC-1 assay and MTT assay, respectively. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis revealed the enrichment of Pink/Parkin-mediated mitophagy in asthmatic fibroblasts compared to healthy controls. In severe asthmatic fibroblasts, the differential expression of mitophagy genes, PINK1 and PRKN, was accompanied by the accumulation of PINK1, Parkin and other mitophagy proteins at baseline. The further accumulation of endogenous LC3BII, p62 and PINK1 in the presence of E64d and pepstatin A in severe asthmatic fibroblasts reinforced their enhanced mitophagy flux. Significantly reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and metabolic activity were also demonstrated at baseline confirming the impairment in mitochondrial function in severe asthmatic fibroblasts. Interestingly, these fibroblasts displayed neither an apoptotic nor senescent phenotype but a pro-fibrotic phenotype with an adaptive survival mechanism triggered by increased AMPKα phosphorylation and mitochondrial biogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated a role for mitophagy in the pathogenesis of severe asthma where the enhanced turnover of damaged mitochondria may contribute to fibrosis in severe asthma by promoting the persistence and pro-fibrotic phenotype of fibroblasts.","Ramakrishnan, Rakhee K.; Bajbouj, Khuloud; Hachim, Mahmood Y.; Mogas, Andrea K.; Mahboub, Bassam; Olivenstein, Ronald; Hamoudi, Rifat; Halwani, Rabih; Hamid, Qutayba",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7704010/,319
14536,A Review of Cyber-Ranges and Test-Beds: Current and Future Trends,2020-12-13,"(1) Background: The management of multiple chronic diseases challenges China’s health system, but current research has neglected how multimorbidity is associated with poor health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and high health service demands by middle-aged and older adults. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Shandong province, China in 2018 across three age groups: Middle-aged (45 to 59 years), young-old (60 to 74 years), and old-old (75 or above years). The information about socio-economic, health-related behaviors, HRQOL, and health service utilization was collected via face-to-face structured questionnaires. The EQ-5D-3L instrument, comprising a health description system and a visual analog scale (VAS), was used to measure participants’ HRQOL, and χ(2) tests and the one-way ANOVA test were used to analyze differences in socio-demographic factors and HRQOL among the different age groups. Logistic regression models estimated the associations between lifestyle factors, health service utilization, and multimorbidity across age groups. (3) Results: There were 17,867 adults aged 45 or above in our sample, with 9259 (51.82%) female and 65.60% living in rural areas. Compared with the middle-aged adults, the young-old and old-old were more likely to be single and to have a lower level of education and income, with the old-old having lower levels than the young-old (P < 0.001). We found that 2465 (13.80%) suffered multimorbidities of whom 75.21% were older persons (aged 60 or above). As age increased, both the mean values of EQ-5D utility and the VAS scale decreased, displaying an inverse trend to the increase in the number of chronic diseases (P < 0.05). Ex-smokers and physical check-ups for middle or young-old respondents and overweight/obesity for all participants (P < 0.05) were positively correlated with multimorbidity. Drinking within the past month for all participants (P < 0.001), and daily tooth-brushing for middle (P < 0.05) and young-old participants (P < 0.001), were negatively associated with multimorbidity. Multimorbidities increased service utilization including outpatient and inpatient visits and taking self-medicine; and the probability of health utilization was the lowest for the old-old multimorbid patients (P < 0.001). (4) Conclusions: The prevalence and decline in HRQOL of multimorbid middle-aged and older-aged people were severe in Shandong province. Old patients also faced limited access to health services. We recommend early prevention and intervention to address the prevalence of middle-aged and old-aged multimorbidity. Further, the government should set-up special treatment channels for multiple chronic disease sufferers, improve medical insurance policies for the older-aged groups, and set-up multiple chronic disease insurance to effectively alleviate the costs of medical utilization caused by economic pressure for outpatients and inpatients with chronic diseases.","Zhao, Qinfeng; Wang, Jian; Nicholas, Stephen; Maitland, Elizabeth; Sun, Jingjie; Jiao, Chen; Xu, Lizheng; Leng, Anli",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7764479/,319
14796,Call on me! Undergraduates’ perceptions of voluntarily asking and answering questions in front of large-enrollment science classes,2021-01-12,"INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Multiple lymphomatous polyposis (MLP) is a distinctive and rare entity of primary gastrointestinal (GI) lymphoma characterized by polypoid lymphomatous tissue in long segments of the gut and a strong tendency for spread throughout the GI tract. Although many cases of MLP presenting as intussusceptions in adults have been reported, we report a rare case of multiple recurrent intussusceptions due to MLP associated with high-grade Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the entire GI tract in a 15-year-old child. CASE PRESENTATION: A 15-year-old child previously operated for acute intestinal obstruction, presented with intermittent abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis of multiple small bowel intussusceptions. Patient was treated by exploratory laparotomy and multiple resection anastomosis. Histopathology confirmed the diagnosis of MLP due to DLBCL. The patient received chemotherapy following surgery. So far, at 6 months of follow-up, Patient is doing well. CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Malignant tumors of the small intestine are unusual, with non-specific clinical presentation. Although ultrasound (US), CT, FDG-PET/CT and endoscopic evaluation are essential modalities for the diagnosis of intestinal polyposis. Final diagnosis of MLP can only be confirmed after histopathological examination and immunohistochemistry studies. Surgical resection followed by appropriate chemotherapy is the treatment of choice. CONCLUSIONS: MLP due to DLBCL has rarely been described in young patients under the age of 18 years. We should keep a high index of suspicion for malignant GI lymphoma in cases of intussusception, especially in older children.","Sharma, Kapil Dev; Massey, Ashish V.; Vijayvargiya, Manish; Jain, Sundeep",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7808902/,319
15400,Human Exposure to Chlorinated Paraffins via Inhalation and Dust Ingestion in a Norwegian Cohort,2021-01-05,"BACKGROUND: Infant immunization coverage worldwide has plateaued at about 85%. Using existing survey data to conduct analyses beyond estimating coverage may help immunization programmes better tailor strategies to reach un- and under-immunized children. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey (MICS), routinely conducted in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), collect immunization data, yet vaccination coverage is often the only indicator reported and used. We conducted a review of published immunization-related analyses to characterize and quantify immunization secondary analyses done using DHS and MICS databases. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the literature, of immunization-related secondary analyses from DHS or MICS published between 2006 and August 2018. We searched 15 electronic databases without language restrictions. For the articles included, relevant information was extracted and analyzed to summarize the characteristics of immunization-related secondary analyses. Results are presented following the PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Among 1411 papers identified, 115 met our eligibility criteria; additionally, one article was supplemented by the Pan American Health Organization. The majority were published since 2012 (77.6%), and most (68.9%) had a first or corresponding author affiliated with institutions in high-income countries (as opposed to LMICs where these surveys are conducted). The median delay between survey implementation and publication of the secondary analysis was 5.4 years, with papers with authors affiliated to institutions in LMIC having a longer median publication delay (p < 0.001). Over 80% of the published analyses looked at factors associated with a specific vaccine or with full immunization. Quality proxies, such as reporting percent of immunization data from cards vs recall; occurrence and handling of missing data; whether survey analyses were weighted; and listing of potential biases or limitations of the original survey or analyses, were infrequently mentioned. CONCLUSION: Our review suggests that more needs to be done to increase the increase the utilization of existing DHS and MICS datasets and improve the quality of the analyses to inform immunization programmes. This would include increasing the proportion of analyses done in LMICs, reducing the time lag between survey implementation and publication of additional analyses, and including more qualitative information about the survey in the publications to better interpret the results.

METHODS: Cross-sectional, web survey-based experiment using a national sample of 1226 United States adults. Participants read identical descriptions about infertility, with the exception of random assignment to infertility being labeled as a “condition,” “disease,” or “disability.” Participants then responded to questions measuring their beliefs and attitudes towards policies related to the diagnosis and treatment of infertility. We measured public support for infertility policies, public preference for infertility labels, and whether support differed by the randomly assigned label used. We also queried associations between demographic data and support for infertility policies. RESULTS: Support was higher for insurance coverage of infertility treatments (p=.014) and fertility preservation (p=.017), and infertility public assistance programs (p=.036) when infertility was described as a “disease” or “disability” compared to “condition.” Participants who were younger, were planning or trying to conceive, had a family member or friend with infertility, and/or had a more liberal political outlook were more likely to support infertility policies. A majority of participants (78%) felt the term “condition” was the best label to describe infertility, followed by “disability” (12%). The least popular label was “disease” (10%). Those preferring “condition” were older (p<.001), more likely to be non-Hispanic White (p=.046), and less likely to have an infertility diagnosis (p<.001). CONCLUSION: While less commonly identified as the best descriptors of infertility, labeling infertility as a “disease” or “disability” may increase support for policies that improve access to infertility care SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s10815-021-02231-z.","Mancuso, Abigail C.; Summers, Karen M.; Chung, Rebecca; Ryan, Ginny L.; Scherer, Aaron M.",J Assist Reprod Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8149289/,319

METHODS: We retrospectively recruited patients hospitalised with viral pneumonia from six academic hospitals in China between August 2016 and December 2019. We measured the prevalence of comorbidities, coinfections, nosocomial infections, and in-hospital mortalities. RESULTS: Of the 806 patients, 370 were immunocompromised and 436 were immunocompetent. The disease severity and in-hospital mortality of immunocompromised patients were higher than those of immunocompetent patients. During the influenza season, an increased number of cases of influenza virus (IFV) infection were found in the immunocompromised group, followed by cases of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. During the non-influenza season, CMV was the main virus detected in the immunocompromised group, while RSV, adenovirus (AdV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), and rhinovirus (HRV) were the main viruses detected in the immunocompetent group. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii (22.4%), Aspergillus spp. (14.1%), and bacteria (13.8%) were the most frequently observed coinfections in immunocompromised patients but not in immunocompetent patients (Aspergillus spp. [10.8%], bacteria [7.1%], and Mycoplasma spp. [5.3%]). CMV infection and infection with two-or-more viruses were associated with a higher in-hospital mortality rate than non-IFV infection. However, patients with IFV and non-IFV infection in immunocompromised patients had similar disease severity and prognosis. CONCLUSIONS: Immunocompromised patients have a high frequency of coinfections, and a higher mortality rate was observed among those infected with CMV and two-or-more viruses. In addition, patients with IFV and non-IFV infection in immunocompromised patients had similar same disease severity and prognosis. The type of viral infection varied with seasons.

The changing epidemiology of pneumonia requires up-to-date data to guide both case management and prevention programs. The Gambia study site contributed a high child mortality, high pneumonia incidence, low HIV prevalence, Haemophilus influenzae type b and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines-vaccinated rural West African setting to the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) Study. METHODS: The PERCH study was a 7-country case-control study of the etiology of hospitalized severe pneumonia in children 1–59 months of age in low and middle-income countries. Culture and nucleic acid detection methods were used to test nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs, blood, induced sputum and, in selected cases, lung or pleural fluid aspirates. Etiology was determined by integrating case and control data from multiple specimens using the PERCH integrated analysis based on Bayesian probabilistic methods. RESULTS: At The Gambia study site, 638 cases of World Health Organization-defined severe and very severe pneumonia (286 of which were chest radiograph [CXR]-positive and HIV-negative) and 654 age-frequency matched controls were enrolled. Viral causes predominated overall (viral 58% vs. bacterial 28%), and of CXR-positive cases respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounted for 37%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 13% and parainfluenza was responsible for 9%. Nevertheless, among very severe cases bacterial causes dominated (77% bacterial vs. 11% viral), led by S. pneumoniae (41%); Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not included in “bacterial”, accounted for 9%. 93% and 80% of controls ≥1 year of age were, respectively, fully vaccinated for age against Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Viral causes, notably RSV, predominated in The Gambia overall, but bacterial causes dominated the severest cases. Efforts must continue to prevent disease by optimizing access to existing vaccines, and to develop new vaccines, notably against RSV. A continued emphasis on appropriate case management of severe pneumonia remains important.","Howie, Stephen R.

Their extensive regulatory activity in the CNS continues on a small scale, from the functions of synapses to large-scale neurodevelopment and cognitive functions, aging, and can be seen in both health and disease situations. One of the vast consequences of the pathological role of dysregulated lncRNAs in the CNS due to their role in a network of regulatory pathways can be manifested in Alzheimer's as a neurodegenerative disease. The disease is characterized by two main hallmarks: amyloid plaques due to the accumulation of β-amyloid components and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) resulting from the accumulation of phosphorylated tau. Numerous studies in humans, animal models, and various cell lines have revealed the role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. This scoping review was performed with a six-step strategy and based on the Prisma guideline by systematically searching the publications of seven databases. Out of 1,591 records, 69 articles were utterly aligned with the specified inclusion criteria and were summarized in the relevant table. Most of the studies were devoted to BACE1-AS, NEAT1, MALAT1, and SNHG1 lncRNAs, respectively, and about one-third of the studies investigated a unique lncRNA. About 56% of the studies reported up-regulation, and 7% reported down-regulation of lncRNAs expressions. Overall, this study was conducted to investigate the association between lncRNAs and Alzheimer's disease to make a reputable source for further studies and find more molecular therapeutic goals for this disease.","Asadi, Mohammad Reza; Hassani, Mehdi; Kiani, Shiva; Sabaie, Hani; Moslehian, Marziyeh Sadat; Kazemi, Mohammad; Ghafouri-Fard, Soudeh; Taheri, Mohammad; Rezazadeh, Maryam",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8490871/,319
22099,"Fokus Beatmung, Sauerstofftherapie und Weaning: Intensivmedizinische Studien aus 2020/2021",2021-10-06,"BACKGROUND: Diaphragm atrophy and dysfunction is a major problem among critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction is thought to play a major role, resulting in a failure of weaning. Stimulation of the phrenic nerves and resulting diaphragm contraction could potentially prevent or treat this atrophy. The subject of this study is to determine the effectiveness of diaphragm stimulation in preventing atrophy by measuring changes in its thickness. METHODS: A total of 12 patients in the intervention group and 10 patients in the control group were enrolled. Diaphragm thickness was measured by ultrasound in both groups at the beginning of study enrollment (hour 0), after 24 hours, and at study completion (hour 48). The obtained data were then statistically analyzed and both groups were compared. RESULTS: The results showed that the baseline diaphragm thickness in the interventional group was (1.98 ± 0.52) mm and after 48 hours of phrenic nerve stimulation increased to (2.20 ± 0.45) mm (p=0.001). The baseline diaphragm thickness of (2.00 ± 0.33) mm decreased in the control group after 48 hours of mechanical ventilation to (1.72 ± 0.20) mm (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that induced contraction of the diaphragm by pacing the phrenic nerve not only reduces the rate of its atrophy during mechanical ventilation but also leads to an increase in its thickness – the main determinant of the muscle strength required for spontaneous ventilation and successful ventilator weaning.

One of the most studied systems is the N-linked glycosylation pathway in the synthesis of secreted glycoproteins (Schrag et al. 2003). The N-linked glycoproteins are subjected to diverse modifications and are transported through ER and Golgi apparatus to their final destinations in- and outside the cell. Incorporation of cargo glycoproteins into transport vesicles is mediated by transmembrane cargo receptors, which have been identified as intracellular lectins. For example, mannose 6-phosphate receptors (Ghosh et al. 2003) function as a cargo receptor for lysosomal proteins in the trans-Golgi network, whereas ERGIC-53 (Zhang et al. 2003) and its yeast orthologs Emp46/47p (Sato and Nakano 2002) are transport lectins for glycoproteins that are transported out of ER.","Gupta, G.

It also reveals the spread of an infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on Epstein’s model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccine stocks, antiviral medicine stocks, the number of medical staff to infection control measures and so on. Furthermore, infectious simulation of Ebola haemorrhagic fever and Zika fever, which have not yet any effective vaccine, is also implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine, antiviral medicine stocks and the number of medical staff are crucial factors to prevent the spread. In addition, a modern city is vulnerable to Zika fever due to commuting by train.","Kurahashi, Setsuya",Agent and Multi-Agent Systems: Technology and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121695/,319

Understanding their co-evolution is critical for designing public policies and decision support for disaster planning. For example, human behaviors and day to day activities of individuals create dense social interactions that are characteristic of modern urban societies. These dense social networks provide a perfect fabric for fast, uncontrolled disease propagation. Conversely, people’s behavior in response to public policies and their perception of how the crisis is unfolding as a result of disease outbreak can dramatically alter the normally stable social interactions. Effective planning and response strategies must take these complicated interactions into account. In this chapter, we describe a computer simulation based approach to study these issues using public health and computational epidemiology as an illustrative example. We also formulate game-theoretic and stochastic optimization problems that capture many of the problems that we study empirically.","Barrett, Christopher L.; Bisset, Keith; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Eubank, Stephen; Lewis, Bryan; Kumar, V.

It has become increasingly clear that changes in the existing health care system will not be sufficient to maintain and improve our health at this historical juncture. Both our extensive knowledge on what creates health as well as the exponentially rising rates of chronic disease obesity, and mental health problems indicate that we need to shift course and apply a radically new mind-set to health and health policy. This is what we mean by policy innovations for health. The boundaries of what we call the “health system” are becoming increasingly fluid and health has become integral to how we live our everyday life. Health itself has become a major economic and social driving force in society. This shifts the pressure for policy innovation from a focus on the existing health system to a reorganization of how we approach health in 21st century societies. The dynamics of the health society challenge the way we conceptualize and locate health in the policy arena and the mechanisms through which we conduct health policy. They also redefine who should be involved in the policy process. This concern is beginning to be addressed within government through Health in All Policy approaches and beyond government through new partnerships for health. Most importantly, the role of citizen and patient is being redefined – a development that will probably lead to the most significant of the policy innovations for health in the 21st century.","Kickbusch, Ilona",Policy Innovation for Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122768/,319

26140,Design of Real-time Systems for QoS,2010,"Vaccines are predominantly used for prevention; that means they should establish a protection in immunized people or animals which will protect them from a possible infection and the subsequent illness when they come into contact with the respective pathogens. Fundamentally, there are two kinds of immunization: active and passive. The latter is based on the administration of immunoglobulin preparations that can neutralize a specific virus. Therefore, passive vaccination is applied only in special cases, such as when the person to be protected recently had verifiable contact with a specific virus (postexposure prophylaxis), or if the risk of exposure to pathogens cannot be ruled out in the following weeks and an active vaccination is not possible, as in short-term planned trips to Third World countries (exposure prophylaxis). An example is the administration of antibodies specific for hepatitis B virus in cases of contamination with blood from people who have an acute or chronically persistent infection with this virus, and thus have high concentrations of infectious particles in the blood. Such accidents occur primarily in medical personnel by needlestick injury (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In certain cases, the administration is performed in combination with an active vaccination (active–passive immunization). Specific immunoglobulin preparations are also administered when people have been bitten by animals that may be infected with the rabies virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). In the case of early application (together with an active vaccination), the antibodies can neutralize the virus, and impede its spread in the body. Since the time between contact with the virus and its spread in the organism is often very short, passive immunization is limited to a period shortly before or after exposure to the infective agent (usually within 4 days). Therefore, it is reserved for cases in which the contact with the potential pathogen is well documented and the type of infection is known, and when an appropriate immunoglobulin preparation is available. The protection afforded by antibody preparations lasts just a few weeks, as immunoglobulins are rapidly degraded in the organism. Therefore, postexposure administration of active vaccines is increasingly preferred, e.g. in the context of outbreak-control vaccination. In veterinary medicine, passive immunization is employed occasionally in young animals which were born in a flock with high infection pressure. This approach is applied, for example, in kennels when infections occur with canine parvovirus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20). However, its value is controversial, as the immunoglobulins administered hinder the more advantageous active immunization.","Modrow, Susanne; Falke, Dietrich; Truyen, Uwe; Schätzl, Hermann",Molecular Virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122972/,319

There are a wide range of materials that have been known to prevent attachment and proliferation of microbes on material surfaces. These include antibiotics, metal ions and quaternary ammonium compounds.

Antimicrobial properties of nanomaterials have been explored to meet these challenges. Various nanomaterials including silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), titanium oxide nanoparticles and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been found to be highly effective bacterial-killing materials. The most well-known examples are silver and silver-based compounds, which were well known to be antiseptic to a spectrum of bacterium even in ancient times. AgNPs have proven to possess high antibacterial activity with minimal perturbation to human cells. Consequently, widespread applications of AgNPs have been found in medical and environmental areas [1]. More recently, carbon nanomaterials have emerged as a type of novel antibacterial nanomaterials, including CNTs and graphene.

The virus outbreak provoked public fear, which resulted in a mass reduction in transit use in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). Its effect differed among socioeconomic groups and geographical areas. A typical way to analyze this is to associate individual reactions to the disaster with socioeconomic characteristics. However, a more structured approach, which considers behavioral characteristics resulting from the societal position of an individual, would identify the basic reason for such associations. The study hypothesized that the degree of fixity that individuals have in their daily life may elucidate these associations. When fear is prevalent, people having the flexibility to change their lifestyle will make more changes in daily activities and travels. The study examined the influence of public fear of a pandemic disease on travel behavior and the effect of life fixity on individual response to the fear. To this end, smart card data of transit use and changes in travel behavior during the MERS period were examined. The study found that fear was powerful and influenced travel behavior differently depending on life fixity levels and regional characteristics.","Kim, Chansung; Cheon, Seung Hoon; Choi, Keechoo; Joh, Chang-Hyeon; Lee, Hyuk-Jin",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7149053/,319

Our laboratories have therefore modified the antiviral assays for IFN bioactivity and Nab, so that they are suitable for large‐scale screening in specialized laboratories. The read‐out is survival of a subcloned A549 cell line in the presence of an otherwise lethal amount of virus. Thus, survival increases in the presence of type 1 IFN and decreases in the presence of NAb against the IFN added to the cells. MxA is induced by type 1 IFN and can be used for measuring the Nab activity. In another assay, the MxA level in the A549 cell line is measured. In an attempt to find a new and better reporter gene for type 1 IFN than MxA and genes specific for either IFN‐α or ‐β, a micro array screen was carried using the U133A chip from Affymetrix. The expression of 22,000 genes can be studied simultaneous with this technology. The results will be presented at the conference.","Sønder, S. U. S.; Hedegaard, C.

31705,Nachrichten,2016-05-11,"This chapter focuses on Closteroviridae family whose member genuses are Closterovirus, Ampelovirus, and Crinivirus. The virions are helically constructed filaments with a pitch of the primary helix in the range of 3.4–3.8 nm, containing about 10 protein subunits per turn of the helix and showing a central hole of 3–4 nm. The very flexuous and open structure of the particles is the most conspicuous trait of members of the family. The virions have a diameter of about 12 nm and their length ranges from 650 nm in case of species with fragmented genome, to over 2000 nm in case of species with monopartite genome. The fragility of virions and a tendency to end-to-end aggregation contribute to the fact that a range of lengths is often given for single viruses. The virions of several species are degraded by CsCl and are unstable in high salt concentration, resist moderately high temperatures and organic solvents, but are sensitive to RNase and chelation. Regardless of the genome type, monopartite or fragmented, virions contain a single molecule of linear, positive sense, single stranded RNA, constituting 5–6% of the particle weight. The structural proteins of most members of the family consist of a major CP and of a diverged copy of it denoted minor CP (CPm), with a size ranging from 22 to 46 kDa (CP) and 23 to 80 kDa (CPm). The members of the family have one of the largest genomes among plant viruses because of sequence duplication and acquisition of nonviral coding sequences such as protease, and HSP70 protein via RNA recombination.",,Virus Taxonomy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173617/,319

32399,Ambities zorgverzekeraars blijven staan: Inkoopbeleid met een disclaimer,2020-05-22,"Arrhythmia detection by classifying ECG heartbeats is an important research topic for healthcare. Recently, deep learning models have been increasingly applied to ECG classification. Among them, most methods work in three steps: preprocessing, heartbeat segmentation and beat-wise classification. However, this methodology has two drawbacks. First, explicit heartbeat segmentation can undermine model simplicity and compactness. Second, beat-wise classification risks losing inter-heartbeat context information that can be useful to achieving high classification performance. Addressing these drawbacks, we propose a novel deep learning model that can simultaneously conduct heartbeat segmentation and classification. Compared to existing methods, our model is more compact as it does not require explicit heartbeat segmentation. Moreover, our model is more context-aware, for it takes into account the relationship between heartbeats. To achieve simultaneous segmentation and classification, we present a Faster R-CNN based model that has been customized to handle ECG data. To characterize inter-heartbeat context information, we exploit inverted residual blocks and a novel feature fusion subroutine that combines average pooling with max-pooling. Extensive experiments on the well-known MIT-BIH database indicate that our method can achieve competitive results for ECG segmentation and classification.","Qiu, Xi; Liang, Shen; Zhang, Yanchun",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206251/,319

The appearance of increasingly large corpora raises new challenges on the investigation of the large scale behavior of the n-gram frequency distributions, not typically emerging on small scale corpora. We propose an empirical model, based on the assumption of finite n-gram language vocabularies, to estimate the number of distinct n-grams in large corpora, as well as the sizes of the equal-frequency n-gram groups, which occur in the lower frequencies starting from 1. The model was validated for n-grams with [Formula: see text], by a wide range of real corpora in English and French, from 60 million up to 8 billion words. These are full non-truncated corpora data, that is, their associated frequency data include the entire range of observed n-gram frequencies, from 1 up to the maximum. The model predicts the monotonic growth of the numbers of distinct n-grams until reaching asymptotic plateaux when the corpus size grows to infinity. It also predicts the non-monotonicity of the sizes of the equal-frequency n-gram groups as a function of the corpus size.","Silva, Joaquim F.; Cunha, Jose C.",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206297/,319
32448,Impact of the distribution of recovery rates on disease spreading in complex networks,2020-01-14,"Retrieval on Cross-modal data has attracted extensive attention as it enables fast searching across various data sources, such as texts, images and videos. As one of the typical techniques for cross-model searching, hashing methods project features with high dimension into short-length hash codes, thus effectively improving storage and retrieval efficiency. Recently, many efforts have been made to widely study supervised methods with promising performance. However, there still remain some problems. Conventionally, hash codes and projection functions are learnt by preserving the pairwise similarities between data items, which neglects the discriminative property of class associated with each data item. Most of the existing methods that utilise class labels also undertake the binary codes learning under a classification frame. The relations between binary codes and labels have not been well considered. To tackle these problems, we propose a shallow supervised hash learning method – Semantics-reconstructing Cross-modal Hashing (SCH), which reconstructs semantic representation and learns the hash codes for the entire dataset jointly. For the semantic reconstruction, the learned semantic representation is projected back into label space, extracting more semantic information. By leveraging reconstructed semantic representations, the hash codes are learnt by considering the underlying correlations between labels, hash codes and original features, resulting in a further performance improvement. Moreover, SCH learns the hash codes and functions without relaxing the binary constraints simultaneously, therefore, it further reduces the quantization errors. In addition, the linear computational complexity of its training makes it practicable to big data. Extensive experiments show that the proposed SCH can perform better than the state-of-the-art baselines.","Zhang, Peng-Fei; Huang, Zi; Zhang, Zheng",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206300/,319
32463,"Effects of Network Structure, Competition and Memory Time on Social Spreading Phenomena",2016-05-13,"A popular model for detecting community structure in large graphs is the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The exact parameters to recover the community structure of a SBM has been well studied, and many methods have been proposed to recover a nodes’ community membership. A popular approach is to use spectral methods where the Graph Laplacian L of the given graph is created, and the Fiedler vector of the graph is found. This vector is then used to cluster nodes in the same community. While a robust method, it can be expensive to compute the Fiedler vector exactly. In this paper we examine the types of errors that can be tolerated using spectral methods while still recovering the communities. The two sources of error considered are: (i) dropping edges using different sparsification strategies; and (ii) inaccurately computing the eigenvectors. In this way, spectral clustering algorithms can be tuned to be far more efficient at detecting community structure for these community models.","Laeuchli, Jesse",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206315/,319

This success has suggested the application of the same approach to recurrent-state epidemics, for which an individual can contract the epidemic and recover repeatedly. The underlying assumption is that backtracking paths (i.e., an individual is reinfected by a neighbor he or she previously infected) do not play a relevant role. In this paper we show that this is not the case for recurrent-state epidemics since the neglect of backtracking paths leads to a formula for the epidemic threshold that is qualitatively incorrect in the large size limit. Moreover, we define a modified recurrent-state dynamics which explicitly forbids direct backtracking events and show that this modification completely upsets the phenomenology.","Castellano, Claudio; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7217544/,319

The aim was to explore how country attributes and circumstances affect SME assessments of the likelihood, impacts, and rankings of global risks, and to find out if SME risk assessment and rankings differ from the global rankings. Data were gathered using an online survey of manufacturing SMEs in Turkey. The results show that global economic risks and geopolitical risks are of major concern for SMEs, and environmental risks are at the bottom of their ranking. Among the economic risks, fiscal crises in key economies and high structural unemployment or underemployment were found to be the highest risks for the SMEs. Failure of regional or global governance, failure of national governance, and interstate conflict with regional consequences were found to be among the top geopolitical risks for the SMEs. The SMEs considered the risk of large-scale cyber-attacks and massive incident of data fraud/theft to be relatively higher than other global technological risks. Profound social instability and failure of urban planning were among the top societal risks for the SMEs. Although the global environmental and disaster risks were ranked lowest on the list, man-made environmental damage and disasters and major natural hazard-induced disasters were ranked the highest among this group of risks. Overall, the results show that SMEs at a country level, for example Turkey, perceive global risks differently than the major global players.","Asgary, Ali; Ozdemir, Ali Ihsan; Özyürek, Hale",Int J Disaster Risk Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223563/,319

Additionally, providing information about whether and how the software and the source code are available allows an assessment about the state and role of open source software in science in general. While such analyses can be done manually, large scale analyses require the application of automated methods of information extraction and linking. In this paper, we present SoftwareKG—a knowledge graph that contains information about software mentions from more than 51,000 scientific articles from the social sciences. A silver standard corpus, created by a distant and weak supervision approach, and a gold standard corpus, created by manual annotation, were used to train an LSTM based neural network to identify software mentions in scientific articles. The model achieves a recognition rate of .82 F-score in exact matches. As a result, we identified more than 133,000 software mentions. For entity disambiguation, we used the public domain knowledge base DBpedia. Furthermore, we linked the entities of the knowledge graph to other knowledge bases such as the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, the Software Ontology, and Wikidata.

RDF provides automation possibilities for semantic interpretation, which can lower the effort. We address the usage of RDF reasoning in large ontologies, and we test approaches for solving reasoning problems, having in mind use cases of low availability of computational resources. In our experiment, we designed and evaluated a method based on a reasoning problem of inferring Schema.org statements from cultural objects described in Wikidata. The method defines two intermediate tasks that reduce the volume of data used during the execution of the RDF reasoner, resulting in an efficient execution taking on average 10.3 ± 7.6 ms per RDF resource. The inferences obtained in the Wikidata test were analysed and found to be correct, and the computational resource requirements for reasoning were significantly reduced. Schema.org inference resulted in at least one rdf:type statement for each cultural resource, but the inference of Schema.org predicates was below expectations. Our experiment on cultural data has shown that Wikidata contains alignment statements to other ontologies used in the cultural domain, which with the application of RDF and OWL reasoning can be used to infer views of Wikidata expressed in cultural domain’s data models.","Freire, Nuno; Proença, Diogo",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256367/,319

Human blood plasma contains water, proteins, organic and in-organic substances including bacteria and viruses. Blood plasma can be effectively used to detect COVID-19 antibodies. The immune system generates antibodies (IgM/IgG proteins) in response to the virus and identification of these antibodies is related to the presence of the infection in the patient in the past.

From abstract multilevel description languages, Offsite automatically derives optimized, platform-specific and problem-specific code of possible variants and applies the performance model to these variants. We apply Offsite to parallel numerical methods for ordinary differential equations (ODEs).

In this paper, we introduce an analysis procedure for MTGL to allow for an on-the-fly analysis of finite/infinite TGSs. To this end, we introduce a further (optimistic) reduction of MTGL conditions, which leads to violations during the on-the-fly analysis only when non-satisfaction is guaranteed in the future whereas the former (pessimistic) reduction leads to violations when satisfaction is not guaranteed in the future. We motivate the relevance of our analysis procedure, which uses both reduction operations, by means of a running example. Finally, we discuss prototypical support in the tool AutoGraph.","Schneider, Sven; Sakizloglou, Lucas; Maximova, Maria; Giese, Holger",Graph Transformation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7314715/,319

The name of the tool derives from the annual Model-Checking Contest, a competition of model-checking tools that provides a large and diverse collection of PNML models. This choice in naming serves to underline the main focus of the tool, which is to provide an open and efficient solution that lowers the access cost for developers wanting to engage in this competition. We describe the architecture and functionalities of our tool and show how it compares with other existing solutions. Despite the fact that the problem we target is abundantly covered in the literature, we show that it is still possible to innovate. To substantiate this assertion, we put a particular emphasis on two distinctive features of MCC that have proved useful when dealing with some of the most challenging colored models in the contest.","Dal Zilio, Silvano",Application and Theory of Petri Nets and Concurrency,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324233/,319

This has been accomplished by carefully studying the structural restrictions of linear logic modalities. Examples of such refinements are subexponentials, light linear logic, and soft linear logic. We bring together these refinements of linear logic in a non-commutative setting. We introduce a non-commutative substructural system with subexponential modalities controlled by a minimalistic set of rules. Namely, we disallow the contraction and weakening rules for the exponential modality and introduce two primitive subexponentials. One of the subexponentials allows the multiplexing rule in the style of soft linear logic and light linear logic. The second subexponential provides the exchange rule. For this system, we construct a sequent calculus, establish cut elimination, and also provide a complete focused proof system. We illustrate the expressive power of this system by simulating Turing computations and categorial grammar parsing for compound sentences. Using the former, we prove undecidability results. The new system employs Lambek’s non-emptiness restriction, which is incompatible with the standard (sub)exponential setting. Lambek’s restriction is crucial for applications in linguistics: without this restriction, categorial grammars incorrectly mark some ungrammatical phrases as being correct.","Kanovich, Max; Kuznetsov, Stepan; Nigam, Vivek; Scedrov, Andre",Automated Reasoning,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7324242/,319

In recent years, many existing works have been proposed to handle the knowledge tracing task, particularly recurrent neural networks based methods, e.g., Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). However, DKT has the problem of vibration in prediction outputs. In this paper, to better understand the problem of DKT, we utilize a mathematical computation model named Finite State Automaton(FSA), which can change from one state to another in response to the external input, to interpret the hidden state transition of the DKT when receiving inputs. And we discover the root cause of the two problems is that the DKT can not handle the long sequence input with the help of FSA. Accordingly, we propose an effective attention-based model, which can solve the above problem by directly capturing the relationships among each item of the input regardless of the length of the input sequence. The experimental results show that our proposed model can significantly outperform state-of-the-art approaches on several well-known corpora.","Zhu, Jia; Yu, Weihao; Zheng, Zetao; Huang, Changqin; Tang, Yong; Fung, Gabriel Pui Cheong",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334689/,319

The Constructed Response Assessment Tool (CRAT) was used to analyze these responses across multiple dimensions of language and relate these textual features to comprehension performance. Results indicate that the linguistic features of post-reading explanatory retrievals were more predictive of comprehension outcomes than self-explanations.

As a first step in addressing this problem, we present a cognitive task analysis study that investigates how students without a mathematics-related background solve novel non-routine problems. We found that most students were able to identify the underlying pattern that yields the final solution in each problem. Furthermore, they tended to use various forms of visualization in their draft work, but occasionally made computational mistakes. Based on these results, we propose our plan for developing an instructional platform that leverages learning science principles to train students in problem-solving abilities.","Nguyen, Huy A.; Guo, Yuqing; Stamper, John; McLaren, Bruce M.",Artificial Intelligence in Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7334732/,319

Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up is an evidence-based early intervention that assesses fidelity during weekly supervision. Providers are first trained in the infant model, with toddler model training considered to be a separate, specialized opportunity. The current study examined changes in fidelity, measured by “in-the-moment” commenting, as providers moved from infant to toddler certification. An initial drop, with a subsequent increase, in commenting fidelity over the training year was expected. Results were consistent with our hypotheses, demonstrating a main effect of time, with most indices of commenting data initially decreasing and then increasing. These findings are consistent with research suggesting that fluctuation in fidelity is typical within community dissemination and suggests that ongoing supervision after the initial training is useful in facilitating successful skill development.","Flagg, Amanda; Costello, Amanda H.; Roben, Caroline K.

Prior to the crisis, there was an interdependence of trade and production for medical supplies, with advanced industrial countries like the United States and Germany specializing in the relatively high-tech medical devices sector, while low-cost production hubs such as China and Malaysia were leading producers of less technologically sophisticated personal protective equipment (PPE) products such as face masks, surgical gloves, and medical gowns. After the COVID-19 outbreak, global shortages of PPE products emerged as many affected countries imposed export controls and sought ways to boost domestic output. A case study of the face mask value chain in the United States shows misalignments between the priorities of U.S. federal government officials and the strategies of leading U.S. multinational producers of face masks, which resulted in exceptionally costly policy delays in terms of health outcomes. On balance, the U.S. shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic is more a policy failure than a market failure.

In this paper, we consider learning Discrete Time Markov Chains (DTMC), with different methods such as frequency estimation or Laplace smoothing. While models learnt with such methods converge asymptotically towards the exact system, a more practical question in the realm of trusted machine learning is how accurate a model learnt with a limited time budget is. Existing approaches provide bounds on how close the model is to the original system, in terms of bounds on local (transition) probabilities, which has unclear implication on the global behavior. In this work, we provide global bounds on the error made by such a learning process, in terms of global behaviors formalized using temporal logic. More precisely, we propose a learning process ensuring a bound on the error in the probabilities of these properties. While such learning process cannot exist for the full LTL logic, we provide one ensuring a bound that is uniform over all the formulas of CTL. Further, given one time-to-failure property, we provide an improved learning algorithm. Interestingly, frequency estimation is sufficient for the latter, while Laplace smoothing is needed to ensure non-trivial uniform bounds for the full CTL logic.","Bazille, Hugo; Genest, Blaise; Jegourel, Cyrille; Sun, Jun",Computer Aided Verification,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7363184/,319

Primary-care veterinary clinical data are now recognised as a valuable research resource. Using data from the VetCompass Programme, this study aimed to report the frequency and risk factors for elbow joint disease in dogs under primary veterinary care in the UK and describe clinical management. RESULTS: From 455,069 dogs under veterinary care, the one-year period prevalence for elbow joint disease diagnosis was 0.56% (95% CI: 0.53–0.60). Of 616 incident cases, the most common specific variants of elbow joint disease were osteoarthritis (n = 468, 75.97%), elbow dysplasia (190, 30.84%) and traumatic (41, 6.66%). The most common signs described by the owners were lameness (n = 466, 75.65%), difficulty exercising (123, 19.97%) and pain (86, 13.96%). The most common findings recorded on veterinary examination were pain (n = 283, 45.94%), lameness (278, 45.13%) and reduced range of movement (243, 39.45%). Common medications used included non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 544, 88.31%), tramadol (121, 19.64%) and disease modifying agents (118, 19.16%). Of 109 deaths involving euthanasia with information available from the 616 incident cases, elbow joint disease contributed to the decision to euthanase in 45 (41.28%) dogs. Five breeds showed increased odds of elbow joint disease compared with crossbred dogs: Rottweiler (OR: 6.16, 95% CI 3.89–9.75), Labrador Retriever (OR: 5.94, 95% CI 4.65–7.60), German Shepherd Dog (OR: 4.13, 95% CI 2.88–5.93), Golden Retriever (OR: 3.11, 95% CI 1.93–5.00) and English Springer Spaniel (OR: 2.00, 95% CI 1.26–3.18). Additional risk factors included having an adult bodyweight that was equal or higher than their breed/sex mean, advancing age, being male, being neutered, being insured and larger bodyweight. CONCLUSIONS: Elbow joint disease is a relatively common diagnosis in dogs and has a high welfare impact as evidenced by the high proportion of cases recorded with pain, lameness and analgesic therapy. There are strong breed predispositions, in particular for large breed dogs. These findings present a clear case for improved breeding programmes to reduce the burden of elbow joint disease.","O’Neill, Dan G.; Brodbelt, Dave C.; Hodge, Rebecca; Church, David B.; Meeson, Richard L.",Canine Med Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7371807/,319

To model the spread of a disease and to predict its future course, epidemiologists make use of compartmental models such as the [Formula: see text] model. In order to address some of the assumptions of the standard [Formula: see text] model, a new modified version of [Formula: see text] model is proposed in this paper that takes into account the percentage of infected individuals who are tested and quarantined. This approach helps overcome the assumption of homogenous mixing of population which is inherent to the conventional [Formula: see text] model. Using the available data of the number of COVID-19 positive cases reported in the state of Kerala, and in India till 26th April, 2020 and 12th May 2020, respectively, the parameter estimation problem is converted into an optimization problem with the help of a least squared cost function. The optimization problem is then solved using differential evolution optimizer. The impact of lockdown is quantified by comparing the rising trend in infections before and during the lockdown. Using the estimated set of parameters, the model predicts that in the state of Kerala, by using certain interventions the pandemic can be successfully controlled latest by the first week of July, whereas the [Formula: see text] value for India is still greater than 1, and hence lifting of lockdown from all regions of the country is not advisable.","Anand, Nikhil; Sabarinath, A.; Geetha, S.; Somanath, S.",Trans Indian Natl,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7380501/,319

First, the pandemic will surely occasion a surge of frontline improvisation and innovation in police organizations responding to the crisis as the experienced needs for new solutions dramatically increase. Secondly, but equally importantly, this wave of frontline innovation is likely to be more transparent than is typically the case for innovations developed in frontline police work, because of changes in formal mandates and informal tolerance for procedural deviance. At this moment of unusually widespread and transparent frontline innovation, we propose an approach to capturing and diffusing this frontline innovation.

This pandemic situation is one of the widely spread diseases in recent history. However, there was an influenza pandemic in 1918 with the exact number of deaths still unknown. Some believe that the death toll would have been about 50–100 million people. At the time of writing this article, COVID-19 has infected 5,306,928 persons worldwide (when the article was finalised for publication, the number has increased up to 15,947,291). The article is aimed at analysing the positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 in a sociological perspective. It is further focused on possible challenges to the supply chain in South Asia. South Asian countries are highly influenced by the pandemic situation, and the regional representation is about 4% in the later part of May 2020 with an increasing tendency. Also, the article has a proposal for the control of the disease as well as the entire socio-economic, environmental and political atmosphere in a country, whilst particularly giving more weight to South Asia. The proposed actions are analysed in short-term, mid-term and long-term basis, and any expert and social worker who is involved in the pandemic control process can gain an insight into what to do and how to perform their tasks. A sociological analysis on COVID-19 is very important because there is a wing comprising dominant medical experts in the control and management of the disease. The article emphasises the importance of a sociological analysis in a pandemic situation. Naturally, anyone would think of a pandemic situation in very negative terms due to its emotional, socio-economic, environmental, political and cultural factors. However, it is also positive due to certain factors that help to reintegrate and reorganise the social system as a whole.","Karunathilake, K.",J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7467397/,319

40745,Global Pigment Producer Hires 33 New Apprentices,2020-10-12,"We live in an unusual time, which effects all of us in different ways. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, some people are working harder than ever, some people have lost their job, some people can only work from home, and some people have to reinvent how they work (Kniffin et al., 2020). Older 50+ workers might even be more affected by the pandemic compared to younger workers because they are labeled as vulnerable and as being at risk in terms of Covid-19 (Ayalon et al., 2020). However, emerging studies on the impact of Covid-19 suggest that older workers respond more effectively to measures that counter Covid-19 (Losada-Balter et al., 2020). This is in line with the lifespan developmental perspective, which theorizes and demonstrates that older adults generally are very capable of adapting and very effective in dealing with the aging process (Baltes and Baltes, 1990; Freund, 2008). Multiple studies show that older adults engage in various self-regulation strategies aimed at continuously maintaining or restoring person-environment fit (e.g., Kooij et al., 2020; Taneva and Arnold, 2018; Zacher, Kooij, & Beier, 2018a) thus helping them to age successfully at work. In this commentary, I will take a more positive perspective on older workers and discuss the self-regulation strategies that older workers engage in and how organizations can stimulate this. I will end my commentary with some suggestions for future research.","Kooij, Dorien T A M",Work Aging Retire,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543637/,319

For the past 12 years, the software received a plethora of extensions by the community, which positively affected the size and data quality. Due to the increase in size and complexity, the release process was facing huge delays (from 12 to 17 months cycle), thus impacting the agility of the development. In this paper, we describe the new DBpedia release cycle including our innovative release workflow, which allows development teams (in particular those who publish large, open data) to implement agile, cost-efficient processes and scale up productivity. The DBpedia release workflow has been re-engineered, its new primary focus is on productivity and agility, to address the challenges of size and complexity. At the same time, quality is assured by implementing a comprehensive testing methodology. We run an experimental evaluation and argue that the implemented measures increase agility and allow for cost-effective quality-control and debugging and thus achieve a higher level of maintainability. As a result, DBpedia now publishes regular (i.e. monthly) releases with over 21 billion triples with minimal publishing effort .","Hofer, Marvin; Hellmann, Sebastian; Dojchinovski, Milan; Frey, Johannes",Semantic Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7586439/,319

41482,Covid-19 als Chance für den Frieden?: Ernüchternde Erfahrungen aus Kolumbien und Syrien,2020-11-03,"INTRODUCTION: Even though advancement in mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention services is observed, many infants are lost to follow-up and could not access the full package of mother-to-child HIV transmission prevention services as a result. This is one of the obstacles to the effectiveness of the program. Therefore, determining the magnitude of lost to follow-up and its predictors is important among HIV-exposed infants. METHOD: This institution-based retrospective cohort study was conducted from August 2013 to June 2018 at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital. We retrieved charts of 423 child–mother pairs through a simple random sampling technique. Data collectors extracted data by using a data extraction tool adapted from the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health HIV-exposed infant follow-up form. Bivariable and multivariable Cox regression models were fitted to identify predictors of lost to follow-up. RESULT: A total of 402 child–mother pairs were included in the study. Of the study participants, 6.0% were lost to follow-up for more than 3 months before the declaration of their HIV status. Born from rural residence mother (AHR = 3.5; 95% CI 1.549–7.894), infants whose mothers have three and more children (AHR = 3; 95% CI 1.284–6.963), and low birth weight infants (AHR = 3.2; 95% CI 1.055–9.450) were independent predictors of lost to follow-up among HIV-exposed infants. CONCLUSION: Significant numbers of infants were unable to access full HIV diagnosis and care services as a result of loss to follow-up. Special consideration for mothers having large numbers of children, rural residence, and low birth weight infants could be an important intervention to decrease lost to follow-up.","Wubneh, Chalachew Adugna; Belay, Getaneh Mulualem; Yehualashet, Fikadu Ambaw; Tebeje, Nigusie Birhan; Mekonnen, Birye Dessalegn; Endalamaw, Aklilu",Infect Dis Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592138/,319
41494,Shackles and Chains: Some Concluding Thoughts,2020-10-31,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) are demyelinating disorders affecting the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system (PNS), respectively. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is one of the most valuable sources of diagnostic biomarkers in neurological diseases. In the present study high sensitivity shotgun mass spectrometry was used to characterise the CSF lipidome of patients with MS, GBS and controls with non-demyelinating diseases. The quantification of 222 CSF lipid molecular species revealed characteristic changes in the absolute and relative lipid concentrations in MS and GBS compared to the controls. For the GBS group, the fourfold elevation in the total lipid content was a discriminatory and a newly identified feature of PNS demyelination. In contrast, in MS, the accumulation of the myelin-derived cerebrosides represented a specific feature of demyelination. As a common feature of demyelination, we identified upregulated levels of lipid metabolic intermediates. We found strong positive correlation between total protein content and lipid concentrations in both diseases. By exploring the CSF lipidome we demonstrate usefulness of broad-range shotgun lipidomic analysis as a fast and reliable method of biomarker discovery in patients with demyelinating neurological disorders that might be a valuable diagnostic complement to existing examinations.","Péter, Mária; Török, Wanda; Petrovics-Balog, Anna; Vígh, László; Vécsei, László; Balogh, Gábor",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7592055/,319

International recommendations for the control of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasize the central role of laboratory testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent, at scale. The availability of testing reagents, laboratory equipment and qualified staff are important bottlenecks to achieving this. Elsewhere, pooled testing (i.e. combining multiple samples in the same reaction) has been suggested to increase testing capacities in the pandemic period. Methods. We discuss our experience with SARS-CoV-2 pooled testing using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the Kenyan Coast. Results. In mid-May, 2020, our RT-PCR testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 was improved by ~100% as a result of adoption of a six-sample pooled testing strategy. This was accompanied with a concomitant saving of ~50% of SARS-CoV-2 laboratory test kits at both the RNA extraction and RT-PCR stages. However, pooled testing came with a slight decline of test sensitivity. The RT-PCR cycle threshold value (ΔCt) was ~1.59 higher for samples tested in pools compared to samples tested singly. Conclusions. Pooled testing is a useful strategy to increase SARS-CoV-2 laboratory testing capacity especially in low-income settings.","Agoti, Charles N.; Mutunga, Martin; Lambisia, Arnold W.; Kimani, Domtila; Cheruiyot, Robinson; Kiyuka, Patience; Lewa, Clement; Gicheru, Elijah; Tendwa, Metrine; Said Mohammed, Khadija; Osoti, Victor; Makale, Johnstone; Tawa, Brian; Odundo, Calleb; Cheruiyot, Wesley; Nyamu, Wilfred; Gumbi, Wilson; Mwacharo, Jedidah; Nyamako, Lydia; Otieno, Edward; Amadi, David; Thoya, Janet; Karani, Angela; Mugo, Daisy; Musyoki, Jennifer; Gumba, Horace; Mwarumba, Salim; M.

In the first training-test data set used in the study, there were 230 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 80 were non-Covid-19, while in the second training-test data set there were 476 X-ray images, of which 150 were Covid-19 and 326 were non-Covid-19. Thus, classification results have been provided for two data sets, containing predominantly Covid-19 images and predominantly non-Covid-19 images, respectively. In the study, a 23-layer CNN architecture and a 54-layer CNN architecture were developed. Within the scope of the study, the results were obtained using chest X-ray images directly in the training-test procedures and the sub-band images obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) to the above-mentioned images. The same experiments were repeated using images obtained by applying local binary pattern (LBP) to the chest X-ray images. Within the scope of the study, four new result generation pipeline algorithms having been put forward additionally, it was ensured that the experimental results were combined and the success of the study was improved. In the experiments carried out in this study, the training sessions were carried out using the k-fold cross validation method. Here the k value was chosen as 23 for the first and second training-test data sets. Considering the average highest results of the experiments performed within the scope of the study, the values of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F-1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the first training-test data set were 0,9947, 0,9800, 0,9843, 0,9881 and 0,9990 respectively; while for the second training-test data set, they were 0,9920, 0,9939, 0,9891, 0,9828 and 0,9991; respectively.

These challenges as well as the underlying causes are subject to an intense economic debate. This article, traces the scientific debate by laying out the theoretical and empirical arguments. As not only nominal, but also real rates have decreased in most developed economies over a long period of time, monetary policy is unlikely to be the major driver of the development. In contrast, theories that explain the decline in interest rates with structural changes in the demand and supply of capital are consistent with the empirical evidence and offer a more convincing explanation. Beyond an analysis of the roots of the decrease, we discuss potential economic consequences of persistently low interest rates. In particular, we discuss evidence of how the transmission channels of monetary policy, financial intermediaries, non-financial companies as well households are affected by the low-interest rate environment.

However, previous studies on emotion and aging have found that older adults report better well-being than younger adults in global survey and daily report. To better understand older adults’ well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak, we examined age differences in daily affective experiences in this study. Method A total of participants from mainland China aged 18 to 85 were recruited to participate in the 14-day daily diary study, after a pretest. Their trait affect and demographic information were measured in the pretest. Their daily affect and stress levels were measured in the daily assessments. Results We found that older adults reported a higher level of low arousal positive affect (e.g., calm) and lower levels of high arousal negative affect (HAN; e.g., anxiety), low arousal negative affect (LAN; e.g., dullness), and perceived stress related to COVID-19 in daily life, compared to younger adults.

The study included n = 226 older adults aged 70-90 years old, living in the Bronx, New York City, who had completed the 3-item Loneliness Scale prior to and during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak in New York City. There was no evidence of significant increases in mean loneliness from pre- to post-COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify risk and protective factors for change in loneliness during the COVID-19 outbreak, adjusting for pre-outbreak loneliness. Living alone, higher levels of education, greater worry about contracting the coronavirus, and limiting of daily exercise activities were risk factors for greater loneliness after the outbreak. In contrast, Black race, older age, greater social support and frequent social interactions via video call, all related to lower levels of loneliness after the outbreak.The outcomes of this study demonstrate substantial resilience among older adults to loneliness in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight key risk and protective factors that may play an important role in individual differences in loneliness as pandemic-driven isolation continues.","Harrington, Karra; Zhaoyang, Ruixue; Scott, Stacey; Graham-Engeland, Jennifer; Sliwinski, Martin",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7740803/,319

Worldwide, the USA and China are the countries with the largest and second largest populations of people aged 80+. More than two million older adults live in senior-living facilities in the USA and the number of beds in senior-living facilities in China has increased to 6.5 million in recent five years. The risk of infections including COVID-19 is tripled in senior-living residents because of age, close living conditions, and underlying health conditions. Infectious diseases account for one third of all deaths in people age 65+ in the USA. COVID-19 has a case fatality rate of 2.3% overall and as high as 15% in patients age 80+ in China. Together with health and services interventions, environmental interventions should be considered to prevent the possible spread of infections in senior-living settings. Based on a literature review and using empirical data of 12 senior-living facility designs collected in both countries, this research analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of existing facility environments in terms of infection control. Environmental interventions to promote infection control are suggested in the context of individual facilities. Proposed interventions are analyzed at two levels: spatial design and design details. Five factors are included: visitors screening, ventilation, isolation rooms, hand washing, and daily temperature checks. From the perspective of infection control, the cross-country similarities and differences of senior-living facility designs are discussed.","Wang, Zhe; Li, Bo",Innov Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7743050/,319

However, its possible hepatic involvement has not been researched extensively. This study amis to analyze liver abnormality associated with disease severity in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This was a pooled analysis of 6 retrospective, cohorts studies including 755 Chinese adult patients (> 18 years) diagnosed with COVID-19, admitted from January through February 2020. These patients were classified into two groups: non- severe and severe, based on interim guidelines of World Health Organization and the National Health Commission of China. Patients would be classified into severe group if one of three following criteria were met: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min, SpO2 < 93% on room air, or PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300mmHg. Results were analyzed with Student’s t- test, Pearson’s Chi-Squared test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test by SAS Enterprise Guide 7.1. Table 1: Pooled Results [Image: see text] RESULTS: 755 Chinese adult patients (>18 years) with COVID-19 were included. Gender of male (OR 1.95; 95% CI 1.26–3.0; P=0.0022), and Wuhan region (OR 2.17; 95% CI 1.4–3.34; P= 0.0004) were significantly associated with the severe group compared with the non-severe group. Also the severe group had a significant lower albumin (g/dL) (3.5±1.1 vs. 4.1±1.0, P= 0.001), higher AST (U/L) (34.1±24.8 vs. 22.3±17.9, P= 0.001), and higher CRP (mg/L) (54.1±122.2 vs. 9.3±59.0, P= 0.0135) compared with the non-severe group. Surprisingly, no significant difference of age between these two groups was identified. Furthermore, no significant difference of ALT, Total bilirubin, D-dimer or INR with disease severity were identified. Table 2: Lab Results And Age With Disease Severity [Image: see text] Table 3: Age And Location With Disease Severity [Image: see text] Figure 1: Variables Comparison Severe vs. Non- Severe [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that male gender and of Wuhan origin were significantly higher in proportion in the severe group. Of Wuhan origin as a risk factor of severe COVID-19 could be explained by limited medical resources for overwhelming COVID-19 patients in Wuhan during the period of January and February 2020. It is unclear why male was the risk factor of severe COVID-19 based on our data. Also, there were significant lower Albumin, higher AST and CRP in severe COVID-19, but their values were not too impressive. However due to limited data and studies, future studies are needed to elucidate risks factors associated with severe COVID-19.

44349,MRS Communications,2020-12-24,"Automatic chronic pain assessment and pain intensity estimation has been attracting growing attention due to its widespread applications. One of the prevalent issues in automatic pain analysis is inadequate balanced expert-labelled data for pain estimation. This work proposes an anomaly detection based network addressing one of the existing limitations of automatic pain assessment. The evaluation of the network is performed on pain intensity estimation and protective behaviour estimation tasks from body movements in the EmoPain Challenge dataset. The EmoPain dataset consists of body part based sensor data for both the tasks. The proposed network, PLAAN (Pain Level Assessment with Anomaly-detection based Network), is a lightweight LSTM-DNN network which considers features based on sensor data as the input and predicts intensity level of pain and presence or absence of protective behaviour in chronic low back pain patients. Joint training considering body movement patterns, such as exercise type, corresponding to pain exhibition as a label improves the performance of the network. However, contrary to perception, protective behaviour rather exists sporadically alongside pain in the EmoPain dataset. This induces yet another complication in accurate estimation of protective behaviour. This problem is resolved by incorporating anomaly detection in the network. A detailed comparison of different networks with varied features is outlined in the paper, presenting a significant improvement with the final proposed anomaly detection based network.","Li, Yi; Ghosh, Shreya; Joshi, Jyoti",J Multimodal User Interfaces,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786324/,319

In this paper, we identify a flaw in the reasoning and show with a counter-example that stutter-trace equivalence is not necessarily preserved. We propose a solution together with an updated correctness proof. Furthermore, we analyse in which formalisms this problem may occur. The impact on practical implementations is limited, since they all compute a correct approximation of the theory.","Neele, Thomas; Valmari, Antti; Willemse, Tim A.

We consider a forward-mode AD method on a higher order language with algebraic data types, and we characterise it as the unique structure preserving macro given a choice of derivatives for basic operations. We describe a rich semantics for differentiable programming, based on diffeological spaces. We show that it interprets our language, and we phrase what it means for the AD method to be correct with respect to this semantics. We show that our characterisation of AD gives rise to an elegant semantic proof of its correctness based on a gluing construction on diffeological spaces. We explain how this is, in essence, a logical relations argument. Finally, we sketch how the analysis extends to other AD methods by considering a continuation-based method.","Huot, Mathieu; Staton, Sam; Vákár, Matthijs",Foundations of Software Science and Computation Structures,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7788619/,319

In educational settings, one of the ways to respond to this crisis has been the online delivery of content. One of the valid critiques of these online delivery models is the passive role of the participants. The challenge is we still know very little about how technology could support children’s active participation in their learning. This challenge exacerbates with children in early years and in their home setting, which is the focus of our research at Monash University’s Conceptual PlayLab. This paper reports on solving the theoretical problem of digital design that can create a relational space for children’s STEM concept formation. The paper argues that engagement with digital tools demands clear design principles that could support both robust concept formation and also development of learning motives in children. Drawing on Wartofsky’s work on artefacts and tool-use and (Fleer 2017a, 2019), conceptualisation of “digital coadjuvant”, we make a case that technology offers a transformative potential for children to imagine and explore together with their caregivers in the Conceptual PlayWorld. We have showed through a practice example on how person and digital technologies become mutually constituted in a pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld. The design principle highlighted in the paper argues for transcending the binary of digital and non-digital. The paper concludes that Conceptual PlayWorld offers a design model that uses digital tools to sustain and amplify children’s exploration in their imaginary play situation.","Rai, Prabhat; Fleer, Marilyn; Fragkiadaki, Glykeria",Hu Arenas,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7797707/,319

The continuously increasing number of infections and deaths has driven several countries to implement control and response strategies including community lockdowns, physical distancing, and travel bans with different levels of success. However, a disease outbreak and the corresponding policies can cause disastrous economic consequences due to business closures and risk minimization behaviors. This paper develops a system dynamics framework of a disease outbreak system covering various policies to evaluate their effectiveness in mitigating transmission and the resulting economic burden. The system dynamics modeling approach captures the relationships, feedbacks, and delays in such a system, revealing meaningful insights on the dynamics of several response strategies.","Sy, Charlle; Ching, Phoebe Mae; San Juan, Jayne Lois; Bernardo, Ezekiel; Miguel, Angelimarie; Mayol, Andres Philip; Culaba, Alvin; Ubando, Aristotle; Mutuc, Jose Edgar",Process Integr Optim Sustain,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7841385/,319

The proposed model exploits three different input modalities: RGB imagery, thermographic imagery and Channel State Information from Wi-Fi signal reflectance to estimate human intrusion and suspicious activity. The fused multimodal information is used as input in a Bidirectional LSTM, which has the benefit of being able to capture temporal interdependencies in both past and future time instances, a significant aspect in the discussed unusual activity detection scenario. We also present a Bayesian optimization framework that fine-tunes the Bidirectional LSTM parameters in an optimal manner. The proposed framework is evaluated on real-world data from a critical water infrastructure protection and monitoring scenario and the results indicate a superior performance compared to other unimodal and multimodal approaches and classification models.","Bakalos, Nikolaos; Voulodimos, Athanasios; Doulamis, Nikolaos; Doulamis, Anastasios; Papasotiriou, Kassiani; Bimpas, Matthaios",Cyber-Physical Security for Critical Infrastructures Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888295/,319

The life path they had expected to take is not consonant with the one they are taking in reality. This perception of “off-course” in identity and self-direction is referred to as derailment. Although previous studies have postulated and demonstrated that derailment causes a low level of well-being, no studies have examined its existence and effect across cultures. We hypothesized that East Asians (Japanese) are less vulnerable to feeling derailed than North Americans (Canadians/Americans), and that those Japanese who feel derailed do not necessarily experience long-term damage to their well-being. Two correlational studies and one longitudinal study with a one-year interval supported these hypotheses and also demonstrated metric invariance of the Derailment Scale between countries. We discuss that these findings may be explained by East Asian’s dialectical thinking, in which the perception of one’s life direction is flexible.

46959,Eine Monsterpille zur Prophylaxe bei Herzgesunden,2021-03-29,"Few patients are as helpless and totally dependent on nursing as long-term intensive care (ICU) patients. How the ICU nurse relates to the patient is crucial, both concerning the patients’ mental and physical health and well-being. Even if nurses provide evidence-based care in the form of minimum sedation, early mobilization, and attempts at spontaneous breathing during weaning, the patient may not have the strength, courage, and willpower to comply. Interestingly, several elements of human connectedness have shown a positive influence on patient outcomes. Thus, a shift from technical nursing toward an increased focus on patient understanding and greater patient and family involvement in ICU treatment and care is suggested. Accordingly, a holistic view including the lived experiences of ICU care from the perspectives of patients, family members, and ICU nurses is required in ICU care as well as research. Considerable research has been devoted to long-term ICU patients’ experiences from their ICU stays. However, less attention has been paid to salutogenic resources which are essential in supporting long-term ICU patients’ inner strength and existential will to keep on living. A theory of salutogenic ICU nursing is highly welcome. Therefore, this chapter draws on empirical data from three large qualitative studies in the development of a tentative theory of salutogenic ICU nursing care. From the perspective of former long-term ICU patients, their family members, and ICU nurses, this chapter provides insights into how salutogenic ICU nursing care can support and facilitate ICU patients’ existential will to keep on living, and thus promoting their health, survival, and well-being. In a salutogenic perspective on health, the ICU patient pathway along the ease/dis-ease continuum reveals three stages; (1) The breaking point, (2) In between, and (3) Never in my mind to give up. The tentative theory of salutogenic long-term ICU nursing care includes five main concepts: (1) the long-term ICU patient pathway (along the salutogenic health continuum), (2) the patient’s inner strength and willpower, (3) salutogenic ICU nursing care (4), family care, and (5) pull and push. The salutogenic concepts of inner strength, meaning, connectedness, hope, willpower, and coping are of vital importance and form the essence of salutogenic long-term ICU nursing care.","Haugdahl, Hege Selnes; Alexandersen, Ingeborg; Haugan, Gørill",Health Promotion in Health Care - Vital Theories and Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7948003/,319

The pandemic has a clear and strong effect on world economic development. The assessments so far show that the COVID-19 could slash global economic growth by 2.0% for each month when existing challenges persist. World commerce might also slash by 13% to 32%, subject to the penetration and level of a world economic depression. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on Malaysian Takaful business and future effect of COVID-19 in Malaysia at 2020. By this time, it is obvious that the pandemic has intense detrimental effect on both the Malaysian macroeconomic and economic welfare of the people. Bank Negara Malaysia in 2020 has forecast that GDP growth will fall between 3.5% and 5.5%. Currently, unemployment is expected to rise to 5%. Islamic economy is also being affected by the virus incidence. The Malaysian Takaful industry is not excluded from the anticipated impact of the economic slowdown in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Apart from considerably hampered growth in 2020, Takaful operators will also have to cope with the increased volatility and rising credit risks of their investments in 2021 and may be 2022. During the pandemic spread of COVID-19 the Malaysian government took financial actions to save the economic sector and to reduce the negative effects of MCO.

Recent postmortem studies reported a large spectrum of neuropathological features that support the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2 [3–5]. Given the complex pathophysiology of COVID-19 associated neurological manifestation, the pathological changes observed at postmortem examination often reflect the combination of both direct and indirect cytopathic effects mediated by the virus, as well as of nonspecific complications of severe disease in the deceased patients with COVID-19 (i.e. critical illness-related encephalopathy [6]; and/or pre-existing medical conditions). Thus, all these factors need to be considered when interpreting neuropathological findings [3, 7]. Hypoxia-ischemia, observed in the majority of critically ill cases of Covid-19, does not account for all relevant neuropathological observations provided by postmortem neuropathological studies in single cases or small patient cohorts [8–14]. However, among these studies the extent and significance of neuroinflammatory changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection are still matter of discussion, with often contradictory conclusions. In particular, it remains unclear to what extent the reported microglia activation and occasionally the presence of sparse lymphocytic infiltrates (T lymphocytes) represents COVID-19-specific findings [6, 7].","Aronica, Eleonora; Gerevini, Simonetta",Neuroimaging of Covid-19,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7972516/,319

Object labels may contain much information that can be difficult to read because the data shown is a lot, and the text is difficult to read by many people. Blind people are unable to get that information autonomously, and many sighted persons (e.g. elderly people and visually-impaired) may have a lot of difficulty in reading labels. Several tools or applications are available on the market or have been proposed in the literature to support this type of activity (e.g. barcode or QR code reading), but they are limited and may require specific skills by the user. Moreover, repeatedly using an application to read label contents or to get additional information on a product can require numerous actions on a touch-screen device. This can make their use inaccessible or unusable for many users, especially while shopping or cooking. In this work, a portable tool is proposed to support people in simply reading the contents of labels and getting additional information, while they are at home or at the shop. Our study aims to propose a portable assistive technology which can be used by everyone both at home and in the shopping, independently from the personal skills and without requiring no smartphone or complex device, and that is a low-cost solution for the user.

Benzophenone (Ph(2)CO), was used as the photoinitiator. The synthesis was optimized by changing the concentration of HEMA, Ph(2)CO, EGDMA, and UV irradiation time. PolyVCi undergoes photocrosslinking by 2 + 2 photocylo addition while the monomer/crosslinker couple, HEMA/EGDMA, undergoes free radical polymerization and crosslinking to form EGDMA crosslinked polyHEMA. Hence, simultaneous interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) formation occurs. The IPN consists of dual network of photocrosslinked polyVCi and EGDMA crosslinked polyHEMA chains. Grafting of HEMA/EGDMA chains on the polyVCi backbone also occur during network formation. The chemical functionalities present in the polyVCi/polyHEMA/polyEGDMA IPN films obtained were characterized by FTIR and SEM analysis. The contact angle measurements show enhanced wettability of the IPN film compared to polyVCi surface. TGA analysis confirms thermal stability of the films. Swelling behavior of the films examined in water and in ethanol reveals the effects of the chemical natures of polyVCi and polyHEMA as well as that of crosslinking on the hydrophilicity of the film. The films were tested as drug release matrices using flurbiprofen. The drug was loaded into the film matrix during IPN formation under UV irradiation. PolyVCi/polyHEMA/polyEGDMA IPN proved to be a suitable release matrix for flurbiprofen demonstrating controlled release behavior and zero-order release kinetics. The release mechanism was confirmed by its Ritger-Peppas “n” value (1.00 to 1.42), which indicates super case II release.","Alokour, Mamoon; Yilmaz, Elvan",J Polym Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7977491/,319

49002,The Transnationalization of Hazardous Waste,2020-12-02,"Proactive adaptation, in which the adaptation for a system’s reliable goal achievement is performed by predicting changes in the environment, is considered as an effective alternative to reactive adaptation, in which adaptation is performed after observing changes. When predicting the environmental changes, the prediction may be uncertain, so it is necessary to verify and confirm an adaptation’s consequences before execution. To resolve the uncertainty, probabilistic model checking (PMC) has been utilized for verification of adaptation tactics’ effects on the goal of a self-adaptive system (SAS). However, PMC-based approaches have limitations on the state-explosion problem of complex SAS model verification and the modeling languages supported by the model checkers. In this paper, to overcome the limitations of the PMC-based approaches, we propose an efficient Proactive Adaptation approach based on STAtistical model checking (PASTA). Our approach allows SASs to mitigate the uncertainty of the future environment, faster than the PMC-based approach, by producing statistically sufficient samples for verification of adaptation tactics based on statistical model checking (SMC) algorithms. We provide algorithmic processes, a reference architecture, and an open-source implementation skeleton of PASTA for engineers to apply it for SAS development. We evaluate PASTA on two SASs using actual data and show that PASTA is efficient comparing to the PMC-based approach. We also provide a comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of PMC- and SMC-based proactive adaptation to guide engineers’ decision-making for SAS development.","Shin, Yong-Jun; Cho, Eunho; Bae, Doo-Hwan",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978901/,319

However, the industry is susceptible to disasters that destroy infrastructure and affect human movement, notably the outbreak of pandemics and epidemics. This study investigated the early impacts of COVID-19 on the global hospitality’s restaurant sector. The study made of data from the OpenTable database and the National Restaurant Association of America. It emerged from the study that most restaurants were shut down for sit-in meals as governments increasingly promulgated regulations for social distancing and lockdowns. This adversely affected fine dining and family restaurants, pubs and taverns. The fast-food outlets were equally affected with businesses mostly operating at less than 20% capacity. This led to substantial financial losses and direct and indirect jobs losses thus bringing many restaurants into unprecedented liquidity challenges. At the peak of the pandemic impact in the USA, millions of restaurant employees lost their jobs. The study recommends a raft of tailor-made measures to assist the restaurant businesses and employees during and after the crisis so that both emerge out of it stronger and resilient to withstand such possible future events. Among such measures are tax rebates for employees and business; improved health and hygiene measures; the provision of grants, loans and debt relief interventions; decreased interests on loans; and other innovative measures to ensure business viability post the pandemic.","Nhamo, Godwell; Dube, Kaitano; Chikodzi, David",Counting the Cost of COVID-19 on the Global Tourism Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980027/,319

The issue addressed in this paper focuses on the importance of considering the social organization into geo-spatially organized communities (i.e., the size, position, and density of cities, towns, settlements) which have a profound impact on shaping the dynamics of epidemics. We introduce a novel geo-spatial population model (GPM) which can be tailored to reproduce a similar heterogeneous individuals’ organization to that of real-world communities in chosen countries. We highlight the important differences between a homogeneous model and GPM in their capability to estimate epidemic outbreak dynamics (e.g., waves), duration and overall coverage using a dataset of the world’s nations. Results show that community size and density play an important role in the predictability and controllability of epidemics. Specifically, small and dense community systems can either remain completely isolated, or show rapid bursts of epidemic dynamics; larger systems lengthen the epidemic size and duration proportionally with their number of communities.","Topîrceanu, Alexandru",Complex Networks & Their Applications IX,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980945/,319

Machine learning is the subset of artificial intelligence which can provide resources to overcome the current mental health crisis during COVID-19. It provides the opportunity to solve challenges with the ability to learn from experiences automatically. This chapter gives useful insight to assess the feasibility and efficacy of artificial intelligence and psychosocial support during the COVID-19 outbreak. The demographic data of Namibia during the infestation period of COVID-19 spread is presented and analysed by statistical methods about age, citizen and gender. Further in this study, a regression model is developed, which gives the relationship between the independent variable which is the date of infestation and a dependent variable which is the number of patients, and the available data is being used to predict the future value of infected COVID-19 outbreak in a similar environment.","Dhaka, Poonam",Big Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence Against COVID-19: Innovation Vision and Approach,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7980972/,319

In this regard, because of the success of turboprop propulsion in the form Tu-95 long-range strategic bomber, by the early 1960s, a ‘turbofan gap’ emerged which the Soviet aviation industry was not able to close during the following decades. Particularly important in this regard were CoCom sanctions, which prevented Moscow from acquiring modern, high-bypass turbofan power plants from the West. Consequently, bloc aviation remained stranded without the new technology it needed. It was dealt a deadly blow with the increasing price of oil, which exposed the shortcomings of its petrochemical sector.","Svik, Peter",Civil Aviation and the Globalization of the Cold War,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7981115/,319

Lockdown stage and implemented shutdowns of industries, etc., exhibited a significant reduction in carbon emissions. Carbon emissions are often associated with burning waste, fossil fuels, crude, coal, etc., and it is harmful to the environment and human survival globally. In this chapter, carbon emission data (fossil carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emission data) have been collected and comparison has been done during lockdown with last year’s data. The comparison showed that emission reduced to a greater extent even more than 50% in some regions. Learnt lessons are evaluated thoroughly in this chapter that can be directed by government and private organizations post lockdown in future. The data presented in this chapter indicated a daily decrease of CO(2) emission by 17% due to complete lockdown in most of the world population. As in most of the region, the lockdown has been upholding the annual decrease in CO(2) emission would be only between 4.2 and 7.5% as estimated by previous researchers.","Dasgotra, Ankit; Singh, Vishal Kumar; Manna, Suvendu; Singh, Gurpreet; Tauseef, S.

50981,Einen digitalen Marktplatz integrieren,2021-03-30,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is among the leading bacteria that cause nosocomial infections. The capsule of this Gram-negative bacterium is a dominant virulence factor, with a prominent role in defense and biofilm formation. Bacteriophages, which are specific for one bacterial strain and its capsule type, can evoke the lysis of bacterial cells, aided by polysaccharide depolymerase enzymes. In this study, we isolated and characterized a bacteriophage against the nosocomial K. pneumoniae 52145 strain with K2 capsular serotype. The phage showed a narrow host range and stable lytic activity, even when exposed to different temperatures or detergents. Preventive effect of the phage in a nasal colonization model was investigated in vivo. Phlyogenetic analysis showed that the newly isolated Klebsiella phage B1 belongs to the Webervirus genus in Drexlerviridae family. We identified the location of the capsule depolymerase gene of the new phage, which was amplified, cloned, expressed, and purified. The efficacy of the recombinant B1dep depolymerase was tested by spotting on K. pneumoniae strains and it was confirmed that the extract lowers the thickness of the bacterium lawn as it degrades the protective capsule on bacterial cells. As K. pneumoniae strains possessing the K2 serotype have epidemiological importance, the B1 phage and its depolymerase are promising candidates for use as possible antimicrobial agents.","Pertics, Botond Zsombor; Cox, Alysia; Nyúl, Adrienn; Szamek, Nóra; Kovács, Tamás; Schneider, György",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8003838/,319

RESULTS: In our study, COVID-19 patients with positive RT-PCR results (RT-PCR (+) group) and patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 but negative RT-PCR results (RT-PCR (−) group) were compared in terms of CT findings. In CT images, ground-glass opacity and ground-glass opacity + patchy consolidation were the most common lesion patterns in both groups. No statistically significant differences in the rates and types of lesion patterns were observed between the two groups. In both groups, lesion distributions and distribution patterns were similarly frequent in the bilateral, peripheral, and lower lobe distributions. Among the 39 patients who underwent follow-up CT imaging in the first or second month, a regression in lesion number and density was detected in 18 patients from both groups. Consolidations were completely resorbed in 16 of these patients, and five patients had newly developed fibrotic changes. The follow-up CT examination of 16 patients was normal. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the false-negative rate of RT-PCR tests caused by various reasons, clinically suspected COVID-19 patients with a contact history should be examined with CT scans, even if RT-PCR tests are negative. If the CT findings are positive, these patients should not be removed from isolation.","Korkmaz, Inan; Dikmen, Nursel; Keleş, Fatma Oztürk; Bal, Tayibe",Egypt J Radiol Nucl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8022619/,319

Peripheral analysis methodologies which are taken into the lens before the performance management have a major role in understanding the organizational culture and dynamism behind the organizational design to identify strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities in a research institute's work for commercial agriculture development. The lack of a proper analyzing system to understand the critical success factors of a research institute towards innovative commercial agriculture has hampered the establishment of a good performance management system in research institutes towards this end. In this context, we highlight the most important avenues that could significantly improve the quality of performance, if used properly in the management of a research institute's work for commercial agriculture. How those management practices and tools could be streamlined by introducing new guidelines and policies in organization design have been elaborated. Further, it will provide an in-depth review of the most suitable peripheral analysis methodologies in place of the proposed structured procedure, to facilitate the selection process of obtaining an optimized KPI set.

Unlike disasters that are more temporarily and spatially bounded, the pandemic has continued to expand across time and space for over a year, leaving an unusually broad range of second-order and third-order harms in its wake. Globally, the unusual conditions of the pandemic—unlike other crises—have impacted almost every facet of our lives. The pandemic has deepened existing inequalities and created new vulnerabilities related to social isolation, incarceration, involuntary exclusion from the labor market, diminished economic opportunity, life-and-death risk in the workplace, and a host of emergent digital, emotional, and economic divides. In tandem, many less advantaged individuals and groups have suffered disproportionate hardship related to the pandemic in the form of fear and anxiety, exposure to misinformation, and the effects of the politicization of the crisis. Many of these phenomena will have a long tail that we are only beginning to understand. Nonetheless, the research also offers evidence of resilience on several fronts including nimble organizational response, emergent communication practices, spontaneous solidarity, and the power of hope.

Thus, we aimed to develop and validate a nomogram predictive model for predicting survival of melanoma. METHODS: Four hundred forty-nine melanoma cases with RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from TCGA were randomly divided into the training set I (n = 224) and validation set I (n = 225), 210 melanoma cases with RNA-seq data from Lund cohort of Lund University (available in GSE65904) were used as an external test set. The prognostic gene biomarker was developed and validated based on the above three sets. The developed gene biomarker combined with clinical characteristics was used as variables to develop and validate a nomogram predictive model based on 379 patients with complete clinical data from TCGA (Among 470 cases, 91 cases with missing clinical data were excluded from the study), which were randomly divided into the training set II (n = 189) and validation set II (n = 190). Area under the curve (AUC), concordance index (C-index), calibration curve, and Kaplan-Meier estimate were used to assess predictive performance of the nomogram model. RESULTS: Four genes, i.e., CLEC7A, CLEC10A, HAPLN3, and HCP5 comprise an immune-related prognostic biomarker. The predictive performance of the biomarker was validated using tROC and log-rank test in the training set I (n = 224, 5-year AUC of 0.683), validation set I (n = 225, 5-year AUC of 0.644), and test set I (n = 210, 5-year AUC of 0.645). The biomarker was also significantly associated with improved survival in the training set (P < 0.01), validation set (P < 0.05), and test set (P < 0.001), respectively. In addition, a nomogram combing the four-gene biomarker and six clinical factors for predicting survival in melanoma was developed in the training set II (n = 189), and validated in the validation set II (n = 190), with a concordance index of 0.736 ± 0.041 and an AUC of 0.832 ± 0.071. CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a nomogram predictive model combining a four-gene biomarker and six clinical factors for melanoma patients, which could facilitate risk stratification and treatment planning.","Zhang, Chuan; Dang, Dan; Wang, Yuqian; Cong, Xianling",Front Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047639/,319

52005,Long COVID braucht Rehabilitation,2021-04-17,"Background: Prehabilitation aims to improve functional capacity prior to cancer treatment to achieve better psychosocial and clinical outcomes. Prehabilitation interventions vary considerably in design and delivery. In order to identify gaps in knowledge and facilitate the design of future studies, we undertook a scoping review of prehabilitation studies to map the range of work on prehabilitation being carried out in any cancer type and with a particular focus on diet or nutrition interventions. Objectives: Firstly, to describe the type of prehabilitation programs currently being conducted. Secondly, to describe the extent to which prehabilitation studies involved aspects of nutrition, including assessment, interventions, implementation, and outcomes. Eligibility Criteria: Any study of quantitative or qualitative design that employed a formal prehabilitation program before cancer treatment (“prehabilitation” listed in keywords, title, or abstract). Sources of Evidence: Search was conducted in July 2020 using MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, EMCARE, CINAHL, and AMED. Charting Methods: Quantitative data were reported as frequencies. Qualitative nutrition data were charted using a framework analysis that reflects the Nutrition Care Process Model: assessment, intervention, and monitoring/evaluation of the nutrition intervention. Results: Five hundred fifty unique articles were identified: 110 studies met inclusion criteria of a formal prehabilitation study in oncology. prehabilitation studies were mostly cohort studies (41%) or randomized-controlled trials (38%) of multimodal (49%), or exercise-only (44%) interventions that were applied before surgery (94%). Nutrition assessment was inconsistently applied across these studies, and often conducted without validated tools (46%). Of the 110 studies, 37 (34%) included a nutrition treatment component. Half of these studies provided the goal for the nutrition component of their prehabilitation program; of these goals, less than half referenced accepted nutrition guidelines in surgery or oncology. Nutrition interventions largely consisted of counseling with dietary supplementation. The nutrition intervention was indiscernible in 24% of studies. Two-thirds of studies did not monitor the nutrition intervention nor evaluate nutrition outcomes. Conclusion: Prehabilitation literature lacks standardized and validated nutritional assessment, is frequently conducted without evidence-based nutrition interventions, and is typically implemented without monitoring the nutrition intervention or evaluating the intervention's contribution to outcomes. We suggest that the development of a core outcome set could improve the quality of the studies, enable pooling of evidence, and address some of the research gaps identified.","Gillis, Chelsia; Davies, Sarah J.; Carli, Francesco; Wischmeyer, Paul E.; Wootton, Stephen A.; Jackson, Alan A.; Riedel, Bernhard; Marino, Luise V.; Levett, Denny Z.

This project aimed to identify changes to burns management in the UK during the “first wave” of COVID-19, and how the lessons learned can be applied to the current “second wave”. METHODS: Between 11th July-15th September, 18 burns services across the UK completed a MDT survey and contributed data on service evaluation. The MDT survey captured perspectives of multiple stakeholders and included changes to burns services, disruptions to supply chain, and service improvements resulting from COVID-19. Service evaluation data was collected retrospectively and prospectively on patients who received inpatient/outpatient treatment during COVID-19. Patients in the retrospective cohort were first seen by burns services between 6th-30th April (coinciding with the UK’s COVID-19 peak), and the prospective cohort were first seen between 30th April-15th September. Each cohort consisted of 10-20 patients per burns service. Service evaluation covered key areas of burns aetiology, referral pathway changes, patient presentation delays to tertiary services, patient management decisions, and outpatient dressing clinic management. Data from the MDT survey and the service evaluation were analysed by descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. RESULTS: The changes to burns services include delays in burn referrals, increase in conservative management, and increased use of telemedicine. CONCLUSION: Across the UK, safe and effective burns care continued to be delivered despite difficulties from the pandemic. We hope the learning points identified in this study will be of use during the “second wave” of the pandemic.","Yoshimura, Ryo; Phillips, Georgina; Wormald, Justin; Collins, Declan; Yoshimura, Ryo",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030163/,319

Thyroid nodules are second most common cause of referral to HMC endocrine clinic. FNABs are gold standard to differentiate benign from malignant nodules.(1- 2) Methods: Our approach includes a teleconsultation to obtain patient’s history and risk factors. Reviewing neck ultrasound (US), obtaining a calcitonin level if indicated, considering comorbidities associated with a high risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.(3) Results: We developed a pathway triaging thyroid (FNAB) to:1-Urgent: patients at higher risk of aggressive thyroid malignancy. Benefits of early detection and treatment outweigh the risk of COVID-19 exposure.(4) FNAB should not be delayed.2-Semi-urgent: patients at low risk for COVID-19 and high suspicion thyroid nodules, but no evidence that early detection improves survival(2), FNAB may be delayed up to 12 months.3-Non-urgent: patients with asymptomatic nodules that have low or intermediate suspicion US pattern.(2) Also, includes nodules with ATA high suspicion US pattern in pregnant women and patients at high risk for COVID-19. The risks outweigh the benefits. FNAB should be delayed until outbreak is controlled.(4) When urgent FNAB is indicated, safety of patients and medical staff needs to be addressed.(5) We recommend testing patient for COVID-19 before FNAB, utilizing US guidance with rapid on-site adequacy evaluation in all cases. Cervical lymph node FNAB with TG washout should be done if indicated. The patient should wear a mask. All medical staff involved should wear personal protective equipment (PPE). The operator should wear N95 mask and face shield. The patient should be informed about cytopathology results via telemedicine. Conclusion: Triaging thyroid (FNAB) during the COVID-19 pandemic should be based on nodule characteristics and risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

Here, we have quantified CGM profiles in Hispanic/Latino adults with or at-risk of non-insulin treated type 2 diabetes (T2D). METHODS: 100 participants (79 female, 86% Hispanic/Latino [predominantly Mexican], age 54·6 [±12·0] years) stratified into (i) at risk of T2D, (ii) with pre-diabetes (pre-T2D), and (iii) with non-insulin treated T2D, wore blinded CGMs for 2 weeks. Beyond standardized CGM measures (average glucose, glucose variability, time in 70–140 mg/dL and 70–180 mg/dL ranges), we also examined additional CGM measures based on the time of day. FINDINGS: Standardized CGM measures were significantly different for participants with T2D compared to at-risk and pre-T2D participants (p<0·0001). In addition, pre-T2D participants spent more time between 140 and 180 mg/dL during the day than at-risk participants (p<0·01). T2D participants spent more time between 140 and 180 mg/dL both during the day and overnight compared to at-risk and pre-T2D participants (both p<0·0001). Time in 70–140 mg/dL range during the day was significantly correlated with HbA(1c) (r=-0·72, p<0·0001), after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and waist circumference (p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: Standardized CGM measures show a progression of dysglycemia from at-risk of T2D, to pre-T2D, and to T2D. Stratifying CGM readings by time of day and the range 140–180 mg/dL provides additional metrics to differentiate between the groups.

METHOD: Two cohorts of patients undergoing I&D procedures were retrospectively identified from attendance records over a 3.5-month period. The first cohort was between 16th October 2018 to 31st January 2019. The second cohort of patients was during the COVID-19 pandemic following the introduction of new RCS guidance (intervention) between 29th March 2020 and 15th June 2020. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients before and 63 after the intervention were included. There were significantly more procedures performed under LA after the introduction of the intervention (n = 52; 82.5%) vs before (n = 4; 5.6%) p < 0.0001. The incidence of wound packing decreased after the intervention (n = 43; 68.3% vs n = 62; 87.3%) p = 0.00452. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that during the pandemic, change in practice resulted in more subcutaneous abscesses being treated with LA.

Telemedicine has shown potential for patients to remotely access support, communicate progress with their medical team and enhance patient empowerment. We conducted a systematic review of smartphone applications for ERAS following colorectal surgery measuring patient outcomes and experience. METHOD: The review was performed adhering to PRISMA guidelines, using search terms pertaining to ERAS, colorectal surgery, and mobile applications via electronic databases. All peer-reviewed English articles were assessed for inclusion and quality by two reviewers. A qualitative analysis was conducted to evaluate methodologies, patient experience, and outcomes. RESULTS: 206 abstracts were identified from which 5 articles (2 RCTs and 3 cohorts) were included in the analysis. Studies surveyed patient adherence to ERAS, LOS, readmission, intra and postoperative complications. Four studies recorded patient satisfaction, whilst one assessed quality of life and application validation. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights paucity in the use of smartphone applications after ERAS in colorectal surgery but demonstrates high patient satisfaction levels. Service delivery in the NHS has increasingly moved to a virtual platform during the coronavirus pandemic. More research and engagement in the development and use of smartphone applications would enhance care for patients.","Aseem, R; Cribb, E; Liccardo, F; Daulatzai, N; Smith, J; Pawa, N",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135972/,319

53940,“No More Insecurities”: New Alternative Masculinities' Communicative Acts Generate Desire and Equality to Obliterate Offensive Sexual Statements,2021-05-25,"Gauging viral transmission through human mobility in order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic has been a hot topic in academic studies and evidence-based policy-making. Although it is widely accepted that there is a strong positive correlation between the transmission of the coronavirus and the mobility of the general public, there are limitations to existing studies on this topic. For example, using digital proxies of mobile devices/apps may only partially reflect the movement of individuals; using the mobility of the general public and not COVID-19 patients in particular, or only using places where patients were diagnosed to study the spread of the virus may not be accurate; existing studies have focused on either the regional or national spread of COVID-19, and not the spread at the city level; and there are no systematic approaches for understanding the stages of transmission to facilitate the policy-making to contain the spread. To address these issues, we have developed a new methodological framework for COVID-19 transmission analysis based upon individual patients’ trajectory data. By using innovative space–time analytics, this framework reveals the spatiotemporal patterns of patients’ mobility and the transmission stages of COVID-19 from Wuhan to the rest of China at finer spatial and temporal scales. It can improve our understanding of the interaction of mobility and transmission, identifying the risk of spreading in small and medium-sized cities that have been neglected in existing studies. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and its policy implications to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cheng, Tao; Lu, Tianhua; Liu, Yunzhe; Gao, Xiaowei; Zhang, Xianghui",Comput.Urban Sci.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8175192/,319

54398,Pneumologen: Weaning-Regelungen dringend erforderlich,2021-06-25,"BACKGROUND: From March 10 to May 3, 2020, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and subsequent enforced lockdown in Italy has led to an increased general psychological distress(1). In particular, people with both compromised immune function and pre-existing physical or psychiatric problems are at increased risk of adverse psychosocial outcomes(2). The purpose of this study was to compare mental health burden in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) paediatric patients with and without COVID-19 lockdown exposure. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study comparing mental health outcomes of two matched 1:1 IBD paediatric groups: Group 1 - before the exposure (January 2019-September 2019) and Group 2 - after COVID-19 pandemic lockdown (April 2020-December 2020). Matching criteria included gender, age, disease duration, IBD subtype, Body Mass Index and disease activity (remission or active). This study included patients with Crohn Disease (CD) and Ulcerative Colitis (UC), >12 years, attending outpatient visits at Bambino Gesù Children Hospital. Data were collected using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) for anxiety and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression. We have estimated the prevalence of anxiety and depression between the two groups. Both groups were also compared with respect to the average score of anxiety and depression symptoms. Sociodemographic and clinical data were recorded from patients’ medical chart. RESULTS: A total of 108 IBD paediatric patients (62 males, 54 with CD and 54 with UC, mean age=16±2,5 years) was enrolled in this study. Out of these, 54 patients were enrolled in Group 1 and 54 in Group 2. Using a cut-off score ≥10, we found similar prevalence of anxiety (13.0% vs 22.2%, P=.206) and depression (13.0% vs 18.5%, P=.428) among the groups. Average scores were quite similar among the two groups, both for anxiety (5.78 vs 5.96, P=.924) and depression (5.89 vs 5.87, P=. 704). Symptom severity levels were mild (≃6) in both groups, according to standardized instrument cut-offs. No significant associations were found between disease activity and symptoms of anxiety and depression in both groups. CONCLUSION: IBD-related symptoms (i.e. weight loss, persistent diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fatigue) lead to severe psychosocial impairment in paediatric IBD patients. COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and enforced isolation (i.e., lockdown, long distance learning, and social restrictions) limited patients’ stressful social situations engagement and paradoxically prevented a worsening of their mental health.

We examined the influence of IBD activity (reflected by Physician Global Assessment (PGA)) on COVID-19 severity, while exploring the modifying effect of age. METHODS: We analyzed 3,028 cases reported to SECURE-IBD from March 13-November 17, 2020. PGA was categorized as remission/mild (reference) vs moderate vs severe. Outcomes used as surrogates of severe SARS-CoV2 infection were hospitalization and a composite of ICU/ventilation/death. Using generalized estimating equations (GEE) to account for clustering by country, we determined the unadjusted association between disease activity and COVID-19 outcomes, overall and by age decade. We included the following covariates in multivariable GEE models a priori: time of COVID-19 diagnosis, age, sex, comorbidities (0, 1, ≥2), IBD type, systemic corticosteroids (CS), anti-TNF monotherapy, anti-TNF plus immune modulator, immune modulator monotherapy, and mesalamine. We included additional covariates (country GDP, race, BMI, anti-integrins and ustekinumab) if they changed the estimate by ≥10%. We also built models stratified by age; the age cut-off for stratification was determined using Joinpoint regression (selecting the age at which outcome rates significantly changed). RESULTS: COVID-19 was more severe in patients with more active IBD: hospitalization rates 19% (remission/mild), 26% (moderate) and 45% (severe); ICU/ventilation/death rates 5% (remission/mild), 6% (moderate) and 12% (severe) (p<0.05, Figure 1). In unadjusted analyses, higher PGA was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (moderate: OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.24–1.88; severe: OR 3.30, 95% CI 2.44–4.46) and ICU/ventilation/death (moderate: OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.10–1.87; severe: OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.71–3.90). As per Figure 2, the magnitude of association between severe PGA (vs remission/mild) and adverse outcomes was greatest in patients ≤50 years. Joinpoint regression also supported a significant change in the rate of ICU/ventilation/death at 50 years. In multivariable analyses (Figure 3), PGA remained significantly associated with hospitalization, but not ICU/ventilation/death. However, in multivariable analyses stratified by age, PGA was consistently associated with both hospitalization and ICU/ventilation/death in patients ≤50, but not >50 years. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: Our data suggest an association between IBD activity, as assessed by PGA, and severe COVID-19 outcome with an increased risk in younger patients.

55025,Identification of water use behavior and calculation of water footprint: a case study,2021-06-29,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Controlling microbial infections, especially nosocomial infection, is a task that continues to be a burden in many societies. The current pandemic has brought new concerns on this matter, mainly on how to better control the dissemination of microbial agents in the environment/surfaces and among humans. Therefore, the search for alternative methods and agents for disinfection is warranted. The aim of our study was to analyze the disinfecting potential of ozonized water in different in vitro tests. By performing microbiological and cell lineage in vitro assays, the biocidal effect of ozonized water was confirmed. Upon a short incubation time, bacterial strains and a yeast were killed by ozonized water, whereas there was no cytotoxicity in the mammalian cell line. These findings lead to the conclusion this agent can be safely tested in technologies for water spray disinfection devices. ABSTRACT: O(3) dissolved in water (or ozonized water) has been considered a potent antimicrobial agent, and this study aimed to test this through microbiological and in vitro assays. The stability of O(3) was accessed following modifications of the physicochemical parameters of water, such as the temperature and pH, with or without buffering. Three concentrations of O(3) (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 ppm) dissolved in water were tested against different microorganisms, and an analysis of the cytotoxic effects was also conducted using the human ear fibroblast cell line (Hfib). Under the physicochemical conditions of 4 °C and pH 5, O(3) remained the most stable and concentrated compared to pH 7 and water at 25 °C. Exposure to ozonized water resulted in high mortality rates for Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. Scanning electron micrograph images indicate that the effects on osmotic stability due to cell wall lysis might be one of the killing mechanisms of ozonized water. The biocidal agent was biocompatible and presented no cytotoxic effect against Hfib cells. Therefore, due to its cytocompatibility and biocidal action, ozonized water can be considered a viable alternative for microbial control, being possible, for example, its use in disinfection processes.","dos Santos, Laerte Marlon Conceição; da Silva, Eduardo Santos; Oliveira, Fabricia Oliveira; Rodrigues, Leticia de Alencar Pereira; Neves, Paulo Roberto Freitas; Meira, Cássio Santana; Moreira, Greta Almeida Fernandes; Lobato, Gabriela Monteiro; Nascimento, Carlos; Gerhardt, Marcelo; Lessa, Arlene Souza; Mascarenhas, Luis Alberto Breda; Machado, Bruna Aparecida Souza",Biology (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231602/,319

55233,Produkte,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND: SARS‐CoV‐2, a ssRNA virus in the same coronavirus family as SARS‐CoV‐1, is responsible for causing COVID‐19, a respiratory disorder with symptoms ranging from mild flu‐like symptoms to severe respiratory distress and organ failure. There is evidence of increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and other interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) due to innate immune activation. These have been linked with severity of symptoms and clinical outcomes of infected patients. However, there is still little known about the expression of one particular ISG, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR), more specifically ADAR1p150 isoform that in addition to its role in transcriptome diversity is also responsible for fighting off viral infections by editing viral RNA. Genomes of both SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2 have been shown to experience RNA editing that in turn influences viral evolution. However, the effects of altered ADAR editing patterns in the host transcriptome in coronavirus infections have not been explored. We hypothesize that changes to ADAR editing patterns, driven by differential expression of ADAR during viral infection, negatively affect protein structure and function. Changes in ADAR editing profiles can help explain underlying molecular mechanisms of the broad spectrum of symptoms seen in patients with COVID‐19. METHODS: Here we use a publicly available RNA sequencing dataset with intestinal (Caco2), lung epithelial (Calu3) and lymph node (H1299) cell lines infected with SARS‐CoV‐1 and SARS‐CoV‐2 to map differential ADAR editing patterns during infection. We used our previously developed RNA‐seq pipeline AIDD (Automated Isoform Diversity Detector) to explore immune gene expression profiles and map ADAR editing landscapes using machine learning, including Guttman scaling and random forest analysis. RESULTS: There is significantly higher expression of ADAR1p150 isoform in lung epithelial cell line, but not in the intestinal cell line or the lymph node cell line in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Additionally, expression of ADAR1p150 is highly correlated with identification of ADAR editing sites with high and moderate impact on protein structure and function in SARS‐CoV‐1 in lung epithelium, but is negatively correlated in intestinal cells. SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected cells show similar patterns; however, the strength of the correlation is moderate. These results indicate differential ADAR editing in protein coding regions seen in SARS‐CoV‐1 and ‐2 infections may play a role in molecular mechanisms underlying clinical symptoms seen during infection. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic changes to protein structure and function like those caused by ADAR editing can help shed light on the pathogenesis of COVID‐19 and may provide novel investigative avenues for therapeutic options.","Plonski, Noel‐Marie; Nitirahardjo, Caroline; Meindl, Richard; Piontkivska, Helen",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239681/,319
55236,Meta-analysis on the Market Development of Electrified Vehicles,2021-07-01,"To date the COVID‐19 pandemic has resulted in over 90 M infections and 1.8 M deaths worldwide, and the numbers continue to rise. The causative virus, SARS–CoV‐2, is a betacoronavirus that binds to cells through an interaction between the viral Spike protein (S) and its receptor (ACE2) on the host cell. The S protein is a 180 kDa glycoprotein comprised of a receptor binding domain, trimerization domain, proteolytic cleavage sites, a single transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail. In addition to receptor binding, the S protein plays a key role in viral membrane fusion during the virus entry and virus induced cell‐cell fusion. The cytoplasmic tail of the Spike has several conserved cysteines that have previously been shown to be palmitoylated in SARS‐CoV and MERS. Recently it was reported in an interactome study (Gordon, D.E et al, 2020) that zDHHC5 and Golga7 are among the top Spike interacting proteins. These two proteins form a complex that functions as palmitoyl‐transferase. To investigate the functional significance of palmitoylation on SARS‐CoV‐2 S protein function and viral infection, we created luciferase/ZsGreen reporter containing HIV‐1 derived viral particles pseudo‐typed with full length wild‐type and mutant SARS CoV‐2 S. Using an Acyl‐PEGyl Exchange Gel‐Shift (APEGS) assay, we show that Spike is palmitoylated on multiple sites. Then, a series of functional assays were carried out to examine the role of Spike palmitoylation on viral egress, viral infection, and Spike protein trimerization, cleavage and fusion. Our results support the hypothesis that palmitoylation inhibitors may be a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit SARS CoV2 and other corona viruses infections","Ramadan, Ahmed; Deschenes, Robert; Roy, Arunava",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239685/,319

However, direct studies on OT levels or clinical trials with this exogenous hormone in patients with PTSD led to inconsistent findings. Therefore, the aim of the present study was at exploring and comparing the plasma OT levels in a group of patients with PTSD and matched healthy subjects as the control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-six outpatients (13 men, 13 women, mean age: 40.3 ± 11.5 years) suffering from PTSD, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), and 26 healthy subjects (13 men, 13 women, mean age: 43.8 ± 12.7 years) were included. The patients were assessed through the structured clinical interview for DSM-5 research version, patient edition (SCID-I/P), and the Impact for Event Scale revised (IES-R). All fasting subjects underwent three venous blood samples for the subsequent oxytocin radioimmunoassay. We used unpaired Student’s t-test to assess OT levels and the intergroup difference of demographic characteristics, while anxiety, avoidance, and hyperarousal scores were compared among groups adjusting for the effect of gender and age by means of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The correlations between different variables were investigated by Pearson’s method. RESULTS: The most common traumatic events of patients with PTSD were the following: severe car accident, physical violence, sexual violence, sudden death of a loved one, and natural disaster. The IES total score was 55 ± 15. Student’s t-test revealed that the patients showed significantly lower OT levels (mean ± SD, pg/ml) than healthy control subjects (4.37 ± 1.61 vs 5.64 ± 2.17, p < 0.001). We detected no correlation between the IES total score, subscales, or single items and OT plasma levels. Again, no difference between men and women was detected in the patients’ group, while healthy control women showed higher OT levels than men. DISCUSSION: Our study, while reporting the presence of decreased plasma OT levels in outpatients with PTSD of both sexes, as compared with healthy control subjects, would support the possible involvement of OT in the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, given the complexity of the clinical picture, future investigations are necessary to better deepen the role and level of OT in PTSD.","Carmassi, Claudia; Marazziti, Donatella; Mucci, Federico; Della Vecchia, Alessandra; Barberi, Filippo Maria; Baroni, Stefano; Giannaccini, Gino; Palego, Lionella; Massimetti, Gabriele; Dell’Osso, Liliana",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8280334/,319

The manuscript explores radiomics approaches in different fields of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, including esophageal cancer, lung cancer, sarcoma and rectal cancer in order to shed a light in the setting of neoadjuvant radiotherapy that can be used to tailor the best subsequent therapeutical strategy. ABSTRACT: Introduction: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy is currently used mainly in locally advanced rectal cancer and sarcoma and in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal cancer, whereas in other diseases it is under investigation. The evaluation of the efficacy of the induction strategy is made possible by performing imaging investigations before and after the neoadjuvant therapy and is usually challenging. In the last decade, texture analysis (TA) has been developed to help the radiologist to quantify and identify the parameters related to tumor heterogeneity, which cannot be appreciated by the naked eye. The aim of this narrative is to review the impact of TA on the prediction of response to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and or chemoradiotherapy. Materials and Methods: Key references were derived from a PubMed query. Hand searching and ClinicalTrials.gov were also used. Results: This paper contains a narrative report and a critical discussion of radiomics approaches in different fields of neoadjuvant radiotherapy, including esophageal cancer, lung cancer, sarcoma, and rectal cancer. Conclusions: Radiomics can shed a light on the setting of neoadjuvant therapies that can be used to tailor subsequent approaches or even to avoid surgery in the future.

56451,The thermodynamics of black holes: from Penrose process to Hawking radiation,2021-08-05,"The entire H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viral genomes were identified in the frozen autopsy specimens: the trachea, lung, colon, and intestinal feces from a patient who died of the disease in 2006. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral genomes showed that these viruses belonged to clade 1 and were the reassortants generated from the reassortment of the viruses within the same clade. The sequencing data from the autopsy specimens revealed at least 8 quasispecies of the H5N1 viruses across all 4 specimen types. These sequences were compared to those derived from the virus isolates grown in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The virus isolates from the trachea, lung, and fecal specimens showed 27 nucleotide substitutions, leading to the changes of 18 amino acid residues. However, there was no change in the amino acid residues that determined the viral virulence. The changes were more commonly observed in the lung, particularly in the HA and NA genes. Our study suggested that the adaptation changes for the viral fitness to survive in a new host species (MDCK cells) might involve many genes, for example, the amino acid substitution 177G or 177W adjacent to the receptor-binding residues in the HA1 globular head and the substitution M315I in PB2. However, a mutation changes near the receptor binding domain may play an important role in determining the cell tropism and is needed to be further explored.","Sangsiriwut, Kantima; Noisumdaeng, Pirom; Uiprasertkul, Mongkol; Prasertsopon, Jarunee; Payungporn, Sunchai; Auewarakul, Prasert; Ungchusak, Kumnuan; Puthavathana, Pilaipan",Biomed Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8323515/,319

It can be obtained via extraction and separation from plants or total synthesis. Plenty of experiments have suggested that osthole exhibited multiple biological activities covering antitumor, anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, osteogenic, cardiovascular protective, antimicrobial, and antiparasitic activities. In addition, there has been some research done on the optimization and modification of osthole. This article summarizes the comprehensive information regarding the sources and modification progress of osthole. It also introduces the up-to-date biological activities of osthole, which could be of great value for its use in future research.

Nurses at primary healthcare (PHC) facilities can play an important role through nursing presence in enhancing MHCUs’ medication adherence. AIM: This article aimed to investigate the relationship between MHCUs’ self-reported medication adherence and their perception of the nursing presence by registered nurses in PHC. SETTING: An urban health district in Gauteng province, South Africa. METHODS: A quantitative, descriptive correlational, cross-sectional design was used. The sample included 180 MHCUs. Data were collected using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale and the Presence of Nursing Scale. RESULTS: The overall adherence level of respondents was partially adherent, with an average score of 6.45 out of a total score of 10. Respondents also reported a low level of perceived nursing presence demonstrated by registered nurses, with an average score of 72.2 out of 125. The results indicated a positive correlation between respondents’ self-reported medication adherence and their perceived nursing presence of registered nurses as evidenced by the positive value of the correlation coefficient of 0.69 with a corresponding significance probability value of 0.000 (r = 0.69; p = 0.00). CONCLUSION: The level of perceived nursing presence demonstrated by registered nurses played a significant role in influencing MHCUs’ level of medication adherence. The registered nurses can improve MHCUs’ medication adherence by demonstrating nursing presence skills such as good listening skills and taking care of MHCUs as individuals and not as a disease. CONTRIBUTION: The results of this study confirm that there is a correlation between nursing presence and medication adherence. This holds significant value for future research in nursing presence. These findings also provide registered nurses in PHC with a valuable tool to improve medication adherence, namely nursing presence.","Kalimashe, Lillian; du Plessis, Emmerentia",Health SA,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8335782/,319

This analysis relied on data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Report on the Global Tobacco Epidemic from 2015, 2017, and 2019, and national regulations were analyzed to determine their consistency with WHO criteria. Significant progress has been made in implementation of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in the Americas. By 2020, most countries had regulations on 100% smoke-free environments in indoor public places, workplaces, and public transport, and large graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging. The number of countries that ban tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship and that tax tobacco at the minimum level recommended by WHO has doubled since 2016. However, the 2022 targets have not yet been reached for any of these measures or for ratification of the relevant international agreements. Although progress has been made in the Region, it has not been uniform. Unless the pace of application of the tobacco control measures contained in the Strategy and Plan of Action accelerates, it is unlikely that its targets will be met.

57012,Certain Investigation on Healthcare Monitoring for Enhancing Data Transmission in WSN,2021-08-24,"The numerous beneficial health outcomes associated with the use of metformin to treat patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), together with data from pre-clinical studies in animals including the nematode, C. elegans, and mice have prompted investigations into whether metformin has therapeutic utility as an anti-aging drug that may also extend lifespan. Indeed, clinical trials, including the MILES (Metformin In Longevity Study) and TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin), have been designed to assess the potential benefits of metformin as an anti-aging drug. Preliminary analysis of results from MILES indicate that metformin may induce anti-aging transcriptional changes; however it remains controversial as to whether metformin is protective in those subjects free of disease. Furthermore, despite clinical use for over 60 years as an anti-diabetic drug, the cellular mechanisms by which metformin exerts either its actions remain unclear. In this review, we have critically evaluated the literature that has investigated the effects of metformin on aging, healthspan and lifespan in humans as well as other species. In preparing this review, particular attention has been placed on the strength and reproducibility of data and quality of the study protocols with respect to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of metformin. We conclude that despite data in support of anti-aging benefits, the evidence that metformin increases lifespan remains controversial. However, via its ability to reduce early mortality associated with various diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline and cancer, metformin can improve healthspan thereby extending the period of life spent in good health. Based on the available evidence we conclude that the beneficial effects of metformin on aging and healthspan are primarily indirect via its effects on cellular metabolism and result from its anti-hyperglycemic action, enhancing insulin sensitivity, reduction of oxidative stress and protective effects on the endothelium and vascular function.","Mohammed, Ibrahim; Hollenberg, Morley D.; Ding, Hong; Triggle, Chris R.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8374068/,319
57021,2021 SMST Founders’ Grant,2021-08-24,"BACKGROUND: Graph theory and machine learning have been shown to be effective ways of classifying different stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Most previous studies have only focused on inter-subject classification with single-mode neuroimaging data. However, whether this classification can truly reflect the changes in the structure and function of the brain region in disease progression remains unverified. In the current study, we aimed to evaluate the classification framework, which combines structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) metrics, to distinguish mild cognitive impairment non-converters (MCInc)/AD from MCI converters (MCIc) by using graph theory and machine learning. METHODS: With the intra-subject (MCInc vs. MCIc) and inter-subject (MCIc vs. AD) design, we employed cortical thickness features, structural brain network features, and sub-frequency (full-band, slow-4, slow-5) functional brain network features for classification. Three feature selection methods [random subset feature selection algorithm (RSFS), minimal redundancy maximal relevance (mRMR), and sparse linear regression feature selection algorithm based on stationary selection (SS-LR)] were used respectively to select discriminative features in the iterative combinations of MRI and network measures. Then support vector machine (SVM) classifier with nested cross-validation was employed for classification. We also compared the performance of multiple classifiers (Random Forest, K-nearest neighbor, Adaboost, SVM) and verified the reliability of our results by upsampling. RESULTS: We found that in the classifications of MCIc vs. MCInc, and MCIc vs. AD, the proposed RSFS algorithm achieved the best accuracies (84.71, 89.80%) than the other algorithms. And the high-sensitivity brain regions found with the two classification groups were inconsistent. Specifically, in MCIc vs. MCInc, the high-sensitivity brain regions associated with both structural and functional features included frontal, temporal, caudate, entorhinal, parahippocampal, and calcarine fissure and surrounding cortex. While in MCIc vs. AD, the high-sensitivity brain regions associated only with functional features included frontal, temporal, thalamus, olfactory, and angular. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that our proposed method could effectively predict the conversion of MCI to AD, and the inconsistency of specific brain regions provides a novel insight for clinical AD diagnosis.","Zhang, Tingting; Liao, Qian; Zhang, Danmei; Zhang, Chao; Yan, Jing; Ngetich, Ronald; Zhang, Junjun; Jin, Zhenlan; Li, Ling",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8375594/,319

57294,Influencing factors on thermal comfort and biosignals of occupant-a review,2021-09-01,"STUDY QUESTION: This cross-sectional survey sought the views of women seeking fertility treatment on the impact of the COVID–19 pandemic on their fertility treatment and attitudes. SUMMARY ANSWER: Most respondents worried the recommendations to postpone treatment would reduce their chances of pregnancy and were concerned about negative effects of SARS-Cov–2 infections on pregnancy. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In spring 2020, the recommendations of ESHRE and German professional societies to postpone fertility treatments resulted in limited or closed services from mid-March to early May in many clinics. Previous studies reported that postponing fertility clinic appointments causes psychological distress, with most patients saying they would have preferred to continue treatment. While no similar studies are available from Germany, where COVID–19 incidence was relatively low, concerns of the patients about possible consequences of a treatment delay and a SARS-CoV–2 infection on fertility and pregnancy remain unknown. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional, anonymous, online questionnaire was completed in June-December 2020 by 249 women attending fertility clinics across Germany. The women were recruited using leaflets, directly by study personnel either in person or by telephone, or via online support group forums for fertility patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: All women seeking treatment in fertility clinics were eligible to participate. The online survey covered questions about the patient’s quality of life, their opinions about the professional societies’ recommendations and their effects as well as any concerns about infection with SARS-CoV–2. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS Version 27. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Three-quarters of participants disagreed with the pausing of fertility treatments. Women who participated from October-December 2020, when the incidence rate was high, were as likely to disagree as participants that participated from June-September 2020 (73% vs 79%, p = 0.3). Nearly all participants (95%) were concerned that treatment delays would reduce their chances of pregnancy. 72 participants (29%) had their appointments cancelled. Nearly all (97%) reported being upset by this, with 40 (56%) reporting that they were extremely or very disappointed about the cancellation. Women coming for follow-up appointments and women who had to wait 10 weeks or longer were more likely to be upset by the postponement or cancellation of their appointment (p = 0.016 and p = 0.012, respectively). Nearly all (97%) of the participants were worried about possible negative effects a SARS-CoV–2 infection might have related to their fertility, pregnancy or unborn child. Sixty-one percent stated they were very or moderately concerned about the negative influence the infection might have on the womańs own health during pregnancy and 60% were very to moderately concerned about potential negative effects for the unborn child. However, only 26% reported they were very or moderately concerned about the potential negative effects of an infection on fertility. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The main limitations of this study are the possibility of selection bias as people with strong opinions are more likely to have participated and the lack of information on non-responders due to the study design. Also, the Covid–19 pandemic is evolving continuously meaning that participantś opinions may vary over time. Wider implications of the findings: Postponement of treatments increased distress among patients and should be avoided when possible. If unavoidable, follow-up patients should be prioritised for treatment and the length of postponement should be minimised. Fertility clinics must provide information about the current state of knowledge of SARS-Cov–2 infections in pregnancies and options for immunization.

To preclinically predict these reactions in drug discovery research, a cell model that can precisely recapitulate the in vivo human intestinal monolayer is desired. In this study, we developed a monolayer platform using human biopsy-derived duodenal organoids for application to pharmacokinetic studies. The human duodenal organoid-derived monolayer was prepared by a simple method in 3–8 days. It consisted of polarized absorptive cells and had tight junctions. It showed much higher cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and carboxylesterase (CES)2 activities than did the existing models (Caco-2 cells). It also showed efflux activity of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and inducibility of CYP3A4. Finally, its gene expression profile was closer to the adult human duodenum, compared to the profile of Caco-2 cells. Based on these findings, this monolayer assay system using biopsy-derived human intestinal organoids is likely to be widely adopted.","Yamashita, Tomoki; Inui, Tatsuya; Yokota, Jumpei; Kawakami, Kentaro; Morinaga, Gaku; Takatani, Masahito; Hirayama, Daisuke; Nomoto, Ryuga; Ito, Kohei; Cui, Yunhai; Ruez, Stephanie; Harada, Kazuo; Kishimoto, Wataru; Nakase, Hiroshi; Mizuguchi, Hiroyuki",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8399089/,319

57603,Battery Raw Materials - Where from and Where to?,2021-09-10,"This article calls for greater attention to immigration attitudes of members of national parliaments (MPs) who absent harmonized immigration policy at the EU level remain the chief decision-makers and are thus responsible for swift government reaction to large influx of immigrants as witnessed in summer 2015 and spring 2020. Against this background, attitudes of MPs toward non-EU immigrants can be highly informative for understanding the foundation and direction of future immigration policy reforms. Although knowledge of MPs immigration attitudes is seemingly important, studies interested in this topic remain scarce. To test the relative importance of identity and economic aspects of MPs' immigration attitudes, this study adopts few well-established theoretical approaches from citizen-level research. Our data come from an MP survey that was administered in 11 Western and Eastern European countries in late 2014 as part of the European National Elites and the Crisis project. Our results suggest that social identity (religiosity) along with political ideology rather than economic concerns drive MPs' immigration attitudes. In addition, we find that in Eastern Europe immigration is only a light force behind political competition unlike in Western Europe, while economic left in Eastern Europe is more anti-immigrant than in Western Europe.

Parents were exposed to stress factors, which can be negatively associated with various psychological, social and physical aspects. OBJECTIVES: Investigation of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and well-being of university employees with daycare- and primary school-aged children. METHODS: Using a standardized online questionnaire, university employees in Saxony and Baden-Wuerttemberg were contacted and asked about their living and working situation during the coronavirus pandemic as well as their subjective well-being and health. RESULTS: The respondents perceive the changes in the social situation, the deterioration of the balance between work and private life and the blurring of boundaries between work and private time as particularly stressful. The respondents in Saxony show significantly worse ratings than in Baden-Wuerttemberg for various stress factors in relation to the work situation. In both states, slightly more than half of the respondents marked categories that indicate a lack of well-being.

Coping skills are an essential part of the Psychological immune system, which leads to successful adaptation. Due to COVID-19 most universities have changed their face-to-face teaching for online education. Nevertheless, there is little concrete empirical evidence on how this generation of students with the ongoing impacts of disruptive changes can cope with it. Colleges and universities need to make changes in order to retain this new generation of students. Our aim was to explore the characteristics and changes in coping skills of university students from three different age groups. Method: Psychological coping skills were measured by the Psychological Immune Competence Inventory (PICI). Differences were detected between generations. Group comparisons (pre-2004, pre-Covid, and post-Covid) groups were compared) using PICI subscales using independent sample analysis of variance. The sample consisted of 4,731 university students, 2,768 (58.5%) were men and 1,730 (36.56%) were women. Results: Students from 2004 showed significantly higher scores in the Self-regulation subsystem scale compared to students in the pre-Covid and post-Covid groups. Self-regulation subsystem: F(2, 2,569.607) = 444.375, p < 0.001, η(2) = 0.27: small effect, ω(2) = 0.27; Resilience: F(2, 2,372.117) = 1171.855, p < 0.001, η(2) = 0.14: small effect, ω(2) = 0.14. Based on the results, the explained variance ratio was at least 10% based on self-regulation and resilience. Conclusions: Psychological immune capacity of students seems to decrease through the years. Nonetheless, interventions may have a further facilitating role in the maintenance and development of psychological immunity during college years.","Takács, Rita; Takács, Szabolcs; T Kárász, Judit; Horváth, Zoltán; Oláh, Attila",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514630/,319

However, severe complications including tension pneumothorax and intrabronchial hemorrhage limit the application of needle biopsy. METHODS: A refined needle biopsy technique, named bronchus-blocked ultrasound-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy (BUS-PTNB), was performed on four intubated patients between August 2020 and April 2021. BUS-PTNB was done at bedside, following an EPUBNOW (evaluation, preparation, ultrasound location, bronchus blocking, needle biopsy, observation, and withdrawal of blocker) workflow. Parameters including procedure feasibility, sample acquisition, perioperative conditions, and complications were observed. Tissue specimens were sent to pathological examinations and microbial tests. RESULTS: Adequate specimens were successfully obtained from four patients. Diagnosis and treatment were correspondingly refined based on pathological and microbial tests. Intrabronchial hemorrhage occurred in patient 1 but was stopped by endobronchial blocker. Mild pneumothorax happened in patient 4 due to little air leakage, and closed thoracic drainage was placed. During the procedure, peripheral capillary hemoglobin oxygen saturation (SPO(2)), blood pressure, and heart rate of patient 4 fluctuated but recovered quickly. Vital signs were stable for patient 1–3. CONCLUSIONS: BUS-PTNB provides a promising, practical and feasible method in acquiring tissue specimen for critically ill patients under intratracheal intubation. It may facilitate the pathological diagnosis or other tissue-based tests for intubated patients and improve clinical outcomes.

We show that a unique stem-loop structure in the 5' domain of U3 is processed to form short RNA fragments that associate with Argonaute. miR-U3 production is independent of Drosha, and an increased amount of U3 in the cytoplasm in the absence of Dicer suggests that a portion of the full length snoRNA is exported to the cytoplasm where it is efficiently processed into miRNAs. Using reporter assays, we demonstrate that miR-U3 can act as a low proficiency miRNA in vivo and our data support the 3' UTR of the sortin nexin SNX27 mRNA as an endogenous U3-derived miRNA target. We further reveal that perturbation of U3 snoRNP assembly induces miR-U3 production, highlighting potential cross-regulation of target mRNA expression and ribosome production.","Lemus-Diaz, Nicolas; Ferreira, Rafael Rinaldi; Bohnsack, Katherine E; Gruber, Jens; Bohnsack, Markus T",Nucleic acids research,https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkaa549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609813/,319
61843,Coronavirus: hospitals must learn from past pandemics.,2020-02-01,"BACKGROUND Risk factors for severe SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy have not been extensively studied. This information can help guide the management of pregnant women with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE Examine risk factors for severe COVID-19 in pregnant women. METHODS We reviewed the records of all pregnant women with positive SARS-CoV2 tests (qRT-PCR) managed at a single tertiary private maternity in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We categorized women as having non-severe (mild or moderate) or severe (severe or critical) COVID-19. We conducted multivariable analyses to identify differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups as risk factors for severe COVID-19. RESULTS Between March 13 and June 7 2020, 114 women tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 80.7% (n = 92) had non-severe disease (69 mild, 23 moderate), 15.7% (n = 18) had severe, and 3.5% (n = 4) had critical COVID-19. Women with severe/critical COVID-19 (n = 22) were significantly older (35.0 ± 5.9 × 31.8 ± 5.1 years, p = 0.011), more likely to have at least one medical comorbidity (81.8% × 52.2%, p = .011) or a history of asthma (18.2% × 3.3%, p = .025), and tended to have a higher median body mass index (30.1 kg/m2, IQR 28.1-33.9 × 28.6, IQR 26.2-32.0, p = .056) than women with non-severe disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified four factors as independent predictors of severe/critical COVID-19: asthma (OR 34.469, 95% CI 1.151-78.030, p = .026), non-white ethnicity (OR 7.932, 95% CI 1.311-47.973, p = .024), maternal age with a best cutoff of ≥ 34 years (OR 1.195, 95% CI 1.001-1.427, p = .048) and gestational age at diagnosis with a best cut-off of ≥ 35 weeks (OR 0.876, 95% CI 0.780-0.983, p = .025). The predictive value of the model including all variables was 0.823 (p < .001). CONCLUSION A history of asthma, non-white ethnicity, and older maternal age were risk factors for, while higher gestational age was protective against severe/critical COVID-19 in pregnant Brazilian women.","Tutiya, Celso; Mello, Filomena; Chaccur, Gilberto; Almeida, Camila; Galvão, Elaine; Barbosa de Souza, Andressa Cristina; Kondo, Mario Macoto; Torloni, Maria Regina; Siaulys, Monica","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2021.1880561; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33535850/,319
62133,The explosion of new coronavirus tests that could help to end the pandemic.,2020-07-01,"Importance Cardiometabolic disease is responsible for decreased longevity and poorer cardiovascular outcomes in the modern era. Metabolite profiling provides a specific measure of global metabolic function to examine specific metabolic mechanisms and pathways of cardiometabolic disease beyond its clinical definitions. Objectives To define a molecular basis for cardiometabolic stress and assess its association with cardiovascular prognosis. Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective observational cohort study was conducted in a population-based setting across 2 geographically distinct centers (Boston Puerto Rican Health Study [BPRHS], an ongoing study of individuals enrolled between June 1, 2004, and October 31, 2009; and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities [ARIC] study, whose participants were originally sampled between November 24, 1986, and February 10, 1990, and followed up through December 31, 2017). Participants in the BPRHS were 668 Puerto Rican individuals with metabolite profiling living in Massachusetts, and participants in the ARIC study were 2152 individuals with metabolite profiling and long-term follow-up for mortality and cardiovascular outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed from October 1, 2018, to March 13, 2020. Exposure The primary exposure was metabolite profiles across both cohorts. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes included associations with multisystem cardiometabolic stress and all-cause mortality and incident coronary heart disease (in the ARIC study). Results Participants in the BPRHS (N = 668; 491 women; mean [SD] age, 57.0 [7.4] years; mean [SD] body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], 32.0 [6.5]) had higher prevalent cardiometabolic risk relative to those in the ARIC study (N = 2152; 599 African American individuals; 1213 women; mean [SD] age, 54.3 [5.7] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 28.0 [5.5]). Multisystem cardiometabolic stress was defined for 668 Puerto Rican individuals in the BPRHS as a multidimensional composite of hypothalamic-adrenal axis activity, sympathetic activation, blood pressure, proatherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, visceral adiposity, and inflammation. A total of 260 metabolites associated with cardiometabolic stress were identified in the BPRHS, involving known and novel pathways of cardiometabolic disease (eg, amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation). A parsimonious metabolite-based score associated with cardiometabolic stress in the BPRHS was subsequently created; this score was applied to shared metabolites in the ARIC study, demonstrating significant associations with coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality after multivariable adjustment at a 30-year horizon (per SD increase in metabolomic score: hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.31; P = .045 for coronary heart disease; and hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.07-1.24; P < .001 for all-cause mortality). Conclusions and Relevance Metabolites associated with cardiometabolic stress identified known and novel pathways of cardiometabolic disease in high-risk, community-based cohorts and were associated with coronary heart disease and survival at a 30-year time horizon. These results underscore the shared molecular pathophysiology of metabolic dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, and longevity and suggest pathways for modification to improve prognosis across all linked conditions.","Murthy, Venkatesh L; Yu, Bing; Wang, Wenshuang; Zhang, Xiuyan; Alkis, Taryn; Pico, Alexander R; Yeri, Ashish; Bhupathiraju, Shilpa N; Bressler, Jan; Ballantyne, Christie M; Freedman, Jane E; Ordovas, Jose; Boerwinkle, Eric; Tucker, Katherine L; Shah, Ravi",JAMA cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamacardio.2020.2686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32717046/,319
62413,Long-acting drug acts like a short-term AIDS vaccine.,2020-05-22,"INTRODUCTION The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a major worldwide health disorder. There is an increasing number of neurological complications recognized with COVID-19 including patients with GBS and its variants. DEVELOPMENT A review of the clinical cases of GBS associated to COVID-19 infection published in the last months has been developed. We included 48 patients (31 men, mean age 56.4 years). The most common COVID-19 symptoms were cough (60.4%) and fever (56.3%). Mean time from COVID-19 symptoms to neurologic manifestations was 12.1 days, but in nine patients (18.8%) developed GBS within seven days. Eleven patients (22.9%) presented cranial nerve involvement in the absence of muscle weakness; 36 presented the classic sensory motor variant (75%) and one had a pure motor variant (2.1%). The electrodiagnostic pattern was considered demyelinating in 82.4% of the generalized variants. The presence of hyposmia/dysgeusia was associated with a latency shorter than seven days to GBS onset of symptoms (30% vs 15.6%), and cranial nerve involvement in the absence of weakness (30.8% vs 17.1%). Most patients (87.5%) were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. Neurological outcome was favorable in 64.6%; 29.2% had respiratory failure and 4.2% died shortly after being admitted. CONCLUSIONS GBS in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection resembles clinically and electrophysiology the classical forms. Further studies are necessary to understand whether GBS frequency is actually increased due to SARS-CoV-2 infection and explore pathogenic mechanisms.","Zuberbühler, P; Conti, M E; León-Cejas, L; Maximiliano-González, F; Bonardo, P; Miquelini, A; Halfon, J; Martínez, J; Gutiérrez, M V; Reisin, R",Revista de neurologia,https://doi.org/10.33588/rn.7206.2020487; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710610/,319

64538,Podcast Extra: Coronavirus - science in the pandemic.,2020-03-17,"RATIONALE With refinements in the operative technique, laparoscopic surgery has become the standard practice for liver resection. In the field of living donor liver transplantation, a few centers adopted laparoscopic surgery as an alternative to conventional open donor hepatectomy, and the application of pure laparoscopic donor right hepatectomy has been limited to the donors with simple, favorable biliary anatomy. PATIENT CONCERNS The candidate donor was a 19-year-old woman with type 3a bile duct variation. INTERVENTIONS After confirming precise cutting points under the guidance of a radiopaque marker rubber band, the bile ducts were divided and the remnant stumps were closed with suture and clipping using Hem-o-lok, respectively. OUTCOMES The postoperative course was uneventful and she was satisfactory 6 months after surgery. LESSONS A laparoscopic donor hepatectomy for the living donor with biliary variation was feasible. Biliary variations are commonly encountered during living donor surgery, and we think that such variations in laparoscopic donor hepatectomy need to be overcome to expand the selection criteria.","Han, Young Seok; Ha, Heontak; Kwon, Hyung Jun; Chun, Jae Min",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000008076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28930845/,319

65586,Inoculum reduction and vector control on the temporal progress of citrus variegated chlorosis incidence.,2021-03-25,"BACKGROUND Gastric leak (GL) is one of the main early-onset postoperative complications of sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Many institutions perform routine upper gastrointestinal (UGI) contrast studies within 24 hours of surgery, looking for GL or gastric stenosis and to determine the need for urgent re-exploration, but this examination delays oral feeding, can cause side effects and is responsible for systematic and probably unnecessary irradiation of the patient. OBJECTIVE Determine the efficacy of routine UGI contrast studies to predict postoperative complications after SG in a large population. SETTING University hospital, France, public practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study consisted of retrospective review of a prospective database of a cohort of patients who underwent primary SG between January 2007 and August 2013 (n = 1137). Routine UGI contrast studies, performed on postoperative day 1, were independently reviewed by 2 radiologists. The primary endpoint of the study was the effect of routine UGI contrast study on detecting postoperative complications. The secondary endpoints were comparison of the findings of routine UGI contrast study and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, sensitivity, and specificity of different imaging signs on abdominal CT scan in the presence of GL, evaluation of the SG learning curve based on the findings of routine UGI contrast studies. RESULTS A total of 1137 patients underwent primary SG and 30 GL (2.6%) with a mean time to diagnosis of 23.4 days (1-245) and 15 cases of gastric stenosis (1.3%) were observed during the study period. Routine UGI study was performed in 1108 patients, whereas 29 patients were assessed by first-line CT scan. None of the 1108 UGI studies found a GL or gastric stenosis. In the 30 cases of GL, the most sensitive and specific sign was the presence of perigastric abscess without contrast material leak (sensitivity: 56.6%; specificity: 95%). The mean time interval between routine postoperative UGI contrast study and abdominal CT scan was 12.9 days (0-86). Uniform gastric shape was acquired after 30-32 SG procedures. CONCLUSION Routine postoperative UGI on postoperative day 1 is of limited value after SG. Abdominal CT scan should be preferred in the presence of clinical suspicion of postoperative complications. Selective UGI contrast study remains indicated when gastric stenosis is suspected and at the beginning of the SG learning curve.","Chivot, Cyril; Rebibo, Lionel; Robert, Brice; Dhahri, Abdennaceur; Regimbeau, Jean-Marc; Yzet, Thierry",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2017.02.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28330791/,319

We performed systematic review and meta-analysis of functional outcomes 1-3 years after treatment. Twenty-three studies were included, reporting on 3127 patients treated for HPV-OPSCC. Gastrostomy tube dependence failed to show statistically significant difference between surgery with adjuvant therapy and chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin at 12 months (8.3% [95% CI: 3.1-15.9] vs. 4.2% [1.1-9.2], p = 0.37) and 24-36 months (10.5% [95% CI: 3.2-21.5] vs. 3.3% [2.0-4.9], p = 0.06).

66336,An overview of epidemic models with phase transitions to absorbing states running on top of complex networks.,2021-01-01,"Of 1,000 pregnant women, one to two will experience venous thromboembolism (VTE) during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of maternal mortality and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) leads to maternal morbidity and may diminish quality of life due to post-thrombotic syndrome during the rest of a woman's life. Despite this important burden, the evidence base for the management of pregnancy-related VTE is weak. Recommendations from evidence-based guidelines are often extrapolated from the non-pregnant population and thus weak or conditional. As a consequence, there is wide variation of practice. In women with a suspicion of PE, the pregnancy-adapted YEARS algorithm is safe and efficient, with 39% of women not needing computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) to rule out PE. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) in therapeutic doses is the treatment of choice during pregnancy, and anticoagulation (LMWH or vitamin K antagonists [VKA] postpartum) should be continued until 6 weeks after delivery with a minimum total duration of 3 months. Use of LMWH or vitamin K antagonists does not preclude breastfeeding. Postpartum, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are an option if women do not breastfeed and long-term use is intended. Management of delivery, including the type of analgesia, requires a multidisciplinary approach and depends on local preferences and patient-specific conditions. Several options are possible and include waiting for spontaneous delivery with temporary interruption of LMWH. Prophylaxis for the prevention of recurrent VTE in subsequent pregnancies is indicated in most women with a history of VTE.","Middeldorp, Saskia; Ganzevoort, Wessel",Blood,https://doi.org/10.1182/blood.2019000963; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797192/,319

In contemporary psychiatry, it is commonly suggested that this connection is a causal connection that has been established through empirical discovery. Herein, I examine the extent to which this claim can be sustained. I argue that the connection between mental disorder and increased suicide risk is not wholly causal but is partly conceptual. This in part relates to the way suicidality is built into the definitions of some psychiatric diagnoses. It also relates to the broader normative assumption that suicidal behavior is by definition mentally disordered behavior. The above has significant epistemological implications, which I explore. I propose that the claim that suicide is connected with mental disorder cannot be justified solely by appealing to empirical evidence but also warrants a justification on conceptual and normative grounds.","Maung, Hane Htut",The Journal of medicine and philosophy,https://doi.org/10.1093/jmp/jhab015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34370029/,319

An overview is required of healthcare interventions improving and decreasing quality of life (QOL) for children with serious illness at the end of life. METHODS A systematic review was performed in five databases, January 2000 to July 2018 without language limit. Reviewers selected quantitative studies with a healthcare intervention, for example, medication or treatment, and QOL outcomes or QOL-related measures, for example, symptoms, for children aged 1-17 years with serious illness. One author assessed outcomes with the QualSyst and GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) Framework; two authors checked a 25% sample. QOL improvement or reduction was categorized. RESULTS Thirty-six studies met the eligibility criteria studying 20 unique interventions. Designs included 1 randomized controlled trial, 1 cross-sectional study, and 34 cohort studies. Patient-reported symptom monitoring increased QOL significantly in cancer patients in a randomized controlled trial. Dexmedetomidine, methadone, ventilation, pleurodesis, and palliative care were significantly associated with improved QOL, and chemotherapy, stem cell transplant, and hospitalization with reduced QOL, in cohort studies. CONCLUSIONS Use of patient-controlled symptom feedback, multidisciplinary palliative care teams with full-time practical support, inhalation therapy, and off-label sedative medication may improve QOL. Curative therapy may reduce QOL. IMPACT QOL for children at the end of life may be improved with patient-controlled symptom feedback, multidisciplinary palliative care teams with full-time practical support, inhalation therapy, and off-label sedative medication.QOL for children at the end of life may be reduced with therapy with a curative intent, such as curative chemotherapy or stem cell transplant.A comprehensive overview of current evidence to elevate currently often-failing QOL management for children at the end of life.New paradigm-level indicators for appropriate and inappropriate QOL management in children at the end of life.New hypotheses for future research, guided by the current knowledge within the field.Various healthcare interventions (as described above) could or might be employed as tools to provide relief in QOL management for children with serious illness, such as cancer, at the end of life, and therefore could be discussed in pediatrician end-of-life training to limit the often failed QOL management in this population, cave the one-size-fits-all approach for individual cases.Multidisciplinary team efforts and 24/7 presence, especially practical support for parents, might characterize effective palliative care team interventions for children with serious illness at the end of life, suggesting a co-regulating link between well-being of the child partly to that of the parentsHypothesis-oriented research is needed, especially for children with nonmalignant disorders, such as genetic or neurological disorders at the end of life, as well as QOL outcomes for intervention research and psychosocial or spiritual outcomes.","Piette, Veerle; Beernaert, Kim; Cohen, Joachim; Pauwels, Nele S; Scherrens, Anne-Lore; van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte; Deliens, Luc",Pediatric research,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-020-1036-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32645707/,319

Sociodemographic, health, and vaccination-related items were adapted from validated scales. Novel items measured trust in public health authorities, vaccinomics-related values, and preferences for federal funding: vaccinomics compared with vaccine issues and chronic diseases. Beginning and end of survey confidence in vaccine safety was measured to assess potential changes. Data were weighted to the U.S. Census. Vaccinomics-related concerns were stratified by sociodemographic characteristics, vaccine hesitancy status (composite outcome), reported serious vaccine reactions, and trust in public health authorities (PHA). Log binomial regression models estimated associations between these variables and agency to make vaccine-related decisions.Results: Most (70.7%, N = 1,925) respondents expected vaccinomics would increase their vaccine confidence compared to now. Agreement was highest among those without serious vaccine reaction experience (unexperienced: 74.2% versus experienced: 62.3%), with high trust in PHA (high: 83.3% versus low: 57.4%), and low vaccine hesitancy among parents of teenagers (low: 78.8% versus high: 62.5%) and adults without minor children (low: 79.8% versus high: 60.6%; all p < .01). Belief that vaccination was an individual's choice was associated with reported serious reactions (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR): 1.16; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.25) and low trust (aPR: 0.91; 0.84, 0.98).

OBJECTIVES We investigated the effect of home non-invasive ventilation (NIV) plus implementation of a call center following hospitalization for acute exacerbations of COPD (chronic obstructive lung disease) on NIV usage and readmissions. METHODS In this prospective pilot study, consecutive patients were screened at our institution for diagnosis of hypercarbic respiratory failure or COPD exacerbation from 2018 until 2019. Patients with more than 2 admissions in the last year were reviewed for eligibility. Of the 82 patients screened, 22 were eligible. There were 10 participants randomized to the intervention (NIV and call center) arm and 10 to NIV alone. RESULTS A total of 20 patients were randomized (mean age of 64, 45% males, BMI of 32). At three months, average usage was 32.1 days out of 90, 35%. When comparing the call center group to the standard group, there was a statistically significant difference in total days of device usage 48.7 compared to 15.5 (significant U-value of 16, critical value of U at p<.05 of 27) and cumulative use in hours 284 vs 87.7 (significant U-value of 20). Participants in the call center group were readmitted on average 4.2 times compared to 2.4 in the control group which was not statistically different (non-significant U-value of 42). In the follow up period, 9/20 (45%) of the participants died. CONCLUSION This pilot study highlights the challenges in implementing care for advanced COPD in a rural population. Our data suggests that telemedicine may favorably address therapy adherence.","Leonard, Rachel; Forte, Michael; Mehta, Devanshi; Mujahid, Hassan; Stansbury, Robert",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.13354; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33709528/,319
69819,Gel dosimetry provides the optimal end-to-end quality assurance dosimetry for MR-linacs.,2020-05-16,"Purpose: Viet Nam currently relies on a manual paper-based system to track and monitor 28 major infectious diseases. This inefficient system takes 2 or more months to complete. Method: We designed and pilot tested the use of text messaging to report certain infectious disease symptoms in rural areas of northern Viet Nam. The project was divided into three 6-month phases carried out in two provinces. The current analysis focuses on the implementation of a two-way feedback system between Phases II and III, which aims at (1) evaluating whether this system improves efficiency by determining the number of correctly (vs. incorrectly) formatted text messages; (2) assessing this system's influence on accuracy by comparing text messages with their respective official paper-based documented forms; and (3) determining whether the amount of information required to report through text messages influences the efficiency and accuracy of the text messages. Results: Between Phases II and III, results revealed a significant improvement in correctly formatted texts in comparison to incorrectly formatted texts. As the number of fields required to report increased, the number of correctly formatted texts (efficiency) as well as the number of matched text messages (accuracy) decreased. Conclusion: Our research demonstrates that an automated error bidirectional feedback system can significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of a Short Message Service-based method for disease surveillance. Also, our data may suggest that two-way communication has better engaged health care staff to follow reporting protocols as well as to maintain accuracy from their clinic's own data.","Wong, Jordan A; Dang, Linh Thuy; Phan, Ngoc Tran; Le, Thuy Kim; Vu, Nguyen Cong; Vu, Thiem Dinh; James, Spencer; Katona, Peter; Katona, Lindsay; Rosen, Joseph; Wong, Frank Y; Nguyen, Cuong Kieu",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0065; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32673154/,319

70480,Israel's high case plateau may offer worrisome portent.,2021-09-24,"BACKGROUND Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are a public health threat. Single-centre interventions, however, are likely to fail in the long term, as patients are commonly transferred between institutions given the economic integration across borders. A transnational approach targeting larger regions is needed to plan overarching sets of interventions. Here, we aim to describe differences in diagnostic and infection prevention and control (IPC) measures in the fight against MDROs. METHODS In 2019, we systematically assessed diagnostic algorithms and IPC measures implemented for detection and control of MDROs at three tertiary academic care centres (Freiburg; Strasbourg; Basel). Data were collected using a standardised data collection sheet to be filled in by every centre. Uncertainties were clarified by direct contact via telephone or email with the data supplier. Internal validity was checked by at least two researchers independently filling in the survey. RESULTS All centres have established a primarily culture-based, rather than a nucleic acid amplification-based approach for detection of MDROs (i.e., vancomycin-resistant Enterococci [VRE], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae [ESBL], carbapenemase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Gram-negatives [CPGN/CRGN]). IPC measures differed greatly across all centres. High-risk patients are screened for most MDROs on intensive care unit (ICU) admission in all centres; only the French centre is screening all patients admitted to the ICU for VRE, MRSA and ESBL. Patients colonised/infected by MRSA, quinolone-resistant ESBL Klebsiella spp. and CPGN/CRGN are isolated everywhere, whereas patients colonised/infected by VRE and ESBL are usually not isolated in the German centre. CONCLUSIONS In contrast to the French and Swiss centres, the German centre no longer uses isolation measures to control VRE and quinolone-susceptible ESBL. Overall, the French centre is more focused on intercepting MDRO transmission from outside, whereas the German and Swiss centres are more focused on intercepting endemic MDRO transmission. These findings point to important challenges regarding future attempts to standardise IPC measures across borders. .","Tschudin-Sutter, Sarah; Lavigne, Thierry; Grundmann, Hajo; Rauch, Julia; Eichel, Vanessa M; Deboscker, Stéphanie; Jaulhac, Benoit; Mutters, Nico T",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.20454; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705560/,319

Lower incidence of COVID-19 at high altitude: Facts and confounders. High Alt Med Biol 00:000-000, 2020.-The rapid transmission, increased morbidity, and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exhausted many health care systems and the global economy. Large variations in COVID-19 prevalence and incidence have been reported across and within many countries worldwide; however, this remains poorly understood. The variability and susceptibility across the world have been mainly attributed to differing socioeconomic status, burden of chronic diseases, access to health care, strength of health care systems, and early or late adoption of control measures. Environmental factors such as pollution, ambient temperature, humidity, and seasonal weather patterns at different latitudes may influence how severe the pandemic is and the incidence of infection in any part of the world. In addition, recent epidemiological data have been used to propose that altitude of residence may not only influence those environmental features considered key to lesser viral transmission, but also susceptibility to more severe forms of COVID-19 through hypoxic-hypobaria driven genomic or nongenomic adaptations specific to high-altitude populations. In this review, we critically examine these factors and attempt to determine based upon available scientific and epidemiological data whether living in high-altitude regions might be protective against COVID-19 as recent publications have claimed.","Pun, Matiram; Turner, Rachel; Strapazzon, Giacomo; Brugger, Hermann; Swenson, Erik R",High altitude medicine & biology,https://doi.org/10.1089/ham.2020.0114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716669/,319

72251,Food allergies: the psychological toll.,2020-12-01,"Introduction: The mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is frequently driven by an injurious immune response characterized by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), endotheliitis, coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure. This spectrum of hyperinflammation in COVID-19 is commonly referred to as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). Areas covered: Medline and Google Scholar were searched up until 15th of August 2020 for relevant literature. Evidence supports a role of dysregulated immune responses in the immunopathogenesis of severe COVID-19. CSS associated with SARS-CoV-2 shows similarities to the exuberant cytokine production in some patients with viral infection (e.g.SARS-CoV-1) and may be confused with other syndromes of hyperinflammation like the cytokine release syndrome (CRS) in CAR-T cell therapy. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha have emerged as predictors of COVID-19 severity and in-hospital mortality. Expert opinion: Despite similarities, COVID-19-CSS appears to be distinct from HLH, MAS, and CRS, and the application of HLH diagnostic scores and criteria to COVID-19 is not supported by emerging data. While immunosuppressive therapy with glucocorticoids has shown a mortality benefit, cytokine inhibitors may hold promise as ""rescue therapies"" in severe COVID-19. Given the arguably limited benefit in advanced disease, strategies to prevent the development of COVID-19-CSS are needed.

Not all about consumption.,2013,"In this laboratory-scale investigation on the applicability of the co-digestion of food waste with sewage sludge, evaluated were the effects of the single-stage versus two-stage operating modes at the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 15 days, and the impact of HRTs: 15 days vs. 25 days, on the single-stage operation. An average volatile solid reduction (VSR) of 61% and methane yield of 314 ml/g-VS were achieved in the two-stage operation (HRT 15 days), while comparable VSR of 57% and the methane yield of 325 ml CH4/g-VS could only be detected at a longer HRT at 25 days in the single-stage operation. The difference in the operating modes showed much higher influence on shaping the overall bacterial structures than the two HRTs of the single-stage operation. The one operational taxonomic unit (OTU) annotatable at the family level of Thermotogaceae was most abundant (> 10%) in all the methanogenic co-digestion consortia, and its dominant role was recognized to be independent of other OTU lineages in the community. OTUs in the phylum Proteobacteria were much more common as the persistent OTUs in the single-stage co-digestion consortia, while in the two-stage consortia, they were in the phylum Firmicutes.

This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

METHODS Consecutive patients of a tertiary care center with dedicated neurological emergency room (nER) were analyzed. The time period of the first lockdown in Germany (calendar weeks 12-17 2020) was retrospectively compared to the corresponding period in 2019 regarding the number of patients presenting to the nER, the number of patients with specific triage scores (Heidelberg Neurological Triage Score), the number of patients with stroke and the quality of stroke care. RESULTS 4330 patients were included. Fewer patients presented themselves in 2020 compared to 2019 (median per week: 134 [118-143] vs. 187 [182-192]; p=0.015). Median numbers of patients per week with triage 1 (emergent) and 4 (nonurgent) were comparable (51 [43-58] vs. 59 [54-62]; p=0.132 and 10 [4-16] vs. 16 [7-18]; p=0.310, respectively).The median number of patients per week declined in categories 2 and 3 in 2020 (41 [37-45] vs. 57 [52-61]; p=0.004 and 28 [23-35] vs. 61 [52-63]; p=0.002, respectively. No change was observed in the absolute number of strokes (138 in 2019 and 141 in 2020). Quality metrics of stroke revascularization therapies (symptom-to-door time, door-to-needle time or relative number of therapies) and stroke severity remained constant. CONCLUSION During the lockdown period in 2020, number of patients with emergent symptoms remained constant, while fewer patients with urgent symptoms were presented.

74570,Interview. A challenge to pseudoscience.,2014,"BACKGROUND Falls in care facilities and hospitals are common events that cause considerable morbidity and mortality for older people. This is an update of a review first published in 2010 and updated in 2012. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of interventions designed to reduce the incidence of falls in older people in care facilities and hospitals. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (August 2017); Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2017, Issue 8); and MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and trial registers to August 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials of interventions for preventing falls in older people in residential or nursing care facilities, or hospitals. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One review author screened abstracts; two review authors screened full-text articles for inclusion. Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We calculated rate ratios (RaR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for rate of falls and risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs for outcomes such as risk of falling (number of people falling). We pooled results where appropriate. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence. MAIN RESULTS Thirty-five new trials (77,869 participants) were included in this update. Overall, we included 95 trials (138,164 participants), 71 (40,374 participants; mean age 84 years; 75% women) in care facilities and 24 (97,790 participants; mean age 78 years; 52% women) in hospitals. The majority of trials were at high risk of bias in one or more domains, mostly relating to lack of blinding. With few exceptions, the quality of evidence for individual interventions in either setting was generally rated as low or very low. Risk of fracture and adverse events were generally poorly reported and, where reported, the evidence was very low-quality, which means that we are uncertain of the estimates. Only the falls outcomes for the main comparisons are reported here.Care facilitiesSeventeen trials compared exercise with control (typically usual care alone). We are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.20; 2002 participants, 10 studies; I² = 76%; very low-quality evidence). Exercise may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.18; 2090 participants, 10 studies; I² = 23%; low-quality evidence).There is low-quality evidence that general medication review (tested in 12 trials) may make little or no difference to the rate of falls (RaR 0.93, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.35; 2409 participants, 6 studies; I² = 93%) or the risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.09; 5139 participants, 6 studies; I² = 48%).There is moderate-quality evidence that vitamin D supplementation (4512 participants, 4 studies) probably reduces the rate of falls (RaR 0.72, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.95; I² = 62%), but probably makes little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.12; I² = 42%). The population included in these studies had low vitamin D levels.Multifactorial interventions were tested in 13 trials. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls (RaR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.18; 3439 participants, 10 studies; I² = 84%; very low-quality evidence). They may make little or no difference to the risk of falling (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.05; 3153 participants, 9 studies; I² = 42%; low-quality evidence).HospitalsThree trials tested the effect of additional physiotherapy (supervised exercises) in rehabilitation wards (subacute setting). The very low-quality evidence means we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls (RaR 0.59, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.34; 215 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%), or whether it reduces the risk of falling (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.93; 83 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%).We are uncertain of the effects of bed and chair sensor alarms in hospitals, tested in two trials (28,649 participants) on rate of falls (RaR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence) or risk of falling (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.24; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence).Multifactorial interventions in hospitals may reduce rate of falls in hospitals (RaR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.01; 44,664 participants, 5 studies; I² = 52%). A subgroup analysis by setting suggests the reduction may be more likely in a subacute setting (RaR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.83; 3747 participants, 2 studies; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the risk of falling (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.09; 39,889 participants; 3 studies; I² = 0%; very low-quality evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS In care facilities: we are uncertain of the effect of exercise on rate of falls and it may make little or no difference to the risk of falling. General medication review may make little or no difference to the rate of falls or risk of falling. Vitamin D supplementation probably reduces the rate of falls but not risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of multifactorial interventions on the rate of falls; they may make little or no difference to the risk of falling.In hospitals: we are uncertain of the effect of additional physiotherapy on the rate of falls or whether it reduces the risk of falling. We are uncertain of the effect of providing bed sensor alarms on the rate of falls or risk of falling. Multifactorial interventions may reduce rate of falls, although subgroup analysis suggests this may apply mostly to a subacute setting; we are uncertain of the effect of these interventions on risk of falling.","Cameron, Ian D; Dyer, Suzanne M; Panagoda, Claire E; Murray, Geoffrey R; Hill, Keith D; Cumming, Robert G; Kerse, Ngaire",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd005465.pub4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30191554/,319

The pKaMeCN([MHLn]+/[MLn) of paramagnetic hydrides in MeCN are estimated for the first time using the ligand acidity constant (LAC) equation where contributions to the pKaMeCN from each ligand are simply added together, with the sum corrected for effects of charge and 5d metals. The pKaLAC-MeCN([MHLn]+/MLn) of over 200 hydride complexes MHLn are used, along with their electrochemical potentials from the literature, in an uncommonly-applied thermochemical cycle in order to reveal systematic trends in the redox couples MIII/II (M = Cr, Mo, W), MnII/I, ReVI/V and ReIV/III, MIII/II (M = Fe, Ru, Os) and MIII/II and MII/I (M = Co, Rh and Ir) and allow the estimation of the bond dissociation free energies BDFE(MH) of the unoxidized hydrides MHLn and the prediction of the electrochemical potential for their oxidation. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are used to validate the pKaMeCN-LAC values of hydrides of WIII, MnII, FeIII, RuIII, CoII and NiIII. When a pKaLAC-MeCN is less than zero for a given complex [MHLn]+, the oxidation of MHLn is irreversible due to proton loss from the oxidized complex to the solvent. When pKaLAC-MeCN >> 0, the oxidation is reversible when there is no gross change in the coordination geometry upon a change in the redox state. Twenty seven paramagnetic hydrides prepared in bulk all have pKaLAC-MeCN >> 0.","Rennie, Benjamin; Eleftheriades, Renee; Morris, Robert H",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c08000; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941024/,319

We compared the epidemiological and evolutionary patterns of seasonal influenza epidemics in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, two adjacent cities in subtropical southern China. This comparison represents a unique natural experiment, as connectivity between these two cities has increased over the past decade. We found that, whilst summer influenza epidemics in Shenzhen used to peak 1-3 months later than those in Hong Kong, the difference decreased after 2005 (P<0.0001). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that influenza isolates from Shenzhen have become genetically closer to those circulating in Hong Kong over time (P = 0.045). Furthermore, although Shenzhen isolates used to be more distant from the global putative source of influenza viruses than isolates from Hong Kong (P<0.001), this difference has narrowed (P = 0.02). Overall, our study reveals that influenza activities show remarkably distinct epidemiological and evolutionary patterns in adjacent subtropical cities and suggests that human mobility patterns can play a major role in influenza dynamics in the subtropics.","Tan, Yi; Lam, Tommy Tsan-Yuk; Wu, Chunli; Lee, Shui-shan; Viboud, Cécile; Zhang, Renli; Weinberger, Daniel M",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.059998-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24310518/,319
75340,Spontaneous Crystallization in Systems of Binary Hard Sphere Colloids.,2020-05-29,"The sense of taste is rarely assessed quantitatively outside of a limited number of academic and industrial laboratories, despite its role in influencing nutrition, the flavor of foods and beverages, and protection against ingestion of spoiled and toxic foodstuffs. This dearth reflects, in part, practical limitations of most taste tests, most notably their reliance on liquid stimuli for stimulus presentation or rinsing. In this study, a novel portable taste test that requires neither liquid tastants nor liquid rinses is described and validated within a clinic population. This test, termed the Waterless Empirical Taste Test (WETT®), uses stimuli that are embedded in pads of monometer cellulose located on disposable plastic strips applied to the tongue's surface. The test-retest and split-half reliability coefficients of the WETT® were 0.92 and 0.88, respectively. These respective coefficients for sucrose, NaCl, citric acid, caffeine, and MSG were 0.82 and 0.80, 0.78 and 0.77, 0.56 and 0.73, and 0.84 and 0.84. The WETT® exhibited comparable, in some cases higher, sensitivity than two comparison taste tests, the Whole Mouth Taste Test and the Taste Quadrant Taste Test, to age, sex, etiology (head trauma vs. upper respiratory infections), and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) taste ability. This study demonstrates that a taste test that does not require liquids can be as reliable and sensitive as more traditional liquid-based taste tests to clinical alterations in taste function.","Doty, Richard L; Wylie, Crystal; Potter, Mark",Behavior research methods,https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-020-01463-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32885386/,319
75361,How the world failed to curb COVID.,2021-05-12,"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis occurs in renally impaired patients who have undergone contrast enhanced MR examination using intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agents. The effect of impaired kidney function on the biodistribution of gadolinium-based contrast agents was investigated using radiolabeled (153/Nat) gadolinium-DOTA, (153/Nat) gadolinium-DTPA, and (153/Nat) gadolinium-DTPA-BMA in a transgenic mouse model of renal impairment. Renally impaired animals had more activity associated with their tissues than did control mice, and this increase varied according to the radiotracer injected. For example, after 7 days, renally impaired animals that received (153/Nat) Gd-DOTA had 3-fold (P < 0.037) more activity in their bone tissue, whereas renally impaired animals receiving (153/Nat) Gd-DTPA and (153/Nat) Gd-DTPA-BMA had 8-fold (P < 0.0001) and 24-fold (P < 0.0001) more activity in their bone tissue, respectively. These findings demonstrate that renal impairment dramatically alters the tissue distribution of Gd(3+) ions in vivo, which are likely a critical factor in the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.","Wadas, Thaddeus J; Sherman, Christopher D; Miner, Jeffrey H; Duncan, James R; Anderson, Carolyn J",Magnetic resonance in medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.22553; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20648683/,319

We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of endovascular therapy (ET) in intravenous (IV) tPA-ineligible patients. METHODS Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected database of consecutive patients treated with ET within 6 hours of stroke onset between September 2010 and April 2015. Patients treated with IV-tPA followed by ET were compared with those treated with ET alone because of IV-tPA ineligibility. Efficacy and safety end points included the rates of good outcome (90-day modified Rankin scale score ≤2), successful reperfusion (modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia 2b-3), parenchymal hematoma (PH-1 and PH-2), and 90-day mortality. Univariate and logistic regression were performed to identify the predictors of outcomes. RESULTS A total of 422 patients were included. Two hundred and fifty-three (59%) patients received IV-tPA+ET, and 169 (41%), ET alone. Combined IV-tPA+ET patients were slightly younger (64.9±15.2 versus 67.9±14.9 years; P=0.05), more often males (56% versus 44%; P=0.01), and had less hypertension (70% versus 81%; P=0.02) and vertebrobasilar occlusions (3% versus 8%; P=0.02). The remaining baseline characteristics, including National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (20 [15-23] versus 19 [15-24]; P=0.85), Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS; 8 [7-9] versus 8 [7-9]; P=0.24), and stroke onset to puncture times (235±70 versus 240±81 minutes; P=0.27), were similar across both groups. There were no significant differences in the rates of modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia 2b-3 (83% versus 80%; P=0.52), 90-day modified Rankin scale score ≤2 (45% versus 38%; P=0.21), or any PH (3% versus 5%; P=0.21). Unadjusted 90-day mortality was higher with ET alone (21% versus 34%; P<0.01); however, IV-tPA ineligibility was not associated with modified Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia 2b-3, any PH, good outcome, or 90-day mortality on logistic regression. CONCLUSIONS IV-tPA-eligible and -ineligible patients seem to have similar outcomes after early ET.","Rebello, Letícia C; Haussen, Diogo C; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Belagaje, Samir; Lima, Andrey; Anderson, Aaron; Frankel, Michael R; Nogueira, Raul G",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.115.012586; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26906918/,319
76555,Time to look in the mirror.,2020-06-08,"PURPOSE The ASCO value framework allows physicians and patients to compare the relative value of novel treatments. Our aim was to assess the value of three frontline ovarian cancer therapies by using this framework. METHODS From phase III, randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) data, the net health benefits (NHBs) for three frontline ovarian cancer treatment options-dose-dense paclitaxel (Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group study JGOG 3016), intraperitoneal (IP)/intravenous (IV) chemotherapy (Gynecologic Oncology Group [GOG] study GOG 172), and concurrent plus maintenance bevacizumab (GOG 218 and the Seventh International Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm study [ICON7])-were calculated. The ASCO value framework calculates the NHB by using six criteria: clinical benefit, toxicity, tail of the curve, symptom palliation, treatment-free interval, and quality of life. Clinical benefit calculation uses ASCO-assigned importance weights for overall survival and progression-free survival. The maximum possible NHB points is 180. NHBs were presented alongside the drug-acquisition cost (DAC) of each therapy. A benefit-cost ratio of NHB points per additional cost was calculated. RESULTS The NHB of dose-dense paclitaxel was 38, at an additional cost of $16 per cycle. IP cisplatin/IV + IP paclitaxel received 29 NHB points, at an additional cost of $1,629 per cycle. Concurrent plus maintenance bevacizumab received 24 NHB points, at an additional cost of $7,581 per cycle (GOG 218) or six NHB points ($3,790 per cycle; ICON7). The ratios of NHB points-to-dollar were as follows: dose-dense paclitaxel, 2.4 (highest); IP chemotherapy, 0.018; and bevacizumab, 0.003 (lowest). CONCLUSION Using the ASCO value framework, we constructed value snapshots of three major frontline therapeutic options in ovarian cancer. Dose-dense paclitaxel provided the highest additional value when analysis accounted for NHB and cost. However, additional research is needed to include individual patient preferences and provide personalized value assessments.","Foote, Jonathan; Secord, Angeles Alvarez; Liang, Margaret; Cohn, David E; Jewell, Elizabeth; Havrilesky, Laura J",Journal of oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/jop.2017.025106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29016225/,319

WRKY transcription factors (TFs) are encoded by one of the largest families in plants and are involved in several biological processes such as growth and development, signal transduction, and plant defence against stress. In this study, 79 and 84 genes encoding putative WRKY TFs have been identified in two wild potato relatives, Solanum commersonii and S. chacoense. Phylogenetic analysis of WRKY proteins divided ScWRKYs and SchWRKYs into three Groups and seven subGroups. Structural and phylogenetic comparative analyses suggested an interspecific variability of WRKYs. Analysis of gene expression profiles in different tissues and under various stresses allowed to select ScWRKY045 as a good candidate in wounding-response, ScWRKY055 as a bacterial infection triggered WRKY and ScWRKY023 as a multiple stress-responsive WRKY gene. Those WRKYs were further studied through interactome analysis allowing the identification of potential co-expression relationships between ScWRKYs/SchWRKYs and genes of various pathways. Overall, this study enabled the discrimination of WRKY genes that could be considered as potential candidates in both breeding programs and functional studies.","Villano, Clizia; Esposito, Salvatore; D'Amelia, Vincenzo; Garramone, Raffaele; Alioto, Daniela; Zoina, Astolfo; Aversano, Riccardo; Carputo, Domenico",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-63823-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346026/,319

This impact has been particularly difficult in New York State, which experienced the largest number of COVID-19 cases and led to a state- mandated pause on all elective surgeries. As a result, physical and occupational therapists became the principal providers of care and had to adjust their workflow to ensure quality care. Understanding the perspectives and needs of therapists relative to the circumstances created by COVID-19 is critical to safe and effective care. The goal of this study was to define the perspectives of therapists in New York State regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their work. An email-based 20-question survey was distributed to 250 therapists from all 10 regions of New York State who treated outpatient orthopedic patients during the peak of the pandemic in early April 2020. The survey collected demographic and practice information as well as responses regarding several clinical practice issues. The results provide insight into the concerns of therapists regarding the delivery of care, and responses clarify indications for therapy and for the use of telemedicine to achieve goals during the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is profoundly impacting the work of therapists worldwide. Therapists responded to this survey expressing concerns about the safe delivery of care, access to personal protective equipment, use of telemedicine, and their role within health care during the pandemic.

METHODS In total, 1,386 participants who underwent abdominal US as part of health examinations between December 2008 and May 2014 were included in this retrospective study. We classified pancreatic echogenicity on a 4-point scale, and compared it using two distinct criteria: fatty pancreas (FP) 1 criterion (normal vs. ≥mild HP) and FP2 criterion (normal/mild HP vs. ≥moderate HP). According to the presence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), participants were subdivided into four groups: non-NAFLD and non-HP, isolated NAFLD, isolated HP, and HP with NAFLD. Glycemic progression was defined as progression from normoglycemia to prediabetes or diabetes or progression from prediabetes to diabetes. RESULTS During the follow-up (median, 5.9 years), 262 of the 1,386 participants developed glycemic progression. Using FP2, the probability of glycemic progression across the four subgroups showed cumulative aggravation for NAFLD and HP (all P<0.05). Isolated HP showed a higher probability of glycemic progression than isolated NAFLD according to FP2 (P<0.001). The highest probability of glycemic progression was observed in patients with both NAFLD and HP (P<0.001). The hazard ratio for glycemic progression increased with the severity of HP. CONCLUSION Increasing severity of HP on US was found to be significantly correlated with glycemic progression. Moreover, isolated HP of moderate or greater severity predicted glycemic progression independent of NAFLD.","Oh, Jiyun; Park, Hyun Jeong; Lee, Eun Sun; Park, Sung Bin; Choi, Byung Ihn; Ahn, Soohyun",Ultrasonography,https://doi.org/10.14366/usg.20122; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730774/,319

STUDY DESIGN Prospective, randomized study. ANIMALS Female cats (n = 24). METHODS After anesthesia induction, cats had short (Short LAP; n = 8) or long duration (Long LAP; n = 8) laparoscopic ovariectomy, or Open OVE (Open; n = 8) for comparison. Hemodynamic and pulmonary measurements were recorded after induction of anesthesia (T0), 5 minutes after abdominal insufflation had reached 6 mmHg of pressure (T1), after the 2nd ovary had been resected (T2), after abdominal decompression (T3), and at the end of anesthesia, after abdominal closure (T4). Hemodynamic and pulmonary variables were compared between groups. RESULTS Low-pressure abdominal insufflation caused cardiopulmonary changes in cats. At T1 and T2, Long LAP and Short LAP caused a significant change in PvCO2 and RC when compared with Open. During T3, RC was lower only in Long LAP. At T2, there was decrease in SV, but not CO for Long LAP when compared with Open.

The contribution by Ralston et al explores how COI management has itself become a terrain of contestation in their analysis of submissions on a draft World Health Organization (WHO) tool to manage COI conflicts in development of nutrition policy. The authors identify two camps in conflict with one another: a corporate side emphasizing their individual good intents and contributions, and an non-governmental organization (NGO) side maintaining inherent structural conflicts that require careful proscribing. The study concludes that the draft tool does a reasonable job in ensuring COI are avoided and policy development sheltered from corporate self-interests, introducing novel improvements in global governance for health. At the same time, the tool appears to adhere to a belief that private economic (corporate) and public good (citizen) conflicts can indeed be managed.

WHAT DOES THIS ARTICLE ADD Our study adds a longitudinal approach to emotional wellbeing and defines different groups of youths according to their evolution over a two-year period. Stress and perceived health status seem to be the most important factors related to emotional wellbeing. Our research shows the importance of health care professionals exploring psychological health, especially when a youth has atypical somatic complaints. This could allow the early detection of psychological problems and the provision of proper timely treatment. AIM OF THE STUDY To assess how emotional wellbeing evolves over a two-year period among youths in Switzerland, and to assess their characteristics. METHODS Data were obtained from the first and third waves of the GenerationFRee study (n = 1311, aged 15–24 at baseline). The sample was divided into four groups according to the evolution of their emotional wellbeing (WB): good at both waves (GoodWB: 67.9%), poor at T1 and good at T3 (BetterWB: 8.4%), good at T1 and poor at T3 (WorseWB: 13.2%), or poor at both waves (PoorWB: 10.4%). Significant variables at the bivariate level were included in a multinomial regression analysis using GoodWB as the reference category. Results are given as relative risk ratios (RRRs). RESULTS The BetterWB group reported more stress at T1 (RRR 1.34), as did the WorseWB group at T3 (1.43). Those in the WorseWB group were more likely to report poorer health status at T3 (6.51). Finally, the PoorWB group reported more stress at T1 (1.33) and T3 (1.44), and poorer health status at T1 (9.39) and T3 (5.75). Other variables not significant in all groups were perceived onset of puberty, having a chronic condition, area of residence and relationships with parents. CONCLUSION Using a longitudinal approach, stress and perceived health status seem to be the main factors that change with emotional wellbeing among youths. Inquiring about stress could be a good proxy for emotional wellbeing, especially among males, who tend to underestimate their emotional worries.","Gubelmann, Alicia; Auderset, Diane; Akre, Christina; Barrense-Dias, Yara; Surís, Joan-Carles",Swiss medical weekly,https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2020.20290; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32667676/,319

General symptoms of this disease are similar to that of many other viral respiratory diseases, including fever, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue, with a chance of progression to more severe complications. However, the virus does not affect all people equally, and cases with comorbidities such as malignancies, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and kidney diseases are at higher risk of developing severe events, including requiring intensive ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death. Patients with cancer are more likely to be infected with COVID-19, which is possibly due to their immunological dysfunction or frequent clinic visits. Also, there is a higher chance that these patients experience severe events because of the medication they receive. In this chapter, we will review the main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in patients with cancer. Recommendations and challenges for managing resources, organizing cancer centers, treatment of COVID-19-infected cancer patients, and performing cancer research during this pandemic will also be discussed.","Nowroozi, Ali; Razi, Sepideh; Sahu, Kamal Kant; Grizzi, Fabio; Arends, Jann; Keshavarz-Fathi, Mahsa; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973186/,319

80646,Revealing the architecture and solution properties of polysaccharide fractions from Macrolepiota albuminosa (Berk.) Pegler.,2021-08-05,"UNLABELLED Insect-borne plant viruses cause significant agricultural losses and jeopardize sustainable global food production. Although blocking plant virus transmission would allow for crop protection, virus receptors in insect vectors are unknown. Here we identify membrane alanyl aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor for pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV) coat protein (CP) in the gut of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, using a far-Western blot method. Pulldown and immunofluorescence binding assays and surface plasmon resonance were used to confirm and characterize CP-APN interaction. PEMV virions and a peptide comprised of PEMV CP fused to a proline-rich hinge (-P-) and green fluorescent protein (CP-P-GFP) specifically bound to APN. Recombinant APN expressed in Sf9 cells resulted in internalization of CP-P-GFP, which was visualized by confocal microscopy; such internalization is an expected hallmark of a functional gut receptor. Finally, in assays with aphid gut-derived brush border membrane vesicles, binding of CP-P-GFP competed with binding of GBP3.1, a peptide previously demonstrated to bind to APN in the aphid gut and to impede PEMV uptake into the hemocoel; this finding supports the hypothesis that GBP3.1 and PEMV bind to and compete for the same APN receptor. These in vitro data combined with previously published in vivo experiments (S. Liu, S. Sivakumar, W. O. Sparks, W. A. Miller, and B. C. Bonning, Virology 401:107-116, 2010, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2010.02.009) support the identification of APN as the first receptor in a plant virus vector. Knowledge of this receptor will provide for technologies based on PEMV-APN interaction designed to block plant virus transmission and to suppress aphid populations. IMPORTANCE A significant proportion of global food production is lost to insect pests. Aphids, in addition to weakening plants by feeding on their sap, are responsible for transmitting about half of the plant viruses vectored by insects. Growers rely heavily on the application of chemical insecticides to manage both aphids and aphid-vectored plant viral disease. To increase our understanding of plant virus-aphid vector interaction, we provide in vitro evidence supporting earlier in vivo work for identification of a receptor protein in the aphid gut called aminopeptidase N, which is responsible for entry of the plant virus pea enation mosaic virus into the pea aphid vector. Enrichment of proteins found on the surface of the aphid gut epithelium resulted in identification of this first aphid gut receptor for a plant virus. This discovery is particularly important since the disruption of plant virus binding to such a receptor may enable the development of a nonchemical strategy for controlling aphid-vectored plant viruses to maximize food production.","Linz, Lucas B; Liu, Sijun; Chougule, Nanasaheb P; Bonning, Bryony C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01479-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26311872/,319

82376,A Ph.D. on hold-indefinitely.,2020-05-08,"Ebolavirus (Ebov), an enveloped virus of the family Filoviridae, causes hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. The viral glycoprotein (GP) is solely responsible for virus-host membrane fusion, but how it does so remains elusive. Fusion occurs after virions reach an endosomal compartment where GP is proteolytically primed by cathepsins. Fusion by primed GP is governed by an internal fusion loop found in GP2, the fusion subunit. This fusion loop contains a stretch of hydrophobic residues, some of which have been shown to be critical for GP-mediated infection. Here we present liposome fusion data and NMR structures for a complete (54-residue) disulfide-bonded internal fusion loop (Ebov FL) in a membrane mimetic. The Ebov FL induced rapid fusion of liposomes of varying compositions at pH values at or below 5.5. Consistently, circular dichroism experiments indicated that the α-helical content of the Ebov FL in the presence of either lipid-mimetic micelles or small liposomes increases in samples exposed to pH ≤5.5. NMR structures in dodecylphosphocholine micelles at pH 7.0 and 5.5 revealed a conformational change from a relatively flat extended loop structure at pH 7.0 to a structure with an ∼90° bend at pH 5.5. Induction of the bend at low pH reorients and compacts the hydrophobic patch at the tip of the FL. We propose that these changes facilitate disruption of lipids at the site of virus-host cell membrane contact and, hence, initiate Ebov fusion.","Gregory, Sonia M; Harada, Erisa; Liang, Binyong; Delos, Sue E; White, Judith M; Tamm, Lukas K",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1104760108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21690393/,319

Abundant in almost every cell type in the lung, including type I epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and neutrophils, cav-1 plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI). ALI and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality in intensive care units, despite improvement in ventilation strategies. The pathogenesis of ARDS is still poorly understood, and therapeutic options remain limited. In this article, we summarize recent data regarding the regulation and function of cav-1 in lung biology and pathology, in particular as it relates to ALI. We further discuss the potential molecular and cellular mechanisms by which cav-1 expression contributes to ALI.

84181,"EuroELSO 2021, Author Index.",2021-05-01,"OBJECTIVE To report the complications and outcome of dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for uncomplicated gall bladder disease. STUDY DESIGN Multi-institutional case series. ANIMALS Client-owned dogs (n=20). METHODS Medical records of dogs that underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy were reviewed and signalment, history, clinical and ultrasound examination findings, surgical variables, and complications were collated. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed using a multiport approach. Data were compared between dogs with successful laparoscopic cholecystectomy and dogs requiring conversion to open cholecystectomy. RESULTS Six dogs (30%) required conversion from laparoscopic to open cholecystectomy due to inability to ligate the cystic duct (3), evidence of gall bladder rupture (1), leakage from the cystic duct during dissection (1), and cardiac arrest (1). Cystic duct dissection was performed in 19 dogs using an articulating dissector (10), right angle forceps (7), and unrecorded (2). The cystic duct was ligated in 15 dogs using surgical clips (5), suture (6), or a combination (4). All dogs were discharged from the hospital and had resolution of clinical signs, although 1 dog developed pancreatitis and 1 dog required revision surgery for bile peritonitis. There was no significant difference in preoperative blood analysis results, surgical technique, or duration of hospitalization between dogs undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy and cases converted to open cholecystectomy. CONCLUSION Laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be performed successfully for uncomplicated gall bladder disease in dogs after careful case selection. The surgeon considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be familiar with a variety of methods for cystic duct dissection and ligation to avoid difficulties during the procedure.","Scott, Jacqueline; Singh, Ameet; Mayhew, Philipp D; Brad Case, J; Runge, Jeffrey J; Gatineau, Matthieu; Kilkenny, Jessica",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.12534; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27503575/,319

84676,The relevance of signal timing in human-robot collaborative manipulation.,2021-09-22,"Junctional epithelium (JE) attaching to the enamel surface seals gaps around the teeth, functioning as the first line of gingival defense. Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) plays a role in epithelial cell fate, and the deficiency of Runx2 in JE causes periodontal destruction, while its effect on the barrier function of JE remains largely unexplored. In the present study, hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining revealed the morphological differences of JE between wild-type (WT) and Runx2 conditional knockout (cKO) mice. We speculated that these changes were related to the down-regulation of E-cadherin (E-cad), junctional adhesion molecule 1 (JAM1), and integrin β6 (ITGB6) in JE. Moreover, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was conducted to assess the expressions of these proteins. To verify the relationship between Runx2 and the three above-mentioned proteins, human gingival epithelial cells (HGEs) were cultured for in vitro experiment. The expression of Runx2 in HEGs was depleted by lentivirus. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis were adopted to analyze the differences in mRNA and protein expressions. Taken together, Runx2 played a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function integrality of JE via regulating the expressions of E-cad and JAM1.","Tian, Yuan; Mu, Haiyu; Wang, Aiqin; Gao, Yan; Dong, Zhiheng; Zhao, Yang; Li, Cong; Zhang, Li; Gao, Yuguang",Journal of molecular histology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10735-021-09962-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763807/,319

85218,Immigrants help make America great.,2020-07-10,"BACKGROUND Poor vessel wall apposition of flow diverter (FD) stents poses risks for stroke-related complications when treating intracranial aneurysms, necessitating long-term surveillance imaging. To facilitate quantitative evaluation of deployed devices, a novel algorithm is presented that generates intuitive two-dimensional representations of wall apposition from either high-resolution contrast-enhanced cone-beam CT (VasoCT) or intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. METHODS VasoCT and OCT images were obtained after FD implant (n=8 aneurysms) in an experimental sidewall aneurysm model in canines. Surface models of the vessel wall and FD device were extracted, and the distance between them was presented on a two-dimensional flattened map. Maps and cross-sections at potential locations of malapposition detected on VasoCT-based maps were compared. The performance of OCT-based apposition detection was evaluated on manually labeled cross-sections using logistic regression against a thresholded (≥0.25 mm) apposition measure. RESULTS VasoCT and OCT acquisitions yielded similar Grading of Regional Apposition after Flow-Diverter Treatment (GRAFT) apposition maps. GRAFT maps from VasoCT highlighted 16 potential locations of malapposition, of which two were found to represent malapposed device struts. Logistic regression showed that OCT could detect malapposition with a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 81%. CONCLUSIONS GRAFT delivered quantitative and visually convenient representations of potential FD malapposition and occasional acute thrombus formation. A powerful combination for future neuroendovascular applications is foreseen with the superior resolution delivered by intravascular OCT.","van der Marel, Kajo; Gounis, Matthew J; Weaver, John P; de Korte, Antonius M; King, Robert M; Arends, Jennifer M; Brooks, Olivia W; Wakhloo, Ajay K; Puri, Ajit S",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-011843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220411/,319

This study examines the behavior of two new suture materials, an elastic material, polyurethane (PUe), and a barbed polydioxanone (PDXb) suture thread in a rabbit model of midline incision closure. METHODS Three 2-cm midline incisions were made in 68 New Zealand White rabbits. The incisions were closed by running suture using four 3/0 threads: polypropylene (PP) (Surgipro®, Covidien), PUe (Assuplus®, Assut Europe), PDX (Assufil®, Assut Europe) or PDXb (Filbloc®, Assut Europe). Animals in each suture group were euthanized 3 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Histological sections of the tissue-embedded sutures were subjected to morphological, collagen expression, macrophage response and uniaxial tensiometry studies. RESULTS No signs of wound dehiscence or complications were observed. At 3 weeks, all sutures were surrounded by connective tissue composed mainly of collagen III. PUe showed greater collagen I expression than the other sutures. All sutures elicited a macrophage response that diminished from 3 weeks to 6 months (p < 0.001). This response was similar for the non-reabsorbable sutures (PP and PUe) yet PDXb showed a significantly greater response than the other reabsorbable suture (PDX) at 3 weeks (p < 0.01). At this early time point, the tensile strength of PUe was similar to that of control intact tissue (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION Three weeks after surgery, PUe revealed more collagen I deposition than the remaining materials and this translated to a similar biomechanical behavior to linea alba, that could avoid the appearance of short term dehiscences and thus reduce the incidence of incisional hernia. PDXb provides no additional advantages in their behavior regarding PDX suture.","Bellón, Juan M; Pérez-López, Paloma; Simón-Allue, Raquel; Sotomayor, Sandra; Pérez-Köhler, Bárbara; Peña, Estefanía; Pascual, Gemma; Calvo, Begoña",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2482-14-70; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25231161/,319
85882,Targeting autophagy to enhance oncolytic virus-based cancer therapy.,2013,"OBJECTIVE To assess the real-world efficacy, tolerability, and safety of ubrogepant in a tertiary headache center. BACKGROUND The efficacy and safety of ubrogepant for the acute treatment of migraine were established in phase 3 randomized controlled trials. However, there is no real-world data of patient experience with ubrogepant in a population in which the majority of patients have chronic migraine, multiple prior unsuccessful treatments, complex medical comorbidities, and concurrent use of other migraine-specific medications. METHOD This was a post-market cohort study conducted at Mayo Clinic Arizona. All patients prescribed ubrogepant were tracked and contacted 1-3 months after the prescription to answer a list of standardized questions. Demographic information and additional headache history were obtained from chart review. RESULTS We obtained eligible questionnaire responses from 106 patients. Chronic migraine accounted for 92/106 (86.8%) of the population. Complete headache freedom (from mild/moderate/severe to no pain) and headache relief (from moderate/severe to mild/no pain or mild to no pain) for ≥75% of all treated attacks at 2 hours after taking ubrogepant were achieved in 20/105 (19.0%) and 50/105 (47.6%) patients, respectively. A total of 33/106 (31.1%) patients reported being ""very satisfied"" with ubrogepant. Adverse events were reported in 42/106 (39.6%) patients, including fatigue in 29/106 (27.4%), dry mouth in 8/106 (7.5%), nausea/vomiting in 7/106 (6.6%), constipation in 5/106 (4.7%), dizziness in 3/106 (2.8%), and other adverse events in 7/106 (6.6%). Predictive factors for being a ""good responder"" to ubrogepant, defined as headache relief for ≥75% of all treated attacks at 2 hours after taking ubrogepant, included migraine with aura, episodic migraine, <5 prior unsuccessful preventive or acute treatment trials. Additionally, prior treatment responses to a CGRP monoclonal antibody and onabotulinumtoxinA injections are predictive of treatment responses and patient satisfaction to ubrogepant. For the 62/106 (58.5%) patients concurrently using a CGRP monoclonal antibody, there was no difference in the ""good responder"" rate or adverse event rate compared to those who were not on a CGRP monoclonal antibody, though the rate of moderate, as opposed to mild adverse events was higher, 11/62 (47.8%) versus 3/44 (17.6%), p = 0.048. Additionally, 16 patients had a history of significant cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. No severe adverse events were reported in any patient. CONCLUSION Our study confirms and extends the efficacy profile and tolerability of ubrogepant in a real-world tertiary headache clinic and identifies factors that may predict efficacy. Adverse event rates were higher than reported in clinical trials. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of ubrogepant.","Chiang, Chia-Chun; Arca, Karissa N; Dunn, Rachel B; Girardo, Marlene E; Quillen, Jaxon K; Dodick, David W; Starling, Amaal J",Headache,https://doi.org/10.1111/head.14062; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33547676/,319

This systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of biologic grafts for ventral hernia repair. METHODS MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies on biologic grafts for the repair of ventral hernias. Outcomes are presented as weighted pooled proportions. RESULTS Twenty-five retrospective studies were included. Recurrence depended on wound class, with an overall rate of 13.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 7.6-21.3). The recurrence rate in contaminated/dirty repairs was 23.1% (95% CI, 11.3-37.6). Abdominal wall laxity occurred in 10.5% (95% CI, 3.7-20.3) of patients. The surgical morbidity rate was 46.3% (95% CI, 33.3-59.6). Infection occurred in 15.9% (95% CI, 9.8-23.2) of patients but only led to graft removal in 4.9% of cases. CONCLUSIONS No randomized trials are available to properly evaluate biologic grafts for ventral hernia repair. The current evidence suggests that biologic grafts perform similarly to other surgical options.

Many newborns require assistance in this adaptive process. Recent evidence now supports titrating oxygen to guide resuscitation but no guidance is provided on utilizing exhaled CO2 measurements. AIM To review the current evidence relating to the use of CO2 monitoring in preterm newborns in the delivery room. METHODS Search was performed using the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE (1966-2014) and PREMEDLINE, EMBASE (1980-2014), CINAHL (1982-2014), Web of Science (1975-2014) and the Oxford Database of Perinatal Trials. RESULTS The search revealed 21 articles relating to CO2 detection, either quantitative or qualitative, in the newborn infant. The majority of these were observational studies, eight relating to CO2 detection as a means of confirming correct endotracheal tube placement in the newborn infant. The other indication is for mask ventilation, and there is one randomized control trial and four observational studies of CO2 detection during mask ventilation. The overall recommendation for CO2 detection for both clinical uses in the delivery suite is level B. DISCUSSION CO2 detection may be of particular benefit for preterm infants in the delivery suite. However there is a need for further research into CO2 detection, in particular capnography, as a means of confirming effective PPV in neonatal resuscitation.","Hawkes, G A; Kelleher, J; Ryan, C A; Dempsey, E M",Resuscitation,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.resuscitation.2014.07.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25086296/,319

Diclofenac submicron particle capsules have been developed using SoluMatrix technology to provide analgesia at lower doses than available solid oral dosing forms. Our study evaluated the analgesic efficacy and safety of lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules in patients with acute pain following elective surgery. METHODS A phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study enrolled 428 patients, aged 18 to 65 years, with moderate-to-severe pain following bunionectomy under regional anesthesia. Patients experiencing a pain intensity rating of ≥ 40 mm on a 100-mm Visual Analog Scale were randomized to receive lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules (35 or 18 mg, 3 times daily [TID]), celecoxib (200 mg, twice daily [BID], 400-mg loading dose), or placebo. The primary efficacy parameter was the overall (summed) pain intensity difference measured over 0 to 48 hours (SPID-48). Secondary efficacy parameters included pain intensity difference (PID) at scheduled assessments. RESULTS Lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules 35 mg TID (524.05; P < 0.001), 18 mg TID (393.25; P = 0.010), and celecoxib 200 mg BID (390.22; P = 0.011) demonstrated significant pain control compared with placebo (77.10) for the primary efficacy parameter, mean SPID-48. Diclofenac submicron particle capsules 35 mg TID (4.52) provided some pain control (higher mean PID) at 30 minutes following administration, in contrast to celecoxib 200 mg BID (0.80), diclofenac submicron particle capsules 18 mg TID (0.31), and placebo (0.12). Better pain control (PID) was noted across all active treatment groups at 5 hours compared with placebo (P ≤ 0.03), and pain relief was sustained throughout the treatment period. The most frequent non-procedure-related AEs were nausea, headache, dizziness, and vomiting. CONCLUSION Lower-dose diclofenac submicron particle capsules provided effective analgesia in this phase 3 clinical study in patients with acute pain and are a potentially promising option for the treatment of patients with acute pain.","Gibofsky, Allan; Silberstein, Stephen; Argoff, Charles; Daniels, Stephen; Jensen, Steve; Young, Clarence L",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/pgm.2013.09.2693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24113671/,319

Analyses of the flow in the room show that there are a number of parameters that play an important role in minimizing airborne cross-infection. The air flow rate to the room must be high, and the air distribution pattern can be designed to have high ventilation effectiveness.

In resource-scarce settings, the superior surgical technique using a synthetic mesh is not affordable. A low-cost alternative is needed. The objective of this study was to calculate and compare costs and cost-effectiveness of inguinal hernia mesh repair using a low-cost versus a commercial mesh in a rural setting in Uganda. METHODS This is a cost-effectiveness analysis of a double-blinded RCT comparing outcomes from groin hernia mesh repair using a low-cost mesh and a commercially available mesh. Cost-effectiveness was expressed in US dollars (with euros in parentheses, exchange rate 30 December 2016) per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted and quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS The cost difference resulting from the choice of mesh was $124·7 (€118·1). In the low-cost mesh group, the cost per DALY averted and QALY gained were $16·8 (€15·9) and $7·6 (€7·2) respectively. The corresponding costs were $58·2 (€55·1) and $33·3 (€31·5) in the commercial mesh group. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken including cost variations and different health outcome scenarios. The maximum costs per DALY averted and QALY gained were $148·4 (€140·5) and $84·7 (€80·2) respectively. CONCLUSION Repair using both meshes was highly cost-effective in the study setting. A potential cost reduction of over $120 (nearly €120) per operation with use of the low-cost mesh is important if the mesh technique is to be made available to the many millions of patients in countries with limited resources.

The laparoscopic approach may reduce those rates. This study compares those outcomes following laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (LVHR) with the standard open approach (OVHR) in obese patients. METHODS A retrospective review of patients with a BMI > 30 kg/m(2) that had undergone ventral hernia repair (VHR) between 2004 and 2012 was included. Demographics, perioperative complications and recurrence rates were compared between the two approaches. Hernia size was divided into three categories (small, medium and large). Physical examination and CT imaging mainly evaluated recurrences. RESULTS A total of 186 patients that underwent VHR were included, 35 patients had LVHR. Groups did not differ in terms of age, gender, ASA score, BMI and in rates of primary or incisional ventral hernia repair. The laparoscopic repairs were performed on significantly larger hernias (48.6 vs. 28.9% categorized as large, p = 0.02). The operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic repair (102 vs. 67 min, p < 0.01). Overall, perioperative complications following LVHR and OVHR were 17.1 versus 20.5% (p = 0.53). Wound-related complications were lower in the LVHR group (5.7 vs. 15.8%, p = 0.09). After a mean follow-up of 58 months, recurrence rates in the laparoscopic and open approaches were 20.0 versus 27.1% (p = 0.28), respectively. Advanced age was found to be a significantly protector from recurrence (OR -0.03; 95% CI 0.96-0.01, p = 0.01). OVHR carries an odds ratio of 2.7 (95% CI 0.88-8.2, p = 0.07) for recurrence compared with OVHR. CONCLUSIONS The risk of recurrence after VHR in obese patients is high. Laparoscopic approach offers a better perioperative and recurrence outcome. We believe that change in those outcomes is possible through weight loss procedures, but may need further studies to be conducted in the form of prospective randomized trials.","Froylich, Dvir; Segal, Miriam; Weinstein, Adam; Hatib, Kamal; Shiloni, Eitan; Hazzan, David",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4258-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26091995/,319

Exploring Variables Associated with Dog Confinement and General Characteristics of the Free-ranging Owned-Dog Population in a Peri-urban Area.,2020-09-27,"The extractive desulfurization (EXDS) of pyrolytic oil (PO) from organosulfur compound with deep eutectic solvent (DES), tetrabutylammonium bromide-formic acid, using hydrodynamic cavitation (HDC) was investigated. Applying the method of independent variation value one per variable, the effect of the processing parameters of EXDS using HDC: the inlet pressure of the reaction mixture (P1), the mass ratio of DES to pyrolysis oil (DES/PO), the temperature of the reaction mixture (T) and the number of passes of the reaction mixture through the cavitation reactor (n), on the degree of desulfurization of pyrolytic oil (DDS) was determined. In order to determine the effect of processing parameters on the DDS, the processing parameters were varied following manners: (a) the value of P1 was varied in the range of 1-50 atm at DES/PO = 5, T = 298 K and n = 10, (b) the value of DES/PO was varied in the range of 1-10 at P1 = 30 atm, T = 298 K and n = 10, (c) the value of temperatures was varied within the range 298-338 K at P1 = 30 atm, DES/PO = 5, and n = 10, and (d) the value of (n) was varied within the range 1-20 at P1 = 30 atm, DES/PO = 5, and T = 298 K. Based on the obtained results, it was found that the increase in the values of P1, DES/PO, T, and n leads to the increase in the value of DDS of pyrolytic oil. The optimal processing parameters EXDS of pyrolytic oil are determined. The model mechanism of the extractive desulfurization of pyrolytic oil with deep eutectic solvent and the influence of cavitation effects on the degree of pyrolytic oil desulfurization are discussed.","Jovanovic, Jelena D; Petkovic, Sandra D; Gigov, Mihajlo N; Adnadjevic, Borivoj K",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-10435-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803584/,319

Growing realization of the health benefits of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity has captured the interest of persons who desire to improve their health, including those at risk for chronic liver injury. They are increasingly adopting wearable activity trackers to measure the activity that they seek to improve. Improved physical activity is the key lifestyle behavior that can improve cardiorespiratory fitness, which is most accurately measured with cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET).

In this prolonged pandemic, nurses and midwives working at the frontline face multiple ethical problems, including their obligation to care for their patients and the risk for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Despite the frequency of emergencies in Africa, there is a paucity of literature on ethical issues during epidemics. Furthermore, nursing regulatory bodies in African countries such as Kenya have primarily adopted a Western code of ethics that may not reflect the realities of the healthcare systems and cultural context in which nurses and midwives care for patients. In this article, we discuss the tension between nurses' and midwives' duty of care and resource allocation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to clarify nurses' and midwives' rights and responsibilities, especially in the current political setting, limited resources, and ambiguous professional codes of ethics that guide their practice.","Shaibu, Sheila; Kimani, Rachel Wangari; Shumba, Constance; Maina, Rose; Ndirangu, Eunice; Kambo, Isabel",Nursing ethics,https://doi.org/10.1177/0969733021996038; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719734/,319
91517,The visa woes that shattered scientists' American dreams.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND Non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) is a heterogeneous disorder, which is characterized by upper gastrointestinal symptoms and sensorimotor disturbances, including abnormal gastric emptying (GE) and increased intestinal chemosensitivity, and associated with greater plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels during duodenal lipid infusion. However, the relationship(s) between these disturbances and daily symptoms in NUD is variable. We hypothesize that abnormal GE and symptoms during a GE study and during duodenal lipid infusion are associated with the severity of daily symptoms and that GLP-1 mediates symptoms during duodenal lipid infusion in NUD. METHODS Gastric emptying of solids, symptoms during the GE study and duodenal lipid infusion, and daily gastrointestinal symptoms (2 week diary) were measured in 24 healthy controls and 40 NUD patients. During duodenal lipid infusion, participants received the GLP-1 antagonist exendin 9-39 or placebo. KEY RESULTS In controls and patients, GE of solids was normal in 75% and 75%, delayed in 8% and 12.5%, or rapid in 17% and 12.5%, respectively. No controls but 26 patients (65%) had severe symptoms during the GE study. During lipid infusion, gastrointestinal symptoms were greater (P = .001) in patients and not affected by exendin. Symptoms during GE study and lipid infusion accounted for respectively 62% and 37% of variance in daily symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS In NUD, symptoms during a GE study and to a lesser extent during lipid infusion explain the variance in daily symptoms. Intestinal chemosensitivity is not reduced by GLP-1 antagonist. Assessment of symptoms during a GE study may provide a useful biomarker for NUD in research and clinical practice.","Chakraborty, Subhankar; Desai, Anshuman; Halland, Magnus; Burton, Duane; Camilleri, Michael; Zinsmeister, Alan R; Bharucha, Adil E",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.13686; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31328363/,319

Medical trainees are particularly susceptible to the emotional impact of patient death. However, few studies have examined how trainees process patient death. This study describes annual patient memorials organized at a large multisite academic graduate medical education program. Peer-led, 1-hour patient memorial services were organized for internal medicine residents, including large and small group reflection, a moment of silence, and collective art projects. At the conclusion of each memorial, participants completed a 10-question survey regarding their experience during the memorial and their prior experiences with patient death. Ninety-nine surveys were analyzed over 2 years. Of resident respondents, 84% reported feeling comfortable or very comfortable participating in the memorials, and 93% rated reflection on patient death as important or very important. When asked how they reflect on patient death, 67% of residents reported processing patient death independently, while only 23% reported processing patient death with their medical teams. Patient memorials with small and large group discussions are easily adopted and replicated. Residents reflect on patient death frequently but often independently rather than with their medical teams.

In addition, relationships between nurse professional emergency preparedness competence, personal preparation for a disaster, and perceived likelihood of reporting to work after a disaster are examined. BACKGROUND Evidence suggests wide gaps in nurses' familiarity with the dimensions of professional emergency preparedness competence and their likelihood to report, potentially impacting human life after a disaster. METHODS An exploratory, cross-sectional survey design was used with a sample of 186 RNs and licensed practical nurses. RESULTS Results indicate significant weaknesses in nurses' professional emergency preparedness competence. There are positive correlations between likelihood to report, personal preparedness, and professional emergency preparedness competence.

93109,Introduction of laparoscopic sacral colpopexy to a fellowship training program.,2013,"BACKGROUND Matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) has demonstrated encouraging midterm clinical outcomes, although published studies presenting longer-term clinical and radiological outcomes, across varied tibiofemoral and patellofemoral graft locations, are scarce. PURPOSE To present the clinical and radiological outcomes a minimum of 10 years after surgery in a consecutive series of patients who underwent MACI in the tibiofemoral or patellofemoral knee joint. Secondly, to investigate any association between outcomes and patient characteristics, graft parameters, and injury and surgery history. STUDY DESIGN Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS Overall, 87 patients (99 grafts: 57 medial femoral condyle, 24 lateral femoral condyle, 11 trochlea, 7 patella) were prospectively evaluated clinically and with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before surgery and at 2, 5, and minimum 10 years after MACI (mean, 13.1 years; range, 10.5-16 years). Patients were evaluated with a range of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), including the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and patient satisfaction. The 6-minute walk test, active knee range of motion, and peak isokinetic knee extensor and flexor strength were assessed. Limb symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated for strength measures. MRI was undertaken to evaluate the repair tissue, and an MRI composite score was calculated. RESULTS All PROMs significantly improved (P < .05) over the pre- to postoperative period. Apart from KOOS Sport (P = .018) and the LSI for peak isokinetic knee extensor strength (P = .005), which significantly improved, no significant change (P > .05) was observed from 2 years after surgery to final follow-up (range, 10.5-16 years) in all other PROMs, 6-minute walk distance, active knee range of motion, and the LSI for peak isokinetic knee flexor strength. At final follow-up, while the mean LSIs for peak isokinetic knee flexor and extensor strength were 96.9% and 95.7%, respectively, 74.7% of patients were satisfied with their ability to participate in sports, and 88.5% were satisfied overall. A nonsignificant decline was observed for tissue infill (P = .211) and the MRI composite score (P = .099) from 2 years to final review. At final MRI review, 9 grafts (9.1%) had failed. While no significant association (P > .05) was observed between clinical or MRI-based outcomes and patient demographics (age, body weight, body mass index), defect size, or the duration of preoperative symptoms, the number of previous surgical procedures was significantly and negatively associated with KOOS Symptoms (P = .015), KOOS Sport (P = .011), and the degree of tissue infill (P = .045). CONCLUSION MACI provided high levels of satisfaction and adequate graft survivorship as visualized on MRI at 10.5 to 16 years after surgery.","Ebert, Jay R; Fallon, Michael; Wood, David J; Janes, Gregory C",The American journal of sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0363546520980109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411565/,319

In most patients, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive imaging modality in the diagnosis of viral encephalitides in the brain. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of brain lesion patterns on brain MRI in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pneumonia patients who developed focal and non-focal neurological manifestations. In addition, it will compare the impact of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) as an index of deteriorating cerebral function on positive brain MRIs in both neurological manifestations. This retrospective study included an examination of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmation, admitted with clinicoradiologic evidence of COVID-19 pneumonia, and who were candidates for brain MRI due to neurological manifestations suggesting brain involvement. Brain imaging acquired on a 3.0 T MRI system (Skyra; Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with a 20-channel receive head coil.

Studies treating HIV-1-infected individuals with latency reactivation agents to reduce their latent HIV-1 reservoirs indicated that their HIV-1-specific immune responses were insufficient to effectively eliminate the reactivated latent HIV-1-infected T cells. Mobilization of ADCC may facilitate elimination of reactivated latent HIV-1-infected cells to deplete the HIV-1 reservoir and contribute to a functional HIV-1 cure. The most effective antibodies for controlling and eradicating HIV-1 infection would likely have the dual capacities of potently neutralizing a broad range of HIV-1 isolates and effectively mobilizing HIV-1-specific ADCC to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells. For this purpose, we constructed LSEVh-LS-F, a broadly neutralizing, defucosylated hexavalent fusion protein specific for both the CD4 and coreceptor gp120-binding sites. LSEVh-LS-F potently inhibited in vivo HIV-1 and simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection in humanized mouse and macaque models, respectively, including in vivo neutralization of HIV-1 strains resistant to the broadly neutralizing antibodies VRC01 and 3BNC117. We developed a novel humanized mouse model to evaluate in vivo human NK cell-mediated elimination of HIV-1-infected cells by ADCC and utilized it to demonstrate that LSEVh-LS-F rapidly mobilized NK cells to eliminate >80% of HIV-1-infected cells in vivo 1 day after its administration. The capacity of LSEVh-LS-F to eliminate HIV-1-infected cells via ADCC combined with its broad neutralization activity supports its potential use as an immunotherapeutic agent to eliminate reactivated latent cells and deplete the HIV-1 reservoir.IMPORTANCE Mobilization of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to eliminate reactivated latent HIV-1-infected cells is a strategy which may contribute to depleting the HIV-1 reservoir and achieving a functional HIV-1 cure.

While data are available for adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), limited reports have analyzed pediatric patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Objective To evaluate currently reported pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence Review An extensive search strategy was designed to retrieve all articles published from December 1, 2019, to March 3, 2020, by combining the terms coronavirus and coronavirus infection in several electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL), and following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Retrospective cross-sectional and case-control studies, case series and case reports, bulletins, and national reports about the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. The risk of bias for eligible observational studies was assessed according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guideline. Findings A total of 815 articles were identified. Eighteen studies with 1065 participants (444 patients were younger than 10 years, and 553 were aged 10 to 19 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the final analysis. All articles reflected research performed in China, except for 1 clinical case in Singapore. Children at any age were mostly reported to have mild respiratory symptoms, namely fever, dry cough, and fatigue, or were asymptomatic. Bronchial thickening and ground-glass opacities were the main radiologic features, and these findings were also reported in asymptomatic patients. Among the included articles, there was only 1 case of severe COVID-19 infection, which occurred in a 13-month-old infant. No deaths were reported in children aged 0 to 9 years. Available data about therapies were limited. Conclusions and Relevance To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that assesses and summarizes clinical features and management of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the lack of European and US data on pediatric patients require further epidemiologic and clinical studies to identify possible preventive and therapeutic strategies.","Castagnoli, Riccardo; Votto, Martina; Licari, Amelia; Brambilla, Ilaria; Bruno, Raffaele; Perlini, Stefano; Rovida, Francesca; Baldanti, Fausto; Marseglia, Gian Luigi",JAMA pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2020.1467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32320004/,319

This study aimed to assess feasibility, safety, and efficiency of performing the same operation with single-incision laparoscopic surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients referred from March 2010 to February 2013 were considered for single-port laparoscopic repair with modified Sugarbaker technique. A SILS port (Covidien, Norwalk, Connecticut, USA) was used together with conventional straight dissecting instruments and a 5.5- mm/52-cm/30° laparoscope. Important technical aspects include modified dissection techniques, namely, ""inline"" and ""chopsticks"" to overcome loss of triangulation, insertion of a urinary catheter into an ostomy for ostomy limb identification, safe adhesiolysis by avoiding electocautery, saline -jet dissection to demarcate tissue planes, dissection of an entire laparotomy scar to expose incidental incisional hernias, adequate mobilization of an ostomy limb for lateralization, and wide overlapping of defect with antiadhesive mesh. RESULTS Of 6 patients, 5 underwent single-port laparoscopic repair, and 1 (whose body mass index [BMI] of 39.4 kg/m(2) did not permit SILS port placement) underwent multiport repair. Mean defect size was 10 cm, and mean mesh size was 660 cm(2) with 4 patients having incidental incisional hernias repaired by the same mesh. Mean operation time was 270 minutes, and mean hospital stay was 4 days. Appliance malfunction ceased immediately, and pain associated with parastomal hernia disappeared. There was no recurrence with a follow-up of 2 to 36 months. CONCLUSION Compared with multiport repair, single-port laparoscopic parastomal repair with modified Sugarbaker technique is safe and efficient, and it may eventually become the standard of care.","Tran, Hanh; Turingan, Isidro; Zajkowska, Marta; Tran, Kim",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13693422519190; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680140/,319

RESULTS The FAERS database contained 962 cases of esketamine-related AEs, with signals detected for several AEs, such as dissociation (ROR = 1,612.64, 95% CI = 1,354.63, 1,919.79; IC = 8.19, 95% CI = 7.96, 8.35), sedation (ROR = 238.46, 95% CI = 202.98, 280.15; IC = 7, 95% CI = 6.75, 7.18), feeling drunk (ROR = 96.17, 95% CI = 61.42, 150.57; IC = 4.84, 95% CI = 4.09, 5.36), suicidal ideation (ROR = 24.03, 95% CI = 18.72, 30.84; IC = 4.31, 95% CI = 3.9, 4.61), and completed suicide (ROR = 5.75, 95% CI = 3.18, 10.41; IC = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.23, 2.94). Signals for suicidal and self-injurious ideation, but not suicide attempt and completed suicide, remained when comparing esketamine to venlafaxine. Females and patients receiving antidepressant polypharmacy, co-medication with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, or somatic medications were more likely to suffer from serious versus non-serious AEs (χ2 = 125.29, p < 0.001, χ2 = 9.08, p = 0.003, χ2 = 8.14, p = 0.004, χ2 = 19.48, p < 0.001, χ2 = 25.62, p < 0.001, and χ2 = 16.79, p < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Esketamine may carry a clear potential for serious AEs, which deserves urgent clarification by means of further prospective studies.","Gastaldon, Chiara; Raschi, Emanuel; Kane, John M; Barbui, Corrado; Schoretsanitis, Georgios",Psychotherapy and psychosomatics,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510703; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854103/,319

Thus, we sought to examine whether increased inflammatory response to stress among patients with CHD is associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular events and whether this risk is higher in women. We examined inflammatory biomarkers known to increase with mental stress (speech task), including interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and matrix metallopeptidase-9 (MMP-9) among 562 patients with stable CHD. Inflammatory response, the difference between post-stress and resting values, was examined as a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) using subdistribution hazards models for competing risks adjusting for demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, and medications. MACE was defined as a composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina with revascularization, and heart failure. All biomarkers were standardized. The mean age was 63 years (range 34-79) and 24% were women. During a median follow-up of 3 years, 71 patients experienced MACE. Overall, there was no significant association between inflammatory response to stress and risk of MACE, but there were sex-based interactions for IL-6 (p = 0.001) and MCP-1 (p = 0.008). The risk of MACE increased 56% (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.21, 2.01; p = 0.001) and 30% (HR: 1.30; 95% 1.09. 1.55; p = 0.004) for each standard deviation increase in IL-6 and MCP-1 response to mental stress for women, respectively, while there was no association among men. Increased inflammation in response to stress is associated with future adverse cardiovascular outcomes among women with CHD.","Sullivan, Samaah; Young, An; Hammadah, Muhammad; Lima, Bruno B; Levantsevych, Oleksiy; Ko, Yi-An; Pearce, Brad D; Shah, Amit J; Hwan Kim, Jeong; Moazzami, Kasra; Driggers, Emily G; Haffar, Ammer; Ward, Laura; Herring, Isaias; Hankus, Allison; Lewis, Tené T; Mehta, Puja K; Douglas Bremner, J; Raggi, Paolo; Quyyumi, Arshed; Vaccarino, Viola","Brain, behavior, and immunity",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916271/,319

97256,A low-power bio-potential acquisition system with flexible PDMS dry electrodes for portable ubiquitous healthcare applications.,2013,"Providing advice for travelers embarking on long-term trips poses a challenge in travel medicine. A long duration of risk exposure is associated with underuse of protective measures and poor adherence to chemoprophylaxis, increasing the chances of acquiring infections. Recently, in our clinic, we observed an increase in the number of travelers undertaking round-the-world trips. These individuals are typically aged around 32 years and quit their jobs to embark on one-to-two-year journeys. Their destinations include countries in two or more continents, invariably Southeast Asia and Indonesia, and mostly involve land travel and visiting rural areas. Such trips involve flexible plans, increasing the challenge, especially with regard to malaria prophylaxis. Advising round-the-world travelers is time-consuming because of the amount of information that must be provided to the traveler. Advisors must develop strategies to commit the traveler to his/her own health, and verify their learnings on disease-prevention measures. Contacting the advisor after the appointment or during the trip can be helpful to clarify unclear instructions or diagnosis made and prescriptions given abroad. Infectious diseases are among the most frequent problems affecting travelers, many of which are preventable by vaccines, medicines, and precautionary measures. The dissemination of counterfeit medicines, particularly antibiotics and antimalarial medicines, emphasizes the need for travelers to carry medicines that they may possibly need on their trip. Additional advice on altitude, scuba diving, and other possible risks may also be given. Considering the difficulties in advising this group, we present a review of the main recommendations on advising these travelers.","Rodrigues, Karis Maria de Pinho; Moreira, Beatriz Meurer",Revista da Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical,https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0418-2017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29768543/,319
98233,Rationally engineered Cas9 nucleases with improved specificity.,2016,"BACKGROUND International migration is the main source of population growth in Canada. Research on the birth outcomes of immigrants has largely been based on Canadian provincial data, raising concerns about whether the findings can be generalized between provinces or between the provinces and Canada. Provincial time trends and variations in birth outcomes are described according to the 20 top maternal birthplaces. DATA AND METHODS Statistics Canada's Vital Statistics-Birth Database (2000 to 2016) was used to extract 5,831,580 records on live births for analyses. Rates of preterm birth (PTB, referring to births at 22 to 36 gestation weeks) and mean birth weight (at 39 to 40 gestation weeks) were compared across provinces between immigrant mothers, according to the top 20 maternal birthplaces, and Canadian-born mothers. RESULTS The proportion of births to immigrant mothers rose overall from 23.7% in 2000 to 30.7% in 2016, but rose unevenly across the provinces. Increases were modest in British Columbia and Ontario; twofold in Alberta, Manitoba and Quebec; and fourfold in Saskatchewan. Compared with PTB rates among Canadian-born mothers, PTB rates were lower among various Asian, African and Western immigrant groups and higher among those from Bangladesh, the Philippines and the Caribbean. Lower birth weights were seen for most source countries, except the United States. These differences were uniform across the provinces, with a few exceptions. DISCUSSION There were large provincial variations in the proportion of births to immigrant mothers. However, disparities in birth outcomes did not substantially vary across provinces for most immigrant maternal birthplaces, suggesting some degree of generalizability for provincial birth data.","Boram Lee, Janelle; Hinds, Aynslie; Urquia, Marcelo L",Health reports,https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000400002-eng; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32644763/,319

99757,Trump lied about science.,2020-09-11,"This work aimed to retrieve a field isolate of probiotic from Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and compare the obtained results with a commercial probiotic product through experimental studies. The study was conducted on 250 Nile tilapia. Ten fish were used to isolate the probiotic strain. Two isolates showed an in vitro inhibitory effect against pathogenic A. hydrophila. The isolate with the largest zone was identified by PCR. Sixty fish were used to test the safety of a potential probiotic. One hundred and eighty fish were used in a two-month feeding experiment. Fish were divided into 3 groups, group (1): the control, group (2): fed on potential probiotics, and group (3): fed on commercial probiotic (Organic Green™). The effects of tested products on the immune response were recorded in all groups. After one and two months of feeding experiment, blood and nonspecific immune parameters were evaluated. Disease resistance against Aeromonas hydrophila was evaluated through challenge experiment. The histopathology of the treated groups was fully recorded in comparison with the control group. The potential probiotic based on the in vitro antimicrobial activity test was identified as P. putida using routine and gel electrophoresis and 16S rRNA sequencing. During the first and the second month of experiment, there was a highly significant increase in the survival percent of the experimental fish in both treated groups with probiotics. In the first phase of the experiment, a significant increase in the haematocrit values and NBT, lysozyme activity, and phagocytic activity was seen in all treated groups in comparison with the control. The increase in the TLC was significant in the group fed with P. putida in comparison with the control group. In the second phase, a nonsignificant increase in the hematocrit values and significant increases in the NBT and phagocytic index were seen in P. putida and organic green groups in comparison with the control group. The TLC and DLC revealed nonsignificant changes in the treated groups in comparison with the control. The RLP in the groups treated with P. putida was higher than that in those treated with organic green. Although probiotics are an important management tool in aquaculture, it should be subjected to scientific laboratory tests and field measurements.","Abomughaid, Mosleh M",International journal of microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8865456; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724309/,319
101504,Guideline No. 404: Initial Investigation and Management of Benign Ovarian Masses.,2020-08-01,"INTRODUCTION Hospitals and emergency departments (EDs) faced profound uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic. Early concerns regarding demand far exceeding capacity were balanced by anecdotal reports of decreased patient visits, including those for specific high-acuity conditions. This study sought to identify changes in ED volume and acuity, within a specific managed care environment, associated with the onset of the pandemic. METHODS Data from patient visits to 2 San Diego, California, EDs-within an integrated health-care system-were extracted from the electronic health record. Daily patient visits, hospital admissions from the ED, Emergency Severity Index scores, and mode of arrival were compared between two 28-day periods, with the 28 days following a ""stay at home"" order issued by the governor of California and a control period of the same dates in 2019. RESULTS These EDs observed a significant decrease in daily visits (42% compared to the previous year) associated with the pandemic. An increased rate of hospital admissions (16.6%-21.6%) was suggestive of an overall increase in acuity; however, changes in the distribution of Emergency Severity Index scores were less pronounced. The overall number of admissions declined significantly. Although overall ambulance traffic decreased, the proportion of patients arriving by ambulance was unchanged. CONCLUSION Patient volume in 2 EDs dropped significantly in association with a statewide response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was also a shift in acuity as measured by the proportion of patients admitted to the hospital, but overall admissions declined, suggesting sicker patients also did not seek care.","Lorenzen, Brent; Schwartz, Adam",The Permanente journal,https://doi.org/10.7812/tpp/20.212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33970083/,319

A permanent pacemaker had been implanted via the right subclavian vein. The pacemaker and pacing leads were removed and a temporary pacemaker was implanted. After vancomycin treatment for 4 weeks, pacemaker implantation via the right external iliac vein was performed under local anesthesia because of left subclavian vein occlusion, infection of the right pocket, and difficulty with epicardial lead insertion. The iliac vein approach is an effective alternative in patients in whom the pectoral approach cannot be used. LEARNING OBJECTIVE Permanent pacemaker implantation using the conventional pectoral approach is impossible or contraindicated in 1-6% of patients. In such patients, implantation via the iliac vein is considered an effective alternative. The advantages of this approach are that the wound size and bleeding amount are very small and that it can be performed under local anesthesia. Therefore, this approach can be used in patients with a poor general condition, including elderly patients.","Yamaguchi, Tetsuo; Miyamoto, Takamichi; Yamauchi, Yasuteru; Obayashi, Tohru",Journal of arrhythmia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joa.2015.08.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27092198/,319
103367,"COVID in Kenya, science in space and Europe's budget boost.",2020-11-01,"The classical and lectin pathways of the complement system are important for the elimination of pathogens and apoptotic cells and stimulation of the adaptive immune system. Upon activation of these pathways, complement component C4 is proteolytically cleaved, and the major product C4b is deposited on the activator, enabling assembly of a C3 convertase and downstream alternative pathway amplification. Although excessive activation of the lectin and classical pathways contributes to multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and overexpression of a C4 isoform has recently been linked to schizophrenia, a C4 inhibitor and structural characterization of the convertase formed by C4b is lacking. In this study, we present the nanobody hC4Nb8 that binds with picomolar affinity to human C4b and potently inhibits in vitro complement C3 deposition through the classical and lectin pathways in human serum and in mouse serum. The crystal structure of the C4b:hC4Nb8 complex and a three-dimensional reconstruction of the C4bC2 proconvertase obtained by electron microscopy together rationalize how hC4Nb8 prevents proconvertase assembly through recognition of a neoepitope exposed in C4b and reveals a unique C2 conformation compared with the alternative pathway proconvertase. On human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons, the nanobody prevents C3 deposition through the classical pathway. Furthermore, hC4Nb8 inhibits the classical pathway-mediated immune complex delivery to follicular dendritic cells in vivo. The hC4Nb8 represents a novel ultrahigh-affinity inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade under both in vitro and in vivo conditions.","Zarantonello, Alessandra; Presumey, Jessy; Simoni, Léa; Yalcin, Esra; Fox, Rachel; Hansen, Annette; Olesen, Heidi Gytz; Thiel, Steffen; Johnson, Matthew B; Stevens, Beth; Laursen, Nick Stub; Carroll, Michael C; Andersen, Gregers R",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000528; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32769120/,319
103373,NGWA News.,2019,"Midwives are multifaceted healthcare professionals whose competence spectrum includes a large variety of knowledge and skills going from antenatal care to education and research. The aim of this review is to suggest the future challenges midwives are going to face in the upcoming decade of this Century. COVID-19 and other infections will reasonably impact healthcare workers all over the world. Midwives are frontline healthcare professionals who are constantly at risk of contagion as their job implies close contact with women, physical support and hand touch. Also, menstruation waste plays a large role in the pollution of waters, severely impacting hygiene in the developing countries and fueling climate change. Appropriate disposal of used menstrual material is still insufficient in many countries of the world especially because of lack of sanitary education on girls. As educators, midwives will be more involved into preventing inappropriate disposal of menstrual hygiene devices by educating girls around the world about the green alternatives to the commercial ones. Despite the evidences about the fertility decrement that occurs with aging, women keep postponing reproduction and increasing their chance being childless or suffering complications related to the advanced maternal age. Teen pregnancies are as well an important issue for midwives who will be called to face more age-related issues and use a tailored case to case approach, enhancing their family planning skills. Another crucial role of midwifery regards the information about the risk of drinking alcohol during gestation. Alcohol assumption during pregnancy is responsible for serious damage to the fetus causing a wide range of pathological conditions related to Fetal Alcoholic Spectrum Disorder, leading cause of mental retardation in children of western countries. On the whole, midwives have demonstrated their willingness to expand their practice through continuing professional development, and through specialist and advanced roles especially in preventive and educational positions.","D'Angelo, A; Ferraguti, G; Petrella, C; Greco, A; Ralli, M; Vitali, M; Framarino Dei Malatesta, M; Fiore, M; Ceccanti, M; Messina, M P",La Clinica terapeutica,https://doi.org/10.7417/ct.2021.2277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33346323/,319

In contrast to other compression devices, its field of application is identical to circular staplers. Yet, limited data are available and there are no reports on the use of this compression device for anastomoses in the lower rectum and in diverted cases. METHODS Between November 2008 and March 2010 a nonrandomized prospective study of patients undergoing colorectal resection was done. RESULTS Sixty-two patients (30 female) with a median age of 67 years (range = 23-87) underwent surgery for benign (35) and malignant (27) indications;the surgery was performed laparoscopically in 53 (85.5%) cases. There were no leaks or other major complications related to the compression anastomosis. One patient died from sepsis caused by a leak of a colonic J-pouch. Three of 12 (25%) patients after (ultra-)low anterior resection experienced pain caused by the presence of the ring. Of 53 undiverted patients, rings were passed spontaneously in 52 (98.1%). No spontaneous passage occurred in patients with a stoma. Their rings were removed transanally prior to stoma closure. After a median of 6 months, endoscopic follow-up was performed in 60 patients (96.8%). Two anastomotic stenoses were detected (3.3%). CONCLUSION Construction of rectal anastomosis using this novel compression device is feasible and safe and appears to cause only few anastomotic strictures in the medium term. Discomfort or pain from the presence of the ring at anastomosis following (ultra-)low anterior resection can be observed in a relevant number of patients.","Dauser, Bernhard; Winkler, Thomas; Loncsar, Gerhard; Herbst, Friedrich",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-011-1135-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21541799/,319

The technique of A Direct Aspiration, First Pass Technique for the Endovascular Treatment of Stroke (ADAPT) appears promising with a high rate of recanalization. We compared ADAPT versus stent retrievers (the Solitaire device) for efficacy and safety as a front-line endovascular procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS We analyzed 243 consecutive patients with large intracranial artery occlusions of the anterior circulation, treated within 6 hours with mechanical thrombectomy by either ADAPT or the Solitaire stent. Th primary outcome was complete recanalization (modified TICI ≥ 2b); secondary outcomes included complication rates and procedural and clinical outcomes. RESULTS From November 2012 to June 2014, 119 patients were treated with stent retriever (Solitaire FR) and 124 by using the ADAPT with Penumbra reperfusion catheters. The median baseline NIHSS score was the same for both groups (Solitaire, 17 [interquartile range, 11-21] versus ADAPT, 17 [interquartile range, 12-21]). Time from groin puncture to recanalization (Solitaire, 50 minutes [range, 25-80 minutes] versus ADAPT, 45 minutes [range, 27-70 minutes], P = .42) did not differ significantly. However, compared with the Solitaire group, patients treated with ADAPT achieved higher final recanalization rates (82.3% versus 68.9%; adjusted relative risk, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.37; P = .022), though differences in clinical outcomes between the cohorts were not significant. Use of an adjunctive device was more frequent in the ADAPT group (45.2% versus 13.5%, P < .0001). The rate of embolization in new territories or symptomatic hemorrhage did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS Front-line ADAPT achieved higher recanalization rates than the Solitaire device. Further randomized controlled trials are warranted to define the best strategy for mechanical thrombectomy.","Lapergue, B; Blanc, R; Guedin, P; Decroix, J-P; Labreuche, J; Preda, C; Bartolini, B; Coskun, O; Redjem, H; Mazighi, M; Bourdain, F; Rodesch, G; Piotin, M",AJNR.

105067,Navigating space in the mammalian brain.,2021-05-28,"The Raf/MEK/ERK signal transduction cascade belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades. Raf/MEK/ERK signaling leads to stimulus-specific changes in gene expression, alterations in cell metabolism or induction of programmed cell death (apoptosis), and thus controls cell differentiation and proliferation. It is induced by extracellular agents, including pathogens such as RNA viruses. Many DNA viruses are known to induce cellular signaling via this pathway. As these pathogens partly use the DNA synthesis machinery for their replication, they aim to drive cells into a proliferative state. In contrast, the consequences of RNA virus-induced Raf/MEK/ERK signaling were less clear for a long time, but since the turn of the century the number of publications on this topic has rapidly increased. Research on this virus/host-interaction will broaden our understanding of its relevance in viral replication. This important control center of cellular responses is differently employed to support the replication of several important human pathogenic RNA viruses including influenza, Ebola, hepatitis C and SARS corona viruses.","Pleschka, Stephan",Biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1515/bc.2008.145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18713014/,319

However, treatment using different strategies is an ongoing area of investigation. The PROMISE study analyzed the safety and effectiveness of the Penumbra System with the ACE68 and ACE64 reperfusion catheters in aspiration thrombectomy of stroke, using A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique (ADAPT). METHODS PROMISE was a prospective study which enrolled 204 patients with intracranial anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic stroke in 20 centers from February 2016 to May 2017. Initial treatment was with the ACE68/ACE64 catheters within 6 hours of symptom onset. Imaging and safety review was performed by an independent Core Laboratory and a Clinical Events Committee. The primary angiographic outcome was revascularization to mTICI 2b-3 at immediate post-procedure and the primary clinical outcome was 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score ≤2. Safety assessment included device- and procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), mortality, and embolization of new territory (ENT). RESULTS Enrolled patients had a median age of 74 (IQR 65-80) years and a median admission NIHSS of 16 (IQR 11-20). The post-procedure mTICI 2b-3 revascularization rate was 93.1% and the 90-day mRS 0-2 rate was 61%. Device- and procedure-related SAEs at 24 hours occurred in 1.5% and 3.4%, respectively, 90-day mortality was 7.5%, sICH occurred in 2.9% while ENT occurred in 1.5%. CONCLUSIONS For frontline therapy of LVO stroke, the ACE68/ACE64 catheters for aspiration thrombectomy were found to be safe and showed similar efficacy to randomized trials using other revascularization techniques.

106087,"Patents, economics, and pandemics.",2020-06-05,"BACKGROUND Several treatment options were recently added for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, response to therapy is variable, and biomarkers that can guide treatment selection and response evaluation are lacking. Circulating RNAs are a promising source of biomarkers. We explored messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential biomarkers in liquid biopsies of patients with mCRPC treated with enzalutamide. METHODS Forty patients were included in this prospective multicenter observational study. Whole blood was drawn at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after start of therapy. Four mRNAs, 6 miRNAs, and 5 lncRNAs were analyzed by quantitative PCR. RNA levels in 30 healthy individuals were used as controls. RNA expression data were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses, and the primary end point was progression-free survival. Clinical factors were included in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Levels of 2 miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-3687, and 1 lncRNA, N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase like 2 antisense RNA 2 (NAALADL2-AS2), were more than 2-fold higher in patients with mCRPC compared with healthy volunteers. Patients with higher levels of miR-375 or miR-3687 showed a shorter time to progression. Patients with higher levels of NAALADL2-AS2 showed a longer time to progression. In the multivariable Cox regression analysis, higher miR-375, miR-3687 and serum prostate-specific antigen concentrations were shown to be independent predictors for shorter time to progression. CONCLUSIONS We identified miR-3687 as a novel prognostic marker for response in patients with CRPC treated with enzalutamide, and we confirmed the prognostic value of miR-375.","Benoist, Guillemette E; van Oort, Inge M; Boerrigter, Emmy; Verhaegh, Gerald W; van Hooij, Onno; Groen, Levi; Smit, Frank; de Mol, Pieter; Hamberg, Paul; Dezentjé, Vincent O; Mehra, Niven; Gerritsen, Winald; Somford, Diederik M; van Erp, Nielka P H; Schalken, Jack A",Clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408351/,319

106215,Call for a bigger vision.,2010,"Microbes broadly constitute several organisms like viruses, protozoa, bacteria, and fungi present in our biosphere. Fast-paced environmental changes have influenced contact of human populations with newly identified microbes resulting in diseases that can spread quickly. These microbes can cause infections like HIV, SARS-CoV2, malaria, nosocomial Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), or Candida infection for which there are no available vaccines/drugs or are less efficient to prevent or treat these infections. In the pursuit to find potential safe agents for therapy of microbial infections, natural biflavonoids like amentoflavone, tetrahydroamentoflavone, ginkgetin, bilobetin, morelloflavone, agathisflavone, hinokiflavone, Garcinia biflavones 1 (GB1), Garcinia biflavones 2 (GB2), robustaflavone, strychnobiflavone, ochnaflavone, dulcisbiflavonoid C, tetramethoxy-6,6″-bigenkwanin and other derivatives isolated from several species of plants can provide effective starting points and become a source of future drugs. These biflavonoids show activity against influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dengue, HIV-AIDS, coxsackieviral, hepatitis, HSV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), protozoal (Leishmaniasis, Malaria) infections, bacterial and fungal infections. Some of the biflavonoids can provide antiviral and protozoal activity by inhibition of neuraminidase, chymotrypsin-like protease, DV-NS5 RNA dependant RNA polymerase, reverse transcriptase (RT), fatty acid synthase, DNA polymerase, UL54 gene expression, Epstein-Barr virus early antigen activation, recombinant cysteine protease type 2.8 (r-CPB2.8), Plasmodium falciparum enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase or cause depolarization of parasitic mitochondrial membranes. They may also provide anti-inflammatory therapeutic activity against the infection-induced cytokine storm. Considering the varied bioactivity of these biflavonoids against these organisms, their structure-activity relationships are derived and wherever possible compared with monoflavones. Overall, this review aims to highlight these natural biflavonoids and briefly discuss their sources, reported mechanism of action, pharmacological uses, and comment on resistance mechanism, flavopiridol repurposing and the bioavailability aspects to provide a starting point for anti-microbial research in this area.","Menezes, José C J M D S; Campos, Vinícius R",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493916/,319

However, the mortality of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with COVID-19 is unclear. Here, we perform a systematic review and meta-analysis, in line with PRISMA guidelines, to assess the reported ICU mortality for patients with confirmed COVID-19. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane databases up to 31 May 2020 for studies reporting ICU mortality for adult patients admitted with COVID-19. The primary outcome measure was death in intensive care as a proportion of completed intensive care unit admissions, either through discharge from the ICU or death. The definition thus excluded patients still alive on ICU. Twenty-four observational studies including 10,150 patients were identified from centres across Asia, Europe, and North America. In-ICU mortality in reported studies ranged from 0-84.6%. Seven studies reported outcome data for all patients. In the remaining studies, the proportion of patients discharged from ICU at the point of reporting varied from 24.5-97.2%. In patients with completed ICU admissions with COVID-19 infection, combined ICU mortality was 41.6% (95%CI 34.0-49.7%, I2 = 93.2%). Subgroup analysis by continent showed that mortality is broadly consistent across the globe. As the pandemic has progressed the reported mortality rates have reduced from above 50% to close to 40%. The in-ICU mortality from COVID-19 is higher than usually seen in ICU admissions with other viral pneumonias. Importantly, the mortality from completed episodes of ICU differs considerably from the crude mortality rates in some early reports.","Armstrong, R A; Kane, A D; Cook, T M",Anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/anae.15201; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602561/,319

METHODS Two hundred seventeen patients were evaluated in a retrospective, multicenter study. Patients were divided into those with either persistent occlusion or recanalization. All patients received admission PCT and follow-up imaging to determine the final ischemic core, which was then retrospectively matched to the PCT images to identify optimal thresholds for the different PCT parameters. These thresholds were assessed for significant variation over time since symptom onset. RESULTS In the persistent occlusion group, optimal PCT parameters that did not significantly change with time included absolute mean transit time, relative mean transit time, relative cerebral blood flow, and relative cerebral blood volume when time was restricted to 15 hours after symptom onset. Conversely, the recanalization group showed no significant time variation for any PCT parameter at any time interval. In the persistent occlusion group, the optimal threshold to delineate the total ischemic area was the relative mean transit time at a threshold of 180%. In patients with recanalization, the optimal parameter to predict the ischemic core was relative cerebral blood volume at a threshold of 66%. CONCLUSIONS Time does not influence the optimal PCT thresholds to delineate the ischemic core and penumbra in the first 15 hours after symptom onset for relative mean transit time and relative cerebral blood volume, the optimal parameters to delineate ischemic core and penumbra.","Qiao, Yujie; Zhu, Guangming; Patrie, James; Xin, Wenjun; Michel, Patrik; Eskandari, Ashraf; Jovin, Tudor; Wintermark, Max",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.003362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24627117/,319

METHODS Patients recovering from Covid-19 pneumonia who presented to our department with any or all of the following complaints: pain, watering, redness and decreased vision were identified. All relevant data were collected for analysis. RESULTS Three patients with endogenous endophthalmitis were identified. All patients had been treated for Covid-19 pneumonia and had received Remdesivir and systemic steroids therefor; 2/3 received tocilizumab. All patients received vitreous biopsy, vitrectomy and intraocular antibiotic injection. Patient 1 demonstrated K.pneumoniae in blood culture, K.pneumoniae and E.coli in urine culture, and K.pneumoniae in vitreous fluid, while patients 2 and 3 demonstrated S.maltophilia and Methicillin Resistant S.Aureus in the blood and nasopharyngeal culture respectively. Correspondingly, the same organism was cultured from vitreous in patients 2 and 3. The visual acuity at last follow up in patients 1-3 was 20/100, 20/80 and 20/40 respectively. The probable source of infection was identified in each as renal calculi, dental caries and the pharynx respectively. Real time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated the presence of SARS CoV-2 in the vitreous fluid of patient 1.

During the Covid-19 crisis, even less time is spent at the bedside, and physical examinations seem markedly truncated or non-existent. It is possible that cost of health care, doctor-patient relationships, and the clinical reasoning skills could be seriously impacted by ongoing decrease in bedside skills and the teaching of these skills. Careful history taking and hypothesis-driven physical examination still form the backbone of clinical reasoning and lead to parsimonious investigations. Overreliance on investigations could drive up costs of healthcare if every diagnosis depends on a head to toe scan. In this paper, we describe strategies for bedside teaching that are relevant and applicable even during the pandemic and an era of physical distancing. These strategies are categorised as: before, during and after patient interactions at the bedside. These strategies can be adapted to normal clinical teaching situations as well as challenging situations such as the current pandemic when physical distancing is mandated.","Dam, Marjel van; Ramani, Subha; Ten Cate, Olle",Medical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1080/0142159x.2020.1798368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726155/,319

We analyzed T-cell exhaustion and senescence, in the context of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1)-related immunity in skeletal muscle biopsies from patients with immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM), and myositis induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (irMyositis). Methods Skeletal muscle biopsies from 12 patients with IMNM, 7 patients with sIBM, and 8 patients with irMyositis were analyzed by immunostaining and immunofluorescence as well as by quantitative PCR. Eight biopsies from nondisease participants served as controls. Results CD3+CD8+ T cells in biopsies from IMNM, sIBM, and irMyositis were largely PD1-positive, while CD68+ macrophages were sparsely positive to the ligand of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-L1). The sarcolemma of myofibers was PD-L2+ and was colocalized with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. CD68+ macrophages were colocalized with PD-L2. Senescent T cells were strongly enriched in skeletal muscle of sIBM, revealing a distinct immunologic signature. Biopsies from patients with irMyositis showed mild signs of senescence and exhaustion. Conclusion Persistent exposure to antigens in IMNMs and sIBM may lead to T-cell exhaustion, a process controlled by the PD1 receptor and its cognate ligands PD-L1/PD-L2. To our knowledge, these data are the first evidence of presence of dysfunctional T cells and relevance of the PD1 pathway in IMNM, sIBM, and irMyositis.

The aim of this study is to compare the sensitivity of different PROs in detecting changes following the initiation of biologic treatment in asthma. Methods: Patients starting a biologic treatment as part of clinical care completed the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-6), the Severe Asthma Questionnaire (SAQ and SAQ-global scores) and the EQ5D (EQ-5D-5L and EQ5D-VAS) at baseline. They completed the ACQ-6, SAQ, SAQ-global and a retrospective global rating of change (GRoC) scale at weeks 4, 8 and 16 and completed the EQ-5D-5L and EQ5D-VAS at week 16. The SAQ-global and EQ5D-VAS differ but both are single item 100-point questions. Sensitivity was measured by Cohen's D effect size at each of the three time points. Results: 110 patients were recruited. Depending on the time of assessment, effect size varied between 0.45 and 0.64 for the SAQ, between 0.50 and 0.77 for the SAQ-global; between 0.45 and 0.69 for ACQ-6; between 0.91 and 1.22 for GRoC; 0.32 for EQ-5D-5L and 0.49 for EQ5D-VAS. Conclusion: The sensitivity to change of a questionnaire varies with the time of measurement. The three asthma-specific prospective measures (SAQ, SAQ-global and ACQ-6) have similar sensitivity to change. The single-item EQ5D-VAS was less sensitive than the asthma specific measures and less sensitive than the single-item SAQ-global.

Research BALs from 21 asymptomatic HCT patients served as controls. Among 69 HCT patients with IPS, 39 (56.5%) had a pathogen detected. The most frequent pathogens were human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) (N = 20 [29%]) followed by human rhinovirus (HRV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Aspergillus (N = 8 [12%] in each). HHV-6 and HRV were rarely detected in controls, whereas CMV and Aspergillus were occasionally detected with low pathogen load. Patients with pathogens had worse day-100 survival than those without (hazard ratio, 1.88; P = .03). Mortality in patients with only pathogens of ""uncertain"" significance in lung was similar to that in patients with pathogens of ""established"" significance. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing did not reveal additional significant pathogens.

There are several types of interferons, which are characterized by their ability to inhibit virus replication and resultant pathogenesis by triggering both innate and cell-mediated immune responses. Virus infection is sensed by a variety of cellular pattern-recognition receptors and triggers the synthesis of interferons, which are secreted by the infected cells. In uninfected cells, cell surface receptors recognize the secreted interferons and activate intracellular signaling pathways that induce the expression of interferon-stimulated genes; the proteins encoded by these genes inhibit different stages of virus replication. To avoid extinction, almost all viruses have evolved mechanisms to defend themselves against the interferon system. Consequently, a dynamic equilibrium of survival is established between the virus and its host, an equilibrium that can be shifted to the host's favor by the use of exogenous interferon as a therapeutic antiviral agent.","Fensterl, Volker; Chattopadhyay, Saurabh; Sen, Ganes C",Annual review of virology,https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-virology-100114-055249; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26958928/,319

Partially automated driving led to slightly higher subjective sleepiness ratings, longer blink durations, decreased pupil diameter, slower heart rate, and higher EEG alpha and theta activity. However, elevated levels of sleepiness mainly arose from the night-time drives when the sleep pressure was high. During daytime, when the drivers were alert, partially automated driving had little or no detrimental effects on driver fatigue. Whether the negative effects of increased sleepiness during partially automated driving can be compensated by the positive effects of lateral and longitudinal driving support needs to be investigated in further studies.","Ahlström, Christer; Zemblys, Raimondas; Jansson, Herman; Forsberg, Christian; Karlsson, Johan; Anund, Anna",Accident; analysis and prevention,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2021.106058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33640613/,319
109805,World News September 2020.,2020-09-01,"Accurate and noninvasive monitoring of the depth of anesthesia (DoA) is highly desirable. Since the anesthetic drugs act mainly on the central nervous system, the analysis of brain activity using electroencephalogram (EEG) is very useful. This paper proposes a novel automated method for assessing the DoA using EEG. First, 11 features including spectral, fractal, and entropy are extracted from EEG signal and then, by applying an algorithm according to exhaustive search of all subsets of features, a combination of the best features (Beta-index, sample entropy, shannon permutation entropy, and detrended fluctuation analysis) is selected. Accordingly, we feed these extracted features to a new neurofuzzy classification algorithm, adaptive neurofuzzy inference system with linguistic hedges (ANFIS-LH). This structure can successfully model systems with nonlinear relationships between input and output, and also classify overlapped classes accurately. ANFIS-LH, which is based on modified classical fuzzy rules, reduces the effects of the insignificant features in input space, which causes overlapping and modifies the output layer structure. The presented method classifies EEG data into awake, light, general, and deep states during anesthesia with sevoflurane in 17 patients. Its accuracy is 92% compared to a commercial monitoring system (response entropy index) successfully. Moreover, this method reaches the classification accuracy of 93% to categorize EEG signal to awake and general anesthesia states by another database of propofol and volatile anesthesia in 50 patients. To sum up, this method is potentially applicable to a new real-time monitoring system to help the anesthesiologist with continuous assessment of DoA quickly and accurately.","Shalbaf, Ahmad; Saffar, Mohsen; Sleigh, Jamie W; Shalbaf, Reza",IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics,https://doi.org/10.1109/jbhi.2017.2709841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28574372/,319
109815,Bifurcation analysis of a phage-bacteria interaction model with prophage induction.,2020-07-28,"The neuroepithelium is a nasal barrier surface populated by olfactory sensory neurons that detect odorants in the airway and convey this information directly to the brain via axon fibers. This barrier surface is especially vulnerable to infection, yet respiratory infections rarely cause fatal encephalitis, suggesting a highly evolved immunological defense. Here, using a mouse model, we sought to understand the mechanism by which innate and adaptive immune cells thwart neuroinvasion by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a potentially lethal virus that uses olfactory sensory neurons to enter the brain after nasal infection. Fate-mapping studies demonstrated that infected central nervous system (CNS) neurons were cleared noncytolytically, yet specific deletion of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) from these neurons unexpectedly had no effect on viral control. Intravital imaging studies of calcium signaling in virus-specific CD8+ T cells revealed instead that brain-resident microglia were the relevant source of viral peptide-MHC I complexes. Microglia were not infected by the virus but were found to cross-present antigen after acquisition from adjacent neurons. Microglia depletion interfered with T cell calcium signaling and antiviral control in the brain after nasal infection. Collectively, these data demonstrate that microglia provide a front-line defense against a neuroinvasive nasal infection by cross-presenting antigen to antiviral T cells that noncytolytically cleanse neurons. Disruptions in this innate defense likely render the brain susceptible to neurotropic viruses like VSV that attempt to enter the CNS via the nose.","Moseman, E Ashley; Blanchard, Alexa C; Nayak, Debasis; McGavern, Dorian B",Science immunology,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abb1817; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32503876/,319
110669,Two BSHS online alternatives to conventional conferences.,2020-11-18,"Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an opportunistic pathogen, constituting an ongoing health concern for immunocompromised patients, the elderly, and neonates. Reports on the isolation of K. pneumoniae from other sources are increasing, many of which express multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Three phylogroups were identified based on nucleotide differences. Niche environments, including plants, animals, and humans appear to be colonized by different phylogroups, among which KpI (K. pneumoniae) is commonly associated with human infection. Infections with K. pneumoniae can be transmitted through contaminated food or water and can be associated with community-acquired infections or between persons and animals involved in hospital-acquired infections. Increasing reports are describing detections along the food chain, suggesting the possibility exists that this could be a hitherto unexplored reservoir for this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. Expression of MDR phenotypes elaborated by these bacteria is due to the nature of various plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-encoding genes, and is a challenge to animal, environmental, and human health alike. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to provide for the rapid identification and screening of antimicrobial susceptibility of Klebsiella isolates. Moreover, hypervirulent isolates linked with extraintestinal infections express phenotypes that may support their niche adaptation. In this review, the prevalence, reservoirs, AMR, Raman spectroscopy detection, and pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae are summarized and various extraintestinal infection pathways are further narrated to extend our understanding of its adaptation and survival ability in reservoirs, and associated disease risks.","Hu, Yujie; Anes, João; Devineau, Stéphanie; Fanning, Séamus",Foodborne pathogens and disease,https://doi.org/10.1089/fpd.2020.2847; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33124929/,319

However, there has not been a thorough global review evaluating these roles in bats across all biogeographical regions of the world. We reviewed the literature published during the last two decades and identified 283 relevant studies: 78 studies where bats controlled potential insect pests, 80 related to the suppression of other arthropods, 60 on the dispersal of native or endemic seeds, 11 related to the dispersal of seeds of introduced plants, 29 on the pollination of native or endemic plants, one study of pollination of introduced plants, and 24 on the use of guano as fertilizer. Our literature search showed that queries combining the terms ""seed dispersal"", ""insectivorous bats"", ""nectarivorous bats"", ""use of guano"" and ""ecosystem services"" returned 577 studies, but less than half were experimental in nature. We found that the evaluation of ecosystem services has been mostly conducted in the Neotropical and Palearctic regions. To detect differences in the selected studies, and to explain trends in the study of ecosystem services provided by bats, we performed generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) fitted with a Poisson distribution to analyze the potential of different sampling methods. We identified 409 bat species that provide ecosystem services (752 insect species consumed by bats and 549 plant species either dispersed or pollinated by bats). Our review summarizes the importance of conserving bat populations and the ecological services they provide, which is an especially crucial concern during the current coronavirus pandemic.

111671,Effective vaccine offers shot of hope for pandemic.,2020-11-13,"Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation caused by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) mutations occurs in approximately 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers (CRC). The antihelminth compound niclosamide downregulates components of the Wnt pathway, specifically Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2) expression, resulting in diminished downstream β-catenin signaling. In this study, we determined whether niclosamide could inhibit the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in human CRCs and whether its inhibition might elicit antitumor effects in the presence of APC mutations. We found that niclosamide inhibited Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation, downregulated Dvl2, decreased downstream β-catenin signaling, and exerted antiproliferative effects in human colon cancer cell lines and CRC cells isolated by surgical resection of metastatic disease, regardless of mutations in APC. In contrast, inhibition of NF-κB or mTOR did not exert similar antiproliferative effects in these CRC model systems. In mice implanted with human CRC xenografts, orally administered niclosamide was well tolerated, achieved plasma and tumor levels associated with biologic activity, and led to tumor control. Our findings support clinical explorations to reposition niclosamide for the treatment of CRC.","Osada, Takuya; Chen, Minyong; Yang, Xiao Yi; Spasojevic, Ivan; Vandeusen, Jeffrey B; Hsu, David; Clary, Bryan M; Clay, Timothy M; Chen, Wei; Morse, Michael A; Lyerly, H Kim",Cancer research,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-10-3978; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21531761/,319
111936,Separating NOM from salts in ion exchange brine with ceramic nanofiltration.,2020-05-03,"A vital arm of the innate immune response to viral infection is the induction and subsequent antiviral effects of interferon (IFN). Rotavirus reduces type I IFN induction in infected cells by the degradation of IFN regulatory factors. Here, we show that the monkey rotavirus RRV and human rotavirus Wa also block gene expression induced by type I and II IFNs through a mechanism allowing signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 activation but preventing their nuclear accumulation. In infected cells, this may allow rotavirus to block the antiviral actions of IFN produced early in infection or by activated immune cells. As the intracellular expression of rotavirus nonstructural proteins NSP1, NSP3, and NSP4 individually did not inhibit IFN-stimulated gene expression, their involvement in this process is unlikely. RRV and Wa rotaviruses also prevented the tumor necrosis factor alpha-stimulated nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-driven gene expression. In addition, NF-kappaB was activated by rotavirus infection, confirming earlier findings by others. As NF-kappaB is important for the induction of IFN and other cytokines during viral infection, this suggests that rotavirus prevents cellular transcription as a means to evade host responses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of this strategy by a double-stranded RNA virus.","Holloway, Gavan; Truong, Thanhmai T; Coulson, Barbara S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01450-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19244315/,319

This paper describes psychological pathways and two key allostatic mediators, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the immune system, through which stressful early rearing conditions may influence adult mental and physical health. The action of meshed gears is introduced as a metaphor to illustrate how responses occurring within a brief time frame, for example, immediate reactions to stressors, can influence developmental and health processes unfolding over much longer spans of time. We identify early-developing psychological and biological response patterns that could link chronic stressors in childhood to later health outcomes. Some of these ""precursor outcomes"" (e.g., heightened vigilance and preparedness for threats; enhanced inflammatory and humoral responses to infectious microorganisms) appear to be aimed at protection from immediate dangers; they may reflect ""adaptive trade-offs"" that balance short-term survival advantages under harsh rearing conditions against disadvantages manifested later in development.

Few studies have explored their combined mental health effects on young people. While self-focused rumination has been suggested to be a key mechanism underlying depression, the role of event-based rumination in mediating the impact of population stressors has yet to be elucidated. METHODS Data were collected from 6988 young people in a large-scale community online survey in Hong Kong. The survey assessed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, direct exposure to social unrest-related traumatic events, coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic-related events, personal stressful life events, event-based rumination and other individual risk factors. RESULTS High levels of comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms were observed. Logistic regression analysis revealed that probable post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with traumatic events (odds ratio = 1.73, 95% confidence interval = [1.64, 1.82]), pandemic-related events (odds ratio = 1.08, confidence interval = [1.01, 1.16]), stressful life events (odds ratio = 1.20, confidence interval = [1.21, 1.37]), high event-based rumination (odds ratio = 3.00, confidence interval = [2.58, 3.48]), lower resilience (odds ratio = 1.18, confidence interval = [1.15, 1.21]), higher smartphone reliance (odds ratio = 1.09, confidence interval = [1.05, 1.13]) and financial concerns (odds ratio = 1.25, confidence interval = [1.18, 1.33]). The odds for probable post-traumatic stress disorder was also significantly higher when two or more traumatic events were experienced (odds ratio = 4.03, confidence interval = [3.52, 4.62]). Factors associated with moderate-to-severe level depressive symptoms were similar. Event-based rumination significantly mediated between different types of external events (traumatic events, pandemic-related events, stressful life events) and both post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION These findings suggest that diverse types of stressful events during population-level crises could add to personal stressors to affect mental health outcomes in young people. Among other protective and risk factors, event-based rumination presented as a prominent transdiagnostic mediator for different symptom dimensions which may be a potentially important target for early risk detection and intervention.","Wong, Stephanie My; Hui, Christy Lm; Suen, Yi Nam; Wong, Corine Sm; Chan, Sherry Kw; Lee, Edwin Hm; Chang, Wing Chung; Chen, Eric Yh",The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211025710; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180248/,319

In this paper, we will describe lessons learned from past pandemics and vaccine campaigns about the path to successful vaccine delivery. The historical record suggests that to have a widely immunized population, leaders must invest in evidence-based vaccine delivery strategies that generate demand, allocate and distribute vaccines, and verify coverage. To generate demand, we must understand the roots of vaccine hesitancy, engage trusted sources of authority to advocate for vaccination, and commit to longitudinal engagement with communities. To allocate vaccines, we must allow qualified organizations and expert coalitions to determine evidence-based vaccination approaches and generate the political will to ensure the cooperation of local and national governments. To distribute vaccines, we must ensure that the people and organizations with expertise in manufacturing, supply chains, and last-mile distribution are positioned to direct efforts. To verify vaccine coverage, we must identify vaccination tracking systems that are portable, interoperable, and secure. Lessons of past pandemics suggest that nations should invest in evidence-informed strategies to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines protect individuals, suppress transmission, and minimize disruption to health services and livelihoods.

The diagnosis of acute infection relies on RT-PCR based viral detection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal serological testing strategy for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies which provides an important indicator of prior infection and potential short-term immunity. METHODS The sensitivity and specificity of four different ELISA assays (Euroimmun IgG, Euroimmun NCP-IgG, Fortress and DIAsource) and one CLIA assay (Roche ELECSYS) were evaluated in 423 samples; 137 patients with confirmed RT-PCR COVID-19 infection (true positives), and 100 pre-pandemic samples collected prior to October 2019 (true negatives). A further 186 samples were collected from healthcare staff and analysed by all five assays. RESULTS The Fortress ELISA assay demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity followed by the Roche ECLIA assay. The highest overall sensitivity came from the assays that measured total antibody (IgM-IgG combined) and the three assays that performed the best (Fortress, Roche, Euroimmun IgG) all have different antigens as their target proteins which suggests that antigen target does not affect assay performance. In mildly symptomatic participants with either a negative RT-PCR or no RT-PCR performed, 16.76% had detectable antibodies suggesting previous infection. CONCLUSIONS We recommend a combined testing strategy utilising assays with different antigenic targets using the fully automated Roche ECLIA assay and confirming discordant samples with the Fortress Total Antibody ELISA assay. This study provides an important indicator of prior infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals.","Heffernan, Emma; Kennedy, Lisa; Hannan, Margaret; Ramlaul, Navneet; Denieffe, Stephanie; Courtney, Garry; Watt, Alison; Hurley, John; Lynch, Maureen; Fitzgibbon, Maria C",Annals of clinical biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1177/00045632211012728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845592/,319

We accumulated ready-to-fuse cells in the presence of the fusion inhibitor lysophosphatidylcholine and then removed the inhibitor to study synchronized cell fusion. We found that osteoclast fusion required the dendrocyte-expressed seven transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP)-dependent non-apoptotic exposure of phosphatidylserine at the surface of fusion-committed cells. Fusion also depended on extracellular annexins, phosphatidylserine-binding proteins, which, along with annexin-binding protein S100A4, regulated fusogenic activity of syncytin 1. Thus, in contrast to fusion processes mediated by a single protein, such as epithelial cell fusion in Caenorhabditis elegans, the cell fusion step in osteoclastogenesis is controlled by phosphatidylserine-regulated activity of several proteins.","Verma, Santosh K; Leikina, Evgenia; Melikov, Kamran; Gebert, Claudia; Kram, Vardit; Young, Marian F; Uygur, Berna; Chernomordik, Leonid V",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m117.809681; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29101233/,319

AIMS To evaluate the association between mental disorders and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes following COVID-19. METHOD We performed a cohort study using the Korean COVID-19 patient database based on national health insurance data. Each person with a mental or behavioural disorder (diagnosed during the 6 months prior to their first SARS-CoV-2 test) was matched by age, gender and Charlson Comorbidity Index with up to four people without mental disorders. SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk and the risk of death or severe events (intensive care unit admission, use of mechanical ventilation and acute respiratory distress syndrome) post-infection were calculated using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Among 230 565 people tested for SARS-CoV-2, 33 653 (14.6%) had mental disorders; 928/33 653 (2.76%) tested SARS-CoV-2 positive and 56/928 (6.03%) died. In multivariable analysis using the matched cohort, there was no association between mental disorders and SARS-CoV-2-positivity risk (odds ratio OR = 0.95; 95% CI 0.87-1.04); however, a higher risk was associated with schizophrenia-related disorders (OR = 1.50; 95% CI 1.14-1.99). Among confirmed COVID-19 patients, the mortality risk was significantly higher in patients with than in those without mental disorders (OR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.15-3.43).

However, outcomes of stent retrieval may differ between acute arterial occlusions due to intracranial atherosclerotic disease (IAD) and those due to embolism. This case series describes the outcomes of stent retriever-based thrombectomy and rescue treatments in 9 patients with IAD-related occlusion. METHODS Among patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute intracranial large artery occlusion, those in whom stent retrieval was attempted as first-line treatment were included in this review. IAD was defined as significant fixed focal stenosis at the occlusion site, which was evident on final angiographic assessment or observed during endovascular treatment. RESULTS Median number of stent retriever passes was 2 (range, 1-3), and temporary bypass was seen in all patients. Immediate partial recanalization (arterial occlusive lesion grade 2-3) was observed in 7 patients. Immediate modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction grade 2b-3 was seen in 6 patients, but the lesions often required rescue treatment due to reocclusion or flow insufficiency. In terms of rescue treatments, angioplasty and intra-arterial tirofiban infusion seemed to be effective. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that stent retrieval can effectively remove thrombi from stenotic lesions and achieve partial recanalization despite the tendency toward reocclusion in most patients with IAD-related occlusion. Further research into the use of rescue treatments, such as tirofiban infusion and angioplasty, is warranted.","Lee, Jin Soo; Hong, Ji Man; Lee, Kyu Sun; Suh, Hong Il; Choi, Jin Wook; Kim, Sun Yong",Journal of stroke,https://doi.org/10.5853/jos.2015.01347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26467196/,319

Here, we report that expression of this immune-regulator in mouse B-1a cells has a critical function in maintaining self-tolerance by regulating these early-developing B cells that express a repertoire enriched for auto-reactivity. Selective deletion of CTLA-4 from B cells results in mice that spontaneously develop autoantibodies, T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and germinal centers (GCs) in the spleen, and autoimmune pathology later in life. This impaired immune homeostasis results from B-1a cell dysfunction upon loss of CTLA-4. Therefore, CTLA-4-deficient B-1a cells up-regulate epigenetic and transcriptional activation programs and show increased self-replenishment.

118602,"A year after lockdowns began, has research got any kinder?",2021-06-10,"INTRODUCTION Evidence requirements may differ across HTA bodies, and so pharmaceutical companies must plan to synergize their evidence generation strategy, across global regulatory and HTA bodies. Until recently, companies had no official platform to discuss the clinical development of a drug with HTA bodies; however, this is changing. OBJECTIVES To achieve broad usage in the EU, products must achieve both regulatory and reimbursement approval, the latter of which is based on HTA appraisal in many markets. The objective of this study is to present and evaluate the different options available for early HTA consultation (during drug development/Phase III) in the major European markets from the industry perspective. METHODS An exploratory (nonsystematic) literature review was performed to identify the European markets offering early HTA consultations, and each process was analyzed using a set of predefined metrics that are relevant to industry (the ability to consult with the regulatory body in parallel, consultation fees, length of consultation meeting, language of consultation meeting, maximum number of pharmaceutical company employees attending, procedural timelines, nature of data for which consultative advice can be sought, the output of the process, and the ability to involve external experts). RESULTS Four different types of early HTA consultation processes were identified across the major European HTA markets. The nature of these processes varied in terms of the types and number of questions that can be addressed, the length of the meeting, the reporting output, and the ability to involve external experts. CONCLUSIONS The availability of various options for early HTA consultation may help to avoid a mismatch between the evidence generated by means of a product's clinical development program, and the evidence expected by HTA bodies and payers, which can facilitate the pricing and reimbursement process upon a product's market authorization.","Cuche, Matthieu; Beckerman, Rachel; Chowdhury, Cyrus A; van Weelden, Marije A",International journal of technology assessment in health care,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0266462314000713; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25816822/,319

121124,Exploring Nurses' Perceptions of Safety: A Phenomenological Study.,2020-12-29,"Rationale Optimal secondary prevention of embolic stroke of undetermined source is not established. The current standard in these patients is acetylsalicylic acid, despite high prevalence of yet undetected paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Aim The ATTICUS randomized trial is designed to determine whether the factor Xa inhibitor apixaban administered within 7 days after embolic stroke of undetermined source, is superior to acetylsalicylic acid for prevention of new ischemic lesions documented by brain magnetic resonance imaging within 12 months after index stroke. Design Prospective, randomized, blinded, parallel-group, open-label, German multicenter phase III trial in approximately 500 patients with embolic stroke of undetermined source. A key inclusion criterion is the presence or the planned implantation of an insertable cardiac monitor. Patients are 1:1 randomized to apixaban or acetylsalicylic acid and treated for a 12-month period. It is an event-driven trial aiming for core-lab adjudicated primary outcome events. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the occurrence of at least one new ischemic lesion identified by axial T2-weighted FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging and/or axial DWI magnetic resonance imaging at 12 months when compared with the baseline magnetic resonance imaging. Key secondary outcomes are the combination of recurrent ischemic strokes, hemorrhagic strokes, systemic embolism; combination of MACE including recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death and combination of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding defined according to ISTH, and change of cognitive function and quality of life (EQ-5D, Stroke Impact Scale). Discussion Embolic stroke of undetermined source is caused by embolic disease and associated with a high risk of recurrent ischemic strokes and clinically silent cerebral ischemic lesions. ATTICUS will investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation detected by insertable cardiac monitor and the effects of early anticoagulation with apixaban compared with antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid on the incidence of new ischemic lesion after embolic stroke of undetermined source.","Geisler, Tobias; Poli, Sven; Meisner, Christoph; Schreieck, Juergen; Zuern, Christine S; Nägele, Thomas; Brachmann, Johannes; Jung, Werner; Gahn, Georg; Schmid, Elisabeth; Bäezner, Hansjörg; Keller, Timea; Petzold, Gabor C; Schrickel, Jan-Wilko; Liman, Jan; Wachter, Rolf; Schön, Frauke; Schabet, Martin; Lindner, Alfred; Ludolph, Albert C; Kimmig, Hubert; Jander, Sebastian; Schlegel, Uwe; Gawaz, Meinrad; Ziemann, Ulf",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493016681019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881833/,319

It provides unparalleled manipulation capability to surgeons and has superseded traditional electrosurgical tools particularly in abdominal surgery, but is yet to be validated with REIMS. The REIMS platform coupled with the Harmonic device was shown to produce tissue-specific lipid profiles through the analysis of porcine tissues in both negative and positive ionization modes. Comparison with other methods of electrosurgical dissection, such as monopolar electrosurgery and CO2 laser, showed spectral differences in the profile dependent on the energy device used. The Harmonic device demonstrated major spectral differences in the phospholipid region of m/z 600-1000 compared with the monopolar electrosurgical and CO2 laser-generated spectra. Within the Harmonic REIMS spectra, high intensities of diglycerides and triglycerides were observed. In contrast, monopolar electrosurgical and laser spectra demonstrated high abundances of glycerophospholipids. The Harmonic scalpel was able to differentiate between the liver, muscle, colon, and small intestine, demonstrating 100% diagnostic accuracy. The validation of the Harmonic device-mass spectrometry combination will allow the platform to be used safely and robustly for real-time in vivo surgical tissue identification in a variety of clinical applications.","Manoli, Eftychios; Mason, Sam; Ford, Lauren; Adebesin, Afeez; Bodai, Zsolt; Darzi, Ara; Kinross, James; Takats, Zoltan",Analytical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00270; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787247/,319

The biopsy specimen showed grade II invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. We duplicated the steps of our laparoscopic nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy procedure to perform a nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy via LESS using conventional ports and instruments. Oncologic clearance was comparable to that in conventional laparoscopic radical hysterectomy. Bladder function recovered completely after removal of the Foley catheter.

123264,Emerging from AI utopia.,2020-04-03,"CONTEXT The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic laid bare the immediate need for primary palliative care education for many clinicians. Primary care clinicians in our health system reported an urgent need for support in advance care planning and end-of-life symptom management for their vulnerable patients. This article describes the design and dissemination of palliative care education for primary care clinicians using an established curriculum development method. OBJECTIVES To develop a succinct and practical palliative care toolkit for use by primary care clinicians during the COVID-19 pandemic, focused on 2 key elements: (i) advance care planning communication skills based on the narrative 3-Act Model and (ii) comfort care symptom management at the end of life. RESULTS The toolkit was finalized through an iterative process involving a team of end-users and experts in palliative care and primary care, including social work, pharmacy, nursing, and medicine. The modules were formatted into an easily navigable, smartphone-friendly document to be used at point of care. The toolkit was disseminated to our institution's primary care network with practices spanning our state. Early feedback has been positive. CONCLUSION While we had been focused primarily on the inpatient setting, our palliative care team at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center pivoted existing infrastructure and curriculum development expertise to meet the expressed needs of our primary care colleagues during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through collaboration with an interprofessional team including end-users, we designed and disseminated a concise palliative care toolkit within 6 weeks.","Roberts, Benjamin; Wright, Scott M; Christmas, Colleen; Robertson, Mariah; Wu, David Shih",The American journal of hospice & palliative care,https://doi.org/10.1177/1049909120944868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32720520/,319

124574,Multiparameter Tests of General Relativity Using Multiband Gravitational-Wave Observations.,2020-11-13,"Background Increasing numbers of neonates are undergoing painful procedures in low-income and middle-income countries, with adequate analgesia seldom used. In collaboration with a multi-disciplinary team in Kenya, we aimed to establish the first evidence-based guidelines for the management of routine procedure-related neonatal pain that consider low-resource hospital settings. METHODS We did a systematic review by searching MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases for studies published from Jan 1, 1953, to March 31, 2019. We included data from randomised controlled trials using heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), premature infant pain profile (PIPP) score, neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS) score, neonatal facial coding system score, and douleur aiguë du nouveau-né scale score as pain outcome measures. We excluded studies in which neonates were undergoing circumcision or were intubated, studies from which data were unextractable, or when pain was scored by non-trained individuals. We did a narrative synthesis of all studies, and meta-analysis when data were available from multiple studies comparing the same analgesics and controls and using the same outcome measures. 17 Kenyan health-care professionals formed our clinical guideline development panel, and we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and the panel's knowledge of the local health-care context to guide the guideline development process. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019126620. FINDINGS Of 2782 studies assessed for eligibility, data from 149 (5%) were analysed, with 80 (3%) of these further contributing to our meta-analysis. We found a high level of certainty for the superiority of breastfeeding over placebo or no intervention (standardised mean differences [SMDs] were -1·40 [95% CI -1·96 to -0·84] in PIPP score and -2·20 [-2·91 to -1·48] in NIPS score), and the superiority of oral sugar solutions over placebo or no intervention (SMDs were -0·38 [-0·61 to -0·16] in heart rate and 0·23 [0·04 to 0·42] in SpO2). We found a moderate level of certainty for the superiority for expressed breastmilk over placebo or no intervention (SMDs were -0·46 [95% CI -0·87 to -0·05] in heart rate and 0·48 [0·20 to 0·75] in SpO2). Therefore, the panel recommended that breastfeeding should be given as first-line analgesic treatment, initiated at least 2 min pre-procedure. Given contextual factors, for neonates who are unable to breastfeed, 1-2 mL of expressed breastmilk should be given as first-line analgesic, or 1-2 mL of oral sugar (≥10% concentration) as second-line analgesic. The panel also recommended parental presence during procedures with adjunctive provision of skin-to-skin care, or non-nutritive sucking when possible. INTERPRETATION We have generated Kenya's first neonatal analgesic guidelines for routine procedures, which have been adopted by the Kenyan Ministry of Health, and have shown a framework for clinical guideline development that is applicable to other low-income and middle-income health-care settings.

METHODS We studied patients with CS/TIA who were randomized to ICM within the CRYSTAL AF study. We assessed whether age, sex, race, body mass index, type and severity of index ischemic event, CHADS2 score, PR interval, and presence of diabetes, hypertension, congestive heart failure, or patent foramen ovale and premature atrial contractions predicted AF development within the initial 12 and 36 months of follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS Among 221 patients randomized to ICM (age 61.6 ± 11.4 years, 64% male), AF episodes were detected in 29 patients within 12 months and 42 patients at 36 months. Significant univariate predictors of AF at 12 months included age (hazard ratio [HR] per decade 2.0 [95% confidence interval 1.4-2.8], p = 0.002), CHADS2 score (HR 1.9 per one point [1.3-2.8], p = 0.008), PR interval (HR 1.3 per 10 milliseconds [1.2-1.4], p < 0.0001), premature atrial contractions (HR 3.9 for >123 vs 0 [1.3-12.0], p = 0.009 across quartiles), and diabetes (HR 2.3 [1.0-5.2], p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis, age (HR per decade 1.9 [1.3-2.8], p = 0.0009) and PR interval (HR 1.3 [1.2-1.4], p < 0.0001) remained significant and together yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78 (0.70-0.85). The same predictors were found at 36 months. CONCLUSION Increasing age and a prolonged PR interval at enrollment were independently associated with an increased AF incidence in CS patients. However, they offered only moderate predictive ability in determining which CS patients had AF detected by the ICM.","Thijs, Vincent N; Brachmann, Johannes; Morillo, Carlos A; Passman, Rod S; Sanna, Tommaso; Bernstein, Richard A; Diener, Hans-Christoph; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Rymer, Marilyn M; Hogge, Laurence; Rogers, Tyson B; Ziegler, Paul D; Assar, Manish D",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000002282; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26683642/,319

However, it remains unclear how real-world social networks could influence the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches. To address this issue, we simulated control strategies for SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a real-world social network generated from high-resolution GPS data that were gathered in the course of a citizen-science experiment3,4. We found that tracing the contacts of contacts reduced the size of simulated outbreaks more than tracing of only contacts, but this strategy also resulted in almost half of the local population being quarantined at a single point in time. Testing and releasing non-infectious individuals from quarantine led to increases in outbreak size, suggesting that contact tracing and quarantine might be most effective as a 'local lockdown' strategy when contact rates are high. Finally, we estimated that combining physical distancing with contact tracing could enable epidemic control while reducing the number of quarantined individuals. Our findings suggest that targeted tracing and quarantine strategies would be most efficient when combined with other control measures such as physical distancing.","Firth, Josh A; Hellewell, Joel; Klepac, Petra; Kissler, Stephen; Kucharski, Adam J; Spurgin, Lewis G",Nature medicine,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-020-1036-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32770169/,319
126137,Delaying COP26 is not a reason to delay climate action.,2020-06-01,"BACKGROUND An estimated 85,000 cases of lymphoma (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) were diagnosed in the United States in 2020. Financial insecurity is known to negatively impact health outcomes. In 2021, as Americans continue to file for unemployment at rates far above pre-COVID-19 pandemic peak levels, there is a persistent need to address the economic burden of diagnoses and threat of financial stressors and its related conditions, which are already known to cause substantial economic burden. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data were obtained from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a cross-sectional survey conducted annually by the National Center for Health Statistics. Two questions were asked of patients to identify potential risk factors of financial insecurity regarding patients' ability to pay medical bills. NHIS respondents between the years 1997 and 2018 self-reporting a history of lymphoma diagnoses was included in the analysis. RESULTS Among over 2 million respondents to the NHIS between 1997 and 2018, 1619 individuals reported a history of lymphoma; 9.95% reported delaying medical care due to cost within the previous 12 months; and 6.52% reported not being able to afford medical care in the previous 12 months. Among the subgroups that had the highest risk of delaying medical care were patients between the ages of 25 and 64 years and the uninsured. CONCLUSION Financial burdens impede patients' abilities to access and adhere to care, which can contribute to poorer health outcomes. As financially insecure patients continue to present with lymphoma diagnoses, it is vital for practicing hematologists to understand the links among health care, financial insecurity, and demographic risk factors in order to devise and implement appropriate interventions.","Jella, Taral K; Cwalina, Thomas B; Treisman, Jonathan; Hamadani, Mehdi","Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clml.2021.02.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33785298/,319

The phase II HORIZON trial evaluated the efficacy of melflufen plus dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), a population with an important unmet medical need. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients with RRMM refractory to pomalidomide and/or an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody received melflufen 40 mg intravenously on day 1 of each 28-day cycle plus once weekly oral dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg (20 mg in patients older than 75 years). The primary end point was overall response rate (partial response or better) assessed by the investigator and confirmed by independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The primary analysis is complete with long-term follow-up ongoing. RESULTS Of 157 patients (median age 65 years; median five prior lines of therapy) enrolled and treated, 119 patients (76%) had triple-class-refractory disease, 55 (35%) had extramedullary disease, and 92 (59%) were refractory to previous alkylator therapy. The overall response rate was 29% in the all-treated population, with 26% in the triple-class-refractory population. In the all-treated population, median duration of response was 5.5 months, median progression-free survival was 4.2 months, and median overall survival was 11.6 months at a median follow-up of 14 months. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 96% of patients, most commonly neutropenia (79%), thrombocytopenia (76%), and anemia (43%). Pneumonia (10%) was the most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic event. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding (both grade 3/4 but fully reversible) occurred concomitantly in four patients. GI events, reported in 97 patients (62%), were predominantly grade 1/2 (93%); none were grade 4. CONCLUSION Melflufen plus dexamethasone showed clinically meaningful efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM, including those with triple-class-refractory and extramedullary disease.","Richardson, Paul G; Oriol, Albert; Larocca, Alessandra; Bladé, Joan; Cavo, Michele; Rodriguez-Otero, Paula; Leleu, Xavier; Nadeem, Omar; Hiemenz, John W; Hassoun, Hani; Touzeau, Cyrille; Alegre, Adrián; Paner, Agne; Maisel, Christopher; Mazumder, Amitabha; Raptis, Anastasios; Moreb, Jan S; Anderson, Kenneth C; Laubach, Jacob P; Thuresson, Sara; Thuresson, Marcus; Byrne, Catriona; Harmenberg, Johan; Bakker, Nicolaas A; Mateos, María-Victoria",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.20.02259; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296242/,319

A homeostasis of host immune responses, induced due to viral infection and further ubiquitination, is maintained by the action of deubiquitinases (DUB). Infecting viruses utilize the process of deubiquitination for tricking host immune system wherein viral DUBs compete with host DUBs for inhibition of innate-immune anti-viral signalling pathways, which instead of maintaining an immune homeostasis bring about virus-mediated pathogenesis. This suggests that viruses co-evolve with their hosts to acquire similar machinery for tricking immune surveillance and establishing infection.","Kumari, Puja; Kumar, Himanshu",Critical reviews in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841x.2017.1368999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28885059/,319
127160,Is India's coronavirus death 'paradox' vanishing?,2021-05-07,"Cardiac cell therapy has gained increasing interest and implantation of biomaterials associated with cells has become a major issue to optimize myocardial cell delivery. Rodent model of myocardial infarction (MI) consisting of Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD) ligation has commonly been performed via a thoracotomy; a second open-heart surgery via a sternotomy has traditionally been performed for epicardial application of the treatment. Since the description of LAD ligation model, post-surgery mortality rate has dropped from 35-13%, however the second surgery has remained critical. In order to improve post-surgery recovery and reduce pain and infection, minimally invasive surgical procedures are presented. Two thoracotomies were performed, the initial one for LAD ligation and the second one for treatment epicardial administration. Biografts consisting of cells associated with solid or gel type matrices were applied onto the infarcted area. LAD ligation resulted in loss of heart function as confirmed by echocardiography performed after 2 and 6 weeks. Goldner trichrome staining performed on heart sections confirmed transmural scar formation. First and second surgeries resulted in less that 10% post-operative mortality.","Frobert, Aurélien; Valentin, Jérémy; Cook, Stéphane; Lopes-Vicente, Justine; Giraud, Marie-Noëlle",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/51390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25285992/,319

Editors and publishers compete for impact factor rankings, to demonstrate how important their journals are, and researchers strive to publish in perceived top journals, despite high publication and access charges. This raises questions of how top journals are identified, whether assessments of impacts are accurate and whether high publication charges borne by the research community are justified, bearing in mind that they also collectively provide free peer-review to the publishers. Although traditional journals accelerated peer review and publication during the COVID-19 pandemic, preprint servers made a greater impact with over 30,000 open access articles becoming available and accelerating a trend already seen in other fields of research. We review and comment on the advantages and disadvantages of a range of assessment methods and the way in which they are used by researchers, managers, employers and publishers. We argue that new approaches to assessment are required to provide a realistic and comprehensive measure of the value of research and journals and we support open access publishing at a modest, affordable price to benefit research producers and consumers.","Triggle, Chris R; MacDonald, Ross; Triggle, David J; Grierson, Donald",Accountability in research,https://doi.org/10.1080/08989621.2021.1909481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33787413/,319

Since then, Australia has experienced unprecedented warming related to climate change and an associated increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, storms, bushfires and air pollution. These events have had major impacts on community physical and mental health. OBJECTIVE The aim of this article is to describe the health impacts of climate change and the role of general practitioners (GPs) in responding to these impacts. DISCUSSION While the clinical skills that underpin general practice have not changed, the environmental and planetary context has shifted. A 'planetary health' approach is required. Climate change should now be considered a health emergency. GPs have a critical role in mitigation and adaptation. Responding to climate change aligns with principles of preventive health and can produce 'co-benefits' for individual and population health.","Pendrey, Catherine Georgia Anne; Beaton, Laura; Kneebone, Jessica Alice",Australian journal of general practice,https://doi.org/10.31128/ajgp-01-20-5207; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738867/,319

This article will elaborate on the clinical features of inpatients with COVID-19 and AIS and the pathophysiological mechanism of AIS under the background of COVID-19. Through a detailed search of relevant studies, we found that the incidence of AIS among COVID-19 patients varied from 0.9% to 4.6%, and AIS has been observed in many people without underlying diseases and cardiovascular risk factors as well as young people. The National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of COVID-19 patients with AIS was higher than historical AIS patients, and the proportion of large vessel occlusion (LVO) was about 64.2%. COVID-19 patients with AIS have commonly high levels of D-D dimer, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), suggesting systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable state. The pooled mortality of COVID-19 patients with AIS was 38% and the mortality of LVO patients is higher (45.9%). Compared with COVID-19-negative AIS patients in the same period in 2020 and 2019, COVID- 19 patients with AIS had a worse prognosis.","Chen, Shiling; Pan, Chao; Zhang, Ping; Tang, Yingxin; Tang, Zhouping",Current neurovascular research,https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202617999201110200410; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33176647/,319
127720,How COVID curbed undergraduate research opportunities.,2021-05-04,"BACKGROUND Little is known about factors affecting implementation of patient safety programmes in low and middle-income countries. The goal of our study was to evaluate the implementation of a patient safety programme for paediatric care in Guatemala. METHODS We used a mixed methods design to examine the implementation of a patient safety programme across 11 paediatric units at the Roosevelt Hospital in Guatemala. The safety programme included: (1) tools to measure and foster safety culture, (2) education of patient safety, (3) local leadership engagement, (4) safety event reporting systems, and (5) quality improvement interventions. Key informant staff (n=82) participated in qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys to identify implementation challenges early during programme deployment from May to July 2018, with follow-up focus group discussions in two units 1 year later to identify opportunities for programme modification. Data were analysed using thematic analysis, and integrated using triangulation, complementarity and expansion to identify emerging themes using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Salience levels were reported according to coding frequency, with valence levels measured to characterise the degree to which each construct impacted implementation. RESULTS We found several facilitators to safety programme implementation, including high staff receptivity, orientation towards patient-centredness and a desire for protocols. Key barriers included competing clinical demands, lack of knowledge about patient safety, limited governance, human factors and poor organisational incentives. Modifications included use of tools for staff recognition, integration of education into error reporting mechanisms and designation of trained champions to lead unit-based safety interventions. CONCLUSION Implementation of safety programmes in low-resource settings requires recognition of facilitators such as staff receptivity and patient-centredness as well as barriers such as lack of training in patient safety and poor organisational incentives. Embedding an implementation analysis during programme deployment allows for programme modification to enhance successful implementation.","Hall, Bria J; Puente, Melany; Aguilar, Angie; Sico, Isabelle; Orozco Barrios, Monica; Mendez, Sindy; Baumgartner, Joy Noel; Boyd, David; Calgua, Erwin; Lou-Meda, Randall; Ramirez, Carla C; Diez, Ana; Tello, Astrid; Sexton, J Bryan; Rice, Henry",BMJ quality & safety,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2020-012552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34039747/,319
127876,The sentinels.,2021-04-30,"BACKGROUND At a clinical level, the intensity of dynamic balance tasks incorporating cross-coordination movements (CCM) is typically progressed by changing the stability of the support surface on which the movement is undertaken. However, biomechanical changes in CCMs performed on stable and unstable surfaces have not yet been quantified. RESEARCH QUESTION Do movement patterns, muscle activity, coordination strategies, knee joint loading and center of mass (CoM) movement differ during a CCM performed on stable and unstable surfaces? METHODS Motion analysis was used to monitor limb kinematics and surface electromyography to analyze supporting leg muscle activity in sixteen healthy athletes during a single-limb support task involving a cyclic CCM on a stable and unstable surface. Angle-angle plots were used to explore coordination strategies in sagittal movement of the hip and shoulder, while differences in kinematics and muscle activity between stable and unstable conditions were evaluated using dependent t-tests (α-level = 0.05). RESULTS CCMs on an unstable surface were performed at a slower speed (p < .05), with a more flexed posture of the support knee (p < .05) and ankle (p < .05) and resulted in reduced hip and shoulder movement of the swing limbs (p < .05). Instability increased activation of selected muscles of the ankle and knee (p < .05), resulted in a two-fold increase in the peak knee adduction moment (p < .05), and was accompanied by greater CoM movement (p < .05). Three coordination patterns of the swing limbs observed when performing CCM on a stable surface, which were mostly preserved on the unstable surface. SIGNIFICANCE Despite adopting several stabilization strategies, CCM undertaken on an unstable surface still evoked greater excursion of the center of mass and, as such, presented a greater challenge to sensorimotor control. Adding instability in form of a swinging platform provides progression of dynamic balance CCM difficulty in an athletic population.","Pohl, Torsten; Brauner, Torsten; Wearing, Scott; Horstmann, Thomas",Gait & posture,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.07.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32888551/,319

Objectives In this cross-sectional study we aimed to investigate the risk factors of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria that caused community-acquired UTI (CA-UTI). Methods Consecutive patients admitted to the Urology and Infectious Diseases policlinics with the diagnosis of CA-UTI were included in the study. A standard form including possible predisposing factors for MDR bacteria was applied. Results In total, 240 patients (51.3% females) were enrolled in the study. The mean age of participants were 59.8 ± 18.3 years old. Escherichia coli (n =166; 69.2%)was the most frequently isolated bacteria and its incidence was higher in females than in males (p=0.01). In total, 129 (53.8%) of the identified pathogens were MDR bacteria. According to multivariate analysis, the use of antibiotics three or more times increased the risk of infection with MDR bacteria by 4.6 times, the history of urinary tract infection in the last 6 months by 2 times, being male and over 65 years old by 3 times. Conclusion Doctors should consider prescribing broad-spectrum antibiotics in patients with severe UTIs with a history of UTI, advanced age, male gender, and multiple antibiotic usage, even if they have a CA-UTI.","Guclu, Ertugrul; Halis, Fikret; Kose, Elif; Ogutlu, Aziz; Karabay, Oğuz",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v21i1.28; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394300/,319

OBJECTIVES The objective of this study is to determine the experiences and psychosocial problems of nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey. SETTINGS The data were collected between 9 May and 12 May 2020, in Istanbul, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS The study sample consisted of 10 nurses, who cared for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. METHODS The research employed the descriptive phenomenological approach. The interviews were conducted face-to-face via the internet and were analysed with Colaizzi's seven-step method. RESULTS The experiences and psychosocial problems among nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were categorised under three themes, which were further divided into subcategories. The theme of the effects of the outbreak was divided into working conditions, psychological effects and social effects; the theme of short-term coping strategies was divided into normalisation, refusal to dwell on experiences, avoidance, expression of emotions and distraction; and the theme of necessities was divided into psychosocial support and resource management. CONCLUSION The nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Turkey were adversely affected, both psychologically and socially, by the pandemic; they used short-term coping strategies, and they needed psychosocial support and resource management. They also faced stigmatising attitudes and experiencing burnout and were at risk for secondary traumas due to witnessing disease and death.","Kackin, Ozlem; Ciydem, Emre; Aci, Ozgur Sema; Kutlu, Fatma Yasemin",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020942788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32674644/,319

We aim to summarize different aspects, such as CoV immune evasion mechanisms and host innate immune response to these infections, and their role in pathogenesis. We have also elaborated the up-to-date findings on different vaccine development strategies and progress against CoVs in both humans and non-human models. Most importantly, we have described the Phageome-human immune interaction, its therapeutic usage as anti-viral, anti-inflammatory agent, and implications for multiple vaccine development systems. The data suggest that endogenous phages might play a vital role in eliminating the infection and regulating the body's immune system. Considering the innate-immune-induced pathogenesis against CoVs and the therapeutic aptitude of phageome, we propose that the prophylactic administration of phages and phage-based vaccines could be a useful strategy to control the emerging CoV infections.","Abaidullah, M; Peng, S; Kamran, M; Song, X; Ali Sher, A; Chen, Y; Rehman, A; Lin, L; Jia, R; Yin, Z",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/20-592-a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34042415/,319

Years of inadequate funding of the nation's federal, state, and local public health agencies, together with mismanagement by the Trump administration, hampered the early response to the epidemic. Meanwhile, barriers to care faced by uninsured and underinsured individuals in the United States could deter COVID-19 care and hamper containment efforts, and lead to adverse medical and financial outcomes for infected individuals and their families, particularly those from disadvantaged groups. While the United States has a relatively generous supply of Intensive Care Unit beds and most other health care infrastructure, such medical resources are often unevenly distributed or deployed, leaving some areas ill-prepared for a severe respiratory epidemic. These deficiencies and shortfalls have stimulated a debate about policy solutions. Recent legislation, for instance, expanded coverage for testing for COVID-19 for the uninsured and underinsured, and additional reforms have been proposed. However comprehensive health care reform - for example, via national health insurance - is needed to provide full protection to American families during the COVID-19 outbreak and in its aftermath.","Gaffney, Adam; Himmelstein, David U; Woolhandler, Steffie","International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",https://doi.org/10.1177/0020731420931431; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32515260/,319

METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study from February 2018 to September 2019 among patients ≥50 years admitted in medical and surgical services of six hospitals in Togo. Data were recorded during hospitalization and through telephone follow-up survey within 90 days after admission. The main outcome was all-cause mortality at 3 months. Survival curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were performed to assess predictors of mortality. RESULTS The median age of the 650 older adults included in the study period was 61 years, IQR: [55-70] and at least one comorbidity was identified in 59.7% of them. The all-cause mortality rate of 17.2% (95%CI: 14.4-20.4) and the majority of death (93.7%) occurred in hospital. Overall survival rate was 85.5 and 82.8% after 30 and 90 days of follow-up, respectively.

METHODS Patients with esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy between July 2013 and July 2014 were included in this study. The gastric conduit was used for reconstruction in all patients and end-to-side cervical anastomosis were performed using a circular stapler. The patients were divided into a narrow group (3-5 cm) and a wide group (>5 cm) based on the gastric conduit width. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze the possible factors (patients' age, gender, preoperative comorbidities, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, gastric conduit width, anastomotic leakage) that could affect the incidence of BAS. RESULTS Two-hundred and one patients were included in this study. The median follow-up period was 29 months (17-58 months). Seven cases (3.5%) showed anastomotic leakage in the postoperative period and 38 patients (18.9%) developed BAS; all within the first year of follow-up. In univariate analysis, the width of the gastric conduit was the only risk factor for the development of BAS (odds ratio [OR] = 3.36, P = .005). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the wide group was an independent significant risk factor for the development of BAS developing compared with the narrow group (OR = 2.84, P = .02).

To minimize the effects of the confounding factors including age, gender and other comorbidities, we excluded patients with comorbidities other than hypertension, and matched the patients with and without hypertension for age and gender at a 1:1 ratio. We analyzed the clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and clinical outcomes of in 32 matched pairs of patients with and without hypertension. RESULTS Compared with the normotensive patients, COVID-19 patients with hypertension were more likely to develop bacterial infections (P=0.002) and had higher neutrophil counts (P=0.007), neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (P=0.045), and lactate dehydrogenase levels (P=0.035). A greater proportion of patients had bilateral patchy opacities on chest CT (P=0.012) in the hypertension group than in the normotensive group. COVID-19 patients with hypertension group were more likely to receive antibiotics (P=0.035) and corticosteroid therapies (P=0.035). CONCLUSIONS Hypertension increases the risk of bacterial infection in patients with COVID-19. Hypertensive patients with COVID-19 have higher neutrophil counts and neutrophil/ lymphocyte ratios and are more likely to require treatment with antibiotics. Hypertensive patients with COVID-19 should therefore take cautions to avoid bacterial infections.","Chengyi, H U; Lushan, Xiao; Hongbo, Zhu; Yanpei, Zhang; Wenfeng, Zhang; Li, Liu; Hong, Zhu",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.11.01; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243750/,319
137617,Biocleaning on Cultural Heritage: new frontiers of microbial biotechnologies.,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Recently, positive data from several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of endovascular therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) has emerged. The aim of this retrospective study is to present our clinical experience in cerebral vessel occlusion treatment using retrievable intracranial stents. METHODS Forty-three consecutive patients with ischemic stroke (median age 75, range 22-87) treated by stent retriever thrombectomy (Solitaire™ FR) between January 2013 and December 2015 were identified. We retrospectively assessed Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale (2b-3 considered as successful recanalization), clinical outcome using modified Rankin scale (mRs) at 3 months (regarding score 0-2 as good clinical outcome), device-related complications and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH; parenchymal hematoma Type 1 or 2 and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score increment ≥4 points) rate. RESULTS The mean NIHSS score on admission was 16.4 (median 16). The mean time from onset to groin puncture (time to treatment) was 290min (median 254min). Successful recanalization was achieved in 30 (69.8%) cases. The mean time from onset to successful reperfusion or procedure termination (time to reperfusion) was 394min (median 375min). Good outcome was observed in 17 (39.5%) patients and mortality was 27.9% (n=12). We found 2 (4,7%) sICHs, one (2,3%) thromboembolic event in different vascular territory and one (2,3%) groin hematoma. CONCLUSION Stent retriever thrombectomy for the treatment of ischemic stroke is safe, provides high rate of recanalization and good clinical outcomes in the setting of large vessel occlusion.","Wiącek, Marcin; Kaczorowski, Rafał; Homa, Jarosław; Filip, Edward; Darocha, Janusz; Dudek, Daniel; Guz, Wiesław; Bartosik-Psujek, Halina",Neurologia i neurochirurgia polska,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pjnns.2016.09.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27717502/,319
137705,Vision-Based Surgical Field Defogging.,2017,"BACKGROUND Outpatient cancer chemotherapy may lead to improved quality of life (QOL) by allowing treatment to continue without impairing the social lives of patients compared with hospitalization. However, the occurrence of serious adverse events may cause a decline in QOL. We investigated the relationship between outpatient chemotherapy-induced adverse events and QOL. METHODS A single-center retrospective descriptive study was conducted in patients who received outpatient chemotherapy at Gifu University Hospital (Gifu, Japan) between September 2017 and December 2018. The utility values of QOL, type and severity of adverse events, type of cancer, chemotherapy regimen, and other patient demographics were analyzed. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. QOL was evaluated using the Japanese version of the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L). Associations between the EQ-5D-5L utility value and serious adverse events were assessed using adjusted (age and sex) odds ratios obtained with a proportional odds logistic regression model. RESULTS Data from 1008 patients who received 4695 chemotherapy cycles were analyzed. According to proportional odds logistic regression, the adverse events that significantly correlated with a decreased EQ-5D-5L utility value were malaise, edema of the limbs, peripheral neuropathy, pruritus, and dry skin. Based on the proportional odds logistic analysis, neither cancer type nor anticancer drugs were significantly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L utility value in patients who received chemotherapy. Pharmaceutical care for peripheral neuropathy significantly improved patients' EQ-5D-5L utility value from 0.747 to 0.776 (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Adverse events (i.e., peripheral neuropathy, malaise, and edema of the limbs) are significantly correlated with a decrease in QOL, regardless of the type of cancer or anticancer drugs used. Pharmaceutical care provided by pharmacists in collaboration with physicians may improve QOL.","Hirose, Chiemi; Fujii, Hironori; Iihara, Hirotoshi; Ishihara, Masashi; Nawa-Nishigaki, Minako; Kato-Hayashi, Hiroko; Ohata, Koichi; Sekiya, Kumiko; Kitahora, Mika; Matsuhashi, Nobuhisa; Takahashi, Takao; Okuda, Kumiko; Naruse, Masayo; Ishihara, Takuma; Sugiyama, Tadashi; Yoshida, Kazuhiro; Suzuki, Akio",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-020-05443-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32281034/,319

DESIGN This study was a retrospective chart review of 16 patients with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 under 3 yrs of age consecutively referred for respiratory decompensations resulting in continuous NIV dependence and oxyhemoglobin desaturation. An avoided hospitalization was defined by the need for continuous NIV using high span bilevel positive airway pressure and reversal of desaturations by MAC in the home setting. The protocol included training and equipping parents to use NIV, MAC, and basic life support. RESULTS There were 49 acute episodes (1.20/patient per year), of which 43 met the criteria for an avoided hospitalization. Therefore, only six episodes (0.15/patient per year) required hospitalization, and four required endotracheal intubation (0.1/patient per year). Three of the four were extubated after 4, 9, and 15 days, respectively, to full NIV support and aggressive MAC. The fourth patient, for whom NIV could not be provided, underwent an emergency intubation at home and died at the age of 40 mos. CONCLUSIONS A protocol including high span bilevel positive airway pressure along with MAC to expel airway secretions and normalize oxyhemoglobin saturation can be used by trained caregivers to avoid episodes of acute respiratory failure and hospitalization for children with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 under 3 yrs of age.","Ottonello, Giancarlo; Mastella, Chiara; Franceschi, Alessia; Bosticco, Daniela; Wolfler, Andrea; Pedemonte, Marina; Esposito, Irene; Gregoretti, Cesare",American journal of physical medicine & rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1097/phm.0b013e318232883a; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21955953/,319

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than ELISA (98% vs 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July-August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R=0.83, p<0.0001 and R=0.87, p<0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R=0.76, p=0.037). On repeat antibody testing three months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in gMFI of 62% vs 79% (p<0.01), for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG respectively. This novel MMIA using DBS could be scalable for rapid and affordable SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance in the U.S. and globally.","Schultz, Jonathan S; McCarthy, Mary K; Rester, Cody; Sabourin, Katherine R; Annen, Kyle; DomBourian, Melkon; Eisenmesser, Elan; Frazer-Abel, Ashely; Knight, Vijaya; Jaenisch, Thomas; Morrison, Thomas E; Rochford, Rosemary; Kedl, Ross M",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jcm.00290-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795412/,319

BACKGROUND The long-term effect of coil embolization therapy in HOCM patients is not well defined. METHODS We evaluated 24 symptomatic HOCM patients in a single center who underwent coil embolization of the septal perforator artery(ies). RESULTS Twenty-four patients on optimal medical therapy presented with NYHA functional class III (75%) or IV (25%) underwent the procedure. The procedure was successful in 22 patients, with significant reduction in left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradient. The functional class significantly improved to class I (54.2%) or II (41.7%) (P < = 0.01). The LVOT gradient was significantly lower during follow up echocardiography (21.3 ± 19 vs. 81.3 ± 41 mm Hg; P < = 0.01). Interventricular septal thickness decreased over time (16.3 ± 3 vs. 18.5 ± 2 mm, P< = 0.01). The procedure was aborted in one of the patients after the third coil prolapsed from the septal perforator in to the left anterior descending artery. The coil was effectively snared out. Three patients required additional coil placement in the second major septal perforator. New permanent pacemaker placement was required in one patient. However, three patients underwent ICD implantation at follow up due to ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that the use of coil embolization for septal ablation is safe, effective, and durable in patients with symptomatic HOCM. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Guerrero, Israel; Dhoble, Abhijeet; Fasulo, Mark; Denktas, Ali E; Sami, Shehzad; Choi, Sangbum; Balan, Prakash; Arain, Salman A; Smalling, Richard W",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.26668; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27511120/,319

AIM Published literature was reviewed on the adverse psychological health outcomes in medical responders to various disasters and mass casualties in order to: (1) assess the psychological impact of disasters on medical responders; and (2) identify the possible risk factors associated with psychological impacts on medical responders. METHODS A literature search of PubMed, Discovery Service, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases for studies on the prevalence/risk factors of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other mental disorders in medical responders of disasters and mass casualties was carried out using pre-determined keywords. Two reviewers screened the 3,545 abstracts and 28 full-length articles which were included for final review. RESULTS Depression and PTSD were the most studied outcomes in medical responders. Nurses reported higher levels of adverse outcomes than physicians. Lack of social support and communication, maladaptive coping, and lack of training were important risk factors for developing negative psychological outcomes across all types of disasters. CONCLUSIONS Disasters have significant adverse effects on the mental well-being of medical responders. The prevalence rates and presumptive risk factors varied among three different types of disasters. There are certain high-risk, vulnerable groups among medical responders, as well as certain risk factors for adverse psychological outcomes. Adapting preventive measures and mitigation strategies aimed at high-risk groups would be beneficial in decreasing negative outcomes.","Naushad, Vamanjore Aboobaker; Bierens, Joost Jlm; Nishan, Kunnummel Purayil; Firjeeth, Chirakkal Paramba; Mohammad, Osama Hashim; Maliyakkal, Abdul Majeed; ChaliHadan, Sajid; Schreiber, Merritt D",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x19004874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625487/,319

The technique facilitates oropharyngeal resection akin to transoral robotic surgery (TORS) without the need for a robot. A dual surgeon approach, analogous to that of endoscopic skull base surgery is used. Each surgeon can actively participate in the resection with several key advantages over current techniques. The technique is applicable to departments internationally especially where the use of a robot is prohibited by cost or availability. This is especially important given the resection of oropharyngeal tumours offers the opportunity of single modality treatment or reduced intensity adjuvant treatment compared to traditional non-surgical therapy.","Zoysa, Nilantha De; Sethi, Neeraj; Jose, Jemy",Head & neck,https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.24799; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28556486/,319
138985,Evolution of approaches to viral safety issues for biological products.,2011,"INTRODUCTION In FRESCO (Fruquintinib Efficacy and Safety in 3+ Line Colorectal Cancer Patients) trial, fruquintinib demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful overall survival benefit in Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, its safety profile, including adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) by age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), is not well known. The present analysis evaluated the safety profile and AESIs for fruquintinib in the FRESCO trial. METHODS In FRESCO, eligible Chinese patients were randomized (2:1) to receive fruquintinib (5 mg once daily for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week off in 28-day cycles) or placebo plus best supportive care. Treatment-related AESIs and time to first occurrence of AESIs were summarized. Treatment-related TEAEs by age, sex, and BMI were also summarized. RESULTS A total of 266 patients (95.7%) in the fruquintinib group and 97 (70.8%) in the placebo group had at least one treatment-related TEAE; the mean relative dose intensity was 92% and 98%, respectively. In the fruquintinib group, the most common (in > 40% of patients) treatment-related AESIs were hypertension (55.4%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome [known as hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR)] (49.3%), and proteinuria (42.1%). The most common treatment-related grade ≥ 3 AESIs (≥ 3% of patients) were hypertension (21.2%), HFSR (10.8%), and proteinuria (3.2%); the median time to onset of these events was 10, 21, and 20 days, respectively. Subgroup analysis by age, sex, and BMI revealed that the frequencies of treatment-related TEAEs were similar across all subgroups, and were consistent with the overall safety profile of fruquintinib. CONCLUSIONS The most common treatment-related grade ≥ 3 AEs were hypertension, HFSR, and proteinuria. The treatment-related TEAE profile of fruquintinib in Chinese patents with mCRC was comparable among different subgroups and consistent with that reported in the overall population.

139376,Quantifying Anatomic Deformations During Laryngoscopy.,2018,"BACKGROUND Chronic pain after inguinal hernioplasty is the foremost side-effect up to 10-30% of patients. Mesh fixation may influence on the incidence of chronic pain after open anterior mesh repairs. METHODS Some 625 patients who underwent open anterior mesh repairs were randomized to receive one of the three meshes and fixations: cyanoacrylate glue with low-weight polypropylene mesh (n = 216), non-absorbable sutures with partially absorbable mesh (n = 207) or self-gripping polyesther mesh (n = 202). Factors related to chronic pain (visual analogue scores; VAS ≥ 30, range 0-100) at 1 year postoperatively were analyzed using logistic regression method. A second analysis using telephone interview and patient records was performed 2 years after the index surgery. RESULTS At index operation, all patient characteristics were similar in the three study groups. After 1 year, chronic inguinal pain was found in 52 patients and after 2 years in only 16 patients with no difference between the study groups. During 2 years' follow-up, three (0.48%) patients with recurrences and five (0.8%) patients with chronic pain were re-operated. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that only new recurrent hernias and high pain scores at day 7 were predictive factors for longstanding groin pain (p = 0.001). Type of mesh or fixation, gender, pre-operative VAS, age, body mass index or duration of operation did not predict chronic pain. CONCLUSION Only the presence of recurrent hernia and early severe pain after index operation seemed to predict longstanding inguinal pain.","Matikainen, M; Aro, E; Vironen, J; Kössi, J; Hulmi, T; Silvasti, S; Ilves, I; Hertsi, M; Mustonen, K; Paajanen, H",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10029-018-1772-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29728882/,319

METHODS To examine presentation and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with ESKD on dialysis, we retrospectively collected clinical data on 59 patients on dialysis who were hospitalized with COVID-19. We used Wilcoxon rank sum and Fischer exact tests to compare patients who died versus those still living. RESULTS Two of the study's 59 patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 57 were on hemodialysis. Median age was 63 years, with high prevalence of hypertension (98%) and diabetes (69%). Patients who died were significantly older than those still living (median age, 75 versus 62 years) and had a higher median Charlson comorbidity index (8 versus 7). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (49%) and cough (39%); initial radiographs most commonly showed multifocal or bilateral opacities (59%). By end of follow-up, 18 patients (31%) died a median 6 days after hospitalization, including 75% of patients who required mechanical ventilation. Eleven of those who died had advanced directives against intubation. The remaining 41 patients (69%) were discharged home a median 8 days after admission. The median initial white blood cell count was significantly higher in patients who died compared with those still living (7.5 versus 5.7×103/μl), as was C-reactive protein (163 versus 80 mg/L).

AREAS COVERED To highlight the need for prophylactic strategies particularly for HCWs, we identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in healthcare settings and the incidence of infections in HCWs by a search on MEDLINE and MEDxRIV (for SARS-Cov-2). To identify prophylactic strategies against, we conducted a search on MEDLINE and clinicaltrials.gov about studies involving SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. EXPERT OPINION HCWs accounts for a great part of SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 infections, they may also contribute to the spread of the disease, particularly in healthcare settings and contribute to nosocomial outbreaks. Some preventive strategies were evaluated in previous emerging coronaviruses epidemics, particularly in MERS-CoV. For COVID-19 prevention, different chemoprophylaxis with drug repositioning and new agents are under evaluation, and different vaccine candidates entered clinical development, with clinical trials.

140824,Bioactivity and potential health benefits of licorice.,2014,"The use of juvenile conventional pigs as a preclinical animal model to perform pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety studies for the paediatric population is increasing. Repetitive oral administration of drugs to juvenile pigs is however challenging. A representative method which can be used from birth till adulthood is necessary. The current study presents the placement and use of a gastrostomy button in pigs with a weight ranging from 2.4 to 161 kg. The surgical placement was performed via a laparotomic procedure on, each time, 12 pigs (six male, six female) of 1 week, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 6-7 months old. For every age category, eight pigs were part of a PK study with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and four pigs served as a control group. No severe complications were observed during surgery. The button remained functional for 10 days in 40 out of 48 pigs. No significant differences in body temperature or white blood cell count were observed during the trial. Three control pigs showed signs of inflammation indicating a NSAID might be warranted. Autopsy revealed minimal signs of major inflammation in the abdominal cavity or the stomach. A limited number of pigs showed mucosal inflammation, ulcers or abscesses in the stomach or around the fistula. These results indicate that the laparotomic placement of a gastrostomy button might be considered safe and easy in growing pigs to perform repetitive oral dosing preclinical studies. However, the method is not advised in pigs weighing more than 100 kg.","Millecam, Joske; van Bergen, Thomas; Devreese, Mathias; Schauvliege, Stijn; Martens, Ann; Chiers, Koen; Croubels, Siska; Antonissen, Gunther",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677219857106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31242071/,319

The purpose of this article is to provide a contemporary review of the nutritional aspects of care for patients with head and neck cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS A literature search was performed in Medline, Cochrane, and other available databases from 1990 through 2012 for the clinical effectiveness of nutritional support, treatment modalities, and methods of delivery in relation to patients with head and neck malignancies. Human studies published in English and having nutritional status and head and neck cancer as a predictor variable were included. Randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, prospective clinical studies, and systemic reviews were selected based on their relevance to the abovementioned subtitles. The resultant articles were analyzed and summarized into the definition, impact, assessment, treatment, and modes of administration of nutrition on the outcome of patients with head and neck cancer. RESULTS Articles were reviewed that focused on the etiology and assessment of malnutrition and current nutritional treatments for cancer-induced anorexia and cachexia. Two hundred forty-eight articles were found: 2 clinical trials, 10 meta-analyses, 210 review studies, and 26 systematic reviews. Because of the lack of prospective data, a summative review of the conclusions of the studies is presented. CONCLUSION Nutritional interventions should be initiated before cancer treatment begins and these interventions need to be ongoing after completion of treatment to ensure optimal outcomes for patients. A nutritional assessment must be part of all comprehensive treatment plans for patients with head and neck cancer. Alternative medical interventions, such as immune-enhancing nutrients or anticytokine pharmaceutical agents, also may be effective as adjuvant therapies, but more research is needed to quantify their clinical effect.","Alshadwi, Ahmad; Nadershah, Mohammed; Carlson, Eric R; Young, Lorrie S; Burke, Peter A; Daley, Brian J",Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joms.2013.04.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23845698/,319
141955,Green investments need global standards and independent scientific review.,2020-08-01,"Introduction There is a significant disparity in outcomes for neonates with gastroschisis in high-income countries (HICs) compared with low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Many LMICs report mortality rates between 75% and 100% compared with <4% in HICs. Aim To undertake a systematic review identifying postnatal interventions associated with improved outcomes for gastroschisis in LMICs. Methods and analysis Three search strings will be combined: (1) neonates; (2) gastroschisis and other gastrointestinal congenital anomalies requiring similar surgical care; (3) LMICs. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Thesis Global, and the Cochrane Library. Grey literature will be identified through Open-Grey, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry and ISRCTN registry (Springer Nature). Additional studies will be sought from reference lists of included studies. Study screening, selection, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality will be undertaken by two reviewers independently and team consensus sought on discrepancies. The primary outcome of interest is mortality. Secondary outcomes include complications, requirement for ventilation, parenteral nutrition duration and length of hospital stay. Tertiary outcomes include service delivery and implementation outcomes. The methodology of the studies will be appraised. Descriptive statistics and outcomes will be summarised and discussed. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required since no new data are being collected. Dissemination will be via open access publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and distribution among global health, global surgery and children's surgical collaborations and international conferences. Conclusion This study will systematically review literature focused on postnatal interventions to improve outcomes from gastroschisis in LMICs. Findings can be used to help inform quality improvement projects in low-resource settings for patients with gastroschisis. In the first instance, results will be used to inform a Wellcome Trust-funded multicentre clinical interventional study aimed at improving outcomes for gastroschisis across sub-Saharan Africa.

Clinical, analytical, and radiological findings have been reported. Detailed different evolution of patients of the same local outbreak has been scarcely reported. We report 6 selected cases of such an evolution. CLINICAL CASES The clinical, radiological, analytical evolution of 6patients is reported. Patients were selected as it were epidemiological close contacts, and showed particular different clinical evolution. RESULTS The clinical course at the start of infection (first week) was similar among patients. In relationship with clinical evolution, middle to severe course were related with inflammation markers levels evolution (D-dimer, IL-6, ferritin, lymphocytes count, etc.). Specially lung alterations were observed, but neurological/neuropsychiatric findings are still common. In evolution, 2patients showed middle symptoms, but the 2most severely affected died. CONCLUSIONS It remains to be elucidated the different evolutive pathways and outcomes of COVD-19. In our 6patients of the same local outbreak, clinical, laboratory and radiological features were different.

There were significant increases in the number of clavicle fractures seen annually, of midshaft clavicle fractures, and of midshaft clavicle fractures treated operatively. The percentage of midshaft clavicle fractures treated with fixation also increased significantly. The volumes of clavicle fractures and midshaft clavicle fractures treated operatively appear to be increasing.

142784,Effect of Graphene Oxide and Silver Nanoparticles Hybrid Composite on P. aeruginosa Strains with Acquired Resistance Genes.,2020,"In mammals, temperature-sensitive TRP channels make membrane conductance of cells extremely temperature dependent, allowing the detection of temperature ranging from noxious cold to noxious heat. We progressively deleted the distal carboxyl terminus domain (CTD) of the cold-activated melastatin receptor channel, TRPM8. We found that the enthalpy change associated with channel gating is proportional to the length of the CTD. Deletion of the last 36 amino acids of the CTD transforms TRPM8 into a reduced temperature-sensitivity channel (Q10 ∼4). Exposing the intracellular domain to a denaturing agent increases the energy required to open the channel indicating that cold drives channel gating by stabilizing the folded state of the CTD. Experiments in the presence of an osmoticant agent suggest that channel gating involves a change in solute-inaccessible volume in the CTD of ∼1,900 Å3 This volume matches the void space inside the coiled coil according to the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of TRPM8. The results indicate that a folding-unfolding reaction of a specialized temperature-sensitive structure is coupled to TRPM8 gating.","Díaz-Franulic, Ignacio; Raddatz, Natalia; Castillo, Karen; González-Nilo, Fernando D; Latorre, Ramon",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004303117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32747539/,319

142886,Multimodal regularised linear models with flux balance analysis for mechanistic integration of omics data.,2021-05-11,"Context The true prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has been difficult to determine due to limited testing, inconsistent symptom severity, and asymptomatic infections. Systematic investigation of the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 has been limited to urban environments and large academic centers. Limited data on the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is available for those who live in a rural community setting, leaving rural practitioners to extrapolate the epidemiology of COVID-19 to a nonhomogeneous population. Objective To determine the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in a community setting. The secondary objective of this study was to describe the difference in infection rate and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in the same rural community. Methods A prospective convenience sample of community members and healthcare workers from the Kingman, Arizona area were tested for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies using a lateral flow immunoassay with the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG test (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) from September 28, 2020 to October 09, 2020. Upon recruitment, participants were asked to complete a demographic survey assessing socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and COVID-19 symptoms in the preceding two months. Following enrollment, a retrospective chart review was completed to determine the percentage of patients who had undergone previous SARS-CoV-RT-PCR testing. Results A total of 566 participants were included in the final analysis: 380 (67.1%) were women, 186 (32.9%) were men, a majority (458; 80.9%) self-identified as White, and 303 (53.5%) were employed as healthcare professionals. Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 8.0% (45 of 566) across the sample and 9.9% (30 of 303) in healthcare workers. No statistical difference in seroprevalence was found between men and women, healthcare workers and other participants, amongst racial groups, by socioeconomic status, by comorbid conditions, or by education level. Among the participants, 108 (19.1%) underwent previous RT-PCR testing. Of the 45 patients who were antibody positive, 27 (60%) had received a previous RT-PCR test, with 20 (44.4%) testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. Participants with symptoms of anosmia/ageusia (p<0.001), chest congestion (p=0.047), fever (p=0.007), and shortness of breath (p=0.002) within the past two months were more likely to have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion Only 8% of 566 participants in this rural community setting were found to have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. A large minority (18; 40%) of patients testing seropositive for SARs-CoV-2 had never received a prior test, suggesting that the actual rates of infection are higher than publicly available data suggest. Further large-scale antibody testing is needed to determine the true prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the rural setting.","Santarelli, Anthony; Lalitsasivimol, Diana; Bartholomew, Nate; Reid, Sasha; Reid, Joseph; Lyon, Chris; Wells, James; Ashurst, John",The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association,https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2020-0287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33567087/,319
144439,"'Covid-19 will accelerate consolidation of vet practices', says VetPartners CEO.",2020-07-01,"From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross-infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human-machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high-sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water-absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.","Lu, Lijun; Jiang, Chunpeng; Hu, Guosheng; Liu, Jingquan; Yang, Bin",Advanced materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202100218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33683745/,319

During 2014-18 mean annual per capita expenditures were $1,463 (35 percent) lower for Hispanic adults with limited English proficiency than for Hispanic adults who were English proficient, after adjustment for respondents' characteristics. Hispanic adults with limited English proficiency also made fewer outpatient and emergency department visits, had fewer inpatient days, and received fewer prescription medications than Hispanic adults who were English proficient. Health care spending gaps between Hispanic adults with limited English proficiency and non-Hispanic adults with English proficiency widened between 1999 and 2018. These language-based gaps in spending and use raise concern that language barriers may be obstructing access to care, resulting in underuse of medical services by adults with limited English proficiency.","Himmelstein, Jessica; Himmelstein, David U; Woolhandler, Steffie; Bor, David H; Gaffney, Adam; Zallman, Leah; Dickman, Samuel; McCormick, Danny",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.02510; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228521/,319

The aim is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this device in treating direct carotid-cavernous fistula. METHODS Ten consecutive patients with direct carotid-cavernous fistula were treated in our institution with Willis covered stents from September 2013 to December 2015. The characteristics of these patients and the immediate and follow-up results were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS Of the 10 patients, 8 were treated for the first time, and 2 had been treated elsewhere. Willis covered stents were successfully released in 9 patients. Abnormal arteriovenous shunt disappeared in 6 cases immediately after stent deployment and endoleak occurred in 3 cases. Endoleak disappeared at 6-month angiography follow-up in one case and was sealed with coils through a pre-set microcatheter in another case. Parent artery was sacrificed as endoleak remained despite repeated balloon dilation and a second stent deployment in the third case. All patients got clinical follow-ups for at least 24 months and 7 patients received angiographic follow-up. Symptoms were relieved gradually in all cases except for slight oculomotor paralysis and visual acuity in one case, respectively.

Although advancements in biotechnology have made vaccines more effective and safer, none are completely free from adverse effects. Many vaccines have been implicated in causing ocular adverse events based on the temporal association of exposure and putative complication. Determination of causality is difficult. We provide an overview of vaccine side effects and also examines the English literature and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) from 2010 through 2020 for vaccine-implicated ocular adverse events. While reactions of eyelids and conjunctiva are commonly reported, the most frequently implicated serious adverse events are optic neuritis and various patterns of intraocular inflammation. Live attenuated vaccines have the potential to cause ocular infection from vaccine-strain organisms, particularly in those immunosuppressed. While postmarketing registries for suspect vaccination adverse events, such as VAERS, are unable to determine causal associations, they are a mainstay in signaling suspected trends that require investigation. The majority of probable and possible serious ocular adverse effects are distinctly uncommon.","Cheng, John Yu; Margo, Curtis E",Survey of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.survophthal.2021.04.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33865883/,319

There is increasing concern for azole resistance all over the world mainly from agricultural fungicide use. Choosing safe and effective antifungal regimens has become a challenge. AREAS COVERED Here, the authors review the epidemiology, mechanisms, and detection of azole resistance along with management options for azole-resistant Aspergillus infection including new antifungal agents under development. EXPERT OPINION Routine global epidemiological surveillance is required to understand azole resistance prevalence. Azole resistant Aspergillus infections are associated with high mortality. No good therapeutic options are currently available. High index of suspicion of resistance is required if a patient is not responding to 4-7 days of azole therapy, particularly in areas of resistance. Susceptibility testing for Aspergillus is not routinely available in many parts of the world, which makes it difficult to diagnose azole resistance in Aspergillus infection.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the relative contribution of these factors to better understand the true effect of exercise training for reducing pain in chronic primary musculoskeletal pain conditions. DESIGN Systematic review with meta-analysis DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE and CENTRAL from inception to February 2021. Reference lists of prior systematic reviews. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials of interventions that used exercise training compared to placebo, true control or usual care in adults with chronic primary musculoskeletal pain. The review was registered prospectively with PROSPERO (CRD42019141096). RESULTS We identified 79 eligible trials for quantitative analysis. Pairwise meta-analysis showed very low-quality evidence (GRADE criteria) that exercise training was not more effective than placebo (g [95% CI]: 0.94 [- 0.17, 2.06], P = 0.098, I2 = 92.4%, studies: n = 4). Exercise training was more effective than true, no intervention controls (g [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.67, 1.36], P < 0.001, I2 = 92.99%, studies: n = 42), usual-care controls (g [95% CI]: 0.65 [0.41, 0.89], P < 0.001, I2 = 84.82%, studies: n = 33), and when all controls combined (g [95% CI]: 0.86 [0.64, 1.07], P < 0.001, I2 = 91.37%, studies: n = 79). CONCLUSIONS There is very low-quality evidence that exercise training is not more effective than non-exercise placebo treatments in chronic pain. Exercise training and the associated clinical encounter are more effective than true control or standard medical care for reductions in pain for adults with chronic musculoskeletal pain, with very low quality of evidence based on GRADE criteria.","Miller, Clint T; Owen, Patrick J; Than, Christian A; Ball, Jake; Sadler, Kate; Piedimonte, Alessandro; Benedetti, Fabrizio; Belavy, Daniel L",Sports medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-021-01526-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34453277/,319

Thus, DCs are productively infected only at very low levels with HIV-1, and this non-permissiveness of DCs is suggested to go along with viral evasion. We now illustrate that complement-opsonized HIV-1 (HIV-C) efficiently bypasses SAMHD1 restriction and productively infects DCs including BDCA-1 DCs. Efficient DC infection by HIV-C was also observed using single-cycle HIV-C, and correlated with a remarkable elevated SAMHD1 T592 phosphorylation but not SAMHD1 degradation. If SAMHD1 phosphorylation was blocked using a CDK2-inhibitor HIV-C-induced DC infection was also significantly abrogated. Additionally, we found a higher maturation and co-stimulatory potential, aberrant type I interferon expression and signaling as well as a stronger induction of cellular immune responses in HIV-C-treated DCs. Collectively, our data highlight a novel protective mechanism mediated by complement opsonization of HIV to effectively promote DC immune functions, which might be in the future exploited to tackle HIV infection.","Posch, Wilfried; Steger, Marion; Knackmuss, Ulla; Blatzer, Michael; Baldauf, Hanna-Mari; Doppler, Wolfgang; White, Tommy E; Hörtnagl, Paul; Diaz-Griffero, Felipe; Lass-Flörl, Cornelia; Hackl, Hubert; Moris, Arnaud; Keppler, Oliver T; Wilflingseder, Doris",PLoS pathogens,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26121641/,319

149445,A Novel Device Decoupling Tactile Slip and Hand Motion in Reaching Tasks: The HaptiTrack Device.,2021-04-22,"Screening of chemical libraries with 2,000 synthetic compounds identified salinomycin as a hit against influenza A and B viruses, with 50% effective concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 4.3 μM in cells. This compound is a carboxylic polyether ionophore that exchanges monovalent ions for protons across lipid bilayer membranes. Monitoring the time course of viral infection showed that salinomycin blocked nuclear migration of viral nuclear protein (NP), the most abundant component of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complex. It caused cytoplasmic accumulation of NP, particularly within perinuclear endosomes, during virus entry. This was primarily associated with failure to acidify the endosomal-lysosomal compartments. Similar to the case with amantadine (AMT), proton channel activity of viral matrix protein 2 (M2) was blocked by salinomycin. Using purified retroviral Gag-based virus-like particles (VLPs) with M2, it was proved that salinomycin directly affects the kinetics of a proton influx into the particles but in a manner different from that of AMT. Notably, oral administration of salinomycin together with the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) led to enhanced antiviral effect over that with either compound used alone in influenza A virus-infected mouse models. These results provide a new paradigm for developing antivirals and their combination therapy that control both host and viral factors.IMPORTANCE Influenza virus is a main cause of viral respiratory infection in humans as well as animals, occasionally with high mortality. Circulation of influenza viruses resistant to the matrix protein 2 (M2) inhibitor, amantadine, is highly prevalent. Moreover, the frequency of detection of viruses resistant to the neuraminidase inhibitors, including oseltamivir phosphate (OSV-P) or zanamivir, is also increasing. These issues highlight the need for discovery of new antiviral agents with different mechanisms. Salinomycin as the monovalent cation-proton antiporter exhibited consistent inhibitory effects against influenza A and B viruses. It plays multifunctional roles by blocking endosomal acidification and by inactivating the proton transport function of M2, the key steps for influenza virus uncoating. Notably, salinomycin resulted in marked therapeutic effects in influenza virus-infected mice when combined with OSV-P, suggesting that its chemical derivatives could be developed as an adjuvant antiviral therapy to treat influenza infections resistant or less sensitive to existing drugs.","Jang, Yejin; Shin, Jin Soo; Yoon, Yi-Seul; Go, Yun Young; Lee, Hye Won; Kwon, Oh Seung; Park, Sehee; Park, Man-Seong; Kim, Meehyein",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01441-18; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30282713/,319

149890,"Artificial Intelligence in Anesthesiology: Current Techniques, Clinical Applications, and Limitations.",2020-02-01,"BACKGROUND Hypotension is common in anaesthetised children, and its impact on cerebral oxygenation is unknown. The goal of the present study was to investigate the effects of moderate systemic arterial hypotension (mHT) and severe hypotension (sHT) on cerebral perfusion and brain tissue oxygenation in piglets. METHODS Twenty-seven anaesthetised piglets were randomly allocated to a control group, mHT group, or sHT group. Cerebral monitoring comprised a tissue oxygen partial pressure ( [Formula: see text] ) and laser Doppler (LD) perfusion probe advanced into the brain tissue, and a near-infrared spectroscopy sensor placed over the skin measuring regional oxygen saturation (rSO2). Arterial hypotension was induced by blood withdrawal and i.v. nitroprusside infusion [target MAP: 35-38 (mHT) and 27-30 (sHT) mm Hg]. Data were analysed at baseline, and every 20 min during and after treatment. RESULTS Compared with control, [Formula: see text] decreased equally with mHT and sHT [mean (SD) after 60 min: control: 17.1 (6.4); mHT: 6.4 (3.6); sHT: 7.2 (4.3) mm Hg]. No differences between groups were detected for rSO2 and LD during treatment. However, in the sHT group, rSO2 increased after restoring normotension [from 49.3 (9.5) to 58.9 (8.9)% Post60]. sHT was associated with an increase in blood lactate [from 1.5 (0.4) to 2.4 (0.9) mmol L-1], and a decrease in bicarbonate [28 (2.4) to 25.8 (2.6) mmol L-1] and base excess [4.7 (1.9) to 2.0 (2.7) mmol L-1] between baseline and 60 min after the start of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS Induction of mHT and sHT by hypovolaemia and nitroprusside infusion caused alterations in brain tissue oxygenation in a piglet model, but without detectable changes in brain tissue perfusion and regional oxygen saturation.","Ringer, S K; Clausen, N G; Spielmann, N; Ohlerth, S; Schwarz, A; Weiss, M",British journal of anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2018.07.041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30442258/,319

Centers performing cryobiopsy differ significantly in procedure technique; an optimal technique minimizing complications but still capable of diagnosing a wide range of DPLDs has not been established. We evaluated our practice of flexible bronchoscopic cryobiopsy in a primarily outpatient setting for patients who required a tissue diagnosis for DPLD of uncertain etiology. METHODS Consecutive patients with indeterminate DPLD who underwent bronchoscopic cryobiopsy at a large academic medical center from January 2012 to August 2015 were retrospectively analyzed. Rates of confident histopathologic diagnosis, confident multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis, management change, and complications were determined. RESULTS One hundred four cases were identified. Confident histopathologic diagnoses were established in 44% (46/104) and confident multidisciplinary consensus diagnoses in 68% (71/104). Usual interstitial pneumonia (19/104) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (22/104) were the most common histopathologic and consensus diagnoses, respectively. Five subjects proceeded to SLB after cryobiopsy which was diagnostic in 3. Results of cryobiopsies changed management in 70% (73/104). Complications occurred in 8 cases with no death. CONCLUSIONS Cryobiopsy during outpatient flexible bronchoscopy facilitated confident multidisciplinary consensus diagnosis of DPLD in more than two thirds of cases, and appears sufficient to establish the histopathologic diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia, with a complication rate that compares favorably to that reported for SLB.","Lentz, Robert J; Taylor, Trevor M; Kropski, Jonathan A; Sandler, Kim L; Johnson, Joyce E; Blackwell, Timothy S; Maldonado, Fabien; Rickman, Otis B",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1097/lbr.0000000000000401; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28796717/,319
150392,History of science. Public Science 2.0--back to the future.,2013,"OBJECTIVES To investigate effects of ablation margins on local tumour progression-free survival (LTPFS) according to RAS status in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CLM). METHODS This two-institution retrospective study from 2005-2016 included 136 patients (91 male, median age 60 years) with 218 ablated CLM. LTPFS was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and evaluated with the log-rank test. Uni/multivariate analyses were performed using Cox-regression models. RESULTS Three-year LTPFS rates for CLM with minimal ablation margin ≤10 mm were significantly worse than those with >10 mm in both mutant-RAS (29% vs. 48%, p=0.038) and wild-type RAS (70% vs. 94%, p=0.039) subgroups. Three-year LTPFS rates of mutant-RAS were significantly worse than wild-type RAS in both CLM subgroups with minimal ablation margin ≤10 mm (29% vs. 70%, p<0.001) and >10 mm (48% vs. 94%, p=0.006). Predictors of worse LTPFS were ablation margins ≤10 mm (HR: 2.17, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, p=0.007), CLM size ≥2 cm (1.80, 1.1-2.8, p=0.017) and mutant-RAS (2.85, 1.7-4.6, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Minimal ablation margin and RAS status interact as independent predictors of LTPFS following CLM ablation. While minimal ablation margins >10 mm should be always the procedural goal, this becomes especially critical for mutant-RAS CLM. KEY POINTS • RAS and ablation margins are predictors of local tumour progression-free survival. • Ablation margin >10 mm, always desirable, is crucial for mutant RAS metastases. • Interventional radiologists should be aware of RAS status to optimize LTPFS.","Calandri, Marco; Yamashita, Suguru; Gazzera, Carlo; Fonio, Paolo; Veltri, Andrea; Bustreo, Sara; Sheth, Rahul A; Yevich, Steven M; Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas; Odisio, Bruno C",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-017-5273-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29417253/,319

IRE offers a targeted nephron-sparing approach for treating kidney tumors, but the relevant organ-specific electrical properties and cellular susceptibility to IRE electric pulses remain to be characterized. Here, a pulse protocol of 100 electric pulses, each 100 μs long, is delivered at 1 pulse/s to canine kidneys at three different voltage-to-distance ratios while measuring intrapulse current, completed 6 h before humane euthanasia. Numerical models were correlated with lesions and electrical measurements to determine electrical conductivity behavior and lethal electric field threshold. Three methods for modeling tissue response to the pulses were investigated (static, linear dynamic, and asymmetrical sigmoid dynamic), where the asymmetrical sigmoid dynamic conductivity function most accurately and precisely matched lesion dimensions, with a lethal electric field threshold of 575 ± 67 V/cm for the protocols used. The linear dynamic model also attains accurate predictions with a simpler function. These findings can aid renal IRE treatment planning under varying electrode geometries and pulse strengths. Histology showed a wholly necrotic core lesion at the highest electric fields, surrounded by a transitional perimeter of differential tissue viability dependent on renal structure.","Neal, Robert E; Garcia, Paulo A; Kavnoudias, Helen; Rosenfeldt, Franklin; Mclean, Catriona A; Earl, Victoria; Bergman, Joanne; Davalos, Rafael V; Thomson, Kenneth R",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,https://doi.org/10.1109/tbme.2014.2360374; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25265626/,319

We sought to investigate whether this experience has altered our knowledge and our current and future practice on the management of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and community-acquired pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS A changing epidemiology was demonstrated, with obesity and pregnancy beyond established risk groups for influenza A, other clinical syndromes beyond primary viral pneumonia, possible coinfections by other viral beyond bacterial pathogens and a disappointing performance of all available severity assessment tools. On the treatment topic, accumulating evidence suggesting worse outcomes argues against the use of corticosteroids, but some noninvasive ventilating modalities require further assessment. SUMMARY The recent influenza A(H1N1)2009 pandemic has highlighted our weaknesses relating to the diagnosis and assessment of severity of SARI, compromising early treatment and ultimate outcomes; further research based on this experience will help to improve prognosis and boost our future preparedness. An important message is the necessity of international collaboration for the rapid dissemination of locally acquired knowledge.","Poulakou, Garyphallia; Pérez, Marcos; Rello, Jordi",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0b013e32835605f2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820154/,319

154125,Virtual flow-diverter treatment planning: The effect of device placement on bifurcation aneurysm haemodynamics.,2017,"Purpose No current guidelines or recommendations exist informing the selection of restriction pressure during blood flow restriction exercise (BFRE). Moreover, the effects of specific relative restriction pressures on the acute muscle, metabolic and cardiopulmonary responses to BFRE are unclear. The purpose of this study was to characterize these acute responses at different levels of restriction pressure. Methods Participants (n = 10) completed rhythmic isometric knee extension exercise across five experimental trials in a balanced randomized order. Three were BFRE trials {B-40 [restriction pressure set to 40% LOP (total limb occlusion pressure)]; B-60 (60% LOP); and B-80 (80% LOP)} with a workload equivalent to 20% maximal voluntary force (MVC), one was non-BFRE at 20% MVC (LL) and one was non-BFRE at 80% MVC (HL). Measurements recorded were torque, muscle activity via electromyography (EMG), tissue oxygenation via near infrared spectroscopy, whole body oxygen consumption, blood lactate and heart rate. Results For the LL and B-40 trials, most measures remained constant. However, for the B-60 and B-80 trials, significant fatigue was demonstrated by a reduction in MVC torque across the trial (p < 0.05). Blood lactate increased from baseline in HL, B-60, and B-80 (p < 0.05). Submaximal EMG was greater in B-60 and B-80 than LL, but lower compared with HL (p < 0.05). Tissue oxygenation decreased in HL, B-40, B-60, and B-80 (p < 0.05), which was lower in the B-80 trial compared to all other trials (p < 0.01). Whole body oxygen consumption was not different between the BFRE trials (p > 0.05). Conclusion We demonstrate graded/progressive acute responses with increasing applied pressure during BFRE, from which we speculate that an effective minimum ""threshold"" around 60% LOP may be necessary for BFRE to be effective with training. While these data provide some insight on the possible mechanisms by which BFRE develops skeletal muscle size and strength when undertaken chronically across a training program, the outcomes of chronic training programs using different levels of applied restriction pressures remain to be tested. Overall, the present study recommends 60-80% LOP as a suitable ""minimum"" BFRE pressure.","Ilett, Michael J; Rantalainen, Timo; Keske, Michelle A; May, Anthony K; Warmington, Stuart A",Frontiers in physiology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2019.01018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31456694/,319

METHODS A comparative analysis of the codon usage bias of the 28 herpesviruses was performed by using the CodonW 1.4 program and CUSP (create a codon usage table) program of EMBOSS (The European Molecular Biology Open Software Suite). RESULTS The results showed obvious differences of the synonymous codon usage bias in the 28 herpesviruses indicated by the Codon Adaptation Index, effective number of codons (ENc), and the value of G + C content at the 3rd codon position. The codon usage pattern of the DPV UL35 gene was phylogenetically conserved and similar to that of the UL35-like genes of the avian alpha-herpesvirus, with a strong bias towards the codons with A and T at the 3rd codon position. A cluster analysis of codon usage pattern of the DPV UL35 gene with other reference herpesviruses demonstrated that the codon usage bias of the UL35 genes of the 28 herpesviruses had a very close relation with their gene function. The ENc-plot revealed that the genetic heterogeneity in the DPV UL35 gene and the 27 reference herpesviruses were constrained by G + C content, while gene length exerted relatively weaker influences. In addition, comparisons of the codon preferences in the UL35 gene of DPV with those of Escherichia coli, yeast and humans revealed that there were 33 codons showing distinct usage differences between the DPV and yeast, and 38 between the DPV and humans, but only 31 between the DPV and E. coli. Therefore, the E. coli system may be more suitable for the expression of the DPV UL35 gene. CONCLUSION Together, these results may improve our understanding of the evolution, pathogenesis and functional studies of DPV, as well as contribute significantly to the area of herpesvirus research and possibly studies with other viruses.","Cai, Ming-Sheng; Cheng, An-Chun; Wang, Ming-Shu; Zhao, Li-Chan; Zhu, De-Kang; Luo, Qi-Hui; Liu, Fei; Chen, Xiao-Yue",Intervirology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000231992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19672100/,319
155130,What the data say about asymptomatic COVID infections.,2020-11-18,"The dimension of the parameter space is typically unknown in a variety of models that rely on factorizations. For example, in factor analysis the number of latent factors is not known and has to be inferred from the data. Although classical shrinkage priors are useful in such contexts, increasing shrinkage priors can provide a more effective approach that progressively penalizes expansions with growing complexity. In this article we propose a novel increasing shrinkage prior, called the cumulative shrinkage process, for the parameters that control the dimension in overcomplete formulations. Our construction has broad applicability and is based on an interpretable sequence of spike-and-slab distributions which assign increasing mass to the spike as the model complexity grows. Using factor analysis as an illustrative example, we show that this formulation has theoretical and practical advantages relative to current competitors, including an improved ability to recover the model dimension. An adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed, and the performance gains are outlined in simulations and in an application to personality data.","Legramanti, Sirio; Durante, Daniele; Dunson, David B",Biometrika,https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/asaa008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32831355/,319

We describe the main strategies undertaken and selected facilitators and challenges in order to identify transferable lessons for other countries working to control the spread and impact of COVID-19. Identified strategies included early recognition of the threat and rapid activation of national response protocols led by national leadership; rapid establishment of diagnostic capacity; scale-up of measures for preventing community transmission; and redesigning the triage and treatment systems, mobilizing the necessary resources for clinical care. Facilitators included existing hospital capacity, the epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak, and strong national leadership despite political changes and population sensitization due to the 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) epidemic. Challenges included sustaining adequate human resources and supplies in high-caseload areas. Key recommendations include (1) recognize the problem, (2) establish diagnostic capacity, (3) implement aggressive measures to prevent community transmission, (4) redesign and reallocate clinical resources for the new environment, and (5) work to limit economic impact through and while prioritizing controlling the spread and impact of COVID-19.

Some factors are specific to the tropics (climate and infections), while others are non-specific (chemicals, human communities and their way of life). Second, we examine the major role of human adaptation to the success of Homo sapiens, with emphasis on the linkage between thermoregulation and sleep-wake regulation. Third, we examine the performance of environmental neurology as a clinical discipline in tropical climates, with focus on the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges posed by human African trypanosomiasis.

METHODS With use of predefined exclusion criteria, all consecutive laparoscopic-assisted (51 patients) and robot-assisted (36 patients) rectal resections for adenocarcinoma from August 2005 to November 2009 at a single institution were considered. Hand-assisted laparoscopy was used for splenic flexure mobilization in all cases. Patients were assigned into robotic and open groups on the basis of the technique used for total mesorectal excision. All 36 robot-assisted resections had the total mesorectal excision performed with robotic assistance and were included in the robotic group. Forty-six of the 51 patients who received a laparoscopic-assisted procedure had the total mesorectal excision performed through the hand port using open surgical technique and were included in the open group. Both groups were compared with respect to patient demographics, perioperative outcomes, and pathology. RESULTS The robotic and open groups were comparable in age, sex, body mass index, history of prior abdominal surgery, ASA class, number of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and tumor stage. There were more abdominoperineal resections (P = .019) and more low and mid rectal tumors (P = .007) in the robotic group. Total procedure time was longer in the robotic group (P = .003), but blood loss was less (P = .036). Lymph node yield, intraoperative and postoperative complications, and length of stay were all comparable. There were 3 positive circumferential margins in the open group vs none in the robotic group, but this did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS Robotic total mesorectal excision is feasible and safe, and is comparable to open total mesorectal excision in terms of perioperative and pathological outcomes. The longer operative time associated with robotic total mesorectal excision could decrease as experience with this relatively new technique increases. Large randomized trials are necessary to validate the potential benefits of less blood loss and lower margin positivity rates observed in this study.","deSouza, Ashwin L; Prasad, Leela M; Ricci, John; Park, John J; Marecik, Slawomir J; Zimmern, Andrea; Blumetti, Jennifer; Abcarian, Herand",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3182060152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21304296/,319

A smaller fluorescent protein is urgently needed since it is more suitable to act as a reporter in AAV. In this study, a bilirubin-dependent reporter smaller than EGFP, termed UnaG, was found to have the ability to label the neurons of a mouse brain as clearly as EGFP without the addition of exogenous bilirubin. We also found that UnaG's pH tolerance is better than that of EGFP; however, its fluorescence recovery after protonated quenching is not as good as that of EGFP. In addition, UnaG preserved its fluorescence better than EGFP in SeeDB clearing. Taken together, this study demonstrates that UnaG can act as a small intrinsically fluorescent reporter in the mouse brain without an additional ligand, thus providing an alternative over EGFP for AAV-mediated neuron labeling in mammals.

So far, evidence has not supported a link between infections with either virus and respiratory tract disease; however, there has not been a large comparison of KIPyV-infected patients to age-matched patient groups. METHODS A retrospective study comparing clinical aspects of KIPyV-positive patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-positive, WUPyV-positive, and respiratory-virus negative patients. Using real-time polymerase chain reaction, 2599 respiratory samples from patients ranging from 1 day to 88 years of age were tested for KIPyV. Electronic medical records were reviewed for 65 cases, for a comparison group consisting of 195 patients negative for common respiratory viruses, and for 56 WUPyV-positive patients drawn from the same population. Twelve patients testing positive for KIPyV as the sole pathogen were matched to 36 RSV-positive patients and clinical features of both groups were compared. RESULTS Seventy-two (2.8%) respiratory samples were positive for KIPyV. Another virus was detected in 71% of the KIPyV-positive samples. Analysis showed no statistically significant differences in clinical manifestations between KIPyV-positive patients and patients negative for common respiratory viruses, however, clinical characteristics of KIPyV-positive patients were less severe than those of patients positive for RSV. KIPyVpositive patients >or=3 years of age were usually immunocompromised in contrast to the younger children with KIPyV. CONCLUSIONS This study did not demonstrate a link between KIPyV infection and symptomatic respiratory disease. Patients positive for KIPyV exhibited less severe clinical symptoms than patients positive for RSV.","Hormozdi, David J; Arens, Max Q; Le, Binh-Minh; Buller, Richard S; Agapov, Eugene; Storch, Gregory A",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3181c1795c; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19949359/,319

How to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections early has become a global focus. Objective, To explore the roles of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies detection, nucleic acid tests and computed tomography (CT) scanning to identify asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, The clinical data of 389 individuals with close contacts including in general characteristics, SARS-CoV-2 etiology, serum-specific IgM and IgG antibody detection and CT imaging results, were systematically analyzed. Results, The present study showed that only 89 of the 389 individuals with close contacts were positive after the first nucleic acid test, while 300 individuals were still negative after two nucleic acid tests. Among the 300 individuals, 75 did not have pneumonia, and the other 225 individuals had pulmonary imaging changes. A total of 143 individuals were eventually diagnosed as having asymptomatic infection through IgM antibody and IgG antibody detection. The sensitivity, specificity and false-negative rate of IgM and IgG antibody detection were approximately 97.1% (347/357), 95.3% (204/214) and 4.67% (10/214), respectively. It also indicated that over approximately 2 weeks, most individuals were both IgM positive and IgG positive, accounting for 68.57% (72/105). Over approximately 3 weeks, the proportion of IgM-positive and IgG-positive individuals decreased to 8.57% (9/105), and the proportion of IgM-negative and IgG-positive individuals increased to 76.19% (80/105). Conclusions, There are highlighted prospects of IgM/IgG antibody detection as a preferred method in identifying the individuals with asymptomatic SARS CoV-2 infection, especially combined with nucleic acid tests and pulmonary CT scanning.","Li, Yaqing; He, Qiang; Yu, Rizhen; Jiang, Hui; Wang, Weizhong; Feng, Dujin; Hou, Guanghua; Zhou, Hongbin; Jiang, Yaona; Xiang, Zhun",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2020-0310-sa; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32966561/,319

METHODS A cross-sectional survey of central Pennsylvanian adults evaluated self-reported knowledge, and a convergent, mixed methods design was used to assess beliefs about recommendations, intended behaviors, perceptions, and concerns related to infectious disease risk, and trust of information sources. RESULTS The survey was completed by 5,948 adults. The estimated probability of correct response for the basic knowledge score, weighted with confidence, was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.79-0.80). Knowledge was significantly higher in patients with higher education and nonminority race. While the majority of respondents reported that they believed following CDC recommendations would decrease the spread of COVID-19 in their community and intended to adhere to them, only 65.2% rated social isolation with the highest level of belief and adherence. The most trusted information source was federal public health websites (42.8%). Qualitative responses aligned with quantitative data and described concerns about illness, epidemiologic issues, economic and societal disruptions, and distrust of the executive branch's messaging. The survey was limited by a lack of minority representation, potential selection bias, and evolving COVID-19 information that may impact generalizability and interpretability. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge about COVID-19 and intended adherence to behavioral recommendations were high. There was substantial distrust of the executive branch of the federal government, however, and concern about mixed messaging and information overload.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people have become more interested in ways to improve and maintain their health. Increased awareness of people on healthy lifestyle is translating into inquisition regarding dietary supplements. AIM First, focus on the most commonly used vitamin supplements and comprehensively review the evidence for and against recommending them to patients to improve and/or maintain cardiovascular health. Second, illustrate how the interest in studies shifted over time from Vitamin A, E, C, and B to Vitamin D and observational studies led to randomized controlled trials. METHODS A thorough PubMed search with the phrase: ""Vitamin supplements and cardiovascular health"" was performed. In the present review, focus was maintained on the evidence for the use of vitamin supplements in the prevention of major cardiovascular events and/or the maintenance of cardiovascular health by comprehensively reviewing all previous studies indexed in PubMed. Studies with clinical 'hard' end-points were included only. RESULTS A total of 87 studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in the present article. High-quality evidence suggesting benefits for the use of vitamin supplements to maintain or improve cardiovascular health in people is minimal to non-existent. CONCLUSIONS Vitamin supplementation does not improve clinical cardiovascular outcomes in general population. Counseling on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle with adequate and nutritious food intake seems more appropriate to improve and maintain cardiovascular health.","Simsek, Bahadir; Selte, Atakan; Egeli, Bugra Han; Çakatay, Ufuk",Clinical nutrition ESPEN,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnesp.2021.02.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745562/,319
161524,Computational social science: On measurement.,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND Treatment of neuropathic pain is still challenging. Recent studies have suggested that dorsal root ganglia (DRG), which carry sensory neural signals from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system, are important for pathological nociception. A proper understanding of the significance and function of DRG and their role in pharmacotherapy can help to improve the treatment of neuropathic pain. Metamizole, also known as sulpyrine or dipyrone, is a non-opioid analgesic commonly used in clinical practice, but it is not used for neuropathic pain treatment. METHODS Chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve was induced in Wistar rats. Metamizole was administered intraperitoneally (ip) preemptively at 16 and 1 h before CCI and then twice a day for 7 days. To evaluate tactile and thermal hypersensitivity, von Frey and cold plate tests were conducted, respectively. RESULTS Our behavioral results provide evidence that repeated intraperitoneal administration of metamizole diminishes the development of neuropathic pain symptoms in rats. Simultaneously, our findings provide evidence that metamizole diminishes the expression of pronociceptive interleukins (IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-18) and chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, and CCL7) in DRG measured 7 days after sciatic nerve injury. These assays indicate, for the first time, that metamizole exerts antinociceptive effects on nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain at the DRG level. CONCLUSIONS Finally, we indicate that metamizole-induced analgesia in neuropathy is associated with silencing of a broad spectrum of cytokines in DRG. Our results also suggest that metamizole is likely to be an effective medication for neuropathic pain.","Zajaczkowska, Renata; Kwiatkowski, Klaudia; Pawlik, Katarzyna; Piotrowska, Anna; Rojewska, Ewelina; Makuch, Wioletta; Wordliczek, Jerzy; Mika, Joanna",Pharmacological reports : PR,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43440-020-00137-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691345/,319

Some evidence suggests that ABO blood type may be a risk factor for cancer incidence and prognosis. For example, a large study recently discovered an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer in patients with non-O blood type; however, it is not known whether blood group correlates with outcomes in patients with RCC. We found a significant and independent association between ABO blood group and overall survival in patients undergoing surgery for locoregional RCC. Specifically, we identified non-O blood type as a predictor of mortality. OBJECTIVE • To determine whether ABO blood group is associated with survival after nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS • We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 900 patients who underwent surgery for locoregional RCC between 1997 and 2008 at a single institution. • Covariates included age, gender, race, American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Status, preoperative anaemia and hypoalbuminemia, tumour characteristics, lymph node status, procedure performed, transfusion status and ABO blood group. • Primary outcomes were overall (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). • Univariable survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank methods. Multivariable analysis was performed using a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS • The 3-year OS estimate was 75% (95%CI 70-79%) for O blood group and 68% (95% CI 63-73%) for non-O blood group (P= 0.072). The 3-year DSS was 81% (95% CI 76-85%) for O blood group and 76% (95%CI 71-80%) for non-O blood group (P= 0.053). • In the multivariable analysis for OS, non-O blood type was significantly associated with decreased OS (HR 1.68, 95%CI 1.18-2.39; P= 0.004) but not DSS (HR 1.53, 95%CI 0.97-2.41; P= 0.065). CONCLUSION • These data suggest that ABO blood group is independently associated with OS in patients undergoing surgery for locoregional RCC. ABO blood group has not been previously recognized as a predictor of survival in RCC.","Kaffenberger, Samuel D; Morgan, Todd M; Stratton, Kelly L; Boachie, Adu M; Barocas, Daniel A; Chang, Sam S; Cookson, Michael S; Herrell, S Duke; Smith, Joseph A; Clark, Peter E",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2012.11366.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22958439/,319
162399,An Asymptotic Theory of Joint Sequential Changepoint Detection and Identification for General Stochastic Models,2021,"OBJECT Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (nTMS) is a newly evolving technique. Despite its supposed purpose (for example, preoperative central region mapping), little is known about its accuracy compared with established modalities like direct cortical stimulation (DCS) and functional MR (fMR) imaging. Against this background, the authors performed the current study to compare the accuracy of nTMS with DCS and fMR imaging. METHODS Fourteen patients with tumors in or close to the precentral gyrus were examined using nTMS for motor cortex mapping, as were 12 patients with lesions in the subcortical white matter motor tract. Moreover, preoperative fMR imaging and intraoperative mapping of the motor cortex were performed via DCS, and the outlining of the motor cortex was compared. RESULTS In the 14 cases of lesions affecting the precentral gyrus, the primary motor cortex as outlined by nTMS correlated well with that delineated by intraoperative DCS mapping, with a deviation of 4.4 ± 3.4 mm between the two methods. In comparing nTMS with fMR imaging, the deviation between the two methods was much larger: 9.8 ± 8.5 mm for the upper extremity and 14.7 ± 12.4 mm for the lower extremity. In 13 of 14 cases, the surgeon admitted easier identification of the central region because of nTMS. The procedure had a subjectively positive influence on the operative results in 5 cases and was responsible for a changed resection strategy in 2 cases. One of 26 patients experienced nTMS as unpleasant; none found it painful. CONCLUSIONS Navigated TMS correlates well with DCS as a gold standard despite factors that are supposed to contribute to the inaccuracy of nTMS. Moreover, surgeons have found nTMS to be an additional and helpful modality during the resection of tumors affecting eloquent motor areas, as well as during preoperative planning.","Krieg, Sandro M; Shiban, Ehab; Buchmann, Niels; Gempt, Jens; Foerschler, Annette; Meyer, Bernhard; Ringel, Florian",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2011.12.jns111524; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22304452/,319

The study re-visits the hotel services delivery process and examines how the hotel service blueprint has been re-framed. Design/methodology/approach: The study implemented an exploratory and qualitative research design to identify changes in customer service encounters and the hotel service delivery process. The research applied a cross-sectional survey-based design, which involved open-ended and closed interview questions with hoteliers in the Delhi/NCR region. Findings: The study identified an increase in contactless service during the service delivery process and in customer service encounters while staying at hotels. In so doing, the various service touchpoints in hotels need to transition from personalized service to contactless service encounters such as at check-in and payment, contactless room key access with available and accessible hand sanitizers, masks, room purifiers, automated room cleaning machines and the deployment of other smart artificial intelligence-based technologies. Practical implications: This paper profiles a revised service blueprint model for hotels, which could assist hotel service managers to address potential sources of customer dissatisfaction and service failure during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) non-invasive ventilation can help patients with moderate symptoms to avoid the need for invasive ventilation in intensive care. However, existing CPAP systems can be complex (and thus expensive) or require high levels of oxygen, limiting their use in resource-stretched environments. Technical Development + Testing: The LeVe (Light) CPAP system was developed using principles of frugal innovation to produce a solution of low complexity and high resource efficiency. The LeVe system exploits the air flow dynamics of electric fan blowers which are inherently suited to delivery of positive pressure at appropriate flow rates for CPAP. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated that performance of the LeVe system was equivalent to other commercially available systems used to deliver CPAP. Pilot Evaluation: The LeVe CPAP system was tested to evaluate safety and acceptability in a group of ten healthy volunteers at Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. The study demonstrated that the system can be used safely without inducing hypoxia or hypercapnia and that its use was well tolerated by users, with no adverse events reported. Conclusions: CPAP ventilation systems provide an important treatment option for COVID-19 patients. To deliver this for the high patient numbers associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare providers require resource efficient solutions. We have shown that this can be achieved through frugal engineering of a CPAP ventilation system, in a system which is safe for use and well tolerated in healthy volunteers. This approach may also benefit other respiratory conditions which often go unaddressed in LMICs for want of context-appropriate technology.","Culmer, P.; Davis Birch, W.; Waters, I.; Keeling, A.; Osnes, C.; Jones, D.; de Boer, G.; Hetherington, R.; Ashton, S.; Latham, M.; Beacon, T.; Royston, T.; Miller, R.; Littlejohns, A.; Parmar, J.; Lawton, T.; Murdoch, S.; Brettle, D.; Musasizi, R.; Nampiina, G.; Namulema, E.; Kapur, N.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.24.21256987v1?rss=1,319

Dried blood spots (DBS) collected by finger prick or heel prick are a minimally invasive sample collection alternative previously used to detect antibodies to other viruses. In this study we evaluated DBS for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies on three commercially available enzyme (EIA) and chemiluminescent (CLIA) immunoassays by analysing paired DBS and serum samples collected from 54 subjects. We demonstrate that testing of DBS samples was highly sensitive and specific, and quantitative results strongly correlated with those of paired serum. These results suggest that DBS derived blood is a viable alternative to plasma or serum for use in EIAs and CLIAs, and has particular utility as a minimally invasive collection tool for COVID-19 serological testing of infants and children.","Walker, G.

163706,Decoding the Neural Signatures of Valence and Arousal From Portable EEG Headset,2021-07-23,"With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic throughout the world, social distancing and using a face mask have become crucial to prevent the spreading of this disease. Our goal is to develop a better way to detect face masks. In this paper, we propose a comparison between all available networks, which is an efficient one-stage face mask detector. The detection scheme follows preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification. The mask detector has been built using deep learning, specifically ResNetV2, as the base pre-trained model upon which we have our own CNN. We use OpenCV’s ImageNet to extract faces from video frames and our trained model to classify if the person is wearing a mask or not. We also propose an object removal algorithm to reject prediction below absolute confidence and accept only predictions above it. For the training purpose, we are using the face mask dataset, which consists of 680 images with mask and 686 images without mask. The results show mask detector has an accuracy of 99.9%. We have also used other pre-trained networks like MobileNetV2 as our base network and compared our results. ResNet50 gives us the state-of-the-art performance of face mask detection, which is higher than other face detectors. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Maity, S.; Das, P.; Jha, K.

Adequate knowledge and practices are vital to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the knowledge and practice regarding COVID-19 among internally displaced persons in Sudan. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected through an online survey using a self-administered questionnaire. Convenience sampling method was used for the internally displaced persons in two camps of Zalingei town, central Darfur region, Sudan. Results: In total, 143 participants responded;75 (52.4%) of them were female, while 68 (47.6%) were male;49 (34.3%) were between the age of 50 and 60 years;78 (54.5%) were formally uneducated;126 (88.1%) did not have a chronic disease;and 56 (39.2%) knew about COVID-19 from their relatives and friends. The overall mean of participants' knowledge toward COVID- 19 was 3.68 (SD +/- 0.60(, denoting good with a rate of 73.6% and that of the practice was 2.65 (SD +/- 1.08), denoting moderate with a rate of 53%. A positive correlation was seen between knowledge and practice (r = 0.700, p &lt; 0.000). Statistically significant differences were observed between the mean score of knowledge and practice with age, education, and information sources (p &lt; 0.0001). While graduates showed a higher knowledge (116.29, p = 0.000), secondary respondents showed a higher practice (115.04, p = 0.000) than others.

165331,The Territory Requires Coherent Work: The Role of Interregional Interactions in Economic Recovery (To the 100th Anniversary of I.G. Aleksandrov’s Work ‘Economic Regionalization of Russia’),2021,"Music has always been a reservoir of African cultures and histories. Through music, we can trace the experiences of particular communities at specific moments in history. It has been used to entertain, educate, as well as preserve the histories of communities throughout East African societies. This paper discusses how music in the digital space has played a pivotal role in helping combat the COVID-19 pandemic and also document this moment in time. The paper considers the role of song in mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in East Africa and analyses the work of popular artists involved in this effort. The paper focuses on songs by leading East African artists such as Bobi Wine from Uganda, Mrisho Mpoto from Tanzania, and Salome Wairimu from Kenya. The paper argues that the songs by the said artists have played an important role in helping to mitigate and document the effects of the pandemic in the East African region. In constructing its arguments, the paper leans on critical reflections on the place of the artist in the society as espoused by Okot P’Bitek (1986) and also theoretical postulations on African oral literature as argued by Ruth Finnegan (2016). The paper also considers critical approaches on the place of the arts in past pandemics in Africa by Gregory Barz and Judah M. Cohen (Eds) (2011). The paper concludes by noting that the online spaces and linguistic choices by the studied artists break physical boundaries to present a united front in battling the COVID-19 pandemic in East Africa.

During the spring of 2020, ours was one of thousands of courses forced to change abruptly from face-to-face instruction to online delivery. We report the effects of this change on students through the lenses initially available to us, including our online homework system, an online forum, and the course evaluations. While preliminary, our results suggest that students were generally unhappy with the transition, but this disappointment did not translate into significantly reduced effort or success. Their primary concerns were not technological but stemmed from behavioral considerations either internal to themselves or external, from the instructor. Although the event probed here was the pandemic, our observations and conclusions may be applicable to other situations in which instruction changes suddenly due to natural or human-caused disasters.","Gavrin, A.",2020 Physics Education Research Conference,https://doi.org/10.1119/perc.2020.pr.gavrin,319

In this paper, we present the case of an online design sprint involving two groups of diverse participants in London and Tokyo as the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded. This modified design sprint model, which we describe as a 'care-full design stroll', integrated co-design approaches with ethics of care to offer remote cultural experiences aimed at addressing inequalities of access and inclusion faced by the arts and cultural sectors in Japan and the UK. We analyse data from ethnographic observations, interviews and surveys in both nations to illustrate the challenges and opportunities of facilitating design sprints online. Our findings show how care-full co-design, underpinned by concepts of thinking-with and working-alongside, can be facilitated in online-only and/or limited terrains, in ways that nourish cultural organisations and their publics in times of great uncertainty.

Survey data comes from the RAND American Life Panel survey, a survey exploring how people in the U.S. are coping with the pandemic. The survey found that (1) the public places a high level of trust in the USPS in comparison with other federal government agencies and (2) when compared with private couriers, such as FedEx and UPS, respondents felt that COVID-19 safety measures were about the same for the USPS and private couriers, however, rural residents felt that the USPS was safer. The importance of the USPS to rural residents is also discussed including post offices as places of social interaction and the USPS being the only delivery option in some rural areas. During the COVID-19 pandemic USPS revenue has plummeted as letter-mail volume, including advertisements and bulk mail, has dropped dramatically. Since the USPS relies on postage for its revenue it may run out of funding without emergency aid. This research report presents information that may assist policymakers in understanding the role USPS plays especially in rural areas.","Pollard, Michael S.; Davis, Lois M.; Corporation, Rand",,https://doi.org/10.7249/rra308-5,319
166882,Acting in a Robotic Environment Requires New Skills for Physicians,2021,"The purpose of this study was to explore the use of social media within the context of heterosexual Black teen girls’ romantic partner selection processes. To better understand Black teen girls’ experiences, five focus groups (N = 27;aged 14–18 years) were conducted over Zoom. An inductive thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) the use of different platforms to gather different types of information, (2) the rules of social media scouting, (3) detecting partner qualities through social media, and (4) exploring Black teen girls’ experience with social media and dating. Participants in our study primarily used Instagram to understand a potential partner’s true self, while Twitter was used to assess a potential partner’s political leanings. Our participants shared numerous “rules” related to the partner-scouting process. Black teen girls in our study explained that photos index a potential partner’s style and hygiene, while memes were used to gauge sense of humor compatibility. More specific to Black teen girls, across all focus groups, participants shared their experiences of racism and bias, such as being associated with Black stereotypes, cultural invalidation, and being accused of “acting White.” Although teen girls of various racial and ethnic groups may use social media to vet romantic partners, findings reveal that Black teen girls navigate social media in a unique way, including being highly attuned to signs of bias. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of COVID-19 social distancing had little impact on our participant’s practice of using social media to vet potential romantic partners. © The Author(s) 2021.","Weser, V.

168038,Short k-mer Abundance Profiles Yield Robust Machine Learning Features and Accurate Classifiers for RNA Viruses,2020-06-25,"Presented by: Javier Padilla-Cabello (jpadillacabello@gmail.com) Introduction A 67-year-old male patient, smoker of more than a pack a day since childhood, presented to the emergency department with a right cervical tumor and dysphagia of twoweeks' evolution. On examination, cervical palpation revealed an adenopathy in the right area IIa of about 5 cm in diameter, stony and adherent to deep planes. Fibrolaryngoscopy showed a lesion on the right laryngeal surface of the epiglottis and a leukoplakia in the right lateral glossoepiglottic fold. Therefore, it was decided to perform transoral laryngeal microsurgery to take biopsies and request CT for extension study. Materials and Methods The samples taken in the operating room and the CT scan showed that it was an epidermoid carcinoma of the supraglottis stage cT1N2BM0. It was decided to perform a right hemiepiglottectomy with extension to the right lateral glossoepiglottic fold by transoral laser surgery together with bilateral functional cervical emptying. The patient required a tracheotomy due to an episode of severe post-surgical laryngeal edema and the cannula had to be maintained, together with a gastrostomy, because the patient subsequently developed dysphagia with aspiration of secretions and food. Results Histopathological analysis showed that it was a combined tumor: on the one hand a poorly differentiated epiglottic neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) (CK-20 +, S100 +, Ki67 90%) with cervical metastasis and on the other hand a supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma in the right glossoepiglottic fold with one cervical metastasis (pT1N1). The case was presented to the oncology committee and it was decided to complete treatment with chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy was administered with a reduced dose of carboplatin (AUC = 3) and etoposide. Despite treatment, local cervical tumor progression was observed in the control CT scan and the patient finally died a few weeks later due to COVID19. Conclusions NEC of the larynx are very rare and aggressive, so an accurate histopathologic diagnosis is essential for early treatment. Their most frequent location is the supraglottis and the clinical presentation of the patient is a mild odynophagia or a cervical mass. Very few associated cases of synchronous laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma have been described. Treatment of NEC is based on chemoradiotherapy with a survival rate of less than 5% at 5 years.","Padilla-Cabello, J.; Vazquez-Lopez, C.; Mora-Diaz, D.; Fanjul-Garcia, F.; Zepeda-Morales, J.

These systems were already deployed nationally when the COVID-19 pandemic hit China, but were connected at a lesser capacity, targeting specific domains of security, industry or government administration. In response to the crisis, multiple technologies have been merged, exceeding the scope of their originally intended functions. This is known as function creep, when surveillant technologies remain functional past achievement of their intended purpose, or surveillant assemblages, where multiple surveillant technologies are combined. As more countries turn to digitalisation to increase public security and intensify social and market governance, the expansion of surveillant functions in China and their now-palpable effects on people’s lives raises new and pressing questions for scholars and decision-makers alike.

169396,Reference data based insights expand understanding of human metabolomes,2020-07-10,"Course selection is a crucial activity for students as it directly impacts their workload and performance. It is also time-consuming, prone to subjectivity, and often carried out based on incomplete information. This task can, nevertheless, be assisted with computational tools, for instance, by predicting performance based on historical data. We investigate the effects of showing grade predictions to students through an interactive visualization tool. A qualitative study suggests that in the presence of predictions, students may focus too much on maximizing their performance, to the detriment of other factors such as the workload. A follow-up quantitative study explored whether these effects are mitigated by changing how predictions are conveyed. Our observations suggest the presence of a framing effect that induces students to put more effort into course selection when faced with more specific predictions. We discuss these and other findings and outline considerations for designing better data-driven course selection tools.","M'endez, Gonzalo Gabriel; Gal'arraga, Luis; Chiluiza, Katherine",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00148v1.pdf,319

A total of 622 classroom teachers filled in an online questionnaire on SE-PE and WE, referring to before and during the lockdown, and on perceived digital competence. While controlling for perceived digital competence, a mixed between-within Repeated Measures Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (RM-MANCOVA) was performed, using a factorial design with two time categories (before vs. during the lockdown) and three age categories (≤40 vs. 41–50 vs. ≥51 years). The RM-MANCOVA revealed that perceived digital competence significantly adjusted teachers’ SE-PE and WE values (p <0.001). The analysis yielded a significant multivariate main effect by time (p <0.001) and by time × age categories (p = 0.001). Follow-up univariate ANCOVA showed significant differences by time in teachers’ SE-PE (p <0.001) and WE (p <0.001), with a reduction in both values from before to during the lockdown. A Bonferroni post hoc pairwise comparison showed teachers’ SE-PE significantly decreased in all age categories (p <0.001). The present findings confirm the importance of promoting SE-PE among primary school teachers, regardless of the crisis due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Specifically, we construct computationally efficient Quasi-representative Concentration Pathways (QCPs) to leverage concentration pathways of existing peer-reviewed scenarios. Computational efficiency allows for bootstrapping to assess uncertainty.

While much has been described in the literature about lung infiltrates and respiratory failure associated with infection of coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), pneumothorax is reported as a rare (a rate of 1%) but a life-threatening complication of COVID-19 pneumonia. Late bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax has been described in few cases. The aim of the report is to consider pneumothorax as a possible complication of COVID-19 pneumonia, which is also one of the causes of respiratory deterioration and potentially fatal outcome in these patients. Case оutline This article describes the clinical course of the patient who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens and who presented with COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by bilateral, spontaneous pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema. He had no underlying lung disease nor risk factors for pneumothorax, except administered non-invasive ventilation/continuous positive airway pressure during first hospitalization. The patient was successfully treated with surgical (chest drainage, thoracoscopy and pleural abrasion) and non-surgical methods (by application of drugs and other supportive therapies). Conclusion This review demonstrates that the possibility of a late pneumothorax should be kept in mind in patients with, or recovering from, COVID-19 disease with progressive dyspnea. The timely diagnosis and management of pneumothorax will reduce COVID-19 associated mortality. © 2021, Serbia Medical Society.

The recommendation for using remdesivir in COVID-19 was based on the in vitro and in vivo activity of this drug against SARS-CoV-2. Methods: this was a prospective, observational study conducted on a large population of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on 30-day mortality; secondary endpoint was the impact of remdesivir-containing therapy on the need of high flow oxygen therapy (HFNC) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) or mechanical ventilation. Data were analyzed after propensity score matching. Results: 407 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled. Out of these, 294 (72.2%) and 113 (27.8%) were respectively treated or not with remdesivir. Overall, 61 (14.9%) patients were treated during hospitalization with non-invasive or mechanical ventilation, while a 30-day mortality was observed in 21 (5.2%) patients. Cox regression analysis, after propensity score matching, showed that therapies, including remdesivir-containing therapy, were not statistically associated with 30-day survival or mortality, while need of HFNC/NIV (HR 17.921, CI95% 0.954-336.73, p=0.044) and mechanical ventilation (HR 3.9, CI95% 5.36-16.2, p=0.003) resulted independently associated with 30-day mortality. Finally, therapies including or not remdesivir were not independently associated with lower or higher risk of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: this real-life experience about the remdesivir use in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 was not associated with significant increase in rates of survival or reduced use of HFNC/NIV or mechanical ventilation, compared to patients treated with other therapies not including remdesivir.","Russo, A.; Binetti, E.; Borrazzo, C.; Gentilini Cacciola, E.; Battistini, L.; Ceccarelli, G.; Mastroianni, C.

173234,Imagining ithaca: Nostos and nostalgia since the great war,2021,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed healthcare, promoting a shift to remote services. Managing long-term therapy conditions, like hypertension, became increasingly difficult due to limited access to care. During these unprecedented times, two community pharmacies collaborated with a school of pharmacy to develop a new remote program to encourage patient centered disease state management. Objectives: The primary objective was to describe patient perceptions of participating in a student-led, remote hypertension education program. The secondary objective was to gain insight on perceptions of the program's impact on current lifestyle. Methods: Second- and third-year pharmacy students worked with faculty preceptors to develop and remotely deliver an 8-week curriculum. During each call, students educated on a topic and set S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) goals. After completing the program, participants were interviewed regarding their experience. This study was a qualitative design using semi-structured interviews. Participants in the program were interviewed by trained investigators. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically coded to address study outcomes. Results: A total of 12 participant interviews were conducted with all participants 50 years of age or older and a majority having a diagnosis of hypertension for greater than 20 years. From the interviews, six dominant themes were identified. Themes were: (a) students were knowledgeable, professional, and engaged;(b) participants felt comfortable communicating with the students and developed a positive relationship;(c) participants expressed having a positive impact on the students' education;(d) the program was organized;(e) participants reported positive lifestyle changes or reinforced habits that they plan to continue, and (f) the remote nature of the program was convenient, but face-to-face interaction was missed.

173305,Observations on the sustainability of biodiversity through seed dispersal in a microecosystem,2021,"During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bogotá, Colombia, some strategies for dealing with the increasing number of infected people and the level of occupation of intensive care units include the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). PPE is a crucial component for patient care and a priority for protecting healthcare workers. For attending this necessity, the location of distribution centers within the city and the corresponding routes to supply the intensive care units (ICU) with PPE have an important role. Formally, this problem is defined as the Location Routing Problem (LRP). The LRP is an NP-Hard problem that combines the Facility Location Problem (FLP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Multiple Depots (MDVRP). This work presents a decision support tool based on a simheuristic method that hybridize an Iterated Local Search (ILS) algorithm with Monte Carlo simulation to deal with the LRP with uncertain demands. Realistic data from Bogotá (Colombia) was retrieved using Google Maps to characterize the geographical distribution of both potential facilities and ICUs, while demands were generated using the uniform probability distribution. Our preliminary results suggest the competitiveness of the algorithm in both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the LRP. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Martínez-Reyes, A.; Quintero-Araújo, C.

174644,Prelim 3: Contents,2020-07-31,"During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic it emerged that the nature and magnitude of demand for mental health services was changing. Considerable increases were expected to follow initial lulls as treatment was sought for new and existing conditions following relaxation of ‘lockdown’ measures. For this to be managed by the various services that constitute a mental health system, it would be necessary to complement such projections with assessments of capacity, in order to understand the propagation of demand and the value of any consequent mitigations. This paper provides an account of exploratory modelling undertaken within a major UK healthcare system during the first wave of the pandemic, when actionable insights were in short supply and decisions were made under much uncertainty. In understanding the impact on post-lockdown operational performance, the objective was to evaluate the efficacy of two considered interventions against a baseline ‘do nothing’ scenario. In doing so, a versatile and purpose-built discrete time simulation model was developed, calibrated and used by a multi-disciplinary project working group. The solution, representing a multi-node, multi-server queueing network with reneging, is implemented in open-source software and is freely and publicly available.","Murch, B. J.; Cooper, J.

Yet, it is currently unknown how multiple lifestyle factors interact to influence cognition. The ACTIVate Study aims to 1) Explore associations between 24-hour time-use and diet compositions with changes in cognition and brain function; and 2) Identify durations of time-use behaviours and the dietary compositions to optimise cognition and brain function. Methods and analysis This three-year prospective longitudinal cohort study will recruit 448 adults aged 60-70 years across Adelaide and Newcastle, Australia. Time-use data will be collected through wrist-worn activity monitors and the Multimedia Activity Recall for Children and Adults (MARCA). Dietary intake will be assessed using the Australian Eating Survey food frequency questionnaire. The primary outcome will be cognitive function, assessed using the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III). Secondary outcomes include structural and functional brain measures using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), cerebral arterial pulse measured with Diffuse Optical Tomography (Pulse-DOT), neuroplasticity using simultaneous Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and Electroencephalography (EEG), and electrophysiological markers of cognitive control using event-related potential (ERP) and time-frequency analyses. Compositional data analysis, testing for interactions between time-point and compositions, will assess longitudinal associations between dependent (cognition, brain function) and independent (time-use and diet compositions) variables. Conclusions The ACTIVate Study will be the first to examine associations between time-use and diet compositions, cognition and brain function. Our findings will inform new avenues for multidomain interventions that may more effectively account for the co-dependence between activity and diet behaviours for dementia prevention.

CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech, Beijing, China) is currently being used for mass vaccination in Thailand as well as other low-income countries. Three VOCs currently circulating within Thailand include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), and B.1.617.2 (Delta) strains. We assessed NAb potency against the prototypic strain containing the original spike sequence (WT) compared to that against the 3 VOCs using sera derived from a cohort of healthcare workers who received a full 2-dose regimen of CoronaVac. Sera from two other cohorts consisting of COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalized in 2020 and 2021 were evaluated for comparison. We found that, despite equally robust production of S1-RBD-binding IgG and 100% seropositivity, sera from both CoronaVac vaccinees and naturally infected individuals had significantly reduced neutralizing capacity against all 3 VOCs compared to WT. Strikingly, NAb titers against Alpha and Beta were comparable, but Delta appears to be significantly more refractory to NAbs in all groups. Our results may help inform on CoronaVac NAb-inducing capacity, which is a proxy for vaccine efficacy, in the context of the WT strain and 3 VOCs. Our results also have critical implications for public health decisionmakers who may need to maintain efficient mitigation strategies amid a potentially high risk for infection with VOCs even in those who have been previously infected.","Vacharathit, V.; Aiewsakun, P.; Manopwisedjaroen, S.; Srisaowakarn, C.; Laopanupong, T.; Ludowyke, N.; Phuphuakrat, A.; Setthaudom, C.; Ekronarongchai, S.; Srichatrapimuk, S.; Wongsirisin, P.; Sangrajrang, S.; Imsuwansri, T.; Kirdlarp, S.; Nualkaew, S.; Sensorn, I.; Sawaengdee, W.; Wichukchinda, N.; Sungkanuparph, S.; Chantratita, W.; Kunakorn, M.; Rojanamatin, J.; Hongeng, S.; Thitithanyanont, A.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.10.21260232v1?rss=1,319

COVID-19 related environmental impacts, through reduced urban activities, is worthy of investigation as it may demonstrate human capacity to manage UHI. We aim to establish the thermal impacts associated with COVID-19 induced urban ‘lockdown’ from 20 March to 20 April 2020 over Tehran. Areal changes in UHI are assessed through Classification and Regression Trees (CART), measured against background synoptic scale temperature changes over the years 1950-2020. Results indicate that monthly Tmean, Tmax and Tmin values during this time were considerably lower than long-term mean values for the reference period. Although the COVID-19 initiated shutdown led to an identifiable temperature anomaly, we demonstrate that this is not a product of upper atmospheric or synoptic conditions alone. We also show that the cooling effect over Tehran was not spatially uniform, which is likely due to the complexity of land uses such as industrial as opposed to residential. Our findings provide potentially valuable insights and implications for future management of urban heat islands during extreme heat waves that pose a serious threat to human health.","Roshan, Gholamreza Sarli Reza Grab Stefan W.",Sustainable Cities and Society,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103263,319

175531,A Low-Cost System for Remote Access and Control of Automation Equipment,2021,"The hospitalization and symptomatic rates of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) are key epidemiological parameters affecting risk analyses conducted for the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) during the Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. As one of the criteria of a variant of concern (VOC) is that it affects disease severity, the authors sought to understand whether the Alpha and Gamma VOCs are significantly different in these two parameters than the original wildtype of SARS-CoV-2, the most prevalent in relevant areas of Canada as of study initiation. Searches for studies were conducted in Scopus and PubMed, and located through following citations and receiving studies from daily literature scans. For the hospitalization outcome, effect ratios relative to original wildtype were included. For the symptomatic ratio, the ratio itself for each variant was used. Analysis of age-related effects was of particular value, as CAF members are primarily adults under the age of 60. The firmest conclusion of this review is that the Alpha VOC comes with a higher relative risk of hospitalization compared to the original wildtype, most likely above 1.4, while unlikely to be above 2, with the balance of evidence being that the relative risk is not significantly modified by age. The evidence for Gamma is more limited, but the odds ratio may be above 2, and potentially much greater than that, especially for those 20-39 years of age. For both VOCs reports on symptomatic ratio differed on whether there was an effect, as well as its potential direction.","Schroeder, A.; MacLeod, M.

Multiple missed opportunities have been identified at every step in the prevention and treatment of CVD, such as failure to make risk factor modifications, failure to diagnose CVD, and failure to use proper evidence-based treatments. With the digital transformation of medicine and advances in health information technology, clinical decision support (CDS) tools offer promise to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of cardiovascular care delivery. Yet, to date, the promise of CDS delivering scalable and sustained value for patient care in clinical practice has not been realized. Here, we review evidence on key emerging questions around the development, implementation, and regulation of CDS with a focus on CVD. We first review evidence on the effectiveness of CDS on patient health and health delivery outcomes related to CVD and features predictive of effectiveness. We then review the barriers encountered during CDS implementation in cardiovascular care with a focus on unintended consequences and strategies to promote successful implementation. Finally, we review the current legal and regulatory environment of CDS with specific examples for CVD.","Lu, Y.; Melnick, E.; Krumholz, H.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.26.21252556v1?rss=1,319
176315,Evaluation of Vicinity-based Hidden Markov Models for Genotype Imputation,2021-09-30,"Abstract In this research, ready-to-print clay was employed to 3D print cylindrical constructs using two different nozzle geometries. The cylinders were printed using a direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printer with similar printing parameters such that the impacts of using different nozzle geometries in contour deviation and mechanical properties of the printed constructs can be quantified. Choosing the right nozzle geometry before printing is critical as it affects the surface finish as well as the mechanical properties of the constructs. This study utilizes point cloud data of the printed samples obtained from a scanning system to measure the contour deviation and surface roughness. According to the results from the point cloud analysis, for cylindrical constructs, circular nozzle imparts less surface roughness and contour deviation whereas square nozzle imparts higher compression strength but with comparatively higher contour deviation and surface roughness. The study provides framework to determine the deviations and mechanical properties of the free form constructs. The work has provided a guideline of nozzle selection in 3D printing of clay constructs for civil infrastructures.","Manikandan, Karthick; Jiang, Xuepeng; Singh, Amit A.; Li, Beiwen; Qin, Hantang",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920316127; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920316127,319

Immunomodulatory treatments have been repurposed to improve mortality outcomes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic health records across the Northwell Health system. COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 1, 2020 and April 15, 2020, were included. Cytokine storm was defined by inflammatory markers: ferritin >700ng/mL, C-reactive protein >30mg/dL, or lactate dehydrogenase >300U/L. Patients were subdivided into six groups -no immunomodulatory treatment (standard of care) and five groups that received either corticosteroids, anti-interleukin 6 (IL-6) antibody (tocilizumab) or anti-IL-1 therapy (anakinra) alone or in combination with corticosteroids. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Results: There were 3,098 patients who met inclusion criteria. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (40-56%), diabetes (32-43%) and cardiovascular disease (2-15%). Patients most frequently met criteria with high lactate dehydrogenase (74.8%) alone, or in combination, followed by ferritin (71.4%) and C-reactive protein (9.4%). More than 80% of patients had an elevated D-dimer. Patients treated with a combination of tocilizumab and corticosteroids (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.459, 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.295-0.714; p<0.0001) or corticosteroids alone (HR: 0.696, 95% CI: 0.512-0.946; p=0.01) had improved hospital survival compared to standard of care. Corticosteroids and tocilizumab was associated with increased survival when compared to corticosteroids and anakinra (HR: 0.612, 95% CI: 0.391-0.958; p-value=0.02). Conclusions: When compared to standard of care, corticosteroid and tocilizumab used in combination, or corticosteroids alone, was associated with reduced hospital mortality for patients with COVID-19 cytokine storm.","Narain, S.; Stefanov, D.; Chau, A.

Methods: We searched from registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO Clinical Trial Registry, and the EU Clinical Trial Registry) and databases (MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Proquest, and Springer) up until June 20, 2021. Articles were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria after duplicates were removed. Infection rate, maternal antibody response, placental antibody transfer, and adverse events were described. This systematic review was performed with quality assessment and semi-quantitative synthesis according to PRISMA guidelines. Results: Twelve observational studies with a total of 40.509 pregnant women included. The mRNA based vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can prevent future SARS-CoV-2 infections (p=0.0004). Both vaccines did not affect pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes. The most commonly encountered adverse reactions are injection-site pain, fatigue, and headache but only transient. Antibody responses were rapid after the prime dose of vaccines. After booster, antibody responses were higher and associated with better placental antibody transfer. Longer intervals between first vaccination dose and delivery were also associated with higher antibody fetal IgG and better antibody transfer ratio. Conclusions: The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are efficacious for preventing future SARS-CoV-2 infections. These vaccines can be considered as a safe option for pregnancy and their fetus. Two doses of vaccines were recommended for more robust maternal and fetal antibody responses. Longer latency was associated with higher fetal antibody responses.","Pratama, N. R.; Wafa, I.

179279,Towards a Collective Agenda on AI for Earth Science Data Analysis,2021-04-11,"Background: Early diagnosis and management of patients with inflammatory arthritis(IA) are critical to improve long-term patient-outcomes. Assessment of joint swelling at joint examination is the reference of IA-identification;early access clinics are constructed to promote this early recognition of IA. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the face-to-face capacity of such services is severely reduced. The accuracy of patient-reported swelling in comparison to joint examination has been extensively evaluated in established RA (ρ 0.31-0.67), but not in patients suspected for IA.[1] Objectives: To promote evidence based care in the era of telemedicine, we determined the accuracy of patient-reported joint swelling for actual presence of IA in persons suspected of IA by general practitioners(GP). Methods: Data from two Dutch Early Arthritis Recognition Clinics were studied. These are screening clinics (1.5-lines-setting) where GPs send patients in case of doubt on IA. At this clinic patients were asked to mark the presence of swollen joints on a mannequin with 52 joints. For this study the DIP joints and the metatarsal joints were excluded and, therefore, a total of 42 joints were assessed for self-reported joint swelling. Clinically apparent IA of ≥1 joint determined by the physician was the reference to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+,LR-), and positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) on patient-level. Pearson correlation coefficients(ρ) were determined. Predictive values depend on the prevalence of a disease in a population. Because the prevalence of IA in a 1.5-lines-setting will differ from a primary care setting, post-test probabilities of IA were estimated for two lower prior-test probabilities as example, namely 20% (estimated probability in patients GPs belief IA is likely) and 2% (prior-test probability with less preselection by GPs), using likelihood ratios and nomograms. Results: A total of 1637 consecutive patients were studied. Median symptom duration was 13 weeks. 76% of patients marked ≥1swollen joint at the mannequin. 41% of patients had ≥1swollen joint at examination by rheumatologists. ρ was 0.20(patient-level)-0.26(joint-level). The sensitivity of patients-reported joint swelling was high, 87%, indicating that the majority of patients with IA had marked swelling on the mannequin. However the specificity was 31%, indicating that 69% of persons without IA had also done so. The LR+ was 1.25;the LR-0.43. The PPV was 46%, the NPV 77%. Thus the PPV increased hardly (from 41% to 46%) and the NPV somewhat (from 59% to 77%). Also in settings with prior-test probabilities of 20% and 2%, estimated PPVs (from respectively 20% and 2% to 24% and 2%) and NPVs (from respectively 80% and 98% to 90% and 99%) hardly increased. Conclusion: Patient-reported joint swelling had little value in distinguishing patients with/without IA for different prior-test probabilities, and is less valuable in comparison to self-reported flare detection in established RA.","Rogier, C.; Van Dijk, B.; Brouwer, E.; De Jong, P.; Van Der Helm-Van Mil, A.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-eular.235,319

Thus, in the decades before Simmel’s essay, this stranger type was already a well-developed figure related to the so-called Jewish question. Georg Brandes and Henrik Pontoppidan used the Jewish stranger to evaluate the societal changes of the fin-de-siècle period and questions of progress vs. decay. Yet, their work limited the stranger to a specific type of Jewishness not including other marginal existences.

Thus, we aimed to develop new taxonomy based on PolyA. Two-hundred and fifty-four consecutive patients were included with rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n:146), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, n:45), Sjogrens syndrome (SS, n:29), autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD, n:17) and systemic sclerosis (SSc, n:17). Clinical features, autoantigen array chip, lymphocytes immunophenotype and cytokine profile were assessed simultaneously. The coexistence of two or more ADs with classification criteria was termed Overt PolyA, whereas the presence of autoantibodies unrelated to the index AD, without criteria fulfillment, was named Latent PolyA. Combination of IgG autoantibodies yielded high accuracy for classification of ADs. In SLE, Histone H2A, Sm/RNP, ssDNA, and dsDNA IgG autoantibodies were the most predictive autoantibodies for this condition. Laminin, Ro/SSA (52 kDa), and U1-snRNP B/B for SS; Thyroglobulin for AITD; Ribo Phosphoprotein P1, and CENP-A for SSc. Interestingly, Thyroglobulin and U1-snRNP B/B' were mutual diagnostic biomarkers in SS and SSc. Latent PolyA showed in nearly 70% of patients, whereas overt PolyA was most common in AITD (82.4%) and SLE (40%). Cluster analysis based on autoantibodies yielded three clusters of which clusters 2 and 3 exhibited high frequency of latent and overt PolyA with distinctive clinical and immunological phenotypes.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the feature of the haptics simulator in comparison with a conventional mannequin simulator by analyzing the assessment of products prepared by dental students using these two kinds of simulator. Materials and methods The subjects were 30 students in the sixth-year classes of the faculty of dentistry. Abutments for a full cast crown were prepared by each subject using two kinds of simulator;one is the haptics simulator and the other is a mannequin simulator. For the resulted products, occlusal surface form, margin design, surface smoothness, taper angle, total cut volume and overall impression were rated by 3 evaluators. Score differences between two simulators were statistically analyzed. Results The kinds of simulator affected subject performance for margin design and total cut volume. The differences in cutting feeling between the simulators as well as variation of stereoscopic ability in subjects were considerable reasons. Evaluators’ rating was affected by difference in simulators for occlusal surface form, total cut volume, and overall impression. This may have been due to variation of stereoscopic ability in evaluators. Conclusion The unique characteristics of virtual reality, such as the simulated cutting sensation and the simulated three-dimensional images created by stereo viewers, affect operators’ performance and evaluators’ rating.

The present study describes 94 infections (47.9% symptomatic, 52.1% asymptomatic), occurred in Lazio Region (Central Italy) in the first trimester 2021, after first or second dose of mRNA BNT162b2 vaccine. Median viral load at diagnosis was independent from number and time of vaccine dose administration, despite the higher proportion of samples with low viral load observed in fully vaccinated individuals. More importantly, infectious virus was cultured from NPS collected from both asymptomatic and symptomatic vaccinated individuals, suggesting that, at least in principle, they can transmit the infection to susceptible people. The majority of the post-vaccine infections here reported, showed pauci/asymptomatic clinical course, confirming the impact of vaccination on COVID-19 disease. Most cases (78%) showed infection in presence of neutralizing antibodies at the time of infection diagnosis, presumably attributable to vaccination, due to the concomitant absence of anti-N IgG in most cases. The proportion of post-vaccine infections attributed either to Alpha and Gamma VOCs was similar to the proportion observed in the contemporary unvaccinated population in Lazio region. In addition, mutational analysis did not suggest enrichment of a defined set of Spike protein substitutions depending on the vaccination status. Characterization of host and virus factors associated with vaccine breakthrough, coupled with intensive and continuous monitoring of involved viral strains, is crucial to adopt informed vaccination strategies.","Colavita, F.; Meschi, S.; Gruber, C.

Teachers must be trained to work on university platforms. The study allows us to analyse the current educational problems, which are found in many countries, not only in Ecuador. The research aimed to determine the virtual andragogical competencies of Ecuadorian university education during the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed research approach was used. A quantitative analysis was applied first, followed by a qualitative analysis. The sample selection was participatory and non-probabilistic. The sample consisted of 1003 active higher education teachers in Ecuador. A questionnaire of 106 questions divided into four variables was applied. A multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed. The analyses demonstrated the need to apply four integral competencies. First the teacher must ""Know how to be"", through continuous ICT training. After the teacher has been trained, he/she must ""Know"". This process involves mastering educational technology. After updating knowledge, they must ""Know how to live together"". Develop critical and constructive communication. Then ""Know how to do"" by applying an effective guiding methodology.

182331,Corona: Facing the Unknown and Finding Oneself,2020,"Background: In March 2020, a directive to halt all elective and non-urgent procedures was issued in Ontario, Canada because of COVID-19. The directive caused a temporary slowdown of screening programs including surveillance colonoscopies for colorectal cancer (CRC). Our goal was to determine if there was a difference in patient and tumour characteristics between CRC patients treated surgically prior to the COVID-19 directive compared to CRC patients treated after the slowdown. Methods: CRC resections collected within the Champlain catchment area of eastern Ontario in the six months prior to COVID-19 (August 1, 2019-January 31, 2020) were compared to CRC resections collected in the six months post-COVID-19 slowdown (August 1, 2020-January 31, 2021). Clinical (e.g. gender, patient age, tumour site, clinical presentation) and pathological (tumour size, tumour stage, nodal stage, lymphovascular invasion) features were evaluated using chi-square tests, T-tests and Mann-Whitney tests where appropriate. Results: 343 CRC specimens were identified (175 pre-COVID-19, 168 post-COVID-19 slowdown). CRC patients treated surgically post-COVID-19 slowdown had larger tumours (44 mm vs. 35 mm; p = 0.0048) and were more likely to have presented emergently (24% vs .10%; p < 0.001). While there was a trend towards higher tumour stage, nodal stage, and clinical stage, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Other demographic and pathologic variables including patient gender, age, and tumour site were similar between the two cohorts. Interpretation: The COVID-19 slowdown resulted in a shift in the severity of disease experienced by CRC patients in Ontario. Pandemic planning in the future should consider the long-term consequences to cancer diagnosis and management.","Forse, C. L.; Petkiewicz, S.; Teo, I.; Purgina, B.

182476,Reflections from the team: Co-creating visual media about ecological processes for young people,2021,"Background: The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has imposed considerable restrictions on people's mobility in order to limit infection transmission. Before the COVID -19 pandemic tele-rheumatology was proposed to patients living in remote areas. Currently, the use of telemedicine has increased significantly. We report on the implementation of a telemedicine program for the evaluation and treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases (1). Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate telemedicine as a viable approach for routine follow-up and management of rheumatic disease. Methods: Sixty-six patients were evaluated online by the remote rheumatologist in four weeks. The population of rheumatology patients was evaluated using a IARPLUS platform Information collected included demographic information consisting of age, gender, and primary rheumatologic diagnosis. Results: The average age of patients who were seen was 54 years and 85% of patients were women. The most common disorders included rheumatoid arthritis (22, 33%), axial spondyloarthropathies (7, 11%), and psoriatic arthritis (15,23%), systemic sclerosis (13, 20%), lupus (6, 9%), UCTD (2,3%), Sjogren and fibromyalgia (1, 1.5%). Results: All patients were given recommendations on COVID-19 vaccine administration. Therapy was remodeled in 13 patients (in particular in 5 patients with anemia intravenous iron infusion was scheduled;1 started immunosuppressant therapy for proteinuria, 4 increased methotrexate for disease activity, 2 discontinued Methotrexate for adverse events (hypertransaminasemia), 1 suspended OH-chloroquine due to retinal accumulation;2 biologic-naive patients, after a three-month of waiting due to inability to come to the hospital, started the biologic drug;22 patients received a renewal of the therapeutic plan;25 patients had a regular six-month follow up;2 ticket exemption for illness;13 consultations and/ or laboratory tests (1 pneumological consultation, 1 ophthalmological consultation, 1 request for sacro-iliac MRI, 3 nailfold videocapillaroscopies, 3 FKT, 1 musculotendinous ultrasound, 1 antibodies for celiac disease, 2 antibodies anti Sars-CoV-2). Conclusion: Telemedicine is becoming more prevalent. We report the successful use of this service in evaluation and management of rheumatic diseases in a period with limited access to rheumatologic care. We have shown that patients can be seen, evaluated, and successfully treated with a variety of medications, including biologic agents, and evaluated for both chronic inflammatory arthropaties and connective tissue diseases.","Cuomo, G.; Masini, F.; Gjeloshi, K.; Lubrano, D.; Adinolfi, L.

182633,How to get the best from your appraisal,2021,"Introduction and Aims: Retarding the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection by preventive strategies is the first line of management. Several countries have declared a stringent lock-down in order to enforce social distancing and prevent the spread of infection. This analysis was conducted in an attempt to understand the impact of lock-down on infection and death rates over a period of time. Material and Methods: A validated database was used to generate data related to countries with declared lock-down. Simple regression analysis was conducted to assess the rate of change in infection and death rates. Subsequently, a k-means and hierarchical cluster analysis was done to identify the countries that performed similarly. Sweden and South Korea were included as counties without lock-down in a second-phase cluster analysis. Results: There was a significant 61% and 43% reduction in infection rates 1-week post lock-down in the overall and India cohorts, respectively, supporting its effectiveness. Countries with higher baseline infections and deaths fared poorly compared to those who declared lock-down early on. Sweden and South Korea fared equally well, as most lock-down countries stemmed the growth of infection and death. Conclusion: Lock-down has proven to be an effective strategy is slowing down the SARS-CoV-2 disease progression exponentially. However, lessons need to be learned from Sweden and South Korea on arresting the disease progression without imposing such stringent measures.","GHOSAL, SAMIT; Bhattacharyya, Rahul; Majumder, Milan",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.03.20089649,319

This holds particularly true for countries like Italy where key regulatory competencies for pandemic management are shared between State and regions, but in a context of unfulfilled federal reforms and increasing autonomist drives which hamper intergovernmental loyal cooperation. Based upon this premise, the article critically examines the development of Italian law-making and State-regions financial relations in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

Man-kind is going through humongous fear and dependence on social media like never before. Fear inevitably leads to panic, speculations, and spread of misinformation. Many governments have taken measures to curb the spread of such misinformation for public well being. Besides global measures, to have effective outreach, systems for demographically local languages have an important role to play in this effort. Towards this, we propose an approach to detect fake news about COVID-19 early on from social media, such as tweets, for multiple Indic-Languages besides English. In addition, we also create an annotated dataset of Hindi and Bengali tweet for fake news detection. We propose a BERT based model augmented with additional relevant features extracted from Twitter to identify fake tweets. To expand our approach to multiple Indic languages, we resort to mBERT based model which is fine tuned over created dataset in Hindi and Bengali. We also propose a zero shot learning approach to alleviate the data scarcity issue for such low resource languages. Through rigorous experiments, we show that our approach reaches around 89% F-Score in fake tweet detection which supercedes the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. Moreover, we establish the first benchmark for two Indic-Languages, Hindi and Bengali. Using our annotated data, our model achieves about 79% F-Score in Hindi and 81% F-Score for Bengali Tweets. Our zero shot model achieves about 81% F-Score in Hindi and 78% F-Score for Bengali Tweets without any annotated data, which clearly indicates the efficacy of our approach. © 2021 IEEE.","Kar, D.; Bhardwaj, M.; Samanta, S.; Azad, A.

185902,Use of a ray-based reconstruction algorithm to accurately quantify preclinical microSPECT images.,2014,"Abstract Soft electrothermal actuators have attracted wide attention due to their high flexibility, adaptability and light weight. These characteristics give them great potentials to be used in biomimetic and soft robotics applications. In this paper, an electrothermal actuator with directly printed microfilament heater was designed, fabricated and characterized. The soft actuator used polyimide (PI) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the structural materials due to their large mismatch of thermal expansion. A microfilament heater was electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printed using a low melting point alloy Bi58/Sn42, and embedded in-between the PI and PDMS layers. The fabricated actuator achieved a maximum curvature of 1.0 cm −1 under a supply voltage as low as 3 V. Resistive self-sensing technology was used to sense the deflection of the actuator and to develop the closed-loop control of the actuator. The bending curvature of the actuator is resulted from the temperature change of the actuator, which can be detected by the electrical resistance change of the embedded heater as they are linearly related. A PID controller was designed for the closed-loop operation of the actuator. Compared with the open-loop operation, the closed-loop controlled actuator demonstrated more rapid and precise response. The developed electrothermal actuator was successfully demonstrated for applications as a soft lifter and soft gripper.","Cao, Yang; Dong, Jingyan",Procedia Manufacturing,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2351978920314670; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2351978920314670,319

MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a cross-sectional survey conducted at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020). The study sample was derived from the Columbia University College of Dental Medicine Alumni network, which included the graduating classes between 1975 and 2015. Active dental practitioners were surveyed regarding changes to their current operations and protective safety measures through a 22 closed-ended questionnaire-based survey. RESULTS The response rate was 17%. Nearly 70.92% of respondents laid off at least one staff member during the COVID-19 pandemic, 51.80% expressed fear of permanent closure, and 79.43% applied for a small business administration loan. There were no significant associations between the amount of time in practice and the need to lay off staff members, the fear of going out of business, or the rates of application for the small business administration loan. Many practitioners bought at least one device geared toward reducing COVID-19 transmission, such as ultraviolet (UV) lights (26.21%), extraoral suctions (37.31%), and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) air filters (54.55%). CONCLUSION At the peak of the pandemic, the majority of dental providers had to reduce staff and seek financial assistance. Concurrently, many of these practices also invested in new safety equipment with the intention of reducing viral transmission. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE External mouth suctions, commercial air purifiers, and air exchange devices might be useful in the private practice setting. However, financially strained practitioners should recognize that these devices have not currently been proven to be effective against the COVID-19 virus.

Unfortunately, trends in cases and rates of infection have been consistently misunderstood, particularly within the media, due to little, if any, statistical analysis of trends. Critical analysis of data is necessary to determine how to best manage local restrictions, particularly if there are resurgences of infection. As such, researchers have been calling for data-driven, statistical analysis of trends of disease to provide more context and validity for significant policy decisions. Methods This quantitative study sought to explore different statistical methods that can be used to evaluate trend data to improve decision-making and public information on the spread of COVID-19. Analyses were conducted using Spearman's rho, Mann-Whitney U tests, Mann-Kendal tests, and Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests with follow up Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin tests. Results The results indicated a mix of both surprising and expected findings. Variations among COVID case reporting for each day of the week were identified but not deemed significant. Spearman correlation data appeared to perform well in identifying monotonic trend while Mann-Kendal tests appeared to provide the most intelligible results. Conclusions This study provides examples of statistical tools and procedures to more thoroughly examine trends in COVID-19 case rate data. It is advocated that such metrics be made available to health and policy stakeholders for potential use for public health decisions.","Ison, David",International journal of health sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952502/,319

METHODS Demographic, infectological, clinical, radiological, laboratory and virological data of patients treated and followed-up between 1-Jan-1998 and 30-June-2008 were reviewed and analysed. RESULTS 19 children met diagnostic criteria. Their mean age was 6.8 years. A prodromal illness--mostly febrile viral infection, upper respiratory infection or chickenpox--preceded neurological symptoms in 17 patients. All had polysymptomatic encephalopathy, 2 children had spinal symptoms. The cerebrospinal fluid was abnormal in all but one. A viral etiology was definite in 7 and probable in 8 cases. MRI disclosed white matter changes in 18, cortical and deep gray matter in 16, cerebellar in 6, brain stem in 14 and spinal cord changes in 2 cases. Repeat MRI performed mean 4 months later showed complete resolution in 6 and partial resolution in 11 patients. 13 patients received high-dose methylprednisolone, 2 of whom were also treated with plasma exchange and 1 with immunoglobulin. 9 children required mechanical ventilation. 2 patients died, 10 recovered without and 7 with sequelae. 2 patients developed further demyelinating events: multiple sclerosis and multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis, respectively.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the S-protein is an essential determinant of virulence and pathogenicity. Therefore we studied the S-gene as an indicator molecule for selection processes employing two different MHV-JHM variants. First, Lewis-rats were infected with MHV-JHM-Pi, a variant that causes demyelinating disease after several weeks p.i. It was not possible to isolate infectious MHV-JHM-Pi from such rats, although viral proteins were expressed. The S-gene was rescued directly from brain tissue employing RT-PCR technology. The amplicons were sequenced in bulk or at the level of single clones. We detected no evidence for an increase of S-gene mutants during the length of time. Only few mutations were found at the clonal level. The changes were distributed throughout the analysed S-gene fragments without a predilection in their location. The frequency of mutation remained low within a range of 0.03 to 0.5 mutations per thousand nucleotides. As a second approach, we sequenced the S-genes of viruses isolated from brain tissue infected with MHV-JHM-ts43. Infection of adult Lewis rats with that mutant resulted several weeks to months p.i. in demyelinating encephalomyelitis. The S-gene of this virus contains an insertion of 423 bp in the S1 region, which is identical to a polymorphic region described for MHV-4. In contrast to JHM-Pi, infectious MHV-JHM-ts43 was readily to isolate from brain tissue. The S-gene sequences of virus isolated 45-106 days p.i. from diseased rats were identical with that of the input virus. These results show, that during a persistent infection of Lewis-rats the S-gene was highly conserved.","Wege, H; Stühler, A; Lassmann, H; Wege, H",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9782356/,319

The organization and expression of the 3' part of the EAV genome are remarkably similar to those of coronaviruses and toroviruses. The 5'-terminal three-quarters of the genome contain the putative EAV polymerase gene, which also shares a number of features with the corresponding gene of corona- and toroviruses. The gene contains two large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, with an overlap region of 19 nucleotides. The presence of a ""shifty"" heptanucleotide sequence in this region and a downstream RNA pseudoknot structure indicate that ORF1b is probably expressed by ribosomal frameshifting. The frameshift-directing potential of the ORF1a/ORF1b overlap region was demonstrated by using a reporter gene. Moreover, the predicted ORF1b product was found to contain four domains which have been identified in the same relative positions in coronavirus and torovirus ORF1b products. The sequences of the EAV and coronavirus ORF1a proteins were found to be much more diverged. The EAV ORF1a product contains a putative trypsinlike serine protease motif. Our data indicate that EAV, presently considered a togavirus, is evolutionarily related to viruses from the coronaviruslike superfamily.","den Boon, J A; Snijder, E J; Chirnside, E D; de Vries, A A; Horzinek, M C; Spaan, W J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1851863/,319

Immune defence mechanisms are critical in recovery from most respiratory infections but the role of the immune system in causing bystander lung injury is not as well understood, and will be the focus of this review. Immune-mediated injury results from physical occlusion of the airways or the ensuing 'cytokine storm', which may spill over into the systemic circulation and cause devastating consequences. Respiratory pathogens employ numerous strategies to avoid detection by the immune system. One of these, the alteration of key surface determinants, makes the design of rational vaccines problematic. In the following review the immune compartments responsible for clinical lung disease are discussed, and current and novel strategies to reduce their potency are overviewed.","Snelgrove, Robert; Williams, Andrew; Thorpe, Callum; Hussell, Tracy",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15482206/,319

They also suggest that depression may constitute a risk factor for the development of dementia, especially in atypical patients who have high rates of hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis disorders. This study aimed to search for correlations among Dexamethasone Suppression Test (DST) cortisol levels, thyroid indices, and family history of dementia in patients with depression. METHODS A sample of 30 patients, aged 21 to 60 years and suffering from major depression according to DSM-IV criteria, took part in the study. Three had a family history of dementia in first-degree relatives. We measured their serum levels of free T3, free T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid binding inhibitory immunoglobulines, thyroglobulin antibodies, and thyroid microsomal antibodies (TMAs). We applied the 1-mg DST to all patients. The statistical analysis included 1-way multivariate analysis of covariance using t tests as the post hoc tests. RESULTS Significantly higher levels of TMAs were found in patients with a family history of dementia, compared with those who did not have this family history. CONCLUSION The results of this study suggest that a more pronounced autoimmune process may characterize depression patients with a family history of dementia.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Kaprinis, Stergios G; Iacovides, Apostolos; Phokas, Konstantinos; Kaprinis, George",Canadian journal of psychiatry.

To examine the impact of SARS on the medical students in a private medical university, a self-reporting questionnaire study was carried out to assess the factual knowledge, anxiety level and perception of the crisis, among the students. The two-week study (between 12 and 23 May, 2003) was carried out three weeks after the first reported SARS-related death in Malaysia. Ninety-one Phase I (junior) and 113 Phase II (senior) students completed the questionnaires. A large majority of students of Phase I and II were correct in their factual knowledge and were sensible in their perception of the future and the handling of the crisis by government(s). However, phase 1 students expressed significantly greater degree of anxiety compared to Phase II in relation to attendance and personal protection in hospital, and in meeting people coughing in public places. The lesser degree of anxiety expressed by phase II senior students may be due in part, to a more realistic assessment of SARS risk brought about by maturity, time spent in hospital and interaction with clinical lecturers and medical staff.","Loh, Li-Cher; Ali, Anita Mohd; Ang, Ter-Hoay; Chelliah, Ambiga",The Malaysian journal of medical sciences : MJMS,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22605957/,319

This emerging disease has caused an unexpected turn in the economy and in society, which has led to the necessity of social isolation and confinement. Diabetic foot consultation was affected by the ongoing situation. The aim of this study was to compare the number of medical visits and the severity of new lesions at presentation at the Diabetic Foot Unit during June 2020 compared to June 2019. Three hundred and fifty six medical visits were analyzed, resulting in a 29% reduction in the number of visits during 2020. The number of patients presenting with new lesions increased from 6.4% to 10.3% (p = ns) during pandemic. The number of visits from the patients' relatives was higher during June 2020 (16.3% vs. 1.4%) (p < 0.05). Controls of feet without active lesions (i.e.: closed wound or periodic control) decreased from 16.8% to 4.5% (p < 0.05). Consultation for medical prescription only was higher in 2020 (22.4%) than in 2019 (7.3%) (p < 0.05). In our sample, there were no significant differences in the severity of new lesions at presentation or on the days of evolution of new ones in comparison with the previous year. During 2020, telehealth consults represented a 7% of all medical visits. There were no major amputations during 2019 and 4 during 2020.

In 2014, we detected HPeV from 38 patients by real-time reverse transcription-PCR in Osaka City, Japan, and 33 HPeV strains were genotyped based on their VP1 sequences. HPeV genotype 3 (HPeV-3) was the most prevalent and accounted for 22 cases (66.7%) followed by nine HPeV-1 (27.3%), one HPeV-2 (3.0%) and one HPeV-4 (3.0%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that detected HPeV-3 strains were divided into three genetically distinct groups. One was characterized by a novel single amino acid deletion mutation at the N terminus of the 2A protein as well as the VP1 sequence, whereas the others were closely related to HPeV-3 strains detected in Japan in either 2008 or 2011. These HPeV-3 groups were detected from patients with various symptoms including three myositis cases. Recent papers have demonstrated that HPeV-3 was the aetiological agent for epidemic myalgia exclusively among adults from Yamagata Prefecture in Japan. Here, we provide clinical details and episodes of three myositis patients including an adult and two children in Osaka City, Japan. Our results suggest that HPeV-3 is a causative agent of myositis not only in adults but also in children.","Yamamoto, Seiji P; Kaida, Atsushi; Naito, Takuto; Hosaka, Taisuke; Miyazato, Yusuke; Sumimoto, Shin-ichi; Kohdera, Urara; Ono, Atsushi; Kubo, Hideyuki; Iritani, Nobuhiro",Journal of medical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358716/,319

Fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assays combine RT-PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, thereby eliminating post-PCR processing and potentially enhancing specificity. Consequently, a fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assay specific for rodent coronaviruses was developed. Primer and probe sequences were selected from the viral genome segment that encodes the membrane (M) protein that is highly conserved among rodent coronaviruses. Use of the fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR detected all strains of MHV and RCV that were evaluated, but did not detect other RNA viruses that naturally infect rodents. Use of the assay detected as little as two femtograms of in vitro transcribed RNA generated from cloned amplicon, and when compared directly with mouse antibody production tests, had similar sensitivity at detecting MHV-A59 in infected cell culture lysates. Finally, use of the assay detected coronavirus RNA in tissues, cage swipes, and feces obtained from mice experimentally infected with MHV, and in tissues and cage swipes obtained from rats naturally infected with RCV. These results indicate that the fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assay should provide a potentially high-throughput, PCR-based method to detect rodent coronaviruses in infected rodents and contaminated biological materials.","Besselsen, David G; Wagner, April M; Loganbill, Jessie K",Comparative medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12022389/,319

Despite this relative simplicity, the molecular regulation of SARS-CoV replication and assembly is not understood. Here, we report that two viral genes, encoding the SARS-CoV membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins, are necessary and sufficient for formation of virus-like particles. Expression vectors encoding these two proteins were synthesized by using preferred human codons. When M and N expression plasmids were cotransfected into human 293 renal epithelial cells, pseudoparticles formed readily. The addition of a third gene, encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein, facilitated budding of particles that contained a corona-like halo resembling SARS-CoV when examined by transmission electron microscopy, with a buoyant density characteristic of coronaviruses. Specific biochemical interactions of these proteins were also shown in vitro. The S, M, and N proteins of the SARS-CoV are, therefore, necessary and sufficient for pseudovirus assembly. These findings advance the understanding of the morphogenesis of SARS-CoV and enable the generation of safe, conformational mimetics of the SARS virus that may facilitate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Huang, Yue; Yang, Zhi-yong; Kong, Wing-pui; Nabel, Gary J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15507643/,319

The same is true for myriad other dangerous infectious diseases to which the world is currently susceptible. One proposal that might prevent outbreaks of this scale and magnitude from recurring would be to have the World Health Organization (WHO) and its technical partners assess which of its member states are at high risk for a disease, either directly or indirectly, and facilitate the creation of international governmental risk pools of those member states. Risk pools would offer open-indexed grant contracts to fund vaccine and drug development for a particular disease, and pharmaceutical companies could browse the index to apply for these grants. If the risk-pool states and a particular company sign a contract, a mutually agreed upon amount of the vaccine or drug would be produced at a below-market purchase price for those states. In return, the company would keep any patents or intellectual property rights for the developed vaccines or drugs. Risk-pool countries that did not use their vaccine or drug could resell that supply on secondary markets to other countries outside of the risk pool. This arrangement will increase the supply of tested drug and vaccine candidates available for combatting unexpected outbreaks of any previously discovered major infectious disease in the future.","Erfe, J Mark",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25506281/,319

Pre- and postinoculation serum samples were collected from all animals during the course of the study and evaluated for antibody titers to SDA virus. All experimental, control and sentinel animals, following inoculation with SDA virus, were necropsied and examined for lesions consistent with SDA. Salivary gland lesions were minimal to absent in rats reinfected with SDA virus for up to 12 to 15 months after the initial exposure and minimal to moderate in the respiratory tract at 12 or 15 months. SDA-associated lesions were extensive in age matched control animals examined at each time period of reinfection with SDA virus. Thus, prior exposure to SDA virus did protect against the development of typical salivary gland lesions for up to 15 months. Recovered animals were evaluated for their ability to transmit the virus following reinfection. Rats reinfected at 6 or 9 months were infectious to their naive cage mates. The results indicate that reinfection with homologous rat coronavirus can occur as early as 6 months after the initial infection, and such rats can transmit the infection to contact controls.","Percy, D H; Bond, S J; Paturzo, F X; Bhatt, P N",Laboratory animal science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2157092/,319

METHODS 250 dental patients were interviewed by questionnaire and 213 were interviewed by phone. RESULTS Less than one-third (30.0%) of the 463 respondents said they were not afraid of contracting the SARS coronavirus from their dentists and did not avoid dental treatment for that reason. Nearly three-fifths (56.7%) did not worry about contracting SARS from dental treatment. Fewer than 10% of the respondents thought that dentists ran a high risk of contracting SARS. From the patients' experiences, 85.2% and 21.7% of the dentists wore face masks and face shields, respectively, when delivering dental treatment. CONCLUSIONS The majority of patients interviewed had confidence in their dentists, their treatment environments, and the infection control measures taken, and were not worried about contracting SARS in the dental setting. This perception is an improvement from that described in an earlier study, in which more than half of the patients were concerned about contracting an infection during dental treatment and perceived that the infection control measures undertaken by the dental profession to prevent infectious diseases were not satisfactory. Patients, however, demanded better infection control measures during the SARS outbreak.","Yip, H K; Tsang, P C S; Samaranayake, L P; Li, A H P",Community dental health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17405470/,319

The hypothesis was that less investment in the public health system, the number of doctors per inhabitant and the number of hospital beds available to the population led to a higher number of deaths after the arrival of COVID-19 in each country studied. The objective was to analyze the relationship between the number of deaths from COVID-19 in the global pandemic declared since December 2019 and health policies and investment in European countries. METHODS A research study was conducted in which a total of six variables were analyzed with official and contrasted data: public health expenditure per capita; doctors per 1,000 inhabitants; number of beds per 1,000 people; deaths from COVID-19 per million inhabitants; number of tests to detect COVID-19 per 1,000 inhabitants; and GINI Coefficient to measure the degree of social inequality in each country. It was carried out in 30 European countries. Frequency and correlation analyses were carried out (Pearson). RESULTS Five countries were found, which gave values above 300 deaths per million (data from April 27, 2020): United Kingdom; (305.39), France (350.16), Italy (440.67), Spain (495.99) and Belgium (612.1). Precisely, in the countries that recorded the most deaths (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain and Belgium) on April 27, we did not find high values of TEST performance. In our analysis, we found that the lower the investment of public spending in health (per capita), the higher the number of deaths per COVID-19 per million inhabitants, the lower the coverage of hospital beds, and the lower the number of doctors. Finally, we found that the lower the expenditure on public health, the higher the GINI coefficient (thus greater social inequality). CONCLUSIONS A negative effect in terms of deaths was detected when investment in public health was lower; the higher number of deaths from COVID-19 was correlated (p<0.005) with greater social inequality (GINI coefficient) and with lower investment in public health (p<0.001); this had an impact on the lower number of available beds and low physician coverage per 1,000 inhabitants.","Barrera-Algarín, Evaristo; Estepa-Maestre, Francisco; Sarasola-Sánchez-Serrano, José Luís; Vallejo-Andrada, Ana",Revista espanola de salud publica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111713/,319

Given the lack of antiviral therapies or vaccines for the disease, the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) obtained much attention as a treatment for COVID-19. However, there are limited and uncertain clinical data to support the beneficial effect of this drug in COVID-19 treatment. HCQ has several side effects and warnings, including blindness, heart failure, and renal toxicity, even with recommended doses. For severe cases of COVID-19 or in patients with preexisting conditions, administering such a drug could be fatal, particularly when taken at high doses or in combination with other antibiotics.

203628,Sound-induced morphogenesis of multicellular systems for rapid orchestration of vascular networks,2020,"In recent years computed tomography of the lungs has been the most common diagnostic procedure aimed at detection of the pathological changes associated with COVID-19. The study is aimed at the use of the developed algorithmic support in combination with texture (geometric) analysis to highlight a number of indicators characterizing the clinical state of the object of interest. Processing is aimed at the solution of a number of diagnostic tasks such as highlighting and contrasting the objects of interest, taking into account the color coding. Further, an assessment is performed according to the appropriate criteria in order to find out the nature of the changes and increase both the visualization of pathological changes and the accuracy of the X-ray diagnostic report. For these purposes, it is proposed to use preprocessing algorithms for a series of images in dynamics. Segmentation of the lungs and areas of possible pathology are performed using wavelet transform and Otsu threshold value. Delta-maps and maps obtained using Shearlet transform with contrasting color coding are used as a means of visualization and selection of features (markers). The analysis of the experimental and clinical material carried out in the work shows the effectiveness of the proposed combination of methods for studying of the variability of the internal geometric features (markers) of the object of interest in the images. © Authors 2021.

204396,Adherence of Burn Outpatient Clinic Referrals to ABA Criteria in a Tertiary Centre: Creating Unnecessary Referrals?,2021,"Purpose of Review: Kumbh Mela, a religious gathering of Hindus held in India, is the largest massive gathering event in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented healthcare crisis in recent times with effects reverberating in all spheres of human lives. India has registered the second highest number of COVID-19 cases. This paper aims to dwell in the religious and social background of Kumbh Mela massive gathering, as well as the ritualistic practices that could potentially entail public health risks in the current situation. It also aims to identify possible preparatory and interventional measures to evade such risks. Recent Findings: In recent years, the increase in the number of people attending the Kumbh Mela has been phenomenal. Congregants are put up at the holy sites for several days. The sheer number of people assembling at the religious venues poses a great challenge to manage the crowds, to cater to the requirements of basic amenities, and to meet their healthcare needs. Some of the ritualistic practices could heighten the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens. The COVID-19 pandemic has escalated over the past few months in India. The pandemic is expected to sustain its tempo in India throughout the foreseeable future. Organization of the forthcoming Kumbh Mela needs meticulous planning. Summary: Kumbh Mela is a Hindu religious gathering at the banks of India's rivers, held periodically. It witnesses assembly of huge numbers of people and has the potential to amplify the COVID-19 pandemic in India; this could overwhelm the healthcare system.","Quadri, Sayed A; Padala, Prasad R",Curr Trop Med Rep,,319
204562,SRLGRN: Semantic Role Labeling Graph Reasoning Network,2020-10-07,"In March 2020, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, the UK Government imposed social and physical distancing measures on the population. These lockdown measures caused significant changes to all aspects of daily life. The current study examined how the passage of time was distorted during the lockdown period. Using an online questionnaire, day and week passage of time judgments were collected. In addition, measures of affect, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction were taken. The results show that over 80% of participants experienced distortion to the passage of time during lockdown in comparison with normal. The passage of time during the day was predicted by age, stress, task load and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction. A slowing of the passage of time was associated with increasing age, increasing stress, reduced task load and reduced satisfaction with current levels of social interaction. Only age and satisfaction with current levels of social interaction predicted passage of time across a week. Again, increasing age and reduced satisfaction with levels of social interaction were associated with a slowing of the passage of time. These findings demonstrate that significant changes to daily life have a significant impact on our experience of time, with younger, more socially satisfied people more likely to experience time as passing more quickly during the lockdown.","Ogden, Ruth S",PLoS One,,319

In this study, I assembled a dataset of 319 viral overlapping genes, which included 82 overlaps whose expression is experimentally known and the respective 237 homologs. Principal component analysis revealed that overlapping genes have a common pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Discriminant analysis separated overlapping from non-overlapping genes with an accuracy of 97%. When applied to overlapping genes with known genealogy, it separated ancestral from de novo frames with an accuracy close to 100%. This high discriminant power was crucial to computationally design variants of de novo viral proteins known to possess selective anticancer toxicity (apoptin) or protection against neurodegeneration (X protein), as well as to detect two new potential overlapping genes in the genome of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.","Pavesi, Angelo",Virology,,319

DESIGN: Rapid online survey. Participants completed a series of online questionnaires regarding hearing ability, socialisation (pre- and during-pandemic), loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive function. STUDY SAMPLE: A total of 80 participants over the age of 70 with access to the internet. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in socialisation levels from pre-pandemic in this population. Hearing difficulties were significantly associated with greater levels of loneliness, depression and self-perceived cognitive dysfunction after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. Additionally, compared to pre-pandemic, people with hearing difficulties had increased odds of reporting worsened anxiety, depression, and memory during the COVID-19 pandemic, although only the effect of hearing difficulties on the change in memory reached statistical significance after controlling for age, gender, and level of education. CONCLUSIONS: The worse the self-reported hearing abilities are, the greater the negative impact of enforced social distancing on depression, loneliness and cognitive function.","Littlejohn, Jenna; Venneri, Annalena; Marsden, Antonia; Plack, Christopher J",Int J Audiol,,319

On many sides - by politicians, commentators, scientists - there have been attempts to give the COVID-19 pandemic event the meaning of Black Swan. In reality, one should wonder if the Black Swan was not, instead (or even), the way the epidemic was handled. In Italy, an unreasonable use of a two-step protocol - IgM/IgG anti-COVID followed by RT-PCR in the serologically positive only has caused considerable uncertainty, particularly relevant in measures for maintenance or readmission to work of health personnel. This protocol could be affected by serious uncertainties arising from the analytical limitations of the tests used. To quantify this defect, we evaluated the analytical specifications of serological tests under different prevalence conditions. In conclusion, although laboratory diagnostics represent a useful tool, it can only be used for epidemiological purposes and not to provide healthy pass.","Fiorini, Marcello; LA Gioia, Antonio",J Prev Med Hyg,,319

The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of arrhythmias in COVID-19 patients in the Shahid Mostafa Khomeini Hospital of Ilam from March to August 2020. Materials and Methods: In this descriptive-analytical study, all the COVID-19 patients with a cardiac condition admitted to the intensive care unit were enrolled by census. Electrocardiography (ECG) and Holter monitoring were used to diagnose arrhythmias. Data analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel using descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). Results: The total number of eligible patients was 45, of whom 26 (57.8%) were men, and 19 (42.2%) were women. The mortality rate of arrhythmias among COVID-19 patients was 17.77% (8 out of 45 patients), and the recovery rate was 82.13% (37 out of 45 patients). Conclusion: Tachycardia and the lack of response to heart rate reducing drug be observed in patients with COVID-19.Owing to an overlap between these symptoms and those of heart diseases, there is a need to further evaluate patients with arrhythmias. Although arrhythmias are not common in COVID-19 patients, they can be fatal and inflict a high mortality rate, which can be prevented by early detection.","Mohammadyari, Elham; Ahmadi, Iraj; Mohammadyari, Anis; Tavan, Hamed; Norozi, Siros",New Microbes New Infect,,319

An increase in arterial stiffness with advanced age has been reported in many publications. The aim of the present review is to summarize current information about possible chemical reactions and physical processes that lead to tissue stiffening and result in age-related diseases in order to find methods that can prevent or retard time-dependent tissue stiffening. The analysis of published data shows that bound water acts as a plasticizer of biological tissues, a decrease in bound water content results in an increase in biological tissue stiffness, and increased tissue stiffness leads to NF-kB activation and triggered actin polymerization-NF-kB activation is associated with age-related diseases. It can be suggested that changes in bound water content through changing tissue stiffness can affect cellular processes and the development of pathologies related to aging. Both age-related diseases and COVID-19 may be associated with tight-junction disruption and increased tissue stiffness and permeability.","Kerch, Garry",,,319

210585,Words matter,2020,"BACKGROUND: New evidence from retrospective cohort studies on risk of death from COVID-19 infection became available. We aimed to systematically review the clinical risk factors for fatal outcome of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed meta-analysis, using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases from December 1 2019 to June 10 2020. The meta-analysis summarized clinical, laboratory, radiological features, and complications of non-survivors with confirmed COVID-19. In addition, a fixed- or random-effects model was adopted based on the heterogeneity among studies. We also used funnel-plot with Egger's tests to screen potential publication bias. RESULTS: In total, twenty studies with 15,408 COVID-19 cases were included in our meta-analysis. Male, current smoking, and older age were associated with in-hospital death. Patients aged 60 years or over had the highest pooled ORs [OR 4.94 (2.89, 8.44)]. Non-survivors were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD), respiratory disease, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). Respiratory disease had the highest pooled ORs [OR 2.55 (2.14, 3.05)]. Dyspnea [OR 3.31 (1.78, 6.16); I2 : 83%] and fatigue [OR 1.36 (1.07, 1.73); I2 : 0%] were associated with increased risk of death. Increased white blood cell count, decreased lymphocyte and platelet counts, were also associated with increased risk of death. Biomarkers of coagulation function, inflammation, liver and kidney function, cardiac and muscle injury were also elevated in nonsurvivors. CONCLUSIONS: Male, current smoking patients aged 60 years or over might face a greater risk of in-hospital death and the comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, CVD, respiratory disease, and CKD could also influence the prognosis of the COVID-19. Clinical feature such as dyspnea and fatigue could imply the exacerbation and even death. Our findings highlighted early markers of mortality which were beneficial to identify fatal COVID-19.","Xiang, Guiling; Xie, Liang; Chen, Zhihong; Hao, Shengyu; Fu, Cuiping; Wu, Qinhan; Liu, Xuhui; Li, Shanqun",Ann. palliat. med.

To correlate biological data with configuration, all four ifenprodil stereoisomers were prepared by diastereoselective reduction and subsequent separation of enantiomers by chiral HPLC. The absolute configuration of ifenprodil stereoisomers was determined by X-ray crystal structure analysis of (1R,2S)-1a and (1S,2S)-1d. GluN2B affinity, ion channel inhibitory activity, and selectivity over &#945;, &#963;, and 5-HT receptors were evaluated. (1R,2R)-Ifenprodil ((1R,2R)-1c) showed the highest affinity toward GluN2B-NMDA receptors (Ki = 5.8 nM) and high inhibition of ion flux in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments (IC50 = 223 nM). Whereas the configuration did not influence considerably the GluN2B-NMDA receptor binding, (1R)-configuration is crucial for elevated inhibitory activity.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing has been imposed by the curfew program in Jordan. AIM: To evaluate the effects of social distancing on the social relationships of the Jordanian population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between the 6th and the 30th of May, 2020. Our questionnaire was constructed to explore the population's perception of the quarantine period, how it is affecting their relationship with others, and the characteristics of their social relationships and communication with various population categories, including family members and work colleagues. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of better social relationships and communication. RESULTS: A total of 4,301 participants were involved in this study. The average score of the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on social relationships among the whole study population was 5.68 (SD: 2.33) out of 10 (equal to 56.8%), which indicates the marginal strength of the social relationships. Around 31.6% of the participants reported that their social relationships were affected to a high degree by the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants who were aged 36-45 were positively affected in terms of their social relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic.

This virus can produce from weak to severe respiratory diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), pneumonia and even death in patients. The COVID-19 disease is distributed by inhalation via contaminated droplets or contact with infected environment. The incubation time is from 2 to 14 day and the symptoms are typically fever, sore throat, cough, malaise, fatigue, breathlessness among others. It needs to be considered that many infected people are asymptomatic. Developing various immunological and virological methods to diagnose this disease is supported by several laboratories. Treatment is principally supportive; however, there are several agents that are using in treating of COVID-19 patients. Interferons (IFNs) have shown to be crucial in fighting with COVID-19 disease and can be a suitable candidate in treatment of these patients. Combination therapy can be more effective than monotherapy to cure this disease. Prevention necessitates to be performed by isolation of suspected people and home quarantine as well as taking care to infected people with mild or strict disease at hospitals.

Nurses were confronted with a high workload and an increase in the number of patients per nurse they had to take care of. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to describe differences in the planning of nursing staff on the Intensive Care in the COVID period versus a recent non-COVID period. The secondary aim was to describe differences in nursing workload in COVID-19 patients, pneumonia patients and other patients on the Intensive Care. We finally wanted to assess the cause of possible differences in Nursing Activities Scores between the different groups. METHODS: We analyzed data on nursing staff and nursing workload as measured by the Nursing Activities Score of 3,994 patients and 36,827 different shifts in 6 different hospitals in the Netherlands. We compared data from the COVID-19 period, March 1st 2020 till July 1st 2020, with data in a non-COVID period, March 1st 2019 till July 1st 2019. We analyzed the Nursing Activities Score per patient, the number of patients per nurse and the Nursing Activities Score per nurse in the different cohorts and time periods. Differences were tested by a Chi-square, non-parametric Wilcoxon or Student's t-test dependent on the distribution of the data. RESULTS: Our results showed both a significant higher number of patients per nurse (1.1 versus 1.0, p<0.001) and a significant higher Nursing Activities Score per Intensive Care nurse (76.5 versus 50.0, p<0.001) in the COVID-19 period compared to the non-COVID period. The Nursing Activities Score was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to both the pneumonia patients (55.2 versus 50.0, p<0.001) and the non-COVID patients (55.2 versus 42.6, p<0.001), mainly due to more intense hygienic procedures, mobilization and positioning, support and care for relatives and respiratory care. CONCLUSION: With this study we showed the impact of COVID-19 patients on the planning of nursing care on the Intensive Care. The COVID-19 patients caused a high nursing workload, both in number of patients per nurse and in Nursing Activities Score per nurse.","Hoogendoorn, M E; Brinkman, S; Bosman, R J; Haringman, J; de Keizer, N F; Spijkstra, J J",Int J Nurs Stud,,319

220065,Emergent green technologies for cost-effective valorization of microalgal biomass to renewable fuel products under a biorefinery scheme,2021,"Globally coordinated cessation of all three serotypes of oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) represents a critical part of a successful polio endgame, which the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to conduct in phases, with serotype 2 OPV cessation completed in mid 2016. Although in 2016 the GPEI expected to globally coordinate cessation of the remaining OPV serotypes (1 and 3) by 2021, continuing transmission of serotype 1 wild polioviruses to date makes those plans obsolete. With increasing time since the last reported polio case caused by serotype 3 wild poliovirus (in November 2012) leading to high confidence about its successful global eradication, the Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication recently certified its eradication. Questions now arise about the optimal timing of serotype 3 OPV (OPV3) cessation. Using an integrated global model that characterizes the risks, costs, and benefits of global polio policy and risk management options, we explored the implications of different options for coordinated cessation of OPV3 prior to COVID-19. Globally coordinating cessation of OPV3 as soon as possible offers the opportunity to reduce cases of vaccine-associated paralytic polio globally. In addition, earlier cessation of OPV3 should reduce the risks of creating serotype 3 circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses after OPV3 cessation, which represents a significant threat to the polio endgame given current GPEI plans to reduce preventive OPV supplemental immunization activities starting in 2019.","Kalkowska, Dominika A; Thompson, Kimberly M",Risk Anal,,319

There are opinions that there is a correlation between high IL-6 levels and disease severity. In our intensive care unit, we evaluated the changes in the laboratory data and radiological involvement severity of our patients who underwent tocilizumab treatment and examined the appropriate laboratory parameter in the treatment follow-up and its effect on survival. Methods: In the critical patient follow-up of COVID-19, 17 of the 23 patients treated with tocilizuniab had a mortal course (Group 1) and the remaining 6 (Group 2) were. The C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, IL-6, D-dimer. procalcitonin, albumin. and ferritin values, which were routinely screened in our clinic on the day of tocilizumab treatment and the 5th day after, were recorded. Both the change between the two groups and the change between days 1 and 5 were analyzed. Results: A total of 23 patients (55.35 +/- 13.31 years) were included in the study. The computed tomography severity score assessed at the intensive care unit admission was statistically significantly higher in Group 2. The procalcitonin and lactate dehydrogenase values measured on day 5 after tocilizumab were significantly lower in Group 2. On the 5th day after treatment, the levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, chest X-rays, IL-6 and D-dirner statistically significantly changed compared to the first day of the treatment. In correlation with the decrease in PCT as of the 5th day after tocilizumab administration. an increasing tendency was observed in 28-day survival. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that tocilizumab treatment may positively contribute to the treatment by decreasing cytokine levels. PCT and LDH follow-up before and after treatment in critically ill patients who are receiving tocilizumab treatment can give an idea about survival.","Ciyiltepe, F.; Saracoglu, A.; Bilir, Y.; Deniz, E.

A prospective cohort study was designed to investigate blood viral load and clearance kinetics in 52 patients (median age, 62 years; 31 [59.6%] male) and explore their association with clinical features and outcomes based on a novel one-step RT droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR). By using one-step RT-ddPCR, 92.3% (48 of 52) of this cohort was quantitatively detected with viremia. The concordance between the blood and oropharyngeal swab tests was 60.92% (53 of 87). One-step RT-ddPCR was tested with a 3.03% false-positive rate and lower 50% confidence interval of detection at 54.026 copies/mL plasma. In all critical patients, the blood viral load was not eliminated, whereas the general and severe patients exhibited a similar ability to clear the viral load. The viral loads in critical patients were significantly higher than those in their general and severe counterparts. Among the 52 study patients, 30 (58%) were discharged from the hospital. Among half of the 30 discharged patients, blood viral load remained positive, of which 76.9% (10 of 13) completely cleared their blood viral load at follow-up. Meanwhile, none of their close contacts had evidence of infection. Quantitative determination of the blood viral test is of great clinical significance in the management of patients with coronavirus disease 2019.","Chen, Liting; Wang, Gaoxiang; Long, Xiaolu; Hou, Hongyan; Wei, Jia; Cao, Yang; Tan, Jiaqi; Liu, Weiyong; Huang, Liang; Meng, Fankai; Huang, Lifang; Wang, Na; Zhao, Jianping; Huang, Gang; Sun, Ziyong; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Jianfeng",J. mol. diagn,,319

Through a stochastic age-structured transmission model calibrated to the observed epidemic in Île-de-France in the first wave, we explored scenarios of partial, progressive, or full school reopening. Given the uncertainty on children's role, we found that reopening schools after lockdown may increase COVID-19 cases, yet protocols exist to keep the epidemic controlled. Under a scenario with stable epidemic activity if schools were closed, reopening pre-schools and primary schools would lead to up to 76% [67, 84]% occupation of ICU beds if no other school level reopened, or if middle and high schools reopened later. Immediately reopening all school levels may overwhelm the ICU system. Priority should be given to pre- and primary schools allowing younger children to resume learning and development, whereas full attendance in middle and high schools is not recommended for stable or increasing epidemic activity. Large-scale test and trace is required to keep the epidemic under control. Ex-post assessment shows that progressive reopening of schools, limited attendance, and strong adoption of preventive measures contributed to a decreasing epidemic after lifting the first lockdown.","Di Domenico, Laura; Pullano, Giulia; Sabbatini, Chiara E; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Colizza, Vittoria",Nat Commun,,319

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to examine the dissemination of the Miyara et al study among Twitter users and whether a shift in their attitudes toward smoking occurred after its publication as preprint on April 21, 2020. METHODS: Twitter posts were crawled between April 14 and May 4, 2020, by the Tweepy stream application programming interface, using a COVID-19-related keyword query. After filtering, the final 1929 tweets were classified into three groups: (1) tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study before it was published, (2) tweets that were not related to Miyara et al study after it was published, and (3) tweets that were related to Miyara et al study after it was published. The attitudes toward smoking, as expressed in the tweets, were compared among the above three groups using multinomial logistic regression models in the statistical analysis software R (The R Foundation). RESULTS: Temporal analysis showed a peak in the number of tweets discussing the results from the Miyara et al study right after its publication. Multinomial logistic regression models on sentiment scores showed that the proportion of negative attitudes toward smoking in tweets related to the Miyara et al study after it was published (17.07%) was significantly lower than the proportion in tweets that were not related to the Miyara et al study, either before (44/126, 34.9%; P<.001) or after the Miyara et al study was published (68/198, 34.3%; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The public's attitude toward smoking shifted in a positive direction after the Miyara et al study found a lower incidence of COVID-19 cases among daily smokers.","Tao, Chunliang; Diaz, Destiny; Xie, Zidian; Chen, Long; Li, Dongmei; O039,; Connor, Richard",JMIR Form Res,,319

This study was conducted to assess the Iranian citizens' attitude about some principles and criteria for allocation of ventilators in the current COVID-19 epidemic.Materials and Methods: An electronic self-administered questionnaire was publicly distributed through social networks of Telegram and WhatsApp to perform this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire consisted of 11 statements about the selection and prioritization of patients for the use of a ventilator.Results: 1262 persons, including 767 citizens and 495 health care providers participated in this study. More than 95% of participants agreed upon the necessity to avoid discrimination and avoid prioritization according to patients' gender, economic and political status. While 40.9% of citizens and 49.6% of healthcare workers believed that a ventilator can be disconnected from a patient with a poor prognosis to help another patient who has a better prognosis (P-value = 0.13), 34.3% of people and 29.6% of healthcare workers believed that the earlier admitted patients have the right to receive the device even if the likeliness of his/her survival is less than the next patient (P-value = 0.009).Conclusions: Maximizing health benefits as a measure of ventilator allocation in the pandemic of COVID-19 is an accepted criterion. Meanwhile, periodic evaluation of patients and disconnecting the device from a patient that no longer benefits from ICU services requires its scientific and ethical basis to be brought in public discourse.","Asghari, Fariba; Parsapour, Alireza; Shamsi Gooshki, Ehsan",AJOB Empir Bioeth,,319

The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the extent of splatter on dental personnel that may occur with AGPs and coughing in a dental anesthesia practice. A Dentoform model was fitted into a dental mannequin and coated with Glo Germ to detect splatter during simulated dental AGPs produced with use of a high-speed handpiece, an ultrasonic scaler, and an air-water syringe, all in conjunction with high-volume suction. A simulated cough was also created using a ventilator programmed to expel Glo Germ within the velocity and volume parameters of a natural cough with dental personnel in their customary positions. A UV light was used after each procedure to systematically evaluate the deposition of Glo Germ splatter on each person. After AGPs were performed, splatter was noted on the face, body, arms, and legs of the dentist and dental assistant. The simulated cough produced more extensive splatter than AGPs; additional Glo Germ was seen on the shoes, the crown of the head, and the back of the dental personnel. Therefore, it is recommended that full personal protective equipment consistent with AGPs be used and changed between patients to reduce the risk of contamination and infection for dental personnel and patients.","Chanpong, Brian; Tang, Michelle; Rosenczweig, Alexander; Lok, Patrick; Tang, Raymond",Anesth Prog,,319

Using the SOMOS COVID-19 Crisis National Latino Survey, we conduct a series of intersectional analyses to understand the extent to which personal experiences with COVID-19, gendered structural factors, and spillover effects of US immigration policies impact the mental health of US Latina/os during a public health emergency. The results show that among Latinas, knowing an undocumented immigrant and someone ill with COVID-19 increases the probability of reporting worse mental outcomes by 52 percent. Furthermore, being a woman increases the probability of reporting the highest level of mental health problems by 30 percent among Hispanic people who know someone with COVID-19 and an undocumented immigrant. These findings indicate that the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak among US Latinas and Latinos are entrenched in gendered and systemic inequalities.","Gomez-Aguinaga, Barbara; Dominguez, Melanie Sayuri; Manzano, Sylvia",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,319
234112,Towards Generative Video Compression,2021-07-26,"The novel coronavirus disease-2019 (Covid-19) public health emergency has caused enormous loss around the world. This pandemic is a concrete example of the existing gap between availability of advanced diagnostics and current need for cost-effective methodology. The advent of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay provided an innovative tool for establishing a rapid diagnostic technique based on the molecular amplification of pathogen RNA or DNA. In this review, we explore the applications, diagnostic effectiveness of LAMP test for molecular diagnosis and surveillance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Our results show that LAMP can be considered as an effective point-of-care test for the diagnosis of Covid-19 in endemic areas, especially for low- and middle-income countries.","Chaouch, Melek",Rev Med Virol,,319
234560,The Futility of Control,2020,"BACKGROUND: The year 2020 has been challenging for many, particularly for young adults who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things. OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September. METHODS: The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual's psychological well-being across the pandemic. RESULTS: Over the course of the pandemic, Lee's depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee's positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=-0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=-0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=-0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors. CONCLUSIONS: We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual's well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.","Lai, Jocelyn; Rahmani, Amir; Yunusova, Asal; Rivera, Alexander P; Labbaf, Sina; Hu, Sirui; Dutt, Nikil; Jain, Ramesh; Borelli, Jessica L",JMIR Form Res,,319

To achieve this purpose, the big data of ""cart search"" demand information provided by small and medium freight enterprises on the freight information platform are analyzed. 343,690 pieces of freight demand big data on the freight information platform and Python, ArcGIS, UCINET, and Gephi software are used. The results show that: (1) The choke-point of unbalanced freight demand network is Wuhan, and the secondary choke-points are Hefei and Zhengzhou. (2) In southern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Wuhan, Hefei, and Nanchang as the centers. In northern China, a chain reaction circle of freight imbalance is formed with Zhengzhou and Taiyuan as the centers. (3) The freight demand of the six provinces in central China exhibits typical characteristics of long tail distribution with large span and unbalanced distribution. (4) The import and export of freight in different cities vary greatly, and the distribution is unbalanced. This study indicates the imbalance difference, chain reaction, keys and hidden troubles posed by the freight demand network. From the perspectives of freight transfer breakout, freight balance breakout, freight strength breakout, and breakout of freight periphery cities, we propose solutions to breakouts in the freight market in six provinces of central China in the post-epidemic era.","Huang, Yin; Liu, Runda; Huang, Shumin; Yang, Gege; Zhang, Xiaofan; Qin, Yin; Mao, Lisha; Sheng, Sishi; Huang, Biao",PLoS One,,319
237786,Moving academic conferences online: Understanding patterns of delegate engagement,2021,"Salmonella is a leading cause of foodborne illness (i.e., salmonellosis) outbreaks, which on occasion are attributed to ground turkey. The poultry industry uses Salmonella prevalence as an indicator of food safety. However, Salmonella prevalence is only one of several factors that determine risk of salmonellosis. Consequently, a model for predicting risk of salmonellosis from individual lots of ground turkey as a function of Salmonella prevalence and other risk factors was developed. Data for Salmonella contamination (prevalence, number, and serotype) of ground turkey were collected at meal preparation. Scenario analysis was used to evaluate effects of model variables on risk of salmonellosis. Epidemiological data were used to simulate Salmonella serotype virulence in a dose-response model that was based on human outbreak and feeding trial data. Salmonella prevalence was 26% (n = 100) per 25 g of ground turkey, whereas Salmonella number ranged from 0 to 1.603 with a median of 0.185 log per 25 g. Risk of salmonellosis (total arbitrary units (AU) per lot) was affected (p &#8804; 0.05) by Salmonella prevalence, number, and virulence, by incidence and extent of undercooking, and by food consumption behavior and host resistance but was not (p > 0.05) affected by serving size, serving size distribution, or total bacterial load of ground turkey when all other risk factors were held constant. When other risk factors were not held constant, Salmonella prevalence was not correlated (r = -0.39; p = 0.21) with risk of salmonellosis. Thus, Salmonella prevalence alone was not a good indicator of poultry food safety because other factors were found to alter risk of salmonellosis. In conclusion, a more holistic approach to poultry food safety, such as the process risk model developed in the present study, is needed to better protect public health from foodborne pathogens like Salmonella.","Oscar, Thomas",Risk anal,,319
238400,"Tributes to William Helmreich, z”l",2020,"Due to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) being a novel virus, there are currently no known effective antiviral drugs capable of slowing its progress. To accelerate the discovery of potential drug candidates, bioinformatics based in silico drug discovery can be applied as a very robust tool. In the present study, more than 60 antiviral drugs already available on the market, were chosen after literature survey. These can be used in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, these candidate drugs were ranked based on their potential to interact with the Spike protein and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the mechanism of their action as well as how the virus infection can utilize Hemoglobin to decrease the oxygen level in blood is explained. Moreover, multiple sequence alignments of the Spike protein with 75 sequences of different viruses from the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily were performed. This gives insight into the evolutionarily conserved domains that can be targeted using drug or antibody treatment. This multidimensional study opens a new layer of understanding about the most effective drug-targetable sites on the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2.","Agrawal, Lokesh; Poullikkas, Thanasis; Eisenhower, Scott; Monsanto, Carlo; Bakku, Ranjith Kumar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12817v1.pdf,319
239098,Smoothed Differential Privacy,2021-07-04,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the subjective and objective olfactory function in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and the effect of olfactory training. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed in 53 patients who recovered from COVID-19 and visited our tertiary hospital. Subjective olfactory function was evaluated using the 11-point Likert scale (0-10) and the Korean version of the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (QOD). Objective olfactory function was evaluated using Cross-Cultural Smell Identification Test (CC-SIT). Confirmed patients were followed up after 2 months of olfactory training. RESULTS: The median, interquartile range (Q1-Q3) score of subjective olfactory function significantly deteriorated in patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) than in those without OD, even after 3 months of onset (11-point Likert scale, 8, 6-9 vs. 10, 10-10; short version of QOD-negative statements, 19, 16-21 vs. 21, 21-21; QOD-visual analogue scale, 7, 1-13 vs. 0, 0-0; all P < 0.001). However, the objective olfactory function was not significantly different between the two groups (median, interquartile range; 11, 9-11 vs. 11, 9-11, P = 0.887). The percentage of patients with objective hyposmia (CC-SIT &#8804; 10) was also not significantly different (47.4% vs. 40%, P = 0.762). OD in COVID-19 was normalized after 2 months of olfactory training in 70% of patients even after 3 months of olfactory impairment. CONCLUSION: Although subjective olfactory function is significantly decreased in the OD group, the objective olfactory function was not significantly different. Moreover, olfactory training is effective in COVID-19 patients with OD.","Seo, Min Young; Choi, Won Suk; Lee, Seung Hoon",J Korean Med Sci,,319

Second, the issue of individual preparedness to hazardous events is discussed. As events such as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds complex behavioral patterns which are hard to predict, sophisticated models which account for behavioral, social, and economic dynamics are required to assess the effectivity and efficiency of decision-making.","Leitner, Stephan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.08917v1.pdf,319

A total of 419 students from two faculties were invited to participate in this 8-week intervention, 155 participants in the control group and 264 in the experimental group. In the experimental group, the researchers incorporated guided activities Module Intervention Model (MIM) using mobile devices into the ESL lessons whereas the control group lessons were without guided activities. Participants from both groups were asked to record their daily mobile device use for activities related to English language learning using an online form. These data were compared to the results of the tests conducted pre- and post-treatment. At the end of the study, students who received guided language activities utilizing the mobile devices had significantly higher levels of language performance than control group students. However, treatment group students who spent more time using mobile devices to learn the language did not display better performance compared to those who spent minimal time. This finding re-established the importance of guided activities as intervention to facilitate students' learning and points to the need for curricular modernization and faculty development in the instructional use of technology. Due to the increased need for online instruction precipitated by ""social distancing and isolation' required to overcome the coronavirus pandemic, the need for faculty to acquire skills in guided use of mobile devices for school-related learning is anticipated to be greater than ever.","Ng, Siew Foen; Azlan, Mohammad Affiq Kamarul; Kamal, Alia Nadhirah Ahmad; Manion, Alison",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,319

While these corpora are valuable in supporting many analyses on this specific pandemic, researchers require additional benchmark corpora that contain other epidemics to facilitate cross-epidemic pattern recognition and trend analysis tasks. During our other efforts on COVID-19 related work, we discover very little disease related corpora in the literature that are sizable and rich enough to support such cross-epidemic analysis tasks. In this paper, we present EPIC30M, a large-scale epidemic corpus that contains 30 millions micro-blog posts, i.e., tweets crawled from Twitter, from year 2006 to 2020. EPIC30M contains a subset of 26.2 millions tweets related to three general diseases, namely Ebola, Cholera and Swine Flu, and another subset of 4.7 millions tweets of six global epidemic outbreaks, including 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu, 2010 Haiti Cholera, 2012 Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), 2013 West African Ebola, 2016 Yemen Cholera and 2018 Kivu Ebola. Furthermore, we explore and discuss the properties of the corpus with statistics of key terms and hashtags and trends analysis for each subset. Finally, we demonstrate the value and impact that EPIC30M could create through a discussion of multiple use cases of cross-epidemic research topics that attract growing interest in recent years. These use cases span multiple research areas, such as epidemiological modeling, pattern recognition, natural language understanding and economical modeling.","Liu, Junhua; Singhal, Trisha; Blessing, Lucienne T.M.; Wood, Kristin L.; Lim, Kwan Hui",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08369v2.pdf,319

SETTING: A large London teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Three groups were compared: group 1-COVID-19-associated deaths in the 6-week period (n=243), group 2-non-COVID deaths in the same period (n=136) and group 3-all deaths in a comparison period of the same 6 weeks in 2019 (n=194). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: This was a descriptive analysis of death case series review and as such no primary or secondary outcomes were pre-stipulated. RESULTS: Deaths in patients from the Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities in the pandemic period significantly increased both in the COVID-19 group (OR=2.43, 95% CI=1.60-3.68, p<0.001) and the non-COVID group (OR=1.76, 95% CI=1.09-2.83, p=0.02) during this time period and the increase was independent of differences in comorbidities, sex, age or deprivation. While the absolute number of deaths increased in 2020 compared with 2019, across all three groups the distribution of deaths by age was very similar. Our analyses confirm major risk factors for COVID-19 mortality including male sex, diabetes, having multiple comorbidities and background from the BAME communities. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of COVID-19 deaths occurring disproportionately in the elderly compared with non-COVID deaths in this period in 2020 and 2019. Deaths in the BAME communities were over-represented in both COVID-19 and non-COVID groups, highlighting the need for detailed research in order to fully understand the influence of ethnicity on susceptibility to illness, mortality and health-seeking behaviour during the pandemic.","Perkin, Michael Richard; Heap, Sarah; Crerar-Gilbert, Agatha; Albuquerque, Wendy; Haywood, Serena; Avila, Zoe; Hartopp, Richard; Ball, Jonathan; Hutt, Kate; Kennea, Nigel",BMJ Open,,319

From 2006 to the present, the PMI has led to considerable country-managed progress in malaria prevention, care, and treatment in 24 of the highest-burden countries in sub-Saharan Africa and three countries in the Southeast Asia Greater Mekong subregion. Furthermore, it has contributed to a 29% reduction in malaria cases and a 60% reduction in the death rates in sub-Saharan Africa. In this context of progress, substantial heterogeneity persists within and between countries, such that malaria control programs can seek subnational elimination in some populations but others still experience substantial malaria disease and death. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most malaria programs have shown resilience in delivering prevention campaigns, but many experienced important disruptions in their care and treatment of malaria illness. Confronting the COVID-19 pandemic and building on the progress against malaria will require fortitude, including strengthening the quality and ensuring the safety and resiliency of the existing programs, extending services to those currently not reached, and supporting the people and partners closest to those in need.","Steketee, Richard W; Choi, Misun; Linn, Anne; Florey, Lia; Murphy, Matthew; Panjabi, Rajesh",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,319

Objectives: To examine evidence for household transmission of SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by several covariates, and to compare it with other coronaviruses. Data Source: PubMed, searched through October 19, 2020. Search terms included SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 with secondary attack rate, household, close contacts, contact transmission, contact attack rate, or family transmission. Study Selection: All articles with original data for estimating household secondary attack rate were included. Case reports focusing on individual households and studies of close contacts that did not report secondary attack rates for household members were excluded. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Meta-analyses were done using a restricted maximum-likelihood estimator model to yield a point estimate and 95% CI for secondary attack rate for each subgroup analyzed, with a random effect for each study. To make comparisons across exposure types, study was treated as a random effect, and exposure type was a fixed moderator. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. Main Outcomes and Measures: Secondary attack rate for SARS-CoV-2, disaggregated by covariates (ie, household or family contact, index case symptom status, adult or child contacts, contact sex, relationship to index case, adult or child index cases, index case sex, number of contacts in household) and for other coronaviruses. Results: A total of 54 relevant studies with 77â¯758 participants reporting household secondary transmission were identified. Estimated household secondary attack rate was 16.6% (95% CI, 14.0%-19.3%), higher than secondary attack rates for SARS-CoV (7.5%; 95% CI, 4.8%-10.7%) and MERS-CoV (4.7%; 95% CI, 0.9%-10.7%). Household secondary attack rates were increased from symptomatic index cases (18.0%; 95% CI, 14.2%-22.1%) than from asymptomatic index cases (0.7%; 95% CI, 0%-4.9%), to adult contacts (28.3%; 95% CI, 20.2%-37.1%) than to child contacts (16.8%; 95% CI, 12.3%-21.7%), to spouses (37.8%; 95% CI, 25.8%-50.5%) than to other family contacts (17.8%; 95% CI, 11.7%-24.8%), and in households with 1 contact (41.5%; 95% CI, 31.7%-51.7%) than in households with 3 or more contacts (22.8%; 95% CI, 13.6%-33.5%). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this study suggest that given that individuals with suspected or confirmed infections are being referred to isolate at home, households will continue to be a significant venue for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Madewell, Zachary J; Yang, Yang; Longini, Ira M; Halloran, M Elizabeth; Dean, Natalie E",JAMA Netw Open,,319

Here, we systematically review the current evidence base pertaining to the prevalence, presentation and outcome of COVID-19 in cancer patients, in order to inform policy and practice going forwards. A keyword-structured systematic search was conducted on Pubmed, Cochrane, Embase and MedRxiv databases for studies reporting primary data on COVID-19 in cancer patients. Studies were critically appraised using the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's quality assessment tool set. The pooled prevalence of cancer as a co-morbidity in patients with COVID-19 and pooled in-hospital mortality risk of COVID-19 in cancer patients were derived by random-effects meta-analyses. In total, 110 studies from 10 countries were included. The pooled prevalence of cancer as a co-morbidity in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 was 2.6% (95% confidence interval 1.8%, 3.5%, I2: 92.0%). Specifically, 1.7% (95% confidence interval 1.3%, 2.3%, I2: 57.6.%) in China and 5.6% (95% confidence interval 4.5%, 6.7%, I2: 82.3%) in Western countries. Patients most commonly presented with non-specific symptoms of fever, dyspnoea and chest tightness in addition to decreased arterial oxygen saturation, ground glass opacities on computer tomography and non-specific changes in inflammatory markers. The pooled in-hospital mortality risk among patients with COVID-19 and cancer was 14.1% (95% confidence interval 9.1%, 19.8%, I2: 52.3%). We identified impeding questions that need to be answered to provide the foundation for an iterative review of the developing evidence base, and inform policy and practice going forwards. Analyses of the available data corroborate an unfavourable outcome of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and cancer.

251013,Book Review: Introduction to housing,2020,"INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: Covid-19 has led to sudden changes to gross anatomy education when traditional dissection-based laboratories had to shift towards virtual modalities due to physical distancing and remote learning requirements. The purpose of this study was to determine how the use of digital teaching resources in gross anatomy education changed from before to during Covid-19. MATERIAL/METHODS: Data were obtained from an IRB-approved survey distributed to professional associations and listservs targeting anatomy educators from June to November 2020. Respondents were asked to select the digital resources they used before and during Covid-19. Data were analyzed during the early and latter parts of the pandemic as May-August (T1) and August-December (T2), as well as overall (T3). T2 data were classified into five categories: 2D illustrations, dissection media, interactive software, in-house, and open access. Total usage for each timepoint, the proportions of digital resources, and the 5 categories before and during Covid-19 were compared using McNemar's test with alpha&lt;5%. Data are presented as percent increase (+value) or decrease (-value). RESULTS: 60 and 208 responses were received for T1 and T2, respectively. The total number of digital resources used for anatomy education increased from before to during COVID-19 as seen in the data analysis from T1 (+47%), T2 (+41%), and T3 (+43%) (P≤0.003). In T1, the use of BlueLink (+122%) and Complete Anatomy (+140%) software increased (P&lt;0.04), while Acland's Anatomy (+68%), Anatomy.TV (+1300%), Complete Anatomy (+89%), and BlueLink (+148%) increased in T2 (P≤0.03). During T3, the usage of Acland's Anatomy (+60%), Anatomy.TV (+750%), Complete Anatomy (+102%), BlueLink (+143%), and VisibleBody (+100%) increased (P≤0.03). All other digital resources did not change (P&gt;0.05). When data for T2 were categorized, dissection media (+44%), interactive software (+87%), and open-access (+100%) content increased (P≤0.008), while 2D illustrations (-3%) and in-house content (-23%) decreased (P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates sustained increases in digital resource usage for gross anatomy education during Covid-19. This was particularly pronounced for interactive software, open access resources and dissection media that allowed educators to mimic features of a dissection lab. SIGNIFICANCE: These rapid shifts in both commercial and free digital resources are likely to drive innovation in anatomy education for years to come. It remains unknown if the current findings are transient Covid-19-related changes or if they will persist long-term.","Goldman, Haviva Attardi Stefanie Barremkala Malli Bentley Danielle Brown Kirsten Dennis Jennifer Farkas Gary Harrell Kelly Klein Barbie Ramnanan Christopher Harmon Derek",The FASEB Journal,,319

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed health care institutions; as a consequence, nurses' lives and psycho-physical health have been affected. INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced nurses to work in physically and psychologically stressful conditions impacting on their life. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study. All narratives (texts and videos) posted by nurses from the 23rd of February 2020 to the 3rd of May (from the start of the outbreak to the end of the first lockdown) were analysed and published on the five most popular Italian professional social media platforms. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed. RESULTS: Five themes emerged from the 380 narratives explored: 'Sharing what is happening within myself'; 'Experiencing unprecedented working conditions'; 'Experiencing a deep change'; 'Failing to rehabilitate the image of nurses in society'; and 'Do not abandon us'. Even though nurses appreciated the recognition of their communities, they still felt devalued and not recognized as professionals. DISCUSSION: Several psychological, physical, social and professional implications emerged from nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being highly praised, nurses perceived they had failed in rehabilitating the image of nurses in society. CONCLUSION: The experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a traumatic event for nurses but it offered them personal and professional growth opportunities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE, NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Supporting nurses' mental health is highly recommended, together with a cultural investment on nurses' role recognition, and a zero-tolerance policy towards violence and aggression towards nurses.","Fontanini, Roberta; Visintini, Erica; Rossettini, Giacomo; Caruzzo, Davide; Longhini, Jessica; Palese, Alvisa",Int Nurs Rev,,319
252475,Bridging Textual and Tabular Data for Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL Semantic Parsing,2020-12-23,"Various infectious diseases, including COVID-19, MERS, and tuberculosis, are global public health issues. Tuberculosis, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is highly contagious and can be transmitted through inhalation of the bacteria. However, it has been assumed that the infectiousness of bacteria and viruses in dead bodies weakens as the time from death increases. In particular, there is little awareness of infection control measures concerning decomposed bodies or even the need for such measures. The deceased, in whom we discovered MTB 3 months following her death, was a woman in her 80s who died at home. We performed judicial autopsy, because police suspected homicide when her husband hanged himself. Obtained organs were used for microscopic examination by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. In addition, real-time PCR and mycobacterial culture testing using Ogawa's medium were performed for the detection of MTB. We found that the MTB in the decomposed body remained viable and potentially infectious. To identify the bacterial strain further, we performed DNA-DNA hybridization and identified the strain as MTB complex. Potentially infectious live MTB survived in the dead body far longer than had been previously reported. Pathologists should consider microbial culture tests for all autopsied cases in which the decedent's medical history or macro-examination suggests possible infection, even when a long duration of time has passed since death. Pathologists and specialists who perform autopsies should recognize that all dead bodies are potentially infectious, including those in which long periods have elapsed since death.","Unuma, Kana; Watanabe, Ryo; Hirayama, Naho; Uemura, Koichi",J Forensic Sci,,319

256086,Zeoco: An insight into daily carbon footprint consumption,2021-02-11,"Whether virulent human pathogenic coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) are effectively transmitted by aerosols remains contentious. Transmission modes of the novel coronavirus have become a hot topic of research with the importance of airborne transmission controversial due to the many factors that can influence virus transmission. Airborne transmission is an accepted potential route for the spread of some viral infections (measles, chickenpox); however, aerosol features and infectious inoculum vary from one respiratory virus to another. Infectious virus-laden aerosols can be produced by natural human respiratory activities, and their features are vital determinants for virus carriage and transmission. Physicochemical characteristics of infectious respiratory aerosols can influence the efficiency of virus transmission by droplets. This critical review identifies studies reporting instances of infected patients producing airborne human pathogenic coronaviruses, and evidence for the role of physical/chemical characteristics of human-generated droplets in altering embedded viruses' viability. We also review studies evaluating these viruses in the air, field studies and available evidence about seasonality patterns. Ultimately the literature suggests that a proportion of virulent human coronaviruses can plausibly be transmitted via the air, even though this might vary in different conditions. Evidence exists for respirable-sized airborne droplet nuclei containing viral RNA, although this does not necessarily imply that the virus is transmittable, capable of replicating in a recipient host, or that inoculum is sufficient to initiate infection. However, evidence suggests that coronaviruses can survive in simulated droplet nuclei for a significant time (>24 h). Nevertheless, laboratory nebulized virus-laden aerosols might not accurately model the complexity of human carrier aerosols in studying airborne viral transport. In summary, there is disagreement on whether wild coronaviruses can be transmitted via an airborne path and display seasonal patterns. Further studies are therefore required to provide supporting evidence for the role of airborne transmission and assumed mechanisms underlying seasonality.","Niazi, Sadegh; Groth, Robert; Spann, Kirsten; Johnson, Graham R",Environ Pollut,,319
256734,Photocatalytic degradation of paracetamol using aluminosilicate supported TiO2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the use of prone positioning has dramatically increased in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because this manoeuvre is related to several complications, it must be performed in a protocolized manner by the appropriate personnel. AIM: To determine the prevalence of adverse events (AEs) in patients admitted to the ICU with a diagnosis of COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome (C-ARDS) undergoing mechanical ventilation in prone position (PP). DESIGN: Descriptive ambispective study of patients admitted to the ICU diagnosed with C-ARDS undergoing mechanical ventilation who were in the PP at least once. The number of PP manoeuvres and the time spent in the PP were recorded for each subject. AEs proportions and frequencies were calculated, and analysis of variance was used to assess mean differences in the number of manoeuvres and total hours in PP stratified by the number of facial pressure ulcers. IBM SPSS Statistics v.25.0. and EPIDAT 4.1 software were used. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were analysed, and 130 PP manoeuvres were performed. The most frequently observed AEs were facial oedema in 26 patients (80.3%) and facial pressure ulcers in 20 (60.6%). There was a significant positive association between the time spent in PP and the development of facial pressure ulcers (P < .001). Enteral nutrition was well tolerated, and no serious AEs or sentinel events were noted. DISCUSSION: Despite the stressful, demanding situation during the peak of the pandemic, the large number of PP manoeuvres, and long duration spent in this position, no serious AEs occurred. This study highlights the need to implement preventive measures to avoid the development of pressure ulcers secondary to prone positioning. RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE: Prone positioning requires a nursing protocol to prevent the occurrence of AEs that may reduce the quality of nursing care.","Rodríguez-Huerta, María Dolores; Díez-Fernández, Ana; Rodríguez-Alonso, María Jesús; Robles-González, María; Martín-Rodríguez, María; González-García, Alberto",Nurs. crit. care,,319

258720,Vaccination certificates could entrench inequality,2021,"Imaging technologies that allow non-radiative visualization and quantification of apoptosis have a great potential for assessing therapy response, early diagnosis, and disease monitoring. Magnetic particle imaging (MPI), the direct imaging of magnetic nanoparticles as positive contrast agent and sole signal source, enables high image contrast (no tissue background signal), potential high sensitivity, and quantifiable signal intensity. These properties confer a great potential for application to tumor apoptosis monitoring. In this study, a simple and robust method was used to conjugate Alexa Fluor 647-AnnexinV (AF647-Anx), which can avidly bind to apoptotic cells, to superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles, termed AF647-Anx-SPIO, which serves as an MPI-detectable tracer. Based on this apoptosis-specific tracer, MPI can accurately and unambiguously detect and quantify apoptotic tumor cells. AF647-Anx-SPIO showed relatively high affinity for apoptotic cells, and differences in binding between treated (apoptotic rate 67.21% ± 1.36%) and untreated (apoptotic rate 10.12 ± 0.11%) cells could be detected by MPI in vitro (P < 0.05). Moreover, the imaging signal was almost proportional to the number of apoptotic cells determined using an MPI scanner (R2 = 0.99). There was a greater accumulation of AF647-Anx-SPIO in tumors of drug-treated animals than in tumors of untreated animals (P < 0.05), and the difference could be detected by MPI ex vivo, while for in vivo imaging, no MPI imaging signal was detected in either group. Overall, this preliminary study demonstrates that MPI could be a potential imaging modality for tumor apoptosis imaging.","Liang, Xin; Wang, Kun; Du, Jiangfeng; Tian, Jie; Zhang, Hui",Phys. med. biol,,319

(spiderwort) plants,2020,"As of December 2019, a new strain of coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) was discovered in Wuhan, China, following an epidemic of a fast-spreading viral respiratory disease, later called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which then lead to the present pandemic the world has come to know. Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 are mostly asymptomatic or present with mild self-limiting symptoms. While GI symptoms occur with less prevalence, they are increasingly being reported. A diagnosis of Covid-19 has increased dramatically in patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms suggesting that GI symptoms should be taken into serious consideration with patient diagnosis. Case 1: A 65-year-old man presented to the hospital emergency room with abdominal pain, Murphy's sign and chills without fever, subsequently diagnosed as acute acalculous cholecystitis with a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. Case 2: A 78-year-old woman presented to the hospital emergency room complaining of severe positional epigastric pain precipitated by lying supine, chills with no fever, being later diagnosed as acute pancreatitis and a positive COVID-19 rRT-PCR. It has become evident that the ACE2 receptor plays a significant role as the entry site into human cells for the virus. This receptor is generally expressed in respiratory cells, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, corresponding with extrapulmonary manifestations of COVID-19. Studies concluded that the origin of gastrointestinal symptoms could be caused by the interaction of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with cells through the ACE2 receptor. The findings of the present study support this theory, as both patients presented with symptoms regarding tissues with high ACE2 expression.","Hassani, A. H.; Beheshti, A.; Almasi, F.; Moghaddam, P.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have been deemed particularly vulnerable given their high rates of disability and increased susceptibility to infections. There have also been concerns regarding disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during the pandemic as many DMTs may increase the risk of infection due to some of their immunosuppressive properties. Furthermore, due to MS-related chronic inflammatory damage within the central nervous system, there have been concerns for worsening neurological injury by COVID-19. This has resulted in an alarmingly high level of anxiety and stress among the MS community leading to a lack of compliance with medications and routine check-ups, and even failure to obtain treatment for relapse. However, there is currently substantial evidence that MS and most DMT usage is not associated with increased COVID-19 severity. MS patients who suffer worse outcomes were more likely to be older and suffer from significant disabilities and comorbid conditions, which would also be expected from those in the general population. Likewise, there is little if any evidence demonstrating an increased susceptibility of MS patients to COVID-19-related neurological complications. Therefore, we aim to summarize the most recent findings related to COVID-19 and MS demonstrating that MS and most DMTs do not appear as risk factors for severe COVID-19.","Chaudhry, F.; Jageka, C.; Levy, P.

None of the existing clinical treatments provide a solution for all patients. Gene therapy and fetal haemoglobin (HbF) reactivation through genetic approaches have obtained promising, but early, results in patients. Furthermore, the search for active molecules to increase HbF is still ongoing. The delta-globin gene produces the delta-globin of haemoglobin A2 (HbA2). Although expressed at a low level, HbA2 is fully functional and could be a valid anti-sickling agent in SCD. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of a strategy aimed to over-express the delta-globin gene in vivo, we crossed transgenic mice carrying a single copy of the delta-globin gene, genetically modified to be expressed at a higher level (activated), with a humanised mouse model of SCD.

265232,World ferrous metallurgy: Crisis around the turn of a new decade,2020,"The influence of riboflavin (B2)-overproducing lactobacilli on the antioxidant status, isoflavone conversion, off-flavor reduction, amino acid profile, and viscosity of B2-bio-enriched fermented soymilk was investigated. Results showed that B2 in fermented soymilk was notably increased from 0.2 to 3.8 µg/mL for Lactobacillus fermentum UFG169 and to 1.9 µg/mL for Lactobacillus plantarum UFG10. The apparent viscosity significantly changed with rising acidity and agglutination of protein. The off-flavor volatile substances (hexanal and nonanal) were significantly reduced in fermented soymilk. Furthermore, a large amount of glucoside form isoflavones was deglycosylated into bioactive aglycones after 4 h up to 32 h. B2 content and isoflavones significantly improved the antioxidant status of soymilk. Partial least squares regression analysis correlated the strain activity and fermentation time with the improved nutritional and functional soymilk qualities. This study demonstrated the strategy for strain development for B2-bio-enriched fermentation to extend the health-promoting benefits of soymilk and soy-related foods. KEY POINTS: â¢ B 2 -enriched fermentation enhanced the nutrition and functional status of soymilk. â¢ Fermentation time significantly affected the apparent viscosity of fermented soymilk. â¢ Off-flavor volatile substances were significantly reduced or even diminished. â¢ Increased B 2 and bioactive isoflavones contributed to improved antioxidant potential.","Zhu, Yun-Yang; Thakur, Kiran; Feng, Jing-Yu; Cai, Jia-Shen; Zhang, Jian-Guo; Hu, Fei; Russo, Pasquale; Spano, Giuseppe; Wei, Zhao-Jun",Appl. microbiol. biotechnol,,319

In the current situation, the virus is rapidly spreading worldwide, and the discovery of a vaccine and potential therapeutics are critically essential. The crystal structure for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro), was recently made available and is considerably similar to the previously reported SARS-CoV. Due to its essentiality in viral replication, it represents a potential drug target. Herein, a computer-aided drug design (CADD) approach was implemented for the initial screening of 13 approved antiviral drugs. Molecular docking of 13 antivirals against the 3-chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) enzyme was accomplished, and indinavir was described as a lead drug with a docking score of -8.824 and a XP Gscore of -9.466 kcal/mol. Indinavir possesses an important pharmacophore, hydroxyethylamine (HEA), and thus, a new library of HEA compounds (>2500) was subjected to virtual screening that led to 25 hits with a docking score more than indinavir. Exclusively, compound 16 with a docking score of -8.955 adhered to drug-like parameters, and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis was demonstrated to highlight the importance of chemical scaffolds therein. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation analysis performed at 100 ns supported the stability of 16 within the binding pocket. Largely, our results supported that this novel compound 16 binds with domains I and II, and the domain II-III linker of the 3CLpro protein, suggesting its suitability as a strong candidate for therapeutic discovery against COVID-19.","Kumar, Sumit; Sharma, Prem Prakash; Shankar, Uma; Kumar, Dhruv; Joshi, Sanjeev K; Pena, Lindomar; Durvasula, Ravi; Kumar, Amit; Kempaiah, Prakasha; Rathi, Brijesh",J. chem. inf. model,,319

272267,Crop Stubble Burning: Can modern technology trigger a new revolution?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infected over 5 million United States (US) residents resulting in more than 180,000 deaths by August 2020. To mitigate transmission, most states ordered shelter-in-place orders in March and reopening strategies varied. OBJECTIVE: To estimate excess COVID-19 cases and deaths after reopening compared with trends prior to reopening for two groups of states: (1) states with an evidence-based reopening strategy, defined as reopening indoor dining after implementing a statewide mask mandate, and (2) states reopening indoor dining rooms before implementing a statewide mask mandate. DESIGN: Interrupted time series quasi-experimental study design applied to publicly available secondary data. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty United States and the District of Columbia. INTERVENTIONS: Reopening indoor dining rooms before or after implementing a statewide mask mandate. MAIN MEASURES: Outcomes included daily cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths for each state. KEY RESULTS: On average, the number of excess cases per 100,000 residents in states reopening without masks is ten times the number in states reopening with masks after 8 weeks (643.1 cases; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 406.9, 879.2 and 62.9 cases; CI = 12.6, 113.1, respectively). Excess cases after 6 weeks could have been reduced by 90% from 576,371 to 63,062 and excess deaths reduced by 80% from 22,851 to 4858 had states implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. Over 50,000 excess deaths were prevented within 6 weeks in 13 states that implemented mask mandates prior to reopening. CONCLUSIONS: Additional mitigation measures such as mask use counteract the potential growth in COVID-19 cases and deaths due to reopening businesses. This study contributes to the growing evidence that mask usage is essential for mitigating community transmission of COVID-19. States should delay further reopening until mask mandates are fully implemented, and enforcement by local businesses will be critical for preventing potential future closures.","Kaufman, Brystana G; Whitaker, Rebecca; Mahendraratnam, Nirosha; Smith, Valerie A; McClellan, Mark B",J Gen Intern Med,,319

Methods: Thirty-two New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of eight animals each, one control group (CI, nonirradiated animals) and three experimental groups (EI, EII, and EIII) that received PBM postoperatively with an aluminum/gallium/arsenide laser diode (Theralase®) at a wavelength of 830 nm (infrared) and 50 mW output power applied to two irradiation fields per session, for a total of seven sessions. All rabbits underwent surgical extraction of the mandibular left incisor, followed by immediate placement of an osseointegrated implant in the fresh socket. The experimental groups EI, EII, and EIII received PBM at an energy density of 5, 2.5, and 10 J/cm2, respectively, per irradiation field. Results: There was no histomorphometric change in any of the groups. Conclusions: PBM, based on the irradiation protocol used in this study, does not cause morphological changes in the thyroid and sublingual glands when used to stimulate peri-implant bone healing in the rabbit mandible.","Silveira, Vinícius Salim; Mayer, Luciano; Gerhardt de Oliveira, Marília; de Carvalho, Ana Luísa Homem; Weber, João Batista Blessmann",Photobiomodul Photomed Laser Surg,,319
273293,What are the new coronavirus variants?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has high morbidity and mortality, and spreads rapidly in the community to result in a large number of infection cases. This study aimed to compare clinical features in adult patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia to those in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS: Clinical presentations, laboratory findings, imaging features, complications, treatment and outcomes were compared between patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and patients with CAP. The study group of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia consisted of 120 patients. One hundred and thirty-four patients with CAP were enrolled for comparison. RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had lower levels of abnormal laboratory parameters (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level) and more extensive radiographic involvement. More severe respiratory compromise resulted in a higher rate of intensive care unit admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and mechanical ventilation (36% vs 15%, 34% vs 15% and 32% vs 12%, respectively; all p < .05). The 30 day mortality was more than twice as high in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia (12% versus 5%; p = .063), despite not reaching a statistically significant difference. CONCLUSIONS: Lower levels of abnormal laboratory parameters, more extensive radiographic involvement, more severe respiratory compromise, and higher rates of ICU admission, ARDS and mechanical ventilation are key characteristics that distinguish patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia from patients with CAP.","Tian, Juncai; Xu, Qizhong; Liu, Song; Mao, Lingli; Wang, Maoren; Hou, Xuewen",Curr Med Res Opin,,319
273453,Size and timescale of epidemics in the SIR framework,2020-04-27,"Introduction To study the role of intraperitoneal drainage in the resuscitation of patients of perforation peritonitis during corona pandemic. Materials and methods This retrospective study was conducted in the general surgery department of Nishtar Medical University/Hospital Multan from April-2020 to September-2020. Patients of peritonitis who presented with bilateral pulmonary crepitations, SpO2 less than 92%, PaO2 less than 60 mmhg on arterial blood gas (ABG's), and chest X-ray (CXR) finding of bilateral infiltrates are included. Due to high suspicion of associated coronavirus infection such patients needed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for virus detection and special measures were required for resuscitation before any definitive treatment. A delay of six to eight hours is usually encountered while ensuring proper safety measures and dedicated operation theaters. Initial resuscitation started with intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics were given to all patients. Twenty-seven patients were resuscitated with preoperative intraperitoneal drainage while waiting for the report of PCR and 13 patients were resuscitated without drainage. Data analysis was carried out using SPSS version 19 software. The mean was calculated for age while, frequency and percentages were calculated for gender, comorbidities, and causes of delay. The mortality was compared using the Chi-square test. Results The mean age of patients was 43.73 +/- 16.04 years. The common cause of peritonitis were perforations due to duodenal ulcer, typhoid, tuberculous (TB), and biliary origin. The variables that led to suspicion of coronavirus were SpO2 &lt; 92%, PaO2 &lt;60rnmHg and bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray. PCR for coronavirus was positive in nine patients. Mortality was 29.6% in those resuscitated with intraperitoneal drainage before the definitive procedure and 54% in those not resuscitated with intraperitoneal drainage. Conclusions The surge of coronavirus infection has put the healthcare staff at great risk. This has led to strict protocols and precautionary measures in the management of patients with perforation peritonitis with suspected corona infection. The local guidelines of management of patients with acute abdomen should include aggressive measures right from the start during the corona pandemic. Intraperitoneal drainage, early in the management of perforation peritonitis decreases morbidity and mortality in suspected corona infected patients.","Kareem, T.; Hashmi, J.; Aftab, F.; Rabbani, M.

Aims: The aim was to evaluate how adequate knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of health-care worker toward the appropriate use of PPE, which can prevent them and the community from virus contamination. Methodology: This study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic in a span of approximately 50 days. This cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was done in 155 health-care providers posted in the COVID-19 area. Statistical Analysis: Data were described in terms of range;mean +/- standard deviation, frequencies (number of cases) and relative frequencies (percentages) as appropriate. Results: Health-care workers (HCWs) were aware of the importance and criticality of donning and doffing procedure, but they lack the knowledge about dispersion of virus as 62% responded that virus dispersion occurs more during donning than doffing. Gaps were found in attitude as 51% of HCWs found it inconvenient to don PPE that they sometimes think of compromising their own safety. Nearly 33.5% of HCWs move out of the doffing area without removing gloves and N-95, which needs serious correction in their practice. Conclusion: There were major gaps in KAP at institutional level among the health-care providers with regard to donning and doffing of PPE during the beginning of this pandemic.","Garg, K.; Grewal, A.; Mahajan, R.; Kumari, S.; Mahajan, A.",Albang Maqalat Wa Abhat Fi Altahdir Waalinas,,319

Objective: The objective was to analyze the patients' characteristics, hematological, biochemical, and chest imaging findings among the cohort of patients with COVID-19 in Egypt and also to shed light on the predictors of COVID-19 severity. Patients and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 66 patients with COVID-19 in Egypt. Medical history, imaging data (CT chest findings), and measured hematological and biochemical parameters at diagnosis were recorded in the form of complete blood counts and differential counts; CRP, ESR, serum ferritin, creatinine, and liver function tests . Results of real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at diagnosis and during follow up of these patients were also recorded. Results: The study included 36 patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 and 30 patients with severe/critical infection. There was a significant older age among severe (62.6 years old ±10.1SD) than mild to moderate infection (55.5 ± 10.1) (pË0.05). Fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and sore throat malaise were highly frequent among COVID-19 patients, while headache and diarrhea were the least frequently occurring manifestations. All included cases (30 patients, 100%) with severe COVID-19 showed crazy-paving appearance (in the form of reticular and/or interlobular septal thickening) with or without GGO. There were significantly lower mean values of WBCs, lymphocytic count, total protein, and albumin among the severely infected than those who had mild to moderate COVID-19 infection, pË0.05 for all. Additionally, there were significantly higher mean values of CRP, ESR, ferritin, ALT, and AST among patients with severe/critical COVID-19 when compared with those having mild to moderate COVID-19, pË0.05 for all. Conclusion: Among the studied demographic, clinical, hematological, biochemical, and imaging data, dyspnea, diabetes mellitus, lymphopenia, raised CRP, ESR, ferritin, ALT, AST, low albumin, and presence of CT chest findings could be considered as predictors for COVID-19 severity using binary logistic regression analysis.","Ghweil, Ali A; Hassan, Mohammed H; Khodeary, Ashraf; Mohamed, Ahmed Okasha; Mohammed, Haggagy Mansour; Abdelazez, Ahmed Alyan; Osman, Heba Ahmed; Bazeed, Shamardan Ezzeldin S",Infect Drug Resist,,319

METHODS: We analysed furin, leptin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, triglycerides, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein in serum from 166 children in the Pediatric Osteoporosis Prevention (POP) study collected at mean age (SD) 9.9 (0.6) years. Children were classified as low-to-normal weight, overweight or obese. Total body fat mass (kg), trunk fat mass (kg) and total body lean mass (kg) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body fat percentage (%) was calculated. RESULTS: We found that circulating furin levels were higher in children with obesity and overweight compared with children with low-to-normal weight (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). Also, there were positive correlations between circulating furin, total body fat mass, trunk fat mass, body fat percentage, triglycerides, adipokines and pro-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: This study indicates associations between furin, adiposity and a pro-inflammatory milieu in children. We suggest that future studies investigate the role of furin in fat tissue inflammation and associated increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases in children. Studies should also investigate whether higher furin levels could be a link between obesity and severe coronavirus disease 2019 in children.","Swärd, Per; Rosengren, Björn E; Jehpsson, Lars; Karlsson, Magnus K",Acta paediatr. scand,,319

According to Erlich (2017), in traumatic situations, not only the ability of the individual to adapt, but also the capacity of creating and continuing existence, which he defines as the ""modality of being"", is damaged, that is, the individual experiences the modality of ""being"" as ""non-being"" and experiences mental death.

AIMS: This study explored adolescent psychopathological profiles at age 17, and their role in predicting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic at age 19. METHODS: The analyses used a sample of 904 participants (mean age = 19.17 years) from the Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) sweep 7 who completed the mental health questions from January 2018 to March 2019 (mean age = 17.18 years) and the COVID-19 Survey in May 2020. Adolescent psychopathological profiles were identified by means of latent class analysis. RESULTS: Four psychopathological profiles were identified: ""low-symptom class"" (60.17% of participants), ""high-symptom class"" (23.01% of participants), ""substance/behavioural addictions class"" (12.03% of participants), and ""emotion-dysregulation class"" (4.79% of participants). Adolescents in the high-symptom and emotional-dysregulation classes had the worst outcome during the lockdown. Specifically, they experienced more stress, conflict and loneliness, and lower levels of perceived social support than adolescents in the other psychopathological classes. Adolescents in the emotional-dysregulation class also consumed more alcohol and had worse financial situation during the lockdown compared to pre- lockdown period. CONCLUSION: Adolescent psychopathological profiles predicted mental health impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Essau, Cecilia A; de la Torre-Luque, Alejandro",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,,319

These events have resulted in a substantial, immediate-term decrease in accrual to both diagnostic and therapeutic cancer investigations as well as substantive alterations in patterns of oncologic care. The sponsors of clinical trials, including the United States National Cancer Institute, as well as the cancer centers and community oncology practices that conduct such studies, have all markedly adapted their models of care, usage of health care personnel, and regulatory requirements in the attempt to continue clinical cancer investigations while maintaining high levels of patient safety. In doing so, major changes in clinical trials practice have been embraced nationwide. There is a growing consensus that the regulatory and clinical research process alterations that have been adopted in response to the pandemic (such as the use of telemedicine visits to reduce patient travel requirements and the application of remote informed consent procedures) should be implemented long term.

The need for an effective vaccine to curb this pandemic cannot be overemphasized. In view of this, we designed a subcomponent antigenic peptide vaccine targeting the N-terminal (NT) and C-terminal (CT) RNA binding domains of the nucleocapsid protein that aid in viral replication. Promising antigenic B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted using computational pipelines. The peptides ""RIRGGDGKMKDL"" and ""AFGRRGPEQTQGNFG"" were the B cell linear epitopes with good antigenic index and nonallergenic property. Two CD8+ and Three CD4+ T cell epitopes were also selected considering their safe immunogenic profiling such as allergenicity, antigen level conservancy, antigenicity, peptide toxicity, and putative restrictions to a number of MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. With these selected epitopes, a nonallergenic chimeric peptide vaccine incapable of inducing a type II hypersensitivity reaction was constructed. The molecular interaction between the Toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) which was triggered by the vaccine was analyzed by molecular docking and scrutinized using dynamics simulation. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to ensure the expression and translation efficiency of the vaccine, utilizing the pET-28a vector. This research, therefore, provides a guide for experimental investigation and validation.","Chukwudozie, Onyeka S; Chukwuanukwu, Rebecca C; Iroanya, Onyekachi O; Eze, Daniel M; Duru, Vincent C; Dele-Alimi, Temiloluwa O; Kehinde, Busuyi D; Bankole, Taiwo T; Obi, Perpetua C; Okinedo, Elizabeth U",J Immunol Res,,319

We aimed to compare trauma volumes, patient characteristics, and trauma mechanisms at a large, urban Level 1 trauma center in the United States during a state-wide ""State of Emergency"" and ""stay-at-home"" order to corresponding historic dates. All adult trauma activations from March 1 through April 30, 2020 and a historic control from March 1 through April 30, 2018 and 2019 were reviewed in the institution's trauma registry. Trauma volumes, patient characteristics, and trauma mechanisms were compared over time as increasingly stricter COVID-related restrictions were enacted in the Commonwealth of Virginia. After declaration of a state-wide ""Public Health Emergency"" on March 17, 2020, the daily number of trauma activations significantly declined to a mean of 4.7 (standard deviation, SD = 2.6), a decrease by 43% from a mean of 8.2 (SD = 0.3) for the same dates in 2018 and 2019. Trauma activations during COVID restrictions vs. historic control were characterized by significantly higher prevalence of chronic alcohol use (15.5% vs. 6.8%, p < 0.01), higher median (25th - 75th percentile) Injury Severity Score of 9 (5 - 16) vs. 6 (4 - 14), p = 0.01, and shorter median (25th - 75th percentile) length of hospital stay of 2 (1 - 6) days vs. 3 (1 - 7) days, p = 0.03.

288125,The moral hazards of smart water management,2020,"In many complex applications, data heterogeneity and homogeneity exist simultaneously. Ignoring either one will result in incorrect statistical inference. In addition, coping with complex data that are non-Euclidean becomes more common. To address these issues we consider a distributional data response additive model in which the response is a distributional density function and the individual effect curves are homogeneous within a group but heterogeneous across groups, the covariates capturing the variation share common additive bivariate functions. A transformation approach is first utilized to map density functions into a linear space. We then apply the B-spline series approximating method to estimate the unknown subject-specific and additive bivariate functions, and identify the latent group structures by hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) algorithm. Our method is demonstrated to identify the true latent group structures with probability approaching one. To improve the efficiency, we further construct the backfitted local linear estimators for grouped structures and additive bivariate functions in post-grouping model. We establish the asymptotic properties of the resultant estimators including the convergence rates, asymptotic distributions and the post-grouping oracle efficiency. The performance of the proposed method is illustrated by simulation studies and empirical analysis with some interesting results.","Han, Zixuan; Li, Tao; You, Jinhong",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13008v1.pdf,319
288168,Science in silence,2021,"SUMMARY: Many of software for network visualization are available, but existing software have not been optimized to infection cluster visualization, especially the current worldwide invasion of COVID-19 since 2019. To reach the spatiotemporal understanding of epidemics, we have developed Haplotype Explorer. In Haplotype Explorer, users can explore the network interactively with metadata like accession number, locations, and collection dates. Time dependent transition of the network can be exported as continuous sections for making a movie. Here, we introduce features and products of Haplotype Explorer, demonstrating time-dependent snapshots and a movie of haplotype networks inferred from total of 4,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes. ABSTRACT: The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally due to functional limitations, that motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters and provides the perspective on infectious disease dynamics depend on regions and time, such as introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer by showing features and an example of visualization. The demo using SARS-CoV-2 genomes are available at https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer/blob/master/Example/. There are several examples using SARS-CoV-2 genomes and Dengue virus serotype 1 E-genes sequence.","Kawano-Sugaya, Tetsuro; Yatsu, Koji; Sekizuka, Tsuyoshi; Itokawa, Kentaro; Hashino, Masanori; Tanaka, Rina; Kuroda, Makoto",G3 (Bethesda Md.),,319

It was assumed that rapid transition to the new format of studying affected students and their attitude to studying, some of them having reported that their self-efficacy and motivation was affected by emergency remote learning. The main purpose of this study was to collect specific information about students' self-efficacy and motives that make them to continue studying and attend remote classes. This includes comparing the levels of self-efficacy of the same group before and after their transition to emergency remote learning. The sample of 75 students responded to the questionnaire devised to assess the level of self-efficacy and distinguish the motives to attend distance classes. The findings demonstrate that students' levels of self-efficacy in 2019 and 2020 are moderate. However, no statistically significant differences were found between the levels of self-efficacy of this group (z = 1.177). As a result, this group of students possesses the same level of self-efficacy before and during the emergency remote learning.

This glycoprotein spike determines the interaction of coronaviruses with the environment and the host. In this paper, we perform all atomic molecular dynamics simulations of the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric glycoprotein spike and surfaces of materials. We considered a material with high hydrogen bonding capacity (cellulose) and a material capable of strong hydrophobic interactions (graphite). Initially, the spike adsorbs to both surfaces through essentially the same residues belonging to the receptor binding subunit of its three monomers. Adsorption onto cellulose stabilizes in this configuration, with the help of a large number of hydrogen bonds developed between cellulose and the three receptor-binding domains of the glycoprotein spike. In the case of adsorption onto graphite, the initial adsorption configuration is not stable and the surface induces a substantial deformation of the glycoprotein spike with a large number of adsorbed residues not pertaining to the binding subunits of the spike monomers.","Malaspina, David C; Faraudo, Jordi",Biointerphases,,319

Infection by a virus that is officially known as COVID-19 has caused global concern mainly due to the number of deaths caused. Since it was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, now COVID-19 has spread to almost all parts of the world with a very rapid spread rate. The main symptom of this infection is a respiratory disease accompanied by other symptoms that resemble flu-like illness. Everyone can suffer from COVID-19, but the elderly, toddlers, pregnant women, and people with certain diseases and disorders of the immune system show more severe symptoms. The disease is transmitted through inhalation or contact with droplets, where the incubation period ranges from 2 to 14 days.

However most microscopes presented to date are quite novel re-imaginings of the microscope's mechanical design and they are either solely dependent on, or primarily geared towards, camera-based observations rather than ergonomic direct vision screening through an ocular lens. The reliance on camera, computer and monitor for observation introduces a compromise between portability, cost and the quality of an instant wide field of view. In this report I introduce the Portable Upgradeable Modular and Affordable (PUMA) microscope which is an open source 3D printed multimodality microscope that employs a traditional upright design for ease of human direct visual observations and slide screening. PUMA uses standard RMS or C-mount objectives, with a tube length 160 mm, 170 mm or infinity and wide field high eye point ocular lenses. PUMA can use simple mirror-based illumination or can be configured to a full Köhler system with Abbe condenser for high numerical aperture observations including oil immersion. PUMA also has advanced digital / optical imaging features such as a digital spatial light modulator and - unique to any 3D printed microscope to date - an augmented reality heads-up display for interactive calibrated measurements. Digital camera imaging can also be used with PUMA - in fact PUMA can take up to 3 separate digital cameras simultaneously. PUMA can also function as a direct vision multi-header microscope for teaching or discussion. The illumination system is also modular and includes transillumination, epi-illumination, fluorescence, polarisation, dark ground and also Schlieren-based phase contrast and other Fourier optics filtering modalities. All these advanced features are available through an on-board, battery operated, microprocessor so no mains supply, smartphone, network connection, PC or external monitor are required making PUMA a truly portable system suitable for remote field work.

294601,The Case for Claim Difficulty Assessment in Automatic Fact Checking,2021-09-20,"Background: Early in the pandemic it was suggested that pre-existing use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) could lead to increased disease severity in patients with COVID-19. NSAIDs are an important analgesic, particularly in those with rheumatological disease, and are widely available to the general public without prescription. Evidence from community studies, administrative data, and small studies of hospitalised patients suggest NSAIDs are not associated with poorer COVID-19 outcomes. We aimed to characterise the safety of NSAIDs and identify whether pre-existing NSAID use was associated with increased severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods: This prospective, multicentre cohort study included patients of any age admitted to hospital with a confirmed or highly suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes were disease severity at presentation, admission to critical care, receipt of invasive ventilation, receipt of non-invasive ventilation, use of supplementary oxygen, and acute kidney injury. NSAID use was required to be within the 2 weeks before hospital admission. We used logistic regression to estimate the effects of NSAIDs and adjust for confounding variables. We used propensity score matching to further estimate effects of NSAIDS while accounting for covariate differences in populations. Results: Between Jan 17 and Aug 10, 2020, we enrolled 78â674 patients across 255 health-care facilities in England, Scotland, and Wales. 72â179 patients had death outcomes available for matching; 40â406 (56·2%) of 71â915 were men, 31â509 (43·8%) were women. In this cohort, 4211 (5·8%) patients were recorded as taking systemic NSAIDs before admission to hospital. Following propensity score matching, balanced groups of NSAIDs users and NSAIDs non-users were obtained (4205 patients in each group). At hospital admission, we observed no significant differences in severity between exposure groups. After adjusting for explanatory variables, NSAID use was not associated with worse in-hospital mortality (matched OR 0·95, 95% CI 0·84-1·07; p=0·35), critical care admission (1·01, 0·87-1·17; p=0·89), requirement for invasive ventilation (0·96, 0·80-1·17; p=0·69), requirement for non-invasive ventilation (1·12, 0·96-1·32; p=0·14), requirement for oxygen (1·00, 0·89-1·12; p=0·97), or occurrence of acute kidney injury (1·08, 0·92-1·26; p=0·33). Interpretation: NSAID use is not associated with higher mortality or increased severity of COVID-19. Policy makers should consider reviewing issued advice around NSAID prescribing and COVID-19 severity.

METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a public dataset from the United Network for Organ Sharing was performed regarding adult lung transplantation (1/19/2020-6/30/2020). Data were stratified into 3 periods: pre-COVID-19 (1/19/2020 - 3/14/2020), 1-COVID-19 era (3/15/2020 - 5/8/2020), and 2-COVID-19 era (5/9/2020 - 6/30/2020). Weekly changes in waitlist inactivations (COVID-19 precautions or not), waitlist additions, transplant volume, and donor recovery were examined across eras and changes across era were correlated. RESULTS: During 1-COVID-19 era, 301 patients were added to the waitlist, representing a 40% decrease when compared to the prior 8-week period. This was followed by a significant increase in listing during the 2-COVID-19 era (t = 2.16, P = .032). Waitlist inactivations decreased in 2-COVID-19 era from the 1-COVID-19 era (t = 3.60, P < .001). There was no difference in waitlist inactivations between the pre-COVID era and the 2-COVID-19 era (P = .10). Weekly volume was not associated with trends in COVID-19 cases across any era but was negatively associated with waitlist inactivations due to COVID-19 precautions entering the 1-COVID-19 era (r = -0.73, P = .04) and 2-COVID-19 eras (r = -0.89, P = .003). CONCLUSION: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US experienced a decrease in lung transplant volume. While overall volume has returned to normal, additional studies are needed to identify areas of improvement to better prepare for future pandemics.","Chan, Ernest G; Chan, Patrick G; Harano, Takashi; Ryan, John P; Morrell, Matthew R; Sanchez, Pablo G",Transplantation,,319

298912,Kenotic Theologies and the Challenge of the 'Anthropocene': From Deep Incarnation to Interspecies Encounter,2021,"In this perspective, we discuss the impact of COVID-19 on tuberculosis (TB)/HIV health services and approaches to mitigating the growing burden of these three colliding epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). SSA countries bear significantly high proportions of TB and HIV cases reported worldwide, compared to countries in the West. Whilst COVID-19 epidemiology appears to vary across Africa, most countries in this region have reported relatively lower-case counts compared to the West. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an additional burden to already overstretched health systems in SSA, which, among other things, have been focused on the longstanding dual epidemics of TB and HIV. As with these dual epidemics, inadequate resources and poor case identification and reporting may be contributing to underestimations of the COVID-19 case burden in SSA. Modelling studies predict that the pandemic-related disruptions in TB and HIV services will result in significant increases in associated morbidity and mortality over the next five years. Furthermore, limited empirical evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 coinfections with TB and HIV are associated with increased mortality risk in SSA. However, predictive models require a better evidence-base to accurately define the impact of COVID-19, not only on communicable diseases such as TB and HIV, but on non-communicable disease comorbidities. Further research is needed to assess morbidity and mortality data among both adults and children across the African continent, paying attention to geographic disparities, as well as the clinical and socio-economic determinants of COVID-19 in the setting of TB and/or HIV.","Nachega, Jean B; Kapata, Nathan; Sam-Agudu, Nadia A; Decloedt, Eric H; Katoto, Patrick D M C; Nagu, Tumaini; Mwaba, Peter; Yeboah-Manu, Dorothy; Chanda-Kapata, Pascalina; Ntoumi, Francine; Geng, Elvin H; Zumla, Alimuddin",Int. j. infect. dis,,319
299394,Controllable Generation from Pre-trained Language Models via Inverse Prompting,2021-03-19,"OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 has become a global public health emergency affecting 223 countries and territories, and it drastically changed the life of public and health care delivery systems. Although many guidelines have been proposed to avoid infection from COVID-19 and to promote the use of telerehabilitation, there is still no clear answer for the current scenario and strategies of therapists' practice during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on Occupational Therapists' (OTs) practice, the use of telerehabilitation strategies by OTs, and their employment and mental health. Also, this study aimed to explore the OTs perspective on the role of telerehabilitation during this pandemic lockdown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020. RESULTS: 114 OTs completed the survey. The results of this study showed that 52.8% of therapists had stress and anxiety due to COVID-19 lockdown. We found that 60.7% of OTs (n=65) used telerehabilitation, versus 36.1% (n=39) before the lockdown. Telerehabilitation approaches were mostly implemented during this lockdown for children with autistic problems (66.6%), stroke (12.9%), cerebral palsy (6.4%), learning disabilities (9.6%), Parkinson's diseases (1.6%), and other medical conditions (2.8%). 10% of therapists reported that they lost their job, and 76% reported that this lockdown affected their income negatively. Overall, 87.8% of therapists reported that mobile technology was very useful to overcome the stress due to COVID-19 related lockdown, social isolation, and social distancing. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown experiences made us rethink the current approach of therapy services into alternative method (mixed mode) delivery of occupational therapy practice, which is including the combined method of video-based (telerehabilitation) consultation and face to face intervention.","Ganesan, B; Fong, K N K; Meena, S K; Prasad, P; Tong, R K Y",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,319

300988,Indian government should heed its scientists on COVID,2021,"Quarantine and isolation measures urgently adopted to control the COVID-19 pandemic might potentially have negative psychological and social effects. We conducted this cross-sectional, nationwide study to ascertain the psychological effect of quarantine and identify factors associated with mental health outcomes among population quarantined to further inform interventions of mitigating mental health risk especially for vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions. Sociodemographic data, attitudes toward the COVID-19, and mental health measurements of 56,679 participants from 34 provinces in China were collected by an online survey from February 28 to March 11, 2020. Of the 56,679 participants included in the study (mean [SD] age, 36.0 [8.2] years), 27,149 (47.9%) were male and 16,454 (29.0%) ever experienced home confinement or centralized quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak. Compared those without quarantine and adjusted for potential confounders, quarantine measures were associated with increased risk of total psychological outcomes (prevalence, 34.1% vs 27.3%; odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.28-1.39; P < 0.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that vulnerable groups of the quarantined population included those with pre-existing mental disorders or chronic physical diseases, frontline workers, those in the most severely affected areas during outbreak, infected or suspected patients, and those who are less financially well-off. Complying with quarantine, being able to take part in usual work, and having adequate understanding of information related to the outbreak were associated with less mental health issues. These results suggest that quarantine measures during COVID-19 pandemic are associated with increased risk of experiencing mental health burden, especially for vulnerable groups. Further study is needed to establish interventions to reduce mental health consequences of quarantine and empower wellbeing especially in vulnerable groups under pandemic conditions.","Wang, Yunhe; Shi, Le; Que, Jianyu; Lu, Qingdong; Liu, Lin; Lu, Zhengan; Xu, Yingying; Liu, Jiajia; Sun, Yankun; Meng, Shiqiu; Yuan, Kai; Ran, Maosheng; Lu, Lin; Bao, Yanping; Shi, Jie",Mol. psychiatry,,319
301306,Complex networks and human language,2007-01-21,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide with a significant death toll. Solid-organ transplantation (SOT) recipients are at higher risk due to their suppressed immune system. In this study, we aimed to conduct a systematic review on COVID-19 clinical manifestations and treatment strategies in SOT recipients. METHODS: We searched three databases for relevant terms related to COVID-19 and transplantation. 50 studies, including 337 patients, were reviewed. RESULTS: 236 patients were male, with a mean age of 49.9 years. The most prevalent group was the kidney 57.0%, followed by 17.2% heart, and 13.6% liver. Fever and Cough were the most reported clinical presentations. Infiltration (55.4%) in chest x-ray and ground-glass opacity (67.1%) in CT scans were the most radiological findings. It was found that 96.8% and 72.4% of patients present with CRP level and lymphocytopenia, respectively, and 70.6% of kidney recipients patients presented with high creatinine levels. The most common baseline immunosuppressants were Calcineurin inhibitors (88.9%), and antimetabolites (73.2%). Antimetabolites (84.3%) and Calcineurin inhibitors (54.3%) were discontinued/decreased 84.3% whereas glucocorticoids dosage almost have no change (77.9%) or even increased. 18.4% of cases had died, and 65.9% were discharged. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' demographics, signs, symptoms, and radiographic findings in SOT recipients are almost similar to the general population. However, gastrointestinal symptoms appear to be more common. There are different treatment strategies, but in most of them, antimetabolite and Calcineurin inhibitors were decreased or discontinued, while corticosteroids were increased. Finally, Covid-19 seems to be more severe and has higher mortality in SOT recipients compared to the general population.","Moosavi, Seyed Ali; Mashhadiagha, Amirali; Motazedian, Nasrin; Hashemazar, Alireza; Hoveidaei, Amir Human; Bolignano, Davide",Transpl Infect Dis,,319

Group therapists have been forced to move online without enough training in leading online groups. Online groups are not the same as meeting in person and present specific obstacles and challenges that should either be compensated for or acknowledged as losses. In this article, the author summarizes these obstacles, identifying factors in group therapy, such as body-to-body interaction, that are absent online and suggesting ways to compensate for other differences, such as the therapist's reduced control over the setting. Surprisingly, some group members may benefit from online groups more than from in-person ones, but the online format is not for everyone. Research on online therapy has already shown this format's effectiveness, and the therapeutic alliance that is positively correlated with outcome seems to be achievable online as well. However, more research is needed, especially on cohesion in online groups, which seems to develop slower online.","Weinberg, Haim",Am J Psychother,,319

The covid-19 pandemic resulted in a significant problem in education worldwide and Egypt with problems related to the shift to distance learning and accessibility to technology and facilities supporting this shift. This paper aims to contribute to the currently ongoing research that asses the changes in architecture and urban education due to the Coronavirus pandemic, including the shift to distance learning in the practical courses that initially need studio work. The state of distance education via the Internet is difficult for architectural teaching curricula. Most studio environment courses require in-class follow-up. In developing countries like Egypt, not all architecture schools are equipped to move to e-learning, and most have not dealt with this before. This paper assesses student satisfaction and analyzes the entire process of distance learning in practical architectural courses during the coronavirus pandemic in Egypt. the research applies a quantitative and qualitative approach. A questionnaire was designed and distributed;304 students from 17 Egyptian schools of architecture responded. A survey and series of interviews were completed among twelve schools of architecture in Egypt to analyze their responses during the crises and study the shift to e-learning in teaching the practical courses. The paper shows that the psychological effect and working solo from home have affected the students the most. There is a need to solve the internet problems, train the staff and the students to use the online tools for virtual classes, and provide a stable e-learning platform. The future of the traditional studio environment is under questioning. This study responds to the urgent need to evaluate the effect of Covid-19 on architecture education and to question the studio environment in the future to achieve a sustainable higher education in schools of architecture in Egypt.","Elrawy, S.; Abouelmagd, D.",European Journal of Sustainable Development,,319

METHODS: Research questions were formulated focusing on diagnosis and treatment of adult patients with RMD within the context of the pandemic, including the management of RMD in patients who developed COVID-19. MEDLINE was searched for eligible studies to address the questions, and the APLAR COVID-19 task force convened 2 meetings through video conferencing to discuss its findings and integrate best available evidence with expert opinion. Consensus statements were finalized using the modified Delphi process. RESULTS: Agreement was obtained around key aspects of screening for or diagnosis of COVID-19; management of patients with RMD without confirmed COVID-19; and management of patients with RMD with confirmed COVID-19. The task force achieved consensus on 25 statements covering the potential risk of acquiring COVID-19 in RMD patients, advice on RMD medication adjustment and continuation, the roles of telemedicine and vaccination, and the impact of the pandemic on quality of life and on treatment adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence primarily from descriptive research supported new recommendations for aspects of RMD care not covered in the previous document, particularly with regard to risk factors for complicated COVID-19 in RMD patients, modifications to RMD treatment regimens in the context of the pandemic, and COVID-19 vaccination in patients with RMD.","Tam, Lai-Shan; Tanaka, Yoshiya; Handa, Rohini; Li, Zhanguo; Lorenzo, Jose Paulo; Louthrenoo, Worawit; Hill, Catherine; Pile, Kevin; Robinson, Philip C; Dans, Leonila F; Hsu, Li Yang; Lee, Sang-Min; Cho, Jiacai; Hasan, A T M Tanveer; Salim, Babur; Samreen, Saba; Shaharir, Syahrul Sazliyana; Wong, Priscilla; Chau, Jeffrey; Danda, Debashish; Haq, Syed Atiqul",Int. j. rheum. dis,,319

Our aim is to uncover the rate of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients and identify those cases in which a possible causative relationship could exist. METHODS: We performed a single-center analysis of a prospective mandatory database. We studied all patients with confirmed COVID-19 and stroke diagnoses from March 2nd to April 30th. Demographic, clinical, and imaging data were prospectively collected. Final diagnosis was determined after full diagnostic work-up unless impossible due to death. RESULTS: Of 2050 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 21 (1.02%) presented an acute ischemic stroke 21 and 4 (0.2%) suffered an intracranial hemorrhage. After the diagnostic work-up, in 60.0% ischemic and all hemorrhagic strokes patients an etiology non-related with COVID-19 was identified. Only in 6 patients the stroke cause was considered possibly related to COVID-19, all of them required mechanical ventilation before stroke onset. Ten patients underwent endovascular treatment; compared with patients who underwent EVT in the same period, COVID-19 was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality (50% versus 15%; Odds Ratio, 6.67; 95% CI, 1.1-40.4; p 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of acute stroke in patients with COVID-19 was below 2% and most of them previously presented established stroke risk factors. Without other potential cause, stroke was an uncommon complication and exclusive of patients with a severe pulmonary injury. The presence of COVID-19 in patients who underwent EVT was an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality.","Requena, Manuel; Olivé-Gadea, Marta; Muchada, Marian; García-Tornel, Álvaro; Deck, Matías; Juega, Jesús; Boned, Sandra; Rodríguez-Villatoro, Noelia; Piñana, Carlos; Pagola, Jorge; Rodríguez-Luna, David; Hernández, David; Rubiera, Marta; Tomasello, Alejandro; Molina, Carlos A; Ribo, Marc",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,319

309421,CoronaPep: An Anti-coronavirus Peptide Generation Tool,2021,"Objective: To determine the association between chronic statin use and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients and Methods: We identified a retrospective cohort of patients requiring admission at the Mayo Clinic using our enterprise-wide COVID-19 registry from March 1st, 2020, through September 30th, 2020. Available information included age, gender, use of statins, medical comorbidities, and 30-day mortality. We estimated the association of statins with 30-day mortality using odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from logistic regression modeling. Results: 1295 patients between the ages of 30 and 80 tested positive for COVID-19 and required admission during the study period, of whom 500 (38.6%) were taking statins at admission. Patients taking statins were older and more likely to have diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure. Within 30 days of diagnosis, 59 (4.6%) died. In multivariable analysis, statin users did not have statistically different odds of death within 30 days with OR of 1.14 (95% CI: 0.64-2.03, P=.67) compared to non-users. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 taking statins had similar 30-day mortality to those not taking statins, after adjusting for relevant covariates. Although this is partly influenced by a higher prevalence of risk factors for more severe COVID-19 presentation not entirely adjusted for by the Charlson Comorbidity Index, these data would not support statins as a likely therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 in the hospital setting.","Yetmar, Zachary A; Challener, Douglas W; Tleyjeh, Imad M; Sohail, M Rizwan; Cerhan, James R; Badley, Andrew D; O039,; Horo, John C",,,319

Rapid and accurate microbiological diagnosis is essential to ensure adequate and effective therapy. AIM: To evaluate a rapid antibiogram kit (KAR®) in point-of-care format for rapid detection of UTI and antibiotic susceptibility. METHODS: The KAR® device has been designed and developed in collaboration with technical engineers and clinical microbiologists. Its evaluation has been carried out through a multicenter study in which three Spanish hospitals have participated. Thus, different in vivo tests have been implemented in order to determine device correlation with the reference microbiological techniques. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 400 urine samples from patients with suspected ITU were tested. The KAR® device provided fast results (mean positivity time of 7,8 ± 1,5 hours) with 97% sensitivity, 89% specificity and 87% agreement for the detection of significant bacteriuria. The percentages of specificity for the antibiotics tested were: ciprofloxacin (97%), fosfomycin (94%),cotrimoxazole (84%), ampicillin (80%) and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (55%). CONCLUSION: The KAR® device could be a useful tool for diagnosing UTI in outpatients, especially in areas of low socio-economic level.","Jover-García, Jorge; Gil-Tomás, Jesús J; Díaz-Lantada, Andrés; Lafont-Morgado, Pilar; Oliver-Sáez, Paloma; Colomina-Rodríguez, Javier",Rev Chilena Infectol,,319

Our central thesis is that leadership hubris was a central (though not the only) culprit in poor responses, and we introduce the problem of inaction as a symptom of hubris. We conclude with some reflections for practitioners and researchers, suggesting a few areas worthy of examination to better understand how societies and business organizations may construct defenses against the dangers of leadership hubris.JEL CLASSIFICATION M14;L26;D70;N00","Villanueva, Jaume Sapienza Harry J.",BRQ Business Research Quarterly,,319

The tourism industry is among the worst-hit industries. How to focus on visitors who are most helpful to the tourism industry and develop sustainable strategy of operation is a very important question for after the epidemic is over. This study applied two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate past statistics from the Tourism Bureau and explore the shopping patterns of tourists who travel to Taiwan. The focus will be on tourists from major countries such as China, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries. According to the analysis of tourists from different countries, the money spent by tourists from different countries is concentrated on different items, and there are subitems that they particularly like to purchase. For the analysis of the purpose of coming to Taiwan, some tourism areas worth developing (such as medical treatment and leisure) are also presented in the research results. Based on these results, and according to the sustainable development goals, specific recommendations for the sustainability strategy of operation are made as a reference for the government and relevant industries. This research also broadens the scope of application of DEA and points out a different direction for future research.","Tsai, Ming-Chi",PLoS One,,319

METHOD: From 68 publications (N = 87,586 participants), 808 estimates were included in a series of multilevel meta-analyses/regressions including random effects to account for estimates nested within studies. RESULTS: Median summary point prevalence estimates varied by disorder and population. Psychiatric morbidity (20-56%), PTSD (10-26%) and depression (9-27%) were most prevalent in most populations. The highest prevalence of each disorder was found among infected/recovered adults (18-56%), followed by healthcare providers (11-28%) and community adults (11-20%). Prevalence estimates were often notably higher than reported for unselected samples. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that overall prevalence estimates moderately varied by pandemic, study location, and mental disorder measure type. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus pandemics are associated with multiple mental disorders in several impacted populations. Needed are investigations of causal links between specific pandemic-related stressors, threats, and traumas and mental disorders.","Boden, Matt; Cohen, Nichole; Froelich, Jessilyn M; Hoggatt, Katherine J; Abdel Magid, Hoda S; Mushiana, Swapandeep S",Gen Hosp Psychiatry,,319

320452,An emerging genre of contemporary fact-checking,2020,"Background: The worldwide emergence of future pandemics emphasizes the need to assess the pandemic resilient urban form to prevent infectious disease transmission during this epidemic. According to the lessons of the COVID-19 outbreak, this study aimed to review the current strategies of responding to pandemics through disaster risk management (DRM) to develop a pandemic-resilient urban form in phases of response, mitigation, and preparedness. Methods: The research method is developed through desk study was used to explore the current literature of urban form responded to COVID-19 pandemic and for the text analysis; qualitative content analysis was applied developing a conceptual framework. Results: To create pandemic resilient urban form, this study proposes principles to enhance the urban form resiliency in 3 scales of housing, neighborhoods/public spaces, and cities. These principles focus on the concept of resilient urban form from new perspectives focusing on the physical and nonphysical aspects of resilient urban form, which develops a new understanding of pandemics as a disaster and health-related emergency risks. The physical aspect of resiliency to epidemic outbreaks includes urban form, access, infrastructure, land use, and natural environment factors. Moreover, the nonphysical aspect can be defined by the sociocultural, economic, and political (including good governance) factors. By providing and enhancing the physical and nonphysical prerequisites, several benefits can be gained and the effectiveness of all response, mitigation, and preparedness activities can be supported. Conclusion: As the pandemic's disruptions influence the citizens' lifestyle dramatically, the prominent role of place characteristics in the outbreak of pandemics, policymakers, urban planners, and urban designers should be pulled together to make urban areas more resilient places for epidemics and pandemics.","Lak, Azadeh; Shakouri Asl, Shideh; Maher, Ali",Med J Islam Repub Iran,,319

The results of fecal nucleic acid detection were analyzed systematically. Stata12.0 software was used for meta-analysis.The results showed that the most common gastrointestinal symptoms in children with COVID-19 were vomiting and diarrhea, with a total incidence of 17.7% (95% Cl 13.9-21.5%). However, the prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in other countries (21.1%, 95% CI 16.5-25.7%) was higher compared to China (12.9%, 95% CI 8-17.7%). In Wuhan, the pooled prevalence was much higher (41.3%, 95% CI 3.2-79.4%) compared to areas outside Wuhan in China (7.1%, 95% CI 4.0-10.3%). The positive rate of fecal nucleic acid testing in COVID-19 children was relatively high at 85.8% (91/106). Additionally, 71.2% (52/73) were still positive for fecal nucleic acid after respiratory tract specimens turned negative. One and two weeks after the respiratory tract specimens turned nucleic acid-negative, 45.2% (33/73) and 34.2% (25/73) patients, respectively, remained fecal nucleic acid-positive. The longest interval between the respiratory tract specimens turning negative and fecal specimens turning negative exceeded 70 days. Conclusions and relevance: gastrointestinal symptoms in pediatric COVID-19 are relatively common. Attention should be paid to the detection of fecal nucleic acids in children. Fecal nucleic acid-negative status should be considered as one of the desegregation standards.","Wang, Ji-Gan; Cui, Hai-Rong; Tang, Hua-Bo; Deng, Xiu-Li",Sci Rep,,319
327024,What I learned from working as a waitress after PA school,2021,"This paper analyzes the properties of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for mixed causal and noncausal models when the error term follows a Student's t-distribution. In particular, we compare several existing methods to compute the expected Fisher information matrix and show that they cannot be applied in the heavy-tail framework. For this purpose, we propose a new approach to make inference on causal and noncausal parameters in finite sample sizes. It is based on the empirical variance computed on the generalized Student's t, even when the population variance is not finite. Monte Carlo simulations show the good performances of our new estimator for fat tail series. We illustrate how the different approaches lead to different standard errors in four time series: annual debt to GDP for Canada, the variation of daily Covid-19 deaths in Belgium, the monthly wheat prices and the monthly inflation rate in Brazil.","Giancaterini, Francesco; Hecq, Alain",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01888v1.pdf,319

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 and positive swab-test undergoing to a chest CT on third-generation DSCT were included. The imaging protocol included a dual-energy acquisition (HD-DECT, 90/150Sn kVp) and fast, low-dose, long-pitch CT, dual-source scan at 100Sn kVp (LDCT). Subjective (Likert Scales) and objective (signal-to-noise and contrast-to-noise ratios, SNR and CNR) analyses were performed; radiation dose and acquisition times were recorded. Nonparametric tests were used. RESULTS: The median radiation dose was lower for LDCT than HD-DECT (Effective dose, ED: 0.28 mSv vs. 3.28 mSv, p = 0.016). LDCT had median acquisition time of 0.62 s (vs 2.02 s, p = 0.016). SNR and CNR were significantly different in several thoracic structures between HD-DECT and LDCT, with exception of lung parenchyma. Qualitative analysis demonstrated significant reduction in motion artifacts (p = 0.031) with comparable diagnostic reliability between HD-DECT and LDCT. CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-low-dose, dual-source, fast CT protocol provides highly diagnostic images for COVID-19 with potential for reduction in dose and motion artifacts.","Agostini, Andrea; Floridi, Chiara; Borgheresi, Alessandra; Badaloni, Myriam; Esposto Pirani, Paolo; Terilli, Filippo; Ottaviani, Letizia; Giovagnoni, Andrea",Radiol Med,,319

Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients comprise a large proportion of this group, yet there is limited knowledge about the presentation, clinical course, and immunosuppression management of this novel infection among heart, lung, liver, pancreas, and kidney transplant recipients. METHODS: We present 21 SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and April 22, 2020 at a US high-volume transplant center. Diagnostic workup, clinical course, immunosuppression/antiviral management, and immediate outcomes are described. RESULTS: Twenty-one (15.9%) of 132 symptomatic patients tested were positive. Mean age at diagnosis was 54.8 ± 10.9 y. Median time from transplant was 5.58 y (interquartile range 2.25, 7.33). Median follow-up was 18 d (interquartile range 13, 30). Fourteen patients required inpatient management, with 7 (50%) placed in the intensive care unit (ICU). All transplant types were represented. Nearly 43% exhibited GI symptoms. Over half (56.2%) presented with elevated serum creatinine suggestive of acute kidney injury. The majority of patients (5/7) with concomitant infections at baseline required the ICU. Eighty percent received hydroxychloroquine ± azithromycin. Ten received toclizumab and/or ribavirin; 1 received remdesivir. Antimetabolites ± calcineurin inhibitors were held or reduced. Over half of hospitalized patients (8/14) were discharged home. Only 1 mortality (4.8%) to date, in a critically ill heart/kidney patient who had been in the ICU before diagnosis.

As the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread across the globe, clinicians warned of the mental illness epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic. Now, funding for digital mental health technologies is surging and many researchers are calling for widespread adoption to address the mental health sequelae of COVID-19. Reckoning with the ethical implications of these technologies is urgent because decisions made today will shape the future of mental health research and care for the foreseeable future. We contend that the most pressing ethical issues concern (1) the extent to which these technologies demonstrably improve mental health outcomes and (2) the likelihood that wide-scale adoption will exacerbate the existing health inequalities laid bare by the pandemic. We argue that the evidence for efficacy is weak and that the likelihood of increasing inequalities is high. First, we review recent trends in digital mental health. Next, we turn to the clinical literature to show that many technologies proposed as a response to COVID-19 are unlikely to improve outcomes. Then, we argue that even evidence-based technologies run the risk of increasing health disparities. We conclude by suggesting that policymakers should not allocate limited resources to the development of many digital mental health tools and should focus instead on evidence-based solutions to address mental health inequalities.","Skorburg, Joshua August; Yam, Josephine",AJOB Neurosci,,319

DESIGN: We conducted a pre-registered online experiment with a nationally representative sample (n = 500). Three stages tested: (i) whether decision trees help people to decide whether they need to self-isolate; (ii) whether an online planning tool increases people's confidence in their ability to self-isolate; and (iii) whether infographics help people to absorb advice on managing a household in which someone must self-isolate. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (i) Accuracy of matching symptom patterns to a response scale for the need to self-isolate; (ii) self-reported confidence in coping with self-isolation; (iii) objective tests of recall and comprehension. RESULTS: Decision trees improved decisions about when self-isolation was necessary, although participants systematically underestimated the need to self-isolate with less common COVID-19 symptoms (e.g. sore throat, fatigue). The online planning tool increased confidence about coping with self-isolation only among the adults aged under 40. Infographics improved recall and comprehension of how to manage self-isolation.

336122,Computing infection distributions and longitudinal evolution patterns in lung CT images,2021,"RATIONALE: It has been recognized that exposure to mass trauma tends to increase the time spent watching television (TV) news. Yet, research on the effects of this tendency on individuals' well-being yielded inconclusive findings. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this longitudinal study is to examine the effects of prior trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on changes in the amount of TV news watching and its effect on subsequent PTSD. More specifically, we examined the interrelations of prior exposure to war captivity, long-term PTSD trajectories, and amount of change TV news watching with PTSD severity during the COVID-19 pandemic, among aging Israeli combat veterans. METHODS: One-hundred-and-twenty Israeli ex-prisoners of war (ex-POWs) from 1973 Yom Kippur War and 65 matched controls (combat veterans from the same war) were followed up at five points of time: 1991 (T1), 2003 (T2), 2008 (T3), 2015 (T4), and in April-May 2020 (T5), during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Ex-POWs had higher odds of COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to PTSD severity at T5. In addition, delayed PTSD trajectory was associated with COVID-19 related increase in TV news watching, which, in turn, contributed to more severe PTSD at T5. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the negative implications of TV news watching during a mass trauma for traumatized individuals. More specifically, they demonstrate its potential pathogenic role in exacerbating prior PTSD among trauma survivors.","Solomon, Zahava; Ginzburg, Karni; Ohry, Avi; Mikulincer, Mario",Soc Sci Med,,319
336151,A Feature Analysis for Multimodal News Retrieval,2020-07-13,"Extensive research has documented the immediate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientists, yet it remains unclear if and how such impacts have shifted over time. Here we compare results from two surveys of principal investigators, conducted between April 2020 and January 2021, along with analyses of large-scale publication data. We find that there has been a clear sign of recovery in some regards, as scientists' time spent on their work has almost returned to pre-pandemic levels. However, the latest data also reveals a new dimension in which the pandemic is affecting the scientific workforce: the rate of initiating new research projects. Except for the small fraction of scientists who directly engaged in COVID-related research, most scientists started significantly fewer new research projects in 2020. This decline is most pronounced amongst the same demographic groups of scientists who reported the largest initial disruptions: female scientists and those with young children. Yet in sharp contrast to the earlier phase of the pandemic, when there were large disparities across scientific fields, this loss of new projects appears remarkably homogeneous across fields. Analyses of large-scale publication data reveal a global decline in the rate of new collaborations, especially in non-COVID-related preprints, which is consistent with the reported decline in new projects. Overall, these findings highlight that, while the end of the pandemic may appear in sight in some countries, its large and unequal impact on the scientific workforce may be enduring, which may have broad implications for inequality and the long-term vitality of science.","Gao, Jian; Yin, Yian; Myers, Kyle R.; Lakhani, Karim R.; Wang, Dashun",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13073v1.pdf,319

338092,Human Pose Detection for Robotic-Assisted and Rehabilitation Environments,2021,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic placed an unprecedented demand on critical care services for the provision of mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy formation facilitates liberation from mechanical ventilation with advantages for both the patient and wider critical care resource, and can be performed using both percutaneous dilatational and surgical techniques. We compared outcomes in those patients undergoing percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy to those undergoing surgical tracheostomy and make recommendations for provision of tracheostomy services in any future surge. METHODS: Multicentre multidisciplinary retrospective observational cohort study including 201 patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis admitted to an ICU in one of five NHS Trusts within the South London Adult Critical Care Network who required mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. RESULTS: Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was performed in 124 (62%) of patients, and surgical tracheostomy in 77 (38%) of patients. There was no difference between percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy and surgical tracheostomy in either the rate of peri-operative complications (16.9 vs. 22.1%, p = 0.46), median [IQR(range)] time to decannulation [19.0 (15.0-30.2 (5.0-65.0)] vs. 21.0 [15.5-36.0 (5.0-70.0) days] or mortality (13.7% vs. 15.6%, p = 0.84). Of the 172 patients that were alive at follow-up, two remained ventilated and 163 were decannulated. CONCLUSION: In patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis that require tracheostomy to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation, there was no difference in outcomes between those patients that had percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy compared with those that had surgical tracheostomy. Planning for future surges in COVID-19-related critical care demands should utilise all available resource and expertise.","Rovira, Aleix; Tricklebank, Stephen; Surda, Pavol; Whebell, Stephen; Zhang, Joe; Takhar, Arun; Yeung, Elizabeth; Fan, Kathleen; Ahmed, Imran; Hopkins, Phillip; Dawson, Deborah; Ball, Jonathan; Kumar, Ram; Khaliq, Waqas; Simo, Ricard; Arora, Asit",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,319

Little research has examined the joint effects and interactions of multiple elements. This study examined 273 women with NTD-affected pregnancies and 477 controls. Cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, lead, and zinc were quantified in maternal serum. Single and mixed effects of these elements on NTD risk were evaluated with Bayesian kernel machine regression, and the effects of individual elements were validated using logistic regression. As a result, NTD risk increased with the concentration of the mixture of the 10 elements. NTD risk rose as the levels of the five toxic elements increased, with effect sizes larger than the overall analyses, but they decreased, albeit non-significantly, as the levels of the five essential elements increased. Lead and manganese showed risk effects on NTDs, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.94 (1.76-2.13) and 1.25 (1.14-1.38), respectively, with the remaining nine elements remaining at their median. Molybdenum showed a protective effect against NTDs with an OR 0.87 (0.90-0.94). The single-element results were validated using logistic regression. In conclusion, NTD risk increased with concentrations of the five toxic elements, with lead and manganese being the major contributors. Essential elements showed protective effects against NTD risk.","Tian, Tian; Yin, Shengju; Jin, Lei; Liu, Jufen; Wang, Chengrong; Wei, Jing; Liu, Mengyuan; Li, Zhiwen; Wang, Linlin; Yin, Chenghong; Ren, Aiguo",Environ Pollut,,319

341538,Science could benefit as Democrats take power,2021,"The current coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has led to immense strain on healthcare systems and workers. Patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19 may also present with acute neurological emergencies such as ischemic stroke. Ischemic stroke in these patients may result from COVID-19 related complications or decompensation of previously asymptomatic cerebrovascular disorders, or concurrent ischemic stroke from common stroke risk factors in a patient with COVID-19. Acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusions require emergent triage, intensive care, and mechanical thrombectomy. Management of patients with large vessel occlusions (LVO) requires special considerations in the current pandemic. Physicians must now account for prognosis of severe COVID-19, resource utilization, and risk of infection to healthcare workers when determining eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). Here, we describe important prognostic factors including age, laboratory, and imaging findings to consider for MT selection and provide suggestions for taking care of patients with LVO and possible or confirmed COVID-19. It is recommended to perform MT in patients within the established guidelines, and consider a conservative approach in cases where there is clinical equipoise to minimize futile reperfusion. Lastly, we describe an illustrative case of a patient with ischemic stroke and COVID-19.","Salahuddin, Hisham; Castonguay, Alicia C.; Zaidi, Syed F.; Burgess, Richard; Jadhav, Ashutosh P.; Jumaa, Mouhammad A.",Front.

METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. The study sample consisted of 84 participants who cared for schizophrenic patients registered in a community mental health center. In the data collection, the 'Self-stigmatizing Scale for Families' and 'Multidimensional Perceived Social Support Scale' were used. The data were analyzed via frequency, mean, standard deviation, Cronbach's alpha analysis, linear regression, Pearson correlation analysis, independent samples t-test, and ANOVA test. RESULTS: Self-stigmatization (32.48 ± 15.15) and perceived social support (44.36 ± 22.88) were found to be moderate in caregivers. Self-stigmatization was found to be higher in caregivers who do not work; have a spouse, mother, or father; have a disease; do not receive support from their family and have not received any education about schizophrenia (p < .05). It was determined that, with increasing age, perceived social support decreases, and the perception of social support increases in caregivers who are high school graduates, working, having children, have no illness, and are educated about schizophrenia (p < .05). It was determined that, as the level of perceived social support increases in caregivers, self-stigmatization decreases (p < .05). CONCLUSION: It was determined that, as the perceived social support increases in caregivers, self-stigmatization decreases. We recommend providing informative support about schizophrenia, to increase hope and social-skill training, and to implement interventions that include caregivers in the fight against stigma.","Karaçar, Yeliz; Bademli, Kerime",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,319

The aim of this research was to determine the proportion of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and degrees of resilient coping, and to also investigate the relationship of loneliness, coping and other variables with psychological distress among apparently healthy Indians during nation-wide lockdown period. METHODS: A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey using pre-designed pre-tested Google form disseminated via different social media platforms was conducted. A total of 1249 responses were analysed all over India. The form enquired about Socio-demographic profile, awareness on COVID pandemic and cases in the surroundings. UCLA Loneliness scale, Brief resilience and coping scale (BRCS) and Psychological distress scale (K6) assessed self-reported loneliness, coping and psychological distress, respectively. Special regressor technique adjusting for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity was used to extract the average marginal effects. RESULTS: Majority of the respondents were 18-35 years old, male, single and urban residents. News media, social media mostly acted as sources of information regarding COVID related news. Overall, 54.47% (95% CI: 51.39-57.53%) and 38.39% (95% CI: 35.57-41.29%) were reported to be lonely and had low resilient coping ability respectively. Around 44.68% had high risk of developing psychological distress. Being a student (average marginal effect coefficient (AMECoef).: -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.12, -0.01]) and perceiving lockdown as an effective measure (AMECoef: -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.19, -0.03]) were protective against psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with male respondents (AMECoef 0.07, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.11]), low or medium resilient copers (AMECoef 0.89, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.61]), and perceiving a serious impact of social distancing measures (AMECoef 0.17, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.26]). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological distress among Indian population during lockdown was prevalent. Poor coping ability and perceiving social distancing to have a serious impact was found to be significantly contributing to psychological distress. Appropriate measures to address these issues would be beneficial for the community mental health.","Lahiri, Arista; Jha, Sweety Suman; Acharya, Rudraprasad; Dey, Abhijit; Chakraborty, Arup",PLoS One,,319

BASIC RESEARCH DESIGN: The study was carried out among 250 adults attending primary care clinics in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia). The study adopted a case-control approach, where diabetes status was first ascertained, and data collection carried out afterwards using questionnaires and periodontal examinations. Variations in the performance of the PPM by demographic (sex and age), socioeconomic (education) and behavioural factors (smoking status and last dental visit) were evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) regression. RESULTS: The PPM including 3 periodontal parameters (missing teeth, percentage of sites with pocket depth &#8805;6mm and mean pocket depth) had an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.69 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.61-0.78), which dropped to 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53-0.75) after adjustment for covariates. Larger variations in performance were found by participants' sex, age and education, but not by smoking status or last dental visit. The PPM performed better among male (adjusted AUC: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.99), younger (0.67; 95% CI: 0.50 to 0.84) and less educated participants (0.76; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic accuracy of a novel periodontal prediction model to identify individuals with diabetes varied according to participants' characteristics.

349497,Europe bets R&D spending will bring jobs to battered economy,2020,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a destructive, aging-related pulmonary disease characterized by formation of lung scar tissue. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-COV-2 leads to long term lung damage in some patients in the form of lung fibrosis. In either disease, aggregation of fibroblasts, cell differentiation and excessive tissue remodeling causes the lung tissue to lose lung compliance and oxygen exchange.Sodium hydrogen exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a membrane bound transport protein that functions to support cell movement, regulate cell activity, and balance intracellular pH. A multitude of signaling pathways involved in the regulating of NHE1 function are also involved in the profibrotic activity of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts;therefore we investigated if NHE1 is involved in profibrotic activity and tissue damage associated with IPF and COVID-19 infection. Because NHE1 is key in the remodeling of actin stress fibers and is involved in stiffness of both disorders, we first investigated the impact of NHE1 on stress fiber formation using agonists involved with both fibrosis and COVID response. Lung fibroblasts were treated with three agonists: transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), serotonin (5HT), and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in the presence and absence of an NHE1 inhibitor, ethyl-isopropyl amiloride (EIPA). LPA induced stress fiber formation 65.40+/-3.3 percent over the control, and both 5HT and TGF-? also stimulated the formation of stress fibers by 50.27+/?5.7 and 50.91+/?1.4 percent over the untreated cells. In each case, inhibiting NHE1 with EIPA blocked agonist-activated stress fiber formation, delineating that all three profibrotic factors need NHE1 activity for cytoskeletal remodeling. Another indicator of fibrosis is the fibroblast to myofibroblast transdifferentiation. Myofibroblasts are apoptosis-resistant cells that excessively deposit extracellular matrix proteins;the build up of these cells further compromises the structural integrity of the alveoli and contributes to lung dysfunction. TGF- ?, a proinflammatory cytokine, significantly contributes to profibrotic activity by stimulating both fibroblast-myofibroblast transition and excess collagen production. Cells treated with TGF-? to induce cell differentiation showed delayed or significantly reduced myofibroblast transformation in the presence of pharmacological inhibitors of NHE1. Specifically, expression of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), the marker for myofibroblast differentiation, was diminished in each CCL39, LL29, and WI38 cell lines by at least 30 percent and a several day delay of the marker's expression. This study demonstrates the potential for NHE1 as a novel target to fight IPF and lung fibrosis in post-COVID-19 infection.","Manchanda, Mishika Nguyentu Trina Provost Joseph",The FASEB Journal,,319

Objective: To describe the prevalence and severity of cardiac MRI findings of myocarditis in a population of competitive student athletes recovering from COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case series, an electronic health record search was performed at our institution (University of Wisconsin) to identify all competitive athletes (a consecutive sample) recovering from COVID-19, who underwent gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI between January 1, 2020, and November 29, 2020. The MRI findings were reviewed by 2 radiologists experienced in cardiac imaging, using the updated Lake Louise criteria. Serum markers of myocardial injury and inflammation (troponin-I, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate), an electrocardiogram, transthoracic echocardiography, and relevant clinical data were obtained. Exposures: COVID-19 infection, confirmed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prevalence and severity of MRI findings consistent with myocarditis among young competitive athletes recovering from COVID-19. Results: A total of 145 competitive student athletes (108 male and 37 female individuals; mean age, 20 years; range, 17-23 years) recovering from COVID-19 were included. Most patients had mild (71 [49.0%]) or moderate (40 [27.6%]) symptoms during the acute infection or were asymptomatic (24 [16.6%]). Symptoms were not specified or documented in 10 patients (6.9%). No patients required hospitalization. Cardiac MRIs were performed a median of 15 days (range, 11-194 days) after patients tested positive for COVID-19. Two patients had MRI findings consistent with myocarditis (1.4% [95% CI, 0.4%-4.9%]). Of these, 1 patient had marked nonischemic late gadolinium enhancement and T2-weighted signal abnormalities over multiple segments, along with an abnormal serum troponin-I level; the second patient had 1-cm nonischemic mild late gadolinium enhancement and mild T2-weighted signal abnormalities, with normal laboratory values. Conclusions and Relevance: In this case series study, based on MRI findings, there was a low prevalence of myocarditis (1.4%) among student athletes recovering from COVID-19 with no or mild to moderate symptoms. Thus, the utility of cardiac MRI as a screening tool for myocarditis in this patient population is questionable.","Starekova, Jitka; Bluemke, David A; Bradham, William S; Eckhardt, Lee L; Grist, Thomas M; Kusmirek, Joanna E; Purtell, Christopher S; Schiebler, Mark L; Reeder, Scott B",JAMA cardiol.

CONCLUSION: The local pandemic preparation ran smoothly apart from a number of hitches that were dealt with swiftly and efficiently, displaying an agility and nimbleness. Malta has been fortunate in that the Government, advised by Public Health, reacted swiftly in order to control local spread. The silver lining is that these preparations and the preparedness exercise will serve in good stead in the setting of future pandemics.","Grech, Victor; Cuschieri, Sarah; Grech, Peter; Farrugia, Ing Karl; Gauci, Charmaine",Early Hum Dev,,319

351305,Automata-based Quantitative Verification,2020-10-05,"BACKGROUND: Rapidly growing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to the health system in Nepal. The main objective of this study was to explore the health system preparedness for COVID-19 and its impacts on frontline health care workers in Nepal. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted among 32 health care workers who were involved in clinical care of COVID-19 patients and four policymakers who were responsible for COVID-19 control and management at central and provincial level. All interviews were conducted through telephone or internet-based tools such as Zoom and Skype. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed into English, and coded using inductive and deductive approaches. RESULTS: Both health care workers and policymakers reported failure to initiate pre-emptive control measures at the early stages of the outbreak as the pivot in pandemic control. Although several measures were rolled out when cases started to appear, the overall health system preparedness was low. The poor governance, and coordination between three tiers of government was compounded by the inadequate personal protective equipment for health care workers, insufficient isolation beds for patients, and poor engagement of the private sector. Additionally, health care workers experienced various degrees of stigma because of their profession and yet were able to maintain their motivation to continue working in the forefront. CONCLUSION: Preparedness for COVID-19 was affected by the poor coordination between three tiers of governance. Specifically, the lack of human resources, inadequate logistic chain management and laboratory facilities for testing COVID-19 appeared to have jeopardized the health system preparedness and escalated the pandemic in Nepal. Despite the poor preparedness, and health and safety concerns, health care workers maintained their motivation. There is an urgent need for an effective coordination mechanism between various tiers of health structure (including private sector) in addition to incentivizing the health care workers for the current and future pandemics.","Shrestha, Nipun; Mishra, Shiva Raj; Ghimire, Saruna; Gyawali, Bishal; Marahatta, Sujan Babu; Maskey, Smriti; Baral, Sushila; Shrestha, Nilima; Yadav, Rakesh; Pokhrel, Sunil; Adhikari, Bipin",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,319

This phenomenon has led to short term as well as long term psychosocial and mental health implications for children and adolescents. The quality and magnitude of impact on minors is determined by many vulnerability factors like developmental age, educational status, pre-existing mental health condition, being economically underprivileged or being quarantined due to infection or fear of infection. AIMS: This paper is aimed at narratively reviewing various articles related to mental-health aspects of children and adolescents impacted by COVID-19 pandemic and enforcement of nationwide or regional lockdowns to prevent further spread of infection. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a review and collected articles and advisories on mental health aspects of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. We selected articles and thematically organized them. We put up their major findings under the thematic areas of impact on young children, school and college going students, children and adolescents with mental health challenges, economically underprivileged children, impact due to quarantine and separation from parents and the advisories of international organizations. We have also provided recommendations to the above. CONCLUSION: There is a pressing need for planning longitudinal and developmental studies, and implementing evidence based elaborative plan of action to cater to the psycho social and mental health needs of the vulnerable children and adolescents during pandemic as well as post pandemic. There is a need to ameliorate children and adolescents' access to mental health support services geared towards providing measures for developing healthy coping mechanisms during the current crisis. For this innovative child and adolescent mental health policies policies with direct and digital collaborative networks of psychiatrists, psychologists, paediatricians, and community volunteers are deemed necessary.","Singh, Shweta; Roy, Deblina; Sinha, Krittika; Parveen, Sheeba; Sharma, Ginni; Joshi, Gunjan",Psychiatry Res,,319

To emphasis the communication we have chosen to analyze all public reports during the state of emergency of the companies listed on the main market at the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The empirical analysis consists of a panel data econometric model using maximum likelihood random-effects regression and a logistical regression to highlight the correlations between the dependent variables Public Reports and Business Continuity Plan and the analyzed independent variables. The study showed that in most cases, the companies had at least one public report, especially the one related to the annual shareholders meeting, a percentage of 21% of companies had two public reports, and only 17% of companies have published three or more reports. The companies that communicated the most were the ones belonging to the premium trading category, and the number of published reports was influenced by the communication evaluation indicator, profitability and by the announcement of the donations made.","Hategan, Camelia-Daniela; Curea-Pitorac, Ruxandra-Ioana; Hategan, Vasile-Petru",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,319

We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention.","Su, Yapeng; Chen, Daniel; Yuan, Dan; Lausted, Christopher; Choi, Jongchan; Dai, Chengzhen L; Voillet, Valentin; Duvvuri, Venkata R; Scherler, Kelsey; Troisch, Pamela; Baloni, Priyanka; Qin, Guangrong; Smith, Brett; Kornilov, Sergey A; Rostomily, Clifford; Xu, Alex; Li, Jing; Dong, Shen; Rothchild, Alissa; Zhou, Jing; Murray, Kim; Edmark, Rick; Hong, Sunga; Heath, John E; Earls, John; Zhang, Rongyu; Xie, Jingyi; Li, Sarah; Roper, Ryan; Jones, Lesley; Zhou, Yong; Rowen, Lee; Liu, Rachel; Mackay, Sean; O039,; Mahony, D Shane; Dale, Christopher R; Wallick, Julie A; Algren, Heather A; Zager, Michael A; Wei, Wei; Price, Nathan D; Huang, Sui; Subramanian, Naeha; Wang, Kai; Magis, Andrew T; Hadlock, Jenn J; Hood, Leroy; Aderem, Alan; Bluestone, Jeffrey A; Lanier, Lewis L",Cell,,319

Therefore, the development of COVID-19 testing kits is still an open area of research. Recently, many studies have shown that chest Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for COVID-19 testing, as chest CT images show a bilateral change in COVID-19 infected patients. However, the classification of COVID-19 patients from chest CT images is not an easy task as predicting the bilateral change is defined as an ill-posed problem. Therefore, in this paper, a deep transfer learning technique is used to classify COVID-19 infected patients. Additionally, a top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive attributes is also utilized to handle noisy and imbalanced COVID-19 dataset kind of problems. Experimental results reveal that the proposed deep transfer learning-based COVID-19 classification model provides efficient results as compared to the other supervised learning models.","Pathak, Y; Shukla, P K; Tiwari, A; Stalin, S; Singh, S",,,319

We assessed the clinical outcomes of patients with COVID-19 during the first wave of the epidemic in Korea. METHODS: Using a modified World Health Organization clinical record form, we obtained clinical data for 3,060 patients with COVID-19 treated at 55 hospitals in Korea. Disease severity scores were defined as: 1) no limitation of daily activities; 2) limitation of daily activities but no need for supplemental oxygen; 3) supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula; 4) supplemental oxygen via facial mask; 5) non-invasive mechanical ventilation; 6) invasive mechanical ventilation; 7) multi-organ failure or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy; and 8) death. Recovery was defined as a severity score of 1 or 2, or discharge and release from isolation. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 43 years of age; 43.6% were male. The median time from illness onset to admission was 5 days. Of the patients with a disease severity score of 3-4 on admission, 65 (71.5%) of the 91 patients recovered, and 7 (7.7%) died due to illness by day 28. Of the patients with disease severity scores of 5-7, 7 (19.5%) of the 36 patients recovered, and 8 (22.2%) died due to illness by day 28.

358732,“A New Battlefield for the United States”: Russia Sanctions and the New Cold War,2020,"As of November 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases was increasing rapidly in many countries. In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of the effective reproduction numbers R(t) for each country by integrating the equations of the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. We cluster countries based on the estimated R(t) through a suitable time series dissimilarity. The clustering result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we extend the simple SIR model for disease spread to include a social response to explain the number X(t) of new confirmed daily cases. In particular, we characterize the social response with a first-order model that depends on three parameters &#957;1,&#957;2,&#957;3. The parameter &#957;1 describes the effect of relaxed intervention when the incidence rate is low; &#957;2 models the impact of interventions when incidence rate is high; &#957;3 represents the fatigue, i.e., the weakening of interventions as time passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19 epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters &#957;1,&#957;2,&#957;3 and initial conditions, such as R0, for different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social responses. One conclusion is that the leading cause of the strong second wave in Europe in the fall of 2020 was not the relaxation of interventions during the summer, but rather the failure to enforce interventions in the fall.","Rypdal, Kristoffer; Bianchi, Filippo Maria; Rypdal, Martin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,319

In view of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID­19) pandemic, studies based on KAP theory have been useful to better understand certain behaviors, such as adherence to prevention measures and control of the spread of the virus. OBJECTIVE: To describe the process of cross-cultural adaptation of two complementary instruments for assessing KAP regarding the COVID­19 pandemic in the Brazilian population. METHODS: Two independent translators proposed a first Brazilian Portuguese version of the scales. The cultural adaptation and pre-test of the Brazilian Portuguese versions occurred at different stages, using a panel of specialists and a subsample of the target population, respectively. RESULTS: The pre-test of the adapted instruments involved 30 Brazilian adults (mean age = 41.8 years; standard deviation = 4.24) and was carried out to assess instrument understanding and applicability. The participants informed they did not have difficulties to self-complete the instruments and reported a high level of clarity and understanding. CONCLUSION: Both instruments can bring an opportunity to study behavioral constructs about COVID­19 in the Brazilian population, aiming to articulate strategies that enable the fulfillment of effective preventive measures.","Meneghini, Andréa Cristina; da Silva, Wanderson Roberto; Martinez, Edson Zangiacomi; Zucoloto, Miriane Lucindo",Trends psychiatry psychother.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated factors of depression, anxiety, and stress among these populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Guided by the health belief model, a cross-sectional study design was employed among 335 participants, and primary data were collected through an online survey. Measured using DASS-21, anxiety, depression, and stress were the dependent variables. We performed descriptive and inferential statistical analyses-logistic regression was used to predict independently associated variables. STATA was used to execute all data analyses. Results: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers were 10.15, 9.25, and 2.39%, respectively. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among those aged 21-30 years old, who had completed a university degree, were married, and had quarantined for 14 days. Conversely, the risk of anxiety and depression was high among those who had bad perceived health status, high perceived susceptibility, and negative stigma perception. Conclusion: The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among repatriated Indonesian migrant workers was relatively low compared to the general population. The risk of anxiety and depression was low among young people, educated people, and those under effective quarantine, but the risk was high among those who had negative perceptions about their health, stigma, and susceptibility to the disease.","Harjana, Ngakan Putu Anom; Januraga, Pande Putu; Indrayathi, Putu Ayu; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; Ward, Paul Russell",Front Public Health,,319
360683,IBFAN News Brief: Breastfeeding Protection and Tackling Malnutrition in the Time of COVID,2021,"With the expansion of the global novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, unprecedented interventions have been widely implemented in many countries, including China. In view of this scenario, this research aims to explore the effectiveness of population mobility restriction in alleviating epidemic transmission during different stages of the outbreak. Taking Shenzhen, a city with a large immigrant population in China, as a case study, the real-time reproduction number of COVID-19 is estimated by statistical methods to represent the dynamic spatiotemporal transmission pattern of COVID-19. Furthermore, migration data between Shenzhen and other provinces are collected to investigate the impact of nationwide population flow on near-real-time dynamic reproductive numbers. The results show that traffic flow control between populated cities has an inhibitory effect on urban transmission, but this effect is not significant in the late stage of the epidemic spread in China. This finding implies that the government should limit international and domestic population movement starting from the very early stage of the outbreak. This work confirms the effectiveness of travel restriction measures in the face of COVID-19 in China and provides new insight for densely populated cities in imposing intervention measures at various stages of the transmission cycle.","Ji, Honglu; Tong, Huan; Wang, Jingge; Yan, Dan; Liao, Zangyi; Kong, Ying",,,319

We illustrate with catastrophic failures of a toy functional applied to H2+ at varying bond lengths, where the standard fitting procedure misses the exact functional; Grimme's D3 fit to noncovalent interactions, which can be contaminated by large density errors such as in the WATER27 and B30 data sets; and double-hybrids trained on self-consistent densities, which can perform poorly on systems with density-driven errors. In these cases, more accurate results are found at no additional cost by using Hartree-Fock (HF) densities instead of self-consistent densities. For binding energies of small water clusters, errors are greatly reduced. Range-separated hybrids with 100% HF at large distances suffer much less from this effect.","Song, Suhwan; Vuckovic, Stefan; Sim, Eunji; Burke, Kieron",J Phys Chem Lett,,319

Fatalities could decrease if every patient could get suitable treatment by the healthcare system. Machine learning, especially computer vision methods based on deep learning, can help healthcare professionals diagnose and treat COVID-19 infected cases more efficiently. Hence, infected patients can get better service from the healthcare system and decrease the number of deaths caused by the coronavirus. This research proposes a method for segmenting infected lung regions in a CT image. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network with an attention mechanism is used to detect infected areas with complex patterns. Attention blocks improve the segmentation accuracy by focusing on informative parts of the image. Furthermore, a generative adversarial network generates synthetic images for data augmentation and expansion of small available datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to some existing procedures.","Yazdekhasty, Parham; Zindari, Ali; Nabizadeh-ShahreBabak, Zahra; Khadivi, Pejman; Karimi, Nader; Samavi, Shadrokh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.08895v2.pdf,319

Prescribers should consider potential effects of investigational anti-COVID-19 drugs on seizures, immunomodulation by anti-seizure medications (ASMs), changes in ASM pharmacokinetics, and the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs). The goal of the Board of the Israeli League Against Epilepsy (the Israeli Chapter of the International League Against Epilepsy, ILAE) was to summarize the main principles of the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19 in patients with epilepsy. This guide was based on current literature, drug labels, and drug interaction resources. We summarized the available data related to the potential implications of anti-COVID-19 co-medication in patients treated with ASMs. Our recommendations refer to drug selection, dosing, and patient monitoring. Given the limited availability of data, some recommendations are based on general pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic principles and might apply to additional future drug combinations as novel treatments emerge. They do not replace evidence-based guidelines, should those become available. Awareness to drug characteristics that increase the risk of interactions can help adjust anti-COVID-19 and ASM treatment for patients with epilepsy.","Ekstein, Dana; Noyman, Iris; Fahoum, Firas; Herskovitz, Moshe; Linder, Ilan; Ben Zeev, Bruria; Eyal, Sara",Isr Med Assoc J,,319

We focus on the first year of the epidemic in Los Angeles County (LAC) (March 1, 2020-March 1, 2021), spanning three epidemic waves. A relative risk modeling approach was developed to estimate conditional effects from available marginal data. A dynamic stochastic epidemic model was developed to produce time-varying population estimates of epidemic parameters including the transmission and infection observation rate. The epidemic and risk models were integrated to produce estimates of subpopulation-stratified probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR for LAC. The probabilities of disease progression and CFR and IFR were found to vary as extensively between age groups as within age categories combined with the presence of absence of other risk factors, suggesting that it is inappropriate to summarize epidemiological parameters for age categories alone, let alone the entire population. The fine-grained subpopulation-stratified estimates of COVID-19 outcomes produced in this study are useful in understanding disparities in the effect of the epidemic on different groups in LAC, and can inform analyses of targeted subpopulation-level policy interventions.","Horn, Abigail L; Jiang, Lai; Washburn, Faith; Hvitfeldt, Emil; de la Haye, Kayla; Nicholas, William; Simon, Paul; Pentz, Maryann; Cozen, Wendy; Sood, Neeraj; Conti, David V",PLoS One,,319

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which outbreak in 2002 and 2011, and the current COVID-19 pandemic are all from the same family of coronavirus. This work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A unique database was created, so-called QU-COVID-family, consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the decision of deep CNNs. Several Deep Learning classifiers were trained and tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported. Original and preprocessed images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks. Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3 outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. In contrast, for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using the original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities of 96.94%, 79.68%, and 90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. All networks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (>96%) with the segmented lung images. This indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases in the eyes of AI, which is often a challenging task for medical doctors.","Tahir, Anas; Qiblawey, Yazan; Khandakar, Amith; Rahman, Tawsifur; Khurshid, Uzair; Musharavati, Farayi; Islam, M.

376436,New horizons in energy geoscience,2020,"BACKGROUND: Early COVID-19 diagnosis prior to laboratory testing results is crucial for infection control in hospitals. Models exist predicting COVID-19 diagnosis, but significant concerns exist regarding methodology and generalisability. AIM: To generate the first COVID-19 diagnosis risk score for use at the time of hospital admission using the TRIPOD (transparent reporting of a multivariable prediction model for individual prognosis or diagnosis) checklist. DESIGN: A multivariable diagnostic prediction model for COVID-19 using the TRIPOD checklist applied to a large single-centre retrospective observational study of patients with suspected COVID-19. METHODS: 581 individuals were admitted with suspected COVID-19; the majority had laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (420/581, 72.2%). Retrospective collection was performed of electronic clinical records and pathology data. RESULTS: The final multivariable model demonstrated AUC 0.8535 (95% confidence interval (0.8121-0.8950). The final model used 6 clinical variables that are routinely available in most low and high resource settings. Using a cut-off of 2, the derived risk score has a sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 86.8%. At COVID-19 prevalence of 10% the model has a negative predictive value (NPV) of 96.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our risk score is intended for diagnosis of COVID-19 in individuals admitted to hospital with suspected COVID-19. The score is the first developed for COVID-19 diagnosis using the TRIPOD checklist. It may be effective as a tool to rule out COVID-19 and function at different pandemic phases of variable COVID-19 prevalence. The simple score could be used by any healthcare worker to support hospital infection control prior to laboratory testing results.","Fink, D L; Khan, P Y; Goldman, N; Cai, J; Hone, L; Mooney, C; El-Shakankery, K H; Sismey, G; Whitford, V; Marks, M; Thomas, S",QJM,,319

The aim of this study was to investigate the broad spectrum antiviral activity of a naturally existing sulfated polysaccharide, lambda-carrageenan (&#955;-CGN), purified from marine red algae. Cell culture-based assays revealed that the macromolecule efficiently inhibited both influenza A and B viruses with EC50 values ranging from 0.3 to 1.4 µg/ml, as well as currently circulating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with an EC50 value of 0.9 ± 1.1 µg/ml. No toxicity to the host cells was observed at concentrations up to 300 µg/ml. Plaque titration and western blot analysis verified that &#955;-CGN reduced expression of viral proteins in cell lysates and suppressed progeny virus production in culture supernatants in a dose-dependent manner. This polyanionic compound exerts antiviral activity by targeting viral attachment to cell surface receptors and preventing virus entry. Moreover, its intranasal administration to mice during influenza A viral challenge not only alleviated infection-mediated reductions in body weight but also protected 60% of mice from virus-induced mortality. Thus, &#955;-CGN could be a promising antiviral agent for preventing infection with several respiratory viruses.","Jang, Yejin; Shin, Heegwon; Lee, Myoung Kyu; Kwon, Oh Seung; Shin, Jin Soo; Kim, Yong-Il; Kim, Chan Woo; Lee, Hye-Ra; Kim, Meehyein",Sci Rep,,319

While this mysterious virus challenges our ability to control viral infections, our opportunities to control the COVID-19 pandemic are gradually fading. Currently, pandemic management relies on preventive interventions. Although prevention is a good strategy to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it still cannot be considered an absolute solution to eliminate this pandemic. Currently, developing a potent immunity against this viral infection seems to be the most promising strategy to drive down this ongoing global tragedy. However, with the emergence of new challenges in the context of immune responses to COVID-19, the road to control this devastating pandemic seems bumpier;thus, it is pivotal to characterize the dynamics of host immune responses to COVID-19, in order to develop efficient prophylactic and therapeutic tools. This begs the question of whether the effector mechanisms of the immune system are indeed potent or a possible contributing factor to developing more severe and lethal forms of COVID-19. In this review, the possible role of the immunopathologic phenomena including antibody-dependent enhancement, cytokine storm, and original antigenic sin in severity and mortality of COVID-19 will be discussed. ©The Author(s) 2021.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcomes, cost, and cost-effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigation strategies on college campuses. DESIGN: The Clinical and Economic Analysis of COVID-19 interventions (CEACOV) model, a dynamic microsimulation model, was used to examine alternative mitigation strategies. The CEACOV model tracks infections accrued by students and faculty, accounting for community transmissions. DATA SOURCES: Data from published literature were used to obtain parameters related to COVID-19 and contact-hours. TARGET POPULATION: Undergraduate students and faculty at U.S. colleges. TIME HORIZON: One semester (105 days). PERSPECTIVE: Modified societal. INTERVENTION: COVID-19 mitigation strategies, including social distancing, masks, and routine laboratory screening. OUTCOME MEASURES: Infections among students and faculty per 5000 students and per 1000 faculty, isolation days, tests, costs, cost per infection prevented, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Among students, mitigation strategies reduced COVID-19 cases from 3746 with no mitigation to 493 with extensive social distancing and masks, and further to 151 when laboratory testing was added among asymptomatic persons every 3 days. Among faculty, these values were 164, 28, and 25 cases, respectively. Costs ranged from about $0.4 million for minimal social distancing to about $0.9 million to $2.1 million for strategies involving laboratory testing ($10 per test), depending on testing frequency. Extensive social distancing with masks cost $170 per infection prevented ($49 200 per QALY) compared with masks alone. Adding routine laboratory testing increased cost per infection prevented to between $2010 and $17 210 (cost per QALY gained, $811 400 to $2 804 600). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results were most sensitive to test costs. LIMITATION: Data are from multiple sources. CONCLUSION: Extensive social distancing with a mandatory mask-wearing policy can prevent most COVID-19 cases on college campuses and is very cost-effective. Routine laboratory testing would prevent 96% of infections and require low-cost tests to be economically attractive.

381313,Keeping surfaces safe,2020,"The multi-dimensional damages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have highlighted the fragility of our economic systems and their lack of resilience. People are starting to question globalisation, and debates on alternative modes of development are back and alive. If economic paradigms need reforming, we also need educational systems that will equip people to build more sustainable societies. With this in mind, this article focuses on two crucial components in 'current issues in comparative education'. One relates to the emergence of a so-far under-explored area of research in education, that of Territorial Education (TE), and places it in the context of both the 1990s educational reforms, intended to create a standardised 'world class education', and of 'education for sustainability'. The second one focuses on the experiential nature that skill-orientated Territorial Education can provide, in contrast to other types of 'education for sustainability' approaches that are more conceptual. Using Urban Agriculture initiatives in Lisbon as illustrative examples, the article shows that such practical approaches might help to make cities sustainable and resilient in the future.","Simon, Sandrine",Current Issues in Comparative Education,,319

While polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the gold standard for COVID-19 screening, serological assays detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in response to past and/or current infection remain vital tools. In particular, lateral flow immunoassay devices are easy to produce, scale, distribute, and use; however, they are unable to provide quantitative information. To enable quantitative analysis of lateral flow immunoassay device results, microgating technology was used to develop an innovative spectrochip that can be integrated into a portable, palm-sized device that was capable of capturing high-resolution reflectance spectrum data for quantitative immunoassay diagnostics. Using predefined spiked concentrations of recombinant anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G (IgG), this spectrochip-coupled immunoassay provided extraordinary sensitivity, with a detection limit as low as 186 pg/mL. Furthermore, this platform enabled the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG in all PCR-confirmed patients as early as day 3 after symptom onset, including two patients whose spectrochip tests would be regarded as negative for COVID-19 using a direct visual read-out without spectral analysis. Therefore, the quantitative lateral flow immunoassay with an exceptionally low detection limit for SARS-CoV-2 is of value. An increase in the number of patients tested with this novel device may reveal its true clinical potential.","Hung, Kai-Feng; Hung, Chih-Hsing; Hong, Chitsung; Chen, Szu-Chia; Sun, Yi-Chen; Wen, Jyun-Wei; Kuo, Chao-Hung; Ko, Cheng-Hao; Cheng, Chao-Min",,,319

Extensive numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly sensitive, rapid, noninvasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in experimental sensing protocols.","Uddin, Syed Mohammad Ashab; Chowdhury, Sayeed Shafayet; Kabir, Ehsan",Plasmonics,,319

This study aims to assess the serologic profiles and time kinetics of antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in patients with COVID-19 using two immunoassays. METHODS: A total of 97 samples serially collected from 17 patients with COVID-19 and 137 negative control samples were analyzed for IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-2 using the AFIAS COVID-19 Ab (Boditech Med Inc., Chuncheon, Republic of Korea) and the EDI&#8482; Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA Kit (Epitope Diagnostics, Inc., San Diego, CA). RESULTS: With both assays, IgM and IgG rapidly increased after 7 days post symptom onset (PSO). IgM antibody levels reached a peak at 15-35 d PSO and gradually decreased. IgG levels gradually increased and remained at similar levels after 22-35 d. The diagnostic sensitivities of IgM/IgG for &#8804;14d PSO were 21.4%/35.7~57.1% and increased to 41.2~52.9%/88.2~94.1% at >14 d PSO with specificities of 98.5%/94.2% for AFIAS COVID-19 Ab and 100.0%/96.4% for EDI&#8482; Novel Coronavirus COVID-19 ELISA Kit. Among 137 negative controls, 12 samples (8.8%) showed positive or indeterminate results. CONCLUSIONS: The antibody kinetics against SARS-CoV-2 are similar to common findings of acute viral infectious diseases. Antibody testing is useful for ruling out SARS-CoV-2 infection after 14 d PSO, detecting past infection, and epidemiologic surveys.","Kweon, Oh Joo; Lim, Yong Kwan; Kim, Hye Ryoun; Kim, Min-Chul; Choi, Seong-Ho; Chung, Jin-Won; Lee, Mi-Kyung",PLoS One,,319

Heat is transferred from substrates to organisms by conduction and reflected radiation. Because brightness influences the degree of heat absorption, substrates could affect the evolution of integumentary optical properties. Here, we show that vipers (Squamata:Viperidae) inhabiting hot, highly radiative and superficially conductive substrates have evolved bright ventra for efficient heat transfer. We analyzed the brightness of 4161 publicly available images from 126 species, and we found that substrate type, alongside latitude and body mass, strongly influences ventral brightness. Substrate type also significantly affects dorsal brightness, but this is associated with different selective forces: activity-pattern and altitude. Ancestral estimation analysis suggests that the ancestral ventral condition was likely moderately bright and, following divergence events, some species convergently increased their brightness. Vipers diversified during the Miocene and the enhancement of ventral brightness may have facilitated the exploitation of arid grounds. We provide evidence that integument brightness can impact the behavioral ecology of ectotherms.","Goldenberg, Jonathan; D039,; Alba, Liliana; Bisschop, Karen; Vanthournout, Bram; Shawkey, Matthew D",Commun Biol,,319

The experiment lasted 48 days. Sixteen crossbred cows with different lineages were submitted to the treatments and divided into two groups that alternated these treatments. Treatments were: traditional (5:30 a.m.) and alternative schedule (8:00 a.m.). The cows were evaluated by visual observation and recording of time spent grazing, ruminating and other activities. This observation was conducted every 5 minutes, 24 hours a day, to determine the time spent with feeding, rumination and other activities. That time was not affected (p > 0.05) by treatments. There were significant effects (p 0.05) for the number of rumination periods, being lower for the 5:30 a.m. milking. The number of bites per minute differed (p 0.05), being fewer for the alternative milking time. The implementation schedule of the alternative milking did not influence feeding behavior, rumination and other activities. However, it affected the number of rumination periods and bites per minute.","Mercês Mercês, Lucas; de Araújo Marques, Jair; Pires Barbosa, Larissa; Oliveira Brandão, Tiago; Passos Garcia, Maurício; Kelly de Araújo Costa, Aline",Acta Sci.

However, the desired recovery was not achieved with Arbidol. Many countries still use this drug in the treatment of COVID19. AIM: We aimed to determine whether Arbidol, the hemagglutinin esterase inhibitor used in the treatment of COVID-19, was effective against SARS Cov-2 in silico. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The similarity between hemagglutinin and spike proteins were reported due to the fact that inhibition properties of Arbidol and its 39 analogues were examined in detail against hemagglutinin esterase and spike glycoproteins. CID 1070884 and CID 1207786 were found to be more active against hemagglutinin esterase than in Arbidol, while these compounds were inactive against spike glycoproteins. The interaction mechanism was clarified between arbidol and spike proteins. Phenylalanine, tyrosine, glycine, lysine, and aspartic acid were found to be the headliner amino acids in the interactions between Arbidol and binding domains of spike glycoproteins in the SARS-CoV2 (Tab. 3, Fig. 8, Ref. 28).","Aktas, A; Tuzun, B; Taskin, A H; Sayin, K; Ataseven, H",Bratisl Lek Listy,,319

Investigation of this viral infection in the human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE) suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can enter these cells through interaction between its membrane-localized S protein with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 molecule on the host cell membrane. Further observation indicates distinct viral replication with a dynamic and moderate increase, whereby viral replication does not lead to a specific cytopathic effect but maintains a continuous release of progeny virions from infected cells. Although messenger RNA expression of various innate immune signaling molecules is altered in the cells, transcription of interferons-&#945; (IFN-&#945;), IFN-ß, and IFN-Î³ is unchanged. Furthermore, expression of some interleukins (IL) related to inflammatory reactions, such as IL-6, IL-2, and IL-8, is maintained at low levels, whereas that of ILs involved in immune regulation is upregulated. Interestingly, IL-22, an IL that functions mainly in tissue repair, shows very high expression. Collectively, these data suggest a distinct infection process for this virus in respiratory epithelial cells, which may be linked to its clinicopathological mechanism.","Liao, Yun; Li, Xueqi; Mou, Tangwei; Zhou, Xiaofang; Li, Dandan; Wang, Lichun; Zhang, Ying; Dong, Xingqi; Zheng, Huiwen; Guo, Lei; Liang, Yan; Jiang, Guorun; Fan, Shengtao; Xu, Xingli; Xie, Zhongping; Chen, Hongbo; Liu, Longding; Li, Qihan",J. med. virol,,319
390606,Industry Update covering November 2020,2021,"During infection with positive-strand RNA viruses, viral RNA synthesis associates with modified intracellular membranes that form unique and captivating structures in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. These viral replication organelles (ROs) play a key role in the replicative cycle of important human pathogens like coronaviruses, enteroviruses, or flaviviruses. From their discovery to date, progress in our understanding of viral ROs has closely followed new developments in electron microscopy (EM). This review gives a chronological account of this progress and an introduction to the different EM techniques that enabled it. With an ample repertoire of imaging modalities, EM is nowadays a versatile technique that provides structural and functional information at a wide range of scales. Together with well-established approaches like electron tomography or labeling methods, we examine more recent developments, such as volume scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and in situ cryotomography, which are only beginning to be applied to the study of viral ROs. We also highlight the first cryotomography analyses of viral ROs, which have led to the discovery of macromolecular complexes that may serve as RO channels that control the export of newly-made viral RNA. These studies are key first steps towards elucidating the macromolecular complexity of viral ROs.","Wolff, Georg; Bárcena, Montserrat",Viruses,,319

However, as of March 2021, countries in Africa are among those with the lowest reported incidence of COVID-19 worldwide (4). Whether this reflects effective mitigation, outbreak response, or demographic characteristics, (5) or indicates limitations in disease surveillance capacity is unclear (6). As countries implemented changes in funding, national policies, and testing strategies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, surveillance capacity might have been adversely affected. This study assessed whether changes in surveillance operations affected reporting in South Sudan; testing and case numbers reported during April 6, 2020-February 21, 2021, were analyzed relative to the timing of funding, policy, and strategy changes.* South Sudan, with a population of approximately 11 million, began COVID-19 surveillance in February 2020 and reported 6,931 cases through February 21, 2021. Surveillance data analyzed were from point of entry screening, testing of symptomatic persons who contacted an alert hotline, contact tracing, sentinel surveillance, and outbound travel screening. After travel restrictions were relaxed in early May 2020, international land and air travel resumed and mandatory requirements for negative pretravel test results were initiated. The percentage of all testing accounted for by travel screening increased >300%, from 21.1% to 91.0% during the analysis period, despite yielding the lowest percentage of positive tests among all sources. Although testing of symptomatic persons and contact tracing yielded the highest percentage of COVID-19 cases, the percentage of all testing from these sources decreased 88%, from 52.6% to 6.3% after support for these activities was reduced. Collectively, testing increased over the project period, but shifted toward sources least likely to yield positive results, possibly resulting in underreporting of cases. Policy, funding, and strategy decisions related to the COVID-19 pandemic response, such as those implemented in South Sudan, are important issues to consider when interpreting the epidemiology of COVID-19 outbreaks.","Shragai, Talya; Summers, Aimee; Olushayo, Olu; Rumunu, John; Mize, Valerie; Laku, Richard; Bunga, Sudhir",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,319

397711,Erratum to Insights Into the March 2021 Issue of the JOE [J Endod (2021) 343-344],2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent for the COVID-19 pandemic, which generated more than 1.82 million deaths in 2020 alone, in addition to 83.8 million infections. Currently, there is no antiviral medication to treat COVID-19. In the search for drug leads, marine-derived metabolites are reported here as prospective SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Two hundred and twenty-seven terpene natural products isolated from the biodiverse Red-Sea ecosystem were screened for inhibitor activity against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with molecular mechanics/generalized Born surface area binding energy calculations. On the basis of in silico analyses, six terpenes demonstrated high potency as Mpro inhibitors with &#916;Gbinding &#8804; -40.0 kcal/mol. The stability and binding affinity of the most potent metabolite, erylosides B, were compared to the human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitor, lopinavir. Erylosides B showed greater binding affinity towards SARS-CoV-2 Mpro than lopinavir over 100 ns with &#916;Gbinding values of -51.9 vs. -33.6 kcal/mol, respectively. Protein-protein interactions indicate that erylosides B biochemical signaling shares gene components that mediate severe acute respiratory syndrome diseases, including the cytokine- and immune-signaling components BCL2L1, IL2, and PRKC. Pathway enrichment analysis and Boolean network modeling were performed towards a deep dissection and mining of the erylosides B target-function interactions. The current study identifies erylosides B as a promising anti-COVID-19 drug lead that warrants further in vitro and in vivo testing.","Ibrahim, Mahmoud A A; Abdelrahman, Alaa H M; Mohamed, Tarik A; Atia, Mohamed A M; Al-Hammady, Montaser A M; Abdeljawaad, Khlood A A; Elkady, Eman M; Moustafa, Mahmoud F; Alrumaihi, Faris; Allemailem, Khaled S; El-Seedi, Hesham R; Paré, Paul W; Efferth, Thomas; Hegazy, Mohamed-Elamir F",Molecules (Basel),,319

METHODS: A total of 1211 non-severe patients with COVID-19 were retrospectively enrolled. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify the risk factors associated with long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding, and a prediction model was established. RESULTS: In the training set, 796 patients were divided into the long-term (> 21 days) group (n = 116, 14.6%) and the short-term (&#8804; 21 days) group (n = 680, 85.4%) based on their viral shedding duration. Multivariate analysis identified that age > 50 years, comorbidity, CD4-positive T-lymphocytes count (CD4 + T cell) &#8804; 410 cells/ul, C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, and the corticosteroid use were independent risk factors for long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. Incorporating the five risk factors, a prediction model, named as the CCCCA score, was established, and its area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.87 in the training set and 0.83 in the validation set, respectively. In the validation set, using a cut-off of 8 points, we found sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 51.7%, 92.2%, 33.3%, and 96.2%, respectively. Long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding increased from 14/370 (3.8%) in patients with CCCCA < 8 points to 15/45 (33.3%) in patients with CCCCA &#8805; 8 points. CONCLUSION: Using the CCCCA score, clinicians can identify patients with long-term SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding.","Huang, Chen Lu; Fei, Ling; Li, WeiXia; Xu, Wei; Xie, Xu Dong; Li, Qiang; Chen, Liang",,,319

A retrospective cross-sectional study was performed primarily to investigate the potential skin damage and secondary impacts on wellbeing of staff resulting from these practices. Additionally the availability and uptake of occupational health services and moisturisers in the work place was also assessed. The survey was distributed to NHS staff between April and May 2020 and asked questions regarding skin damage, impact on wellbeing and availability and utilisation of occupational health input and moisturisers. Of the 211 responders, 167 washed their hands more than ten times per shift. Three quarters of these reported cracks or fissures in one or more regions of their hands, most frequently to the back of the hands or web spaces. Amongst the 157 staff who wore FFP3 masks, redness of the nasal area was most frequently reported with 8% reporting facial blisters. 36% of staff reported a substantial impact on one or more aspects of their wellbeing. Only 7% of respondents had received specialist advice, yet a quarter (26%) had made or anticipated needing changes to their occupational duties. The majority (63%) felt they required no specialist input, despite 38% of these reporting a substantial detriment to their wellbeing. Handwashing and face mask use is resulting in skin damage amongst healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with associated detriment to wellbeing.

406277,Europäische Währungsunion: schlecht gerüstet für große Krisen,2021,"ABSTRACT: The impact of COVID-19, on the health and safety of patients, staff, and healthcare organizations, has yet to be fully uncovered. Patient adverse events, such as hospital-acquired pressure injuries (HAPIs), have been problematic for decades. The introduction of a pandemic to an environment that is potentially at-risk for adverse events may result in unintended patient safety and quality concerns. We use the learning health system framework to motivate our understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of HAPIs within our health system. Using a retrospective, observational design, we used descriptive statistics to evaluate trends in HAPI from March to July 2020. Hospital-acquired pressure injury numbers have fluctuated from a steady increase from March-May 2020, hitting a peak high of 90 cases in the month of May. However, the trend in the total all stage HAPIs began to decline in June 2020, with a low of 51 in July, the lowest number since March 2020. Patients evaluated in this study did not have a longitudinal increase in HAPIs from March-July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite similarities in illness severity between the two time points. Our experience has demonstrated the ability of our organizational leaders to learn quickly during crisis.","Polancich, Shea; Hall, Allyson G; Miltner, Rebecca; Poe, Terri; Enogela, Ene M; Montgomery, Aoyjai P; Patrician, Patricia A",J Healthc Qual,,319
406669,New Vaccine-Manufacturing Methods Are Moving Away From the Egg,2021,"RATIONALE: The COVID-19 pandemic poses extraordinary challenges to public health. OBJECTIVE: Because the novel coronavirus is highly contagious, the widespread use of preventive measures such as masking, physical distancing, and eventually vaccination is needed to bring it under control. We hypothesized that accepting conspiracy theories that were circulating in mainstream and social media early in the COVID-19 pandemic in the US would be negatively related to the uptake of preventive behaviors and also of vaccination when a vaccine becomes available. METHOD: A national probability survey of US adults (N = 1050) was conducted in the latter half of March 2020 and a follow-up with 840 of the same individuals in July 2020. The surveys assessed adoption of preventive measures recommended by public health authorities, vaccination intentions, conspiracy beliefs, perceptions of threat, belief about the safety of vaccines, political ideology, and media exposure patterns. RESULTS: Belief in three COVID-19-related conspiracy theories was highly stable across the two periods and inversely related to the (a) perceived threat of the pandemic, (b) taking of preventive actions, including wearing a face mask, (c) perceived safety of vaccination, and (d) intention to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conspiracy beliefs in March predicted subsequent mask-wearing and vaccination intentions in July even after controlling for action taken and intentions in March. Although adopting preventive behaviors was predicted by political ideology and conservative media reliance, vaccination intentions were less related to political ideology. Mainstream television news use predicted adopting both preventive actions and vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Because belief in COVID-related conspiracy theories predicts resistance to both preventive behaviors and future vaccination for the virus, it will be critical to confront both conspiracy theories and vaccination misinformation to prevent further spread of the virus in the US. Reducing those barriers will require continued messaging by public health authorities on mainstream media and in particular on politically conservative outlets that have supported COVID-related conspiracy theories.","Romer, Daniel; Jamieson, Kathleen Hall",Soc Sci Med,,319

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among residents in Australia, including patients, frontline health and other essential service workers, and community members during June 2020. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10); level of fear was assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S); and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the extent of psychological distress, level of fear and coping strategies while adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 587 participants, the majority (391, 73.2%) were 30-59 years old and female (363, 61.8%). More than half (349, 59.5%) were born outside Australia and two-third (418, 71.5%) completed at least a Bachelor's degree. The majority (401, 71.5%) had a source of income, 243 (42.3%) self-identified as a frontline worker, and 335 (58.9%) reported financial impact due to COVID-19. Comorbidities such as pre-existing mental health conditions (AOR 3.13, 95% CIs 1.12-8.75), increased smoking (8.66, 1.08-69.1) and alcohol drinking (2.39, 1.05-5.47) over the last four weeks, high levels of fear (2.93, 1.83-4.67) and being female (1.74, 1.15-2.65) were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Perceived distress due to change of employment status (4.14, 1.39-12.4), alcohol drinking (3.64, 1.54-8.58), providing care to known or suspected cases (3.64, 1.54-8.58), being female (1.56, 1.00-2.45), being 30-59 years old (2.29, 1.21-4.35) and having medium to high levels of psychological distress (2.90, 1.82-5.62) were associated with a higher level of fear; while healthcare service use in the last four weeks was associated with medium to high resilience.

The vicious tentacles of the disease have been disseminated worldwide with unknown complications and repercussions. Advanced COVID-19 syndrome is characterized by the uncontrolled and elevated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressed immunity, leading to the cytokine storm. The uncontrolled and dysregulated secretion of inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines is positively associated with the severity of the viral infection and mortality rate. The secretion of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1, and IL-6 leads to a hyperinflammatory response by recruiting macrophages, T and B cells in the lung alveolar cells. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that immune cells such as macrophages recruit inflammatory monocytes in the alveolar cells and allow the production of large amounts of cytokines in the alveoli, leading to a hyperinflammatory response in severely ill patients with COVID-19. This cascade of events may lead to multiple organ failure, acute respiratory distress, or pneumonia. Although the disease has a higher survival rate than other chronic diseases, the incidence of complications in the geriatric population are considerably high, with more systemic complications. This review sheds light on the pivotal roles played by various inflammatory markers in COVID-19-related complications. Different molecular pathways, such as the activation of JAK and JAK/STAT signaling are crucial in the progression of cytokine storm;hence, various mechanisms, immunological pathways, and functions of cytokines and other inflammatory markers have been discussed. A thorough understanding of cytokines' molecular pathways and their activation procedures will add more insight into understanding immunopathology and designing appropriate drugs, therapies, and control measures to counter COVID-19. Recently, anti-inflammatory drugs and several antiviral drugs have been reported as effective therapeutic drug candidates to control hypercytokinemia or cytokine storm. Hence, the present review also discussed prospective anti-inflammatory and relevant immunomodulatory drugs currently in various trial phases and their possible implications.","Rabaan, A.

It was first identified in Wuhan City in China in December 2019. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to identify the top 15 countries with spatial mapping of the confirmed cases. A comparison was done between the identified top 15 countries for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and an advanced autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used for predicting the COVID-19 disease spread trajectories for the next 2 months. METHODS: The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. The spatial map is useful to identify the intensity of COVID-19 infections in the top 15 countries and the continents. The recent reported data for confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the last 3 months was represented and compared between the top 15 infected countries. The advanced ARIMA model was used for predicting future data based on time series data. The ARIMA model provides a weight to past values and error values to correct the model prediction, so it is better than other basic regression and exponential methods. The comparison of recent cumulative and predicted cases was done for the top 15 countries with confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19. RESULTS: The top 15 countries with a high number of confirmed cases were stratified to include the data in a mathematical model. The identified top 15 countries with cumulative cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 were compared. The United States, the United Kingdom, Turkey, China, and Russia saw a relatively fast spread of the disease. There was a fast recovery ratio in China, Switzerland, Germany, Iran, and Brazil, and a slow recovery ratio in the United States, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Russia, and Italy. There was a high death rate ratio in Italy and the United Kingdom and a lower death rate ratio in Russia, Turkey, China, and the United States. The ARIMA model was used to predict estimated confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for the top 15 countries from April 24 to July 7, 2020. Its value is represented with 95%, 80%, and 70% confidence interval values. The validation of the ARIMA model was done using the Akaike information criterion value; its values were about 20, 14, and 16 for cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of COVID-19, respectively, which represents acceptable results. CONCLUSIONS: The observed predicted values showed that the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries will double in all the observed countries except China, Switzerland, and Germany. It was also observed that the death and recovery rates were rose faster when compared to confirmed cases over the next 2 months. The associated mortality rate will be much higher in the United States, Spain, and Italy followed by France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. The forecast analysis of the COVID-19 dynamics showed a different angle for the whole world, and it looks scarier than imagined, but recovery numbers start looking promising by July 7, 2020.","Singh, Ram Kumar; Rani, Meenu; Bhagavathula, Akshaya Srikanth; Sah, Ranjit; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Kalita, Himangshu; Nanda, Chintan; Sharma, Shashi; Sharma, Yagya Datt; Rabaan, Ali A; Rahmani, Jamal; Kumar, Pavan",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,319

The LAP-VEGaS guidelines were formed to guide the production of high-quality surgical videos. The aim of this study is to use the LAP-VEGaS guidelines to determine if videos of LSGs available on Youtube® are of an acceptable standard for surgical educational purposes. METHODS: A YouTube® search was performed using the term laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. Appropriate videos were analysed by two individuals using the sixteen LAP-VEGaS guidelines. RESULTS: A total of 575 videos were found, of which 202 videos were included and analysed using the LAP-VEGaS guidelines. The median video guideline score was 6/16 with 89% of videos meeting less than half of all guidelines. There was no correlation between the LAP-VEGaS score and view count. CONCLUSIONS: There is an abundance of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy educational videos available on YouTube®; however, when analysed using the LAP-VEGaS guidelines, the majority do not meet acceptable educational standards for surgical training purposes.","Chapman, David; Weaver, Abigail; Sheikh, Laila; MacCormick, Andrew D; Poole, Garth",Obes. surg,,319
411643,Multi-objective Optimization Approach Based on Deterministic and Metaheuristic Techniques to Resource Management in Health Crisis Scenarios Under Uncertainty,2021,"The influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 cause trivial upper and severe lower respiratory infections (Influenza virus 290,000 to 650,000 deaths/year). These viruses come into contact with the airways either by direct projection, by secondary inhalation of airborne droplets, or by handling (fomites). The objective of this article is to clarify the mechanisms of production and penetration of droplets of secretions emitted during all expiratory phenomena likely to transport these viruses and come into contact with the respiratory mucosa. The droplets>5µm follow the laws of ballistics, those<5µm follow Brownian motion and remain suspended in the air. The aerosols of droplets are very heterogeneous whether the subject is healthy or sick. During an infectious period, not all droplets contain viral RNA. If these RNAs are detectable around patients, on surfaces, and in the ambient air at variable distances according to the studies (from 0.5m to beyond the patient's room), this is without prejudice to the infectious nature (viability) of the virus and the minimum infectious dose. There is a time lag between the patient's infectious period and that of RNA detection for both viruses. Subsequently, the inhaled particles must meet the laws of fluid dynamics (filtration) to settle in the respiratory tree. All of this partly explains the contagiousness and the clinical expression of these two viruses from the olfactory cleft to the alveoli.","de Gabory, L; Alharbi, A; Kérimian, M; Lafon, M-E",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,,319
412956,Efficient network immunization under limited knowledge,2020,"Population migration and urban traffic are two important aspects of the socioeconomic system. We analyze the trends of social production and resumption of life after the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-influenced Spring Festival in 2020 with statistics on reported cases of COVID-19 from China's National Health Commission and big data from Baidu Migration (a platform collecting population migration data). We find that (1) the distribution of COVID-19 cases throughout mainland China has a specific spatial pattern. Provinces in eastern China have more reported cases than those in western China, and provinces adjacent to Hubei have more confirmed COVID-19 cases than nonadjacent provinces. Densely populated regions with well-developed economies and transportation are more likely to have cluster infection incidents. (2) The COVID-19 epidemic severely impacts the return of the migrant population in the Spring Festival travel rush, as demonstrated by the significant reduction in the return scale, along with the extended timespan and uncertainty regarding the end of the travel rush. Among 33 provinces, special administrative regions, autonomous regions and municipalities, 23 of them (approximately 70%) have a return rate below 60%. Hubei, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia have the lowest return rates (below 5%), whereas the return rates in Hainan and Shandong, 272.72% and 97.35%, respectively, indicate the best trend of resumption. Due to government regulations, the population return in densely populated and well-developed regions shows a positive trend. (3) The resumption of urban traffic is slow and varies greatly in different regions. The urban traffic conditions in 22 provinces and municipalities have a more than 60% level of resumption. Guizhou and Yunnan have the highest level of resumption of urban traffic, whereas Xinjiang, Hubei, and Heilongjiang have the lowest (29.37%, 35.76%, and 37.90%, respectively). However, provinces and municipalities with well-developed intercity traffic have a lower level of resumption, mainly because of regulatory methods such as lockdowns and traffic restrictions. The increased public awareness of epidemic prevention and the decreased frequency of outdoor activities are also two positive factors slowing the spread of the epidemic. (4) Time will be necessary to fully resume social production and life throughout China. Xining and Jinan have the highest levels of resumption, 82.14% and 71.51%, respectively. Urumqi and Wuhan are the cities with the lowest levels of resumption, only 0.11% and 0.61%, respectively. Currently, 12 of 33 provinces and municipalities have levels of resumption of more than 80%; among them, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Gansu have with the highest levels of resumption and have nearly resumed the 2019 levels of work and life, whereas Xinjiang and Hubei have the lowest resumption rates, only 0.09% and 7.57%, respectively. Thus, relevant government departments should focus more on densely populated and well-developed provinces and cities when applying epidemic prevention and work resumption methods. We reveal the general conditions of the epidemic and the population return scale across China, along with urban traffic conditions and the resumption of social production and life under COVID-19, providing a scientific basis for local governments to make further decisions on work resumption.","Xu, Xinliang; Wang, Shihao; Dong, Jinhui; Shen, Zhicheng; Xu, Shuwan",PLoS One,,319
413121,Transformers for Headline Selection for Russian News Clusters,2021-06-19,"Optimal quarantining strategy of suppressing interdependent epidemics spreading over complex networks is a critical issue. In this paper, we first establish a framework to capture the coupling between two epidemics, and then analyze the system's equilibrium states by categorizing them into three classes, and deriving their stability conditions. The designed quarantining strategy globally optimizes the trade-off between the quarantining cost and the severity of epidemics in the network. In addition, we provide structural results on the predictability of epidemic spreading by showing the existence and uniqueness of the solution. We also demonstrate the robustness of quarantining strategy by showing the continuity of epidemic severity with respect to the applied quarantining effort. A gradient descent algorithm based on a fixed-point iterative scheme is proposed to find the optimal quarantining strategy. Depending on the system parameters, the quarantining strategy can lead to switching between equilibria of the interdependent epidemic network as the control cost varies. Finally, we use case studies to corroborate and illustrate the obtained theoretical results.","Chen, Juntao; Huang, Yunhan; Zhang, Rui; Zhu, Quanyan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14262v1.pdf,319

One such symptom, anosmia, may be a neurologic marker of coronavirus infection and the initial presentation of infected patients. Because this symptom is not routinely investigated by imaging, there is conflicting literature on neuroimaging abnormalities related to COVID-19-related anosmia. We present a novel case of COVID-19 anosmia with definitive olfactory bulb atrophy compared with pre-COVID imaging. The patient had prior MR imaging related to a history of prolactinoma that provided baseline volumes of her olfactory bulbs. After a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 and approximately 2 months duration of anosmia, an MRI was performed that showed clear interval olfactory bulb atrophy. This diagnostic finding is of prognostic importance and indicates that the olfactory entry point to the brain should be further investigated to improve our understanding of COVID infectious pathophysiology.","Chiu, Andrew; Fischbein, Nancy; Wintermark, Max; Zaharchuk, Greg; Yun, Paul T; Zeineh, Michael",Neuroradiology,,319

METHODS: This prospective, cross-sectional comparative study enrolled 25 amblyopic patients and 25 healthy controls. All patients and controls underwent OCTA and OCT imagining. Macular vessel densities of the Superficial Capillary Plexus (SCP) and Deep Capillary Plexus (DCP) and retinal thickness were measured by OCTA and ganglion cell layer (GCL) by OCT. RESULTS: SCP density at the fovea and parafovea was significantly lower in amblyopic eyes than in fellow eyes and control group. DCP density at the fovea was significantly lower in amblyopic eyes than fellow eyes and control group. Mean GCL thickness on OCT was 0.73 ± 0.07 µm in amblyopic eyes, 0.75 ± 0.06 µm in fellow eyes and 0.77 ± 0.06 µm in the control group. GCL volume was significantly lower in amblyopic eyes than the fellow eyes. The SCP and DCP and GCL thickness were not affected by the severity of amblyopia. CONCLUSION: Macular vessel densities of the SCP and DCP of eyes with amblyopia is lower compared to the fellow non-amblyopic eyes and the control group. The thickness of GCL was lower in amblyopic eyes than fellow eyes while the severity of amblyopia did not have any impact on these structures. Microvascular retinal structures may have been affected in the course of amblyopia development.","Yilmaz Cinar, F G; Ozkan, G",Int. ophthalmol,,319

416658,When no news is bad news -- Detection of negative events from news media content,2021-02-12,"INTRODUCTION: During the state of alarm established in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of the face-to-face outpatient consultations were cancelled and a telephone consultation was established to follow up coloproctological patients. The objective of this study was to analyse the efficacy of telemedicine (by telephone) in monitoring patients in a coloproctology unit, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Prospective descriptive study of consecutive patients in a single centre. The result of the teleconsultation was classified as discharge, resolved visit or reprogramming and was analysed by different diagnostic groups. RESULTS: From March 19th to April 17th, 2020, the teleconsultation of 190 patients was carried out. The response rate was 94.2% (179). The diagnostic categories of the patients attended were: 51 (26.9%) colorectal neoplasia, 48 (25.3%) proctological pathology, 72 (37.9%) pelvic floor dysfunctions and 19 (10%) other benign pathologies. 105 (55.26%) could be recited as if they had come in person. Eleven (5.8%) patients were discharged. No significant differences were found between the different diagnostic categories and the resolution of the teleconsultation. The reasons for reprogramming are analyzed in the study. CONCLUSION: In the context of a pandemic, teleconsultation has allowed 61% of follow-up visits to be definitively solved, avoiding the reprogramming of 116 patients. The new social and health paradigm after the pandemic will require a rethinking of our healthcare model, and in many aspects, telemedicine can offer tools for this.","Muñoz-Duyos, Arantxa; Abarca-Alvarado, Natalia; Lagares-Tena, Laura; Sobrerroca, Laura; Costa, Daniel; Boada, Mercè; Ureña, Dolors; Delgado-Rivilla, Salvadora",Cir.

416964,News from the BIPM laboratories—2020,2021,"The infection of the novel coronavirus that originated from Wuhan, China in December 2019 converted rapidly into a pandemic by March 11, 2020. Whereas the infection mortality rate is not completely understood, it seems to be significantly beyond that of other recent pandemics (e.g., H1N1 pandemic). This paper discusses moral injury in the context of disaster and epidemic and how easily the moral psychology of individuals and society can be shaken. Moral injury is a multiscientific concept involving psychology, culture, and religion. Amid the outbreak of the novel coronavirus pneumonia, immoral behaviors and events such as violence, injury, and illness have also caused different degrees of impact on the moral standards of individuals, confusing moral cognition, destroying moral emotion, and weakening moral toughness, resulting in varying degrees of moral injury. If there is no national health, there will be no positive society for all. Based on this, the public needs to pay close attention to the moral health of the whole people and effectively avoid the occurrence of moral injury.

417376,Enabling the sustainable space era by developing the infrastructure for a space economy,2021-08-23,"Demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks, gloves, and gowns has increased significantly since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge, we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent [Formula: see text] queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately 90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.","Furman, Eugene; Cressman, Alex; Shin, Saeha; Kuznetsov, Alexey; Razak, Fahad; Verma, Amol; Diamant, Adam",Health care manag. sci,,319

Using Artificial Intelligence to Predict COVID-19 Outcomes with Socio-demographic Data (preprint),2020,"BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality (VR) as a distraction technique in the management of acute pain and anxiety during amniocentesis. STUDY DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial was conducted between September 2020 and October 2020 involving 60 women undergoing mid-trimester amniocentesis. Thirty women were assigned randomly to the VR intervention (immersive video content as a distraction method) group and 30 to the standard care group using a predetermined randomization code. The primary outcome measure was the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, along with the women's ratings of their extent of anxiety experienced during the procedure. The VAS consisted of a 10 cm line ranging from 0 to 10 (anchored by 0 = no pain and 10=very severe pain). Anxiety was assessed on Spielberger's state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) questionnaire. RESULTS: The patients' characteristics and obstetric data were similar in both groups. The ratings on the VAS indicated that the VR intervention was associated with significantly less pain than the ratings in the standard of care group; namely, 2.5 ± 1.5 vs. 3.8 ± 1.7, respectively (95 % CI 0.44-2.13; p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in maternal anxiety levels before and after amniocentesis. CONCLUSION: The VR intervention as a distractive technique emerged as effective in reducing pain during amniocentesis. It is easy to use, relatively inexpensive, has the advantage of no serious side effects, and may decrease the fear of pain that can affect patients' experiences and compliance with this procedure.","Melcer, Yaakov; Maymon, Ron; Gal-Kochav, Maayan; Pekar-Zlotin, Marina; Levinsohn-Tavor, Orna; Meizner, Israel; Svirsky, Ran",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,319
420331,LUCIA: An open source device for disinfection of N95 masks using UV-C radiation,2021,"Despite considerable progress over the years, tuberculosis (TB) still remains the top cause of death among the infectious diseases and has devastating socio-economic consequences for people in low- and middle-income countries. To add to this, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened delivery of TB care across the globe. As a global community, we have committed to end the TB epidemic by 2030. The World Health Organization has framed a strategy to achieve this goal which consists of three pillars namely i) integrated patient-centred care and prevention, ii) bold policies and systems and iii) intensified research and innovation. An analysis of the performance of national tuberculosis programmes (NTPs) across the globe against the ten priority indicators recommended for monitoring the end TB strategy show that there are huge gaps at every step in the cascade of care of TB patients. In our view, these gaps reflect suboptimal implementation of existing strategies known to be efficacious and operational research (OR) is one of the best available tools to plug the gaps. In this paper, we define what operational research is and how it differs from other kinds of research. We also share our views and experiences about how operational research can be used by NTPs to identify implementation gaps and their reasons, and develop and test possible solutions - which are then integrated to make changes to policy and practice and eventually improve programme outcomes. OR can be defined as research into interventions, strategies and tools which produces practical useable knowledge that can be used to enhance the quality, coverage, effectiveness and efficiency of disease control programmes, health services or health systems in which the research is conducted. The key steps in integrating operational research in the NTPs include: i) securing political commitment reflected by inclusion of OR in the national strategic plans of NTPs and earmarked funding, ii) having a critical mass of dedicated and trained human resources in OR within the NTP, iii) setting research priorities and steering the direction of research in the country, iv) using output-oriented models of capacity building such as the Structured Operational Research Training Initiative (SORT IT) model and building communities of practice, v) harnessing existing capacity in the country by forging partnerships with academia, vi) NTP-led nationwide, multicentre OR studies, vii) providing access to anonymized patient and programme surveillance data, vii) creating a forum for evidence dissemination and fostering policy change and ix) monitoring and accountability. In conclusion, ending the TB epidemic will not be possible without new tools (diagnostics, drugs, vaccines) and a multi-sectoral response involving stakeholders beyond the health ministry, including private providers, patients and communities. However, timely conduct of operational research to fine-tune programme implementation and ensuring proper deployment of new tools will be equally crucial to maximize the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions and ultimately contribute towards ending TB.","Kumar, Ajay Mv; Harries, Anthony D; Satyanarayana, Srinath; Thekkur, Pruthu; Shewade, Hemant D; Zachariah, Rony",Indian J Tuberc,,319

The WHO, ECDC and CDC have issued conflicting guidelines on the use of respiratory filters (N95) by HCWs. We searched PubMed, Embase and The Cochrane Library from the inception to March 21, 2020 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing N95 respirators versus surgical masks for prevention of COVID-19 or any other respiratory infection among HCWs. The grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) was used to evaluate the quality of evidence. Four RCTs involving 8736 HCWs were included. We did not find any trial specifically on prevention of COVID-19. However, wearing N95 respirators can prevent 73 more (95% CI 46-91) clinical respiratory infections per 1000 HCWs compared to surgical masks (2 RCTs; 2594 patients; low quality of evidence). A protective effect of N95 respirators in laboratory-confirmed bacterial colonization (RR = 0.41; 95%CI 0.28-0.61) was also found. A trend in favour of N95 respirators was observed in preventing laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza like illness. We found no direct high quality evidence on whether N95 respirators are better than surgical masks for HCWs protection from SARS-CoV-2. However, low quality evidence suggests that N95 respirators protect HCWs from clinical respiratory infections. This finding should be contemplated to decide the best strategy to support the resilience of healthcare systems facing the potentially catastrophic SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Iannone, Primiano; Castellini, Greta; Coclite, Daniela; Napoletano, Antonello; Fauci, Alice Josephine; Iacorossi, Laura; D039,; Angelo, Daniela; Renzi, Cristina; La Torre, Giuseppe; Mastroianni, Claudio M; Gianola, Silvia",PLoS One,,319

We performed a retrospective observational study in order to evaluate the profile of people consulting the Unit annexed to the Muniz Hospital, during the period comprising epidemiological weeks 28 to 42, 2020. The total number of consultations was 12 571;6801 (54.1%) patients were male, and the average age was 38 years. A total of 2499 (26.3 %) of 9501 swabs resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2 when analyzed by RT- PCR. The average age of confirmed COVID-19 patients was 37.9 years;1367 (54.7%) were male and 143 (5.7%) required hospitalization at the first consultation. As many as 6097 (48.5%) participants were beneficiaries of social security or prepaid medicine. Only 160 (1.3%) were HIV positive, with COVID-19 coinfection diagnosed in 39/160 (24.4%), of which 9 (23.1%) required hospitalization. Only 128 (1%) had tuberculosis (TB);TB/COVID-19 coinfection was diagnosed in 31 of them (24.2%), and 8/31 (25.8%) required hospitalization. The triple association HIV/TB /COVID-19 was reported in only 2 patients. Contrary to expectations, TB and HIV, the two main diseases treated in our hospital, were under-represented in this Emergency Unit, but the requirement of hospitalization for coinfected patients was quite frequent. This may be due to late consultation caused by mobility and assistance restrictions during quarantine. Interestingly, our data also indicate that the city's public sector had to absorb unsatisfied demand from the private sector and suburban population.","Lagrutta, L.; Sotelo, C. A.; Estecho, B.

Whether COVID19 from Delta infection differs to infection with other variants in children is unknown. Methods Through the prospective COVID Symptom Study, 109,626 UK school-aged children were proxy-reported between December 28, 2020 and July 8, 2021. We selected all symptomatic children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were proxy-reported at least weekly, within two timeframes: December 28, 2020 to May 6, 2021 (Alpha (B.1.1.7) the main UK circulating variant); and May 26 to July 8, 2021 (Delta the main UK circulating variant). We assessed illness profiles (symptom prevalence, duration, and burden), hospital presentation, and presence of long (>28 day) illness; and calculated odds ratios for symptoms presenting within the first 28 days of illness. Findings 694 (276 younger [5 11 years], 418 older [12 17 years]) symptomatic children tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 with Alpha infection and 706 (227 younger and 479 older) children with Delta infection. Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2 9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2 9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants. Symptom burden over the first 28 days was slightly greater with Delta compared with Alpha infection (in younger children, 3 (IQR 2 5) with Alpha, 4 (IQR 2 7) with Delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3 8) with Alpha and 6 (IQR 3 9) with Delta infection in older children). The odds of several symptoms were higher with Delta than Alpha infection, including headache and fever. Few children presented to hospital, and long illness duration was uncommon, with either variant. Interpretation COVID-19 in UK school-aged children due to SARSCoV2 Delta strain B.1.617.2 resembles illness due to the Alpha variant B.1.1.7., with short duration and similar symptom burden.","Molteni, Erika; Sudre, Carole Helene; Canas, Liane S; Bhopal, Sunil S; Hughes, Robert C; Chen, Liyuan; Deng, Jie; Murray, Benjamin; Kerfoot, Eric; Antonelli, Michela S; Graham, Mark S; Klaser, Kerstin; May, Anna; Hu, Christina; Pujol, Joan Capdevila; Wolf, Jonathan; Hammers, Alexander; Spector, Timothy D; Ourselin, Sebastien; Modat, Marc; Steves, Claire; Absoud, Michael; Duncan, Emma L",,,319

In this paper, I examine whether normative powers can be adequately explained normatively, by appeal to norms of a practice, normative principles, human interests, or values Can normative explanations of normative powers explain how an exercise of the will can afford us special freedom in determining our reasons? I argue that normative approaches to answering this question prove to be inadequate To vindicate the thought that normative powers can make our reasons ‘up to us’, we need an altogether different approach to understanding them, one that is located not in the normative but in the metaphysical I end the paper by sketching a metaphysical explanation of normative powers This metaphysical defence of normative powers provides a window into a different, more agent-centered way of thinking about rational agency","Chang, Ruth",Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume,,319

METHODS: Three search engines were searched on 13 April 2020 for specific Arabic terms on COVID-19. The first 100 consecutive websites from each engine were analyzed for eligibility, which resulted in a sample of 36 websites. These websites were subjected to quality assessments using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks tool, the DISCERN tool, and Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode) certification. The readability of the websites was assessed using an online readability calculator. RESULTS: Among the 36 eligible websites, only one (2.7%) was HONcode certified. No website attained a high score based on the criteria of the DISCERN tool; the mean score of all websites was 31.5 ± 12.55. As regards the JAMA benchmarks results, a mean score of 2.08 ± 1.05 was achieved by the websites; however, only four (11.1%) met all the JAMA criteria.

431874,Comment,2020,"Eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE) is a rare condition with a chronic relapsing and remitting course, characterized by the presence of annular or polycyclic erythematous and plaque lesions and prominent tissue eosinophilia on histopathology. There is an ongoing discussion on whether EAE is a subset of Wells syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis) or a separate entity. To date, few cases of EAE have been reported in the literature; of these, about 40 cases were in adults and fewer than ten cases were in children. Given the rarity of this condition, there are no clear recommendations for its management. Systemic corticosteroids and antimalarials are the most commonly used medications used to treat EAE, but many cases have been reported in the literature that are resistant to treatment with these medications. Here, we present a 65-year-old female with EAE refractory to numerous systemic therapies (corticosteroids, hydroxychloroquine, dapsone, doxycycline, methotrexate) who showed a good response to mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks interleukin-5. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of mepolizumab therapy in a patient with EAE. We also review other treatment strategies that have been used to manage this condition to date. Targeting cytokines crucial for the functioning of eosinophils may be a novel direction in the management of EAE, but prospective, double-blinded and placebo-controlled studies are needed to provide further evidence.","Zychowska, Magdalena; Tutka, Klaudia; Reich, Adam",Dermatol Ther (Heidelb),,319

Considering the sequences of cases, deaths, and recovered of all Spanish regions, it combines modern Deep Learning (DL) techniques for analyzing sequences with the usual Bayesian Poisson-Gamma model for counts. DL model provides a suitable description of observed sequences but no reliable uncertainty quantification around it can be obtained. To overcome this we use the prediction from DL as an expert elicitation of the expected number of counts and thus obtaining the posterior predictive distribution of counts in an orthodox Bayesian analysis. The overall resulting model allows us to either predict the future evolution of the sequences on all regions, as well as, estimating the consequences of eventual future scenarios.","Cabras, Stefano",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10335v1.pdf,319

A total of 24 hospitalized patients aged between 30-80 years who were admitted to the Tarsus Medical Park Hospital between February to March 2020 was included in the study. The patients were divided into LINCOCIN® and AZITRO® treatment groups. Bronchoalveolar-lavage PCR results were compared after treatment. The mean age was 58.4±15.4 years in the LINCOCIN® group and 59.1±16.6 years in the AZITRO® group. In the LINCOCIN® group, the rate of males was 66.7% and it was 58.3% in the AZITRO® group. There were no statistical differences in terms of age and gender between the groups. On the 6th day after starting treatment, negative bronchoalveolar PCR result was 83.3% in the LINCOCIN® group and 33.3% in the AZITRO® group. The negative bronchoalveolar PCR proportion was significantly higher in the LINCOCIN® group than in the AZITRO® group. LINCOCIN® usage may be more appropriate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia.

However, a unified theory of OT effects has yet to be developed. Relatedly, growing concerns about the robustness of conclusions drawn in the field have been raised. The current article contributes to this debate by reporting on and discussing key conclusions from a systematic review of published studies addressing the interactive effects of intranasal OT (IN-OT) administration on psychosocial outcomes in a healthy population. The review indicates that (a) tested interactive IN-OT effects were highly heterogeneous; (b) for most published interactions, no replication was attempted; (c) when attempted, replications were largely unsuccessful; (d) significance was unrelated to sample size; (e) statistical power was critically low and unrelated to the rate of significant results; and (f) research practices were characteristic of an exploratory approach. This concerning state of affairs makes it virtually impossible to tease apart true from false interactive IN-OT effects.

Over 80% of people diagnosed with COVID-19 experience a mild illness and there is a need for community management to support these people in their home. In this paper we present, a telephone based COVID-19 community monitoring service developed in an Australian public health network, and we describe the rapid implementation of the service and the demographic and clinical characteristics of those enrolled. A retrospective mixed methods evaluation of the COVID-19 community monitoring service using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. Eight hundred and fifty COVID-19 positive patients were enrolled, 54% female, 45% male, mean age 34 years SD 17. Four hundred and nine (48%) patients were born outside Australia. Among the 850 patients, 305 (36%) were classified as having a high risk of serious illness from COVID-19. The most prevalent risk factors were cardiovascular disease (37%), lung disease (30%) and age over 60 years (26%). The most common reported ongoing symptoms were fatigue (55%), breathing issues (26%) and mental health issues such as low mood (19%). There were no deaths in patients that participated in the service. The process of risk stratification undertaken with telephone triage was effective in determining risk of prolonged illness from COVID-19. Telephone monitoring by trained health professionals has a strong potential in the effective management of patients with a mild COVID-19 illness.","Clarke, A C; Hull, S; Semciw, A I; Jessup, R L; Campbell, D; Fabri, A M; Tully, N; Bramston, C; Hayes, J",J. community health,,319

METHODS: The present study is a descriptive type of research. The study's sample group consisted of 735 people and included healthcare workers (n = 426) and service sector employees (n = 309). In this study, sociodemographic characteristics, employment in the healthcare or service sector, having a relative with COVID-19, losing any relative due to COVID-19 and taking preventive measures were taken as independent variables. The dependent variable was the score from the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). RESULTS: The FCV-19S median value was 14 for the service sector and 17 for the healthcare sector. While no difference was found between occupational groups and the FCV-19S score in the service sector, there was a significant correlation between occupational groups and the FCV-19S score in the healthcare sector. The FCV-19S median value of midwives was 21, and it was higher than those of other occupational groups were. The mean FCV-19S scores of those who thought they had COVID-19 symptoms due to stress or panic were higher among the healthcare workers. CONCLUSION: The healthcare workers need more support in fear management than those engaged in service sector employees, and it is recommended that raising the awareness of service sector employees in terms of compliance with preventive measures should be prioritized.","Kabasakal, Esma; Özpulat, Funda; Akca, Aysegül; Özcebe, L Hilal",Int. arch. occup. environ. health,,319
444888,[Basic information of Coronavirus],2020,"We report clinical profile of hundred and nine patients with SARS CoV-2 infection, and whole genome sequences (WGS) of seven virus isolates from the first reported cases in India, with various international travel histories. Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease were frequently associated with severity of the disease. WBC and neutrophil counts showed an increase, while lymphocyte counts decreased in patients with severe infection suggesting a possible neutrophil mediated organ damage, while immune activity may be diminished with decrease in lymphocytes leading to disease severity. Increase in SGOT, SGPT and blood urea suggests the functional deficiencies of liver, heart, and kidney in patients who succumbed to the disease when compared to the group of recovered patients. The WGS analysis showed that these isolates were classified into two clades: I/A3i, and A2a (four according to GISAID: O, L, GR, and GH). Further, WGS phylogeny and travel history together indicate possible transmission from Middle East and Europe.

446423,Kindness Should Still Underline Science During the Pandemic,2020,"Ambient levels of electromagnetic fields (EMF) have risen sharply in the last 80 years, creating a novel energetic exposure that previously did not exist. Most recent decades have seen exponential increases in nearly all environments, including rural/remote areas and lower atmospheric regions. Because of unique physiologies, some species of flora and fauna are sensitive to exogenous EMF in ways that may surpass human reactivity. There is limited, but comprehensive, baseline data in the U.S. from the 1980s against which to compare significant new surveys from different countries. This now provides broader and more precise data on potential transient and chronic exposures to wildlife and habitats. Biological effects have been seen broadly across all taxa and frequencies at vanishingly low intensities comparable to today's ambient exposures. Broad wildlife effects have been seen on orientation and migration, food finding, reproduction, mating, nest and den building, territorial maintenance and defense, and longevity and survivorship. Cyto- and geno-toxic effects have been observed. The above issues are explored in three consecutive parts: Part 1 questions today's ambient EMF capabilities to adversely affect wildlife, with more urgency regarding 5G technologies. Part 2 explores natural and man-made fields, animal magnetoreception mechanisms, and pertinent studies to all wildlife kingdoms. Part 3 examines current exposure standards, applicable laws, and future directions. It is time to recognize ambient EMF as a novel form of pollution and develop rules at regulatory agencies that designate air as 'habitat' so EMF can be regulated like other pollutants. Wildlife loss is often unseen and undocumented until tipping points are reached. Long-term chronic low-level EMF exposure standards, which do not now exist, should be set accordingly for wildlife, and environmental laws should be strictly enforced.","Levitt, B Blake; Lai, Henry C; Manville, Albert M",Rev. environ. health,,319

These same warnings are reverberating during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consideration of the impacts of EVD on maternal and child health services from facility data can be instructive during COVID-19. We surveyed all peripheral healthcare units (PHUs) in Sierra Leone in October 2014 and March 2015 to assess closures, staffing, amenities, medicines, supplies, and service utilization during May 2014–January 2015 and October 2013–January 2014. We report PHU characteristics and service utilization changes for equivalent 4-month periods during the epidemic and the prior year. We present utilization changes by district and service type, and model excess child mortality. PHU closures (−8%) and staff attrition (−3%) were limited, but many facilities lacked amenities, medicines, and supplies. Utilization of preventive and scheduled services fell more than individualized, clinical care interventions, aside from malaria treatment which declined significantly. Ebola virus disease intensity in districts was weakly associated with utilization, aside from two districts that were severely affected. Modeling suggests utilization declines resulted in 6,782 excess under-five deaths (an increase of 21%) between 2014 and 2015. Ebola virus disease negatively affected service provision, but utilization declined relatively more, particularly for preventive and scheduled interventions. Although these findings are specific to Sierra Leone's EVD epidemic, they illustrate the magnitude of possible effects in other settings due to COVID-19–induced service disruptions, where collateral impacts on child mortality from other preventable causes may far outweigh COVID-19 mortality","Sharkey, A.

The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic over time in 28 countries was analysed and fit to several simple rate models. The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate projections for more recent data. While the Gompertz growth model (mean R2 = 0.998) best fit the current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit introduced significant model errors. However, the quadratic rate model (mean R2 = 0.992) fit the current data best for 25 (89%) countries as determined by R2 values of the remaining models. Projection to the future using the simple quadratic model accurately forecast the number of future total number of cases 50% of the time up to 10 days in advance. Extrapolation to the future with the simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future cases. These results demonstrate that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given country can be made using this very simple model.","Blanco, N; Stafford, K A; Lavoie, M C; Brandenburg, A; Górna, M W; Merski, M",Epidemiol Infect,,319

We present the clinical outcomes of HIV patients hospitalized for COVID-19 in a matched comparison with historical controls. METHODS: We conducted retrospective cohort study of HIV patients who were admitted for COVID-19 between March 2020 and April 2020 to Newark Beth Israel Medical Center. Data on baseline clinical characteristics and hospital course was documented and compared with that of a matched control group of COVID-19 patients who had no history of HIV. Kaplan Meier Survival curves and the log-rank tests were used to estimate and compare in-hospital survival between both unmatched and matched groups. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with HIV were hospitalized with COVID-19. Median age was 59 years. The rates of in-hospital death, the need for mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit admission were 13% (n=3), 9% (n=2) and 9% (n=2) respectively. The HIV infection was well controlled in all patients except for 3 patients who had presented with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). All AIDS patients were discharged home uneventfully. A one-to-one propensity matching identified 23 COVID-19 patients who served as a control group. In both pre- and post-match cohorts, survival between HIV and control groups were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort of HIV infected patients hospitalized for COVID-19, there was no difference in mortality, ICU admission and the need for mechanical ventilation when compared to a matched control of COVID -19 patients with HIV.

457671,Keeping critical assets safe when teleworking is the new norm,2020,"BACKGROUND: The majority of the children with SARS-CoV-2 infection present with respiratory symptoms, hence various chest imaging modalities have been used in the management. Knowledge about the radiological findings of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in children is limited. Hence, we systematically synthesized the available data that will help in better management of COVID-19 in children. METHODS: Four different electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science and CENTRAL) were searched for articles reporting radiological findings in children with COVID-19. Studies reporting thoracic radiological findings of COVID-19 in patients aged <19 years were included. A random-effect meta-analysis (wherever feasible) was performed to provide pooled estimates of various findings. RESULTS: A total of 1984 records were screened of which forty-six studies (923 patients) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan was the most frequently used imaging modality. While one-third of the patients had normal scans, a significant proportion (19%) of clinically asymptomatic children had radiological abnormalities too. Unilateral lung involvement (55%) was frequent when compared with bilateral and ground-glass opacities were the most frequent (40%) definitive radiological findings. Other common radiological findings were non-specific patchy shadows (44%), consolidation (23%), halo sign (26%), pulmonary nodules and prominent bronchovascular marking. Interstitial infiltration being the most frequent lung ultrasound finding. CONCLUSION: CT scan is the most frequently used imaging modality for COVID-19 in children and can detect pneumonia before the appearance of clinical symptoms.

467067,A strange new world,2020,"Background: Disease control involves multiple actions overtime to halt the spread of COVID-19. The role of a country's governance in slowing the spread of COVID-19 has not yet been well investigated. Objective: This study aims to investigate the association between governance and the trend of COVID-19 incidence in countries with the highest prevalence. We hypothesized that countries with better governance are more likely to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 than countries with worse governance. Methods: We analyzed 62 most prevalent countries with at least 10,000 accumulative confirmed cases from January 22 to June 15, 2020. Countries were further grouped into three different levels of governance (25 better governance, 24 fair governance, and 13 worse governance), identified outbreak and mitigation periods using the joinpoint regression model, and compared the number of days and average daily percent change in incidence in two periods by governance level using the one-way analysis of variance. Findings: The average outbreak period in the 62 countries lasted 84.0 days. Sixty percent of countries (N = 37) had experienced outbreak periods, followed by a mitigation period. In contrast, the rest forty percent of countries (N = 25) still had a rising trend. In the outbreak period, better governance countries had a more rapid increase but a shorter outbreak period (71.2 days) than countries with fair (93.5 days) and worse (90.8 days) governance. Most countries with better governance (84.0%) revealed a declining trend in COVID-19 incidence, while such a trend was less than half of fair and worse governance countries (38.5%-41.7%). Conclusions: Countries with better governance are more resilient during the COVID-19 crisis. While the mitigation of COVID-19 is observed in most better governance countries, the incidence of COVID-19 is still surging in most fair and worse governance countries, and the possibility of a recurring epidemic of COVID-19 in countries cannot be ignored.","Chien, Lung-Chang; Lin, Ro-Ting",Ann Glob Health,,319

467520,News,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hindered medical student career planning and clinical rotations. Recruitment and networking may be more influential in match outcomes than previous cycles. Medical residency training programs have significant challenges in recruiting diverse applicants. The American Psychiatric Association's Black Caucus developed a virtual recruitment event for residency programs with robust diversity initiatives and underrepresented medical students. This article evaluates our methods, short-term results, and influence on participating medical students. METHODS: The authors sent web-based invitations to all programs subscribed to the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training listserv. Programs that demonstrated intention and commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion were selected. The authors used various social media platforms and the Black Caucus listserv to advertise to medical students. Student participants received an online feedback survey consisting of multiple-choice and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Thirty-six programs and one hundred seven medical students participated in the 2-day diversity fair. Seventy-six students completed the following survey, which is a response rate of 71%. A majority of students reported that this event strongly influenced their interest in a program (71.05) and are actively considering a residency program they had not previously considered (69.74). A majority of medical students (89.47) strongly agreed that program representatives treated them with professionalism and respect. CONCLUSION: This event improved communication between highly valued underrepresented minority students applicants and residency programs. A notable majority of participants found the program overwhelmingly beneficial.","Ojo, Enioluwafe; Hairston, Danielle",Acad Psychiatry,,319

METHODS: As a proxy for home or in-lab testing, validation of a symptom-based measure of OSA risk is presented, based on an on-going larger prospective study of 156 family medicine patients with OSA (88 women, 68 men; mean age 57) and 60 Control participants (36 women, 24 men; mean age 54) recruited from the community. Participants completed the Sleep Symptom Checklist (SSC) as well as a range of other self-report measures; primary care patients also underwent a polysomnographic sleep study. RESULTS: Results show (a) that individuals with OSA reported more symptoms on the SSC related to Insomnia, Daytime Symptoms, Sleep Disorders and Psychological Maladjustment than the Control group (all p<.001), and (b) that their sleep-related symptoms were significantly more severe than those of Controls. In addition, (c) several PSG indices in recently diagnosed, untreated individuals with OSA were significantly correlated with SSC measured Sleep Disorder symptoms, and (d) SSC scores significantly distinguished OSA participants from Controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that family practitioners can effectively pre-screen patients for possible OSA by inquiring about 5 items that form the SSC Sleep Disorders subscale. If OSA is suspected, there are a range of behavioral techniques which we recommend to improve symptoms. The current pandemic causes us to reflect that provisional targeting of symptoms and guidance as to mitigation strategies while waiting for specialist care could serve patients well at any time.","Rizzo, Dorrie; Libman, Eva; Baltzan, Marc; Fichten, Catherine; Bailes, Sally",J. clin. sleep med,,319

468415,Living to Spend Another Day: Exploring Resilience as a New Fourth Goal of Ecological Economics,2020,"Relatively few studies have examined how the degree of involvement of local communities in nature‐based tourism, and the benefits that are generated for them, impact the choices that tourists make when visiting developing countries. We surveyed over 400 visitors in multiple locations in Namibia, using a discrete choice experiment to elicit preferences for attributes reflecting tracking safaris of the critically endangered, desert‐adapted black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis bicornis) in the northwest of the country. Attributes included those related to local community involvement and the benefits they receive from tourism, as well as the reinvestment of tourism profits back into rhino conservation, and the wildlife likely to be seen on safari. Using a latent class model that assigned tourists to market segments based on the observed pattern of responses in the choice experiment, we find that respondents can be divided into four classes that reflect differences in tourism preferences and their own demographics and experiences. While responses to attributes varied across classes, respondents were consistent in demonstrating a strong preference for the largest share of profits being returned to the local community, and were willing to pay an additional $43–670 to ensure this happens. Respondents in the four classes differed in their views toward the financing of rhino conservation and the participation of community trackers in rhino safaris, although those respondents in the class most interested in rhino tracking safaris were willing to pay an additional $34 per trip for tracker involvement. Our results demonstrate the value of assessing heterogeneity in tourists' preferences for wildlife experiences, and suggest that appropriate pricing and marketing may result in “triple bottom line” gains for nature‐based tourism.","Naidoo, Robin Beytell Piet Malherbe Andrew Middleton Angus Perche Juliette Muntifering Jeff R.",Conservation Science and Practice,,319

While learning-based approaches enjoy flexibility and generalizability, scaling these approaches to solve such compositional tasks remains a challenge. In this work, we aim to solve multi-task learning through the lens of sequence-conditioning and weighted sampling. First, we propose a new suite of benchmark specifically aimed at compositional tasks, MultiRavens, which allows defining custom task combinations through task modules that are inspired by industrial tasks and exemplify the difficulties in vision-based learning and planning methods. Second, we propose a vision-based end-to-end system architecture, Sequence-Conditioned Transporter Networks, which augments Goal-Conditioned Transporter Networks with sequence-conditioning and weighted sampling and can efficiently learn to solve multi-task long horizon problems. Our analysis suggests that not only the new framework significantly improves pick-and-place performance on novel 10 multi-task benchmark problems, but also the multi-task learning with weighted sampling can vastly improve learning and agent performances on individual tasks.","Lim, Michael H.; Zeng, Andy; Ichter, Brian; Bandari, Maryam; Coumans, Erwin; Tomlin, Claire; Schaal, Stefan; Faust, Aleksandra",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07578v1.pdf,319

Data are needed on the comparative safety, reactogenicity, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) effects of these vaccines. Objective: To compare safety, reactogenicity, and changes in HRQOL scores after aIIV3 vs HD-IIV3. Design, Setting, and Participants: This randomized blinded clinical trial was a multicenter US study conducted during the 2017 to 2018 and 2018 to 2019 influenza seasons. Among 778 community-dwelling adults aged at least 65 years and assessed for eligibility, 13 were ineligible and 8 withdrew before randomization. Statistical analysis was performed from August 2019 to August 2020. Interventions: Intramuscular administration of aIIV3 or HD-IIV3 after age-stratification (65-79 years; &#8805;80 years) and randomization. Main Outcomes and Measures: Proportions of participants with moderate-to-severe injection-site pain and 14 other solicited reactions during days 1 to 8, using a noninferiority test (5% noninferiority margin), and serious adverse events (SAE) and adverse events of clinical interest (AECI), including new-onset immune-mediated conditions, during days 1 to 43. Changes in HRQOL scores before and after vaccination (days 1, 3) were also compared between study groups. Results: A total of 757 adults were randomized, 378 to receive aIIV3 and 379 to receive HD-IIV3. Of these participants, there were 420 women (55%) and 589 White individuals (78%) with a median (range) age of 72 (65-97) years. The proportion reporting moderate-to-severe injection-site pain, limiting or preventing activity, after aIIV3 (12 participants [3.2%]) (primary outcome) was noninferior compared with HD-IIV3 (22 participants [5.8%]) (difference -2.7%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 0.4). Ten reactions met noninferiority criteria for aIIV3; 4 (moderate-to-severe injection-site tenderness, arthralgia, fatigue, malaise) did not. It was inconclusive whether these 4 reactions occurred in higher proportions of participants after aIIV3. No participant sought medical care for a vaccine reaction. No AECI was observed. Nine participants had at least SAE after aIIV3 (2.4%; 95% CI,1.1% to 4.5%); 3 had at least 1 SAE after HD-IIV3 (0.8%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 2.2%). No SAE was associated with vaccination. Changes in prevaccination and postvaccination HRQOL scores were not clinically meaningful and not different between the groups. Conclusions and Relevance: Overall safety and HRQOL findings were similar after aIIV3 and HD-IIV3, and consistent with prelicensure data. From a safety standpoint, this study's results support using either vaccine to prevent influenza in older adults.

In their standard formulation, however, they do not allow exploring how the hypothesized model deviates from the truth nor do they provide any insight into how the rejected model could be improved to better fit the data. The main goal of this work is to establish a comprehensive framework for goodness-of-fit which naturally integrates modeling, estimation, inference and graphics. Modeling and estimation are conducted by generalizing smooth tests in the context of the novel LP approach to statistical modeling introduced by Mukhopadhyay and Parzen (2014).

472468,International Perspectives Concerning Donor Milk Banking During the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Pandemic,2020,"RATIONALE: The new coronavirus pneumonia Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic. Patients with critically COVID-19 usually require invasive respiratory support, and the airway management is particularly important and the prognosis is poor. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old man with an anastomotic fistula after radical treatment of esophageal cancer and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax was admitted with cough and dyspnea. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed with novel coronavirus pneumonia and right-side encapsulated pyopneumothorax by pharyngeal swab nucleic acid test in combination with chest computed tomography (CT). INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with antibiotics, antiviral and antibacterial medications, respiratory support, expectorant nebulization, and nutritional support. But he expressed progressive deterioration. Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were performed since the onset of the type - respiratory failure on the 13th day of admission. The patient had persistent refractory hypercapnia after mechanical ventilation. Based on the treatment mentioned above, combined with repeated bronchoalveolar lavage by using N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhalation solution, the patients refractory hypercapnia was gradually improved. OUTCOMES: The patient was cured and discharged after being given the mechanical ventilation for 26 days as well as 46 days of hospitalization, currently is surviving well. LESSONS: Patients with severe conditions of novel coronavirus pneumonia often encounter bacterial infection in their later illness-stages. They may suffer respiratory failure and refractory hypercapnia that is difficult to improve due to excessive mucus secretion leading to small airway obstruction. This study provided a new insight on the proper treatment severe COVID-19 patients. The use of reasonable antibiotics and symptomatic respiratory support and other treatment, timely artificial airway and repeated bronchoalveolar NAC inhalation solution lavage, expectorant and other airway management are essential for such patients.","Liu, Yan; Wang, Meifang; Luo, Guoshi; Qian, Xin; Wu, Chenglin; Zhang, Yizhong; Chen, Biyu; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Tang, Yijun",Medicine (Baltimore),,319
473216,Prediction Surface Uncertainty Quantification in Object Detection Models for Autonomous Driving,2021-07-11,"AIMS: The storm-like nature of the health crises caused by COVID-19 has led to unconventional clinical trial practices such as the relaxation of exclusion criteria. The question remains: how can we conduct diverse trials without exposing sub-groups of populations to potentially harmful drug exposure levels? The aim of this study was to build a knowledge-base of the effect of intrinsic/extrinsic factors on the disposition of several repurposed COVID-19 drugs. METHODS: PBPK models were used to study the change in PK of drugs repurposed for COVID-19 in geriatric patients, different race groups, organ impairment, DDI risks. These models were also used to predict epithelial lining fluid (ELF) exposure which is relevant for COVID-19 patients under elevated cytokine levels. RESULTS: The simulated PK profiles suggest no dose adjustments are required based on age and race for COVID-19 drugs; however, dose adjustments may be warranted for COVID-19 patients also exhibiting hepatic/renal impairment. PBPK model simulations suggest ELF exposure to attain a target concentration was adequate for most drugs, except for hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, atazanavir and lopinavir/ritonavir. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that systematically collated data on the ADME, human PK parameters, DDIs, and organ impairment can be used to verify simulated plasma and lung tissue exposure for drugs repurposed for COVID-19, justifying broader patient recruitment criteria. In addition, the PBPK model developed was used to study the effect of age and ethnicity on the PK of repurposed drugs, and to assess the correlation between lung exposure and relevant potency values from in vitro studies for SARS-CoV-2.","Pilla Reddy, Venkatesh; El-Khateeb, Eman; Jo, Heeseung; Giovino, Natalie; Lythgoe, Emily; Sharma, Shringi; Tang, Weifeng; Jamei, Masoud; Rastomi-Hodjegan, Amin",,,319
473538,Book Review: The 99 Percent Economy: How Democratic Socialism Can Overcome the Crises of Capitalism,2020,"Background: Pandemic SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Wuhan, China on December 31, 2019. Twenty-one days later, the US identified its first case--a man who had traveled from Wuhan to the state of Washington. Recent studies in the Wuhan and Seattle metropolitan areas retrospectively tested samples taken from patients with COVID-like symptoms. In the Wuhan study, there were 4 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 7 influenza positives out of 26 adults outpatients who sought care for influenza-like-illness at two central hospitals prior to January 12, 2020. The Seattle study reported 25 SARS-CoV-2 positives and 442 influenza positives out of 2353 children and adults who reported acute respiratory illness prior to March 9, 2020. Here, we use these findings to extrapolate the early prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle. Methods: For each city, we estimate the ratio of COVID-19 to influenza infections from the retrospective testing data and estimate the age-specific prevalence of influenza from surveillance reports during the same time period. Combining these, we approximate the total number of symptomatic COVID-19 infections. Findings: In Wuhan, there were an estimated 1386 [95% CrI: 420-3793] symptomatic cases over 30 of COVID-19 between December 30, 2019 and January 12, 2020. In Seattle, we estimate that 2268 [95% CrI: 498, 6069] children under 18 and 4367 [95% CrI: 2776, 6526] adults were symptomatically infected between February 24 and March 9, 2020. We also find that the initial pandemic wave in Wuhan likely originated with a single infected case who developed symptoms sometime between October 26 and December 13, 2019; in Seattle, the seeding likely occurred between December 25, 2019 and January 15, 2020. Interpretation: The spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Seattle was far more extensive than initially reported. The virus likely spread for months in Wuhan before the lockdown. Given that COVID-19 appears to be overwhelmingly mild in children, our high estimate for symptomatic pediatric cases in Seattle suggests that there may have been thousands more mild cases at the time.","Du, Zhanwei; Javan, Emily; Nugent, Ciara; Cowling, Benjamin J; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",EClinicalMedicine,,319
473720,Smart Close-out Netting,2020-11-14,"ABSTRACT The unbridled propagation of the sharing economy halted abruptly with the onset of the pandemic, forcing sharing economy companies to respond to the new set of challenges faced by them. There were marked differences between the pre- and post-COVID challenges. Post-COVID, sharing economy companies designed novel response strategies including tempering ambitions, adapting business models, designing new standard operating procedures, displaying empathy towards employees and partners, building trust, and sharing information with stakeholders. This signified a reorientation of sharing economy companies in the hyperconnected world where there is a blurring of boundaries as brand experiences and meanings are cocreated by stakeholders. Sharing economy companies would need to focus on different set of values to attain competitive advantage in the post-COVID world - partnership instead of confrontation, nurturing instead of destructive, open and sharing instead of closed, and empathetic instead of uncaring. This can help create meaningful differentiation and provide competitive advantage. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Meenakshi, N.",Journal of Strategic Marketing,,319

The aim was to determine whether obesity is a risk factor for unfavourable health outcomes in patients affected by COVID-19 admitted to ICU. METHODS AND RESULTS: 95 consecutive patients with COVID-19 (78 males and 18 females) were admitted to ICU and included in the study. Height, weight, BMI, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores, CRP, CPK, ICU and hospital length of stay and comorbidities were evaluated. Participants with obesity had a lower 28 day survival rate from ICU admission than normal weight subjects. Cox proportional hazard model-derived estimates, adjusted for age, gender and comorbidity, confirmed the results of the survival analysis (HR:5.30,95%C.I.1.26-22.34). Obese subjects showed longer hospital and ICU stay as compared with normal weight counterpart.Subjects with obesity showed significantly higher CRP and CPK levels than normal weight subjects. CONCLUSION: In individuals with obesity, careful management and prompt intervention in case of suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is necessary to prevent the progression of the disease towards severe outcomes and the increase of hospital treatment costs.","Rossi, Andrea P; Gottin, Leonardo; Donadello, Katia; Schweiger, Vittorio; Nocini, Riccardo; Taiana, Matteo; Zamboni, Mauro; Polati, Enrico",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,,319
475263,Editorial./ Od Redakcji,2020,"BACKGROUND: The internet has become an important source of health information for users worldwide. The novel coronavirus caused a pandemic search for information with broad dissemination of false or misleading health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the quality and readability of online information about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was a trending topic on the internet, using validated instruments and relating the quality of information to its readability. METHODS: The search was based on the term ""Wuhan Coronavirus"" on the Google website (February 6, 2020). At the search time, the terms ""COVID-19"" or ""SARS-CoV-2"" (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) did not exist. Critical analysis was performed on the first 110 hits using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct (HONcode), the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark, the DISCERN instrument, and Google ranking. RESULTS: The first 110 websites were critically analyzed, and only 1.8% (n=2) of the websites had the HONcode seal. The JAMA benchmark showed that 39.1% (n=43) of the websites did not have any of the categories required by this tool, and only 10.0% (11/110) of the websites had the four quality criteria required by JAMA. The DISCERN score showed that 70.0% (n=77) of the websites were evaluated as having a low score and none were rated as having a high score. CONCLUSIONS: Nonhealth personnel and the scientific community need to be aware about the quality of the information they read and produce, respectively. The Wuhan coronavirus health crisis misinformation was produced by the media, and the misinformation was obtained by users from the internet. The use of the internet has a risk to public health, and, in cases like this, the governments should be developing strategies to regulate health information on the internet without censuring the population. By February 6, 2020, no quality information was available on the internet about COVID-19.","Cuan-Baltazar, Jose Yunam; Muñoz-Perez, Maria José; Robledo-Vega, Carolina; Pérez-Zepeda, Maria Fernanda; Soto-Vega, Elena",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,319

Inflammation and the innate immune system have been recently recognized as pivotal players in the most severe forms, characterized by significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this setting, several studies have also reported the presence of abnormalities in coagulation parameters and platelets count, possibly identifying a subgroup of patients with poor prognosis. Some reports of full-blown thromboembolic events are emerging. Among the possible mechanisms underlying coagulation dysfunction, the so-called ""cytokine storm"" seems to play a pivotal role. Other candidate factors include virus-specific mechanisms, related to the virus interaction with renin angiotensin system (RAS) and the fibrinolytic pathway, but also comorbidities affecting these patients. Coagulation dysfunction is therefore a candidate risk factor for adverse outcomes in COVID-19 and should be carefully addressed in clinical practice.","Lazzaroni, Maria Grazia; Piantoni, Silvia; Masneri, Stefania; Garrafa, Emirena; Martini, Giuliana; Tincani, Angela; Andreoli, Laura; Franceschini, Franco",Blood Rev,,319

Faculty need resources and support to transition face to face courses into an online format. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to highlight nursing faculty perceptions of the effectiveness of resources, support, and methodologies for online teaching during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive survey design was used to collect data about nursing faculty resources, support and methodologies used to transition at least one undergraduate or graduate degree nursing course to an online format during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Eighty-four faculty who taught in ten university colleges of nursing used varied teaching methodologies in online courses, but included some consistent methods such as websites and web based tools. The student engagement strategies that faculty were most satisfied with were journal writing and projects. Most faculty reported having information technology support and access to instructional design resources. Conclusion: Nursing faculty were resourceful, adaptive, and willing to use both novel and existing resources and methodologies to meet their teaching objectives and engage students. They were also, overall, satisfied with the administrative support they received from their respective institutions. Many of these resources, methodologies, and supports will continue to be used by faculty as likely more programs and courses will continue to be managed online. © The Author(s) 2021.","Wilson, J.

We conducted a study to evaluate two academic laboratories' fingerstick capillary blood collection kits suitable for home use for laboratory measurement of HbA1c. Methods: Four clinical sites recruited 240 participants (aged 4-80 years, HbA1c 5.1%-13.5%). Capillary blood samples were obtained by the participant or parent using collection kits from two laboratories (University of Minnesota Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (ARDL) and Children's Mercy Hospital Laboratory (CMH)) and mailed under varying shipping conditions by United States Postal Service to the laboratories. Comparisons were made between HbA1c measurements from capillary samples and contemporaneously obtained venous samples. The primary outcome was percentage of capillary HbA1c values within 5% of the corresponding venous values. Results: HbA1c values were within 5% of venous values for 96% of ARDL kit specimens shipped with a cold pack and 98% without a cold pack and 99% and 99%, respectively, for the CMH kits. R2 values were 0.98, 0.99, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. Results appeared similar across HbA1c levels and for pediatric and adult participants. Usability survey scores were high. Conclusions: Capillary blood collection kits, suitable for home use, from two academic laboratories, were demonstrated to be easy to use and provided results that are comparable with those obtained from venous specimens. Based on these results, there is strong evidence that HbA1c measurements from capillary specimens obtained with these specific kits can be used interchangeably with HbA1c measurements from venous specimens for clinical research and clinical care.","Beck, Roy W; Bocchino, Laura E; Lum, John W; Kollman, Craig; Barnes-Lomen, Victoria; Sulik, Mark; Haller, Michael J; Bode, Bruce; Cernich, Joseph T; Killeen, Anthony A; Garg, Uttam; Liljenquist, David; Adams, Janey G; Clements, Margaret; Gabrielson, Deanna; Johnson, Terri; Clements, Mark A",Diabetes technol. ther,,319

481030,Predicting the 21st General Election Results Through Polling-Based Methods,2020,"Although interest in ""cytokine storms"" has surged over the past decade, it was massively amplified in 2020 when it was suggested that a subset of patients with COVID-19 developed a form of cytokine storm. The concept of cytokine storm syndromes (CSS) encompasses diverse conditions or circumstances that coalesce around potentially lethal hyperinflammation with hemodynamic compromise and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a prototypic form of CSS that develops in the context of rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The treatment of MAS relies heavily upon corticosteroids and cytokine inhibitors, which have proven to be lifesaving therapies in MAS, as well as in other forms of CSS. Within months of the recognition of SARS-CoV2 as a human pathogen, descriptions of COVID-19 patients with hyperinflammation emerged. Physicians immediately grappled with identifying optimal therapeutic strategies for these patients, and despite clinical distinctions such as marked coagulopathy with endothelial injury associated with COVID-19, borrowed from the experiences with MAS and other CSS. Initial reports of patients treated with anti-cytokine agents in COVID-19 were promising, but recent large, better-controlled studies of these agents have had mixed results suggesting a more complex pathophysiology. Here, we discuss how the comparison of clinical features, immunologic parameters and therapeutic response data between MAS and hyperinflammation in COVID-19 can provide new insight into the pathophysiology of CSS.","Ombrello, Michael J; Schulert, Grant S",Transl Res,,319

483718,Book Review: Reporting bad news: Negotiating the boundaries between intrusion and fair representation in media coverage of death,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Both inflammation and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) are associated with the risk of respiratory infections. To clarify the hypothesis that CRF attenuates the incident risk of pneumonia due to inflammation, we conducted a prospective study examining the independent and joint associations of inflammation and CRF on the risk of pneumonia in a population sample of 2041 middle-aged men. METHODS: Cardiorespiratory fitness was directly measured as peak oxygen uptake (VËO2peak) during progressive exercise testing to volitional fatigue, and categorized into tertiles. Inflammation was defined by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Pneumonia cases were identified by internal medicine physicians using the International Classification of Diseases codes in clinical practice. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 27 yr, 432 pneumonia cases were recorded. High hsCRP and CRF were associated with a higher risk (HR = 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.88) and a lower risk of pneumonia (HR = 0.55; CI, 0.39-0.76) after adjusting for potential confounders, respectively. Compared with normal hsCRP-Fit, moderate to high hsCRP-Unfit had an increased risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.63; CI, 1.21-2.20), but moderate to high hsCRP-Fit was not associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (HR = 1.25; CI, 0.93-1.68). CONCLUSIONS: High CRF attenuates the increased risk of pneumonia due to inflammation. These findings have potential implications for the prevention of respiratory infection characterized by systemic inflammation, such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).","Jae, Sae Young; Heffernan, Kevin S; Kurl, Sudhir; Kunutsor, Setor K; Kim, Chul-Ho; Johnson, Bruce D; Franklin, Barry A; Laukkanen, Jari A",J. cardiopulm. rehabil. prev,,319

Patients on dialysis tend to have a reduced immune response to infection or vaccination. We aimed to assess, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine in patients on maintenance hemodialysis and the factors associated with it. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: The study included 56 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. RESULTS: All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; interquartile range, 1128-5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; interquartile range, 3687-15,471). A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that this difference was statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05). Within the dialysis group, older age and lower lymphocyte count were associated with antibody response in the lower quartile (odds ratio, 1.22 per 1-year older; 95% confidence interval, 1.13 to 1.68; P=0.03 and odds ratio, 0.83 per 10-e3/µl-higher lymphocyte count; 95% confidence interval, 0.58 to 0.97; P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients on maintenance hemodialysis developed a substantial humoral response following the BNT162b2 vaccine, it was significantly lower than controls. Age was an important factor in the humoral response, regardless of chronic medical conditions.","Grupper, Ayelet; Sharon, Nechama; Finn, Talya; Cohen, Regev; Israel, Meital; Agbaria, Amir; Rechavi, Yoav; Schwartz, Idit F; Schwartz, Doron; Lellouch, Yonatan; Shashar, Moshe",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,,319

Road transport remains the most favoured mode of transport for both freight and passenger movement in India. As per the World Health Organization, approximately 1.35 million people die annually on the world's roads, and another 20 to 50 million sustain nonfatal injuries as a result of road traffic crashes. These injuries and deaths have an immeasurable impact on the families affected, whose lives are often changed irrevocably by these tragedies, and on the communities in which these people lived and worked. India ranks 1 in the total number of traffic-related deaths across the 199 countries reported in the World Road Statistics, 2018, followed by China and the USA due to its large population (India, 21.7, and China, 18.6, fatalities per 100,000), although several Central American and African countries have higher fatality rates. During COVID-19 (coronavirus disease-19) pandemic, a national lockdown was implemented by Government of India from 24 March to 31 May 2020, in four phases to control the spread of SARS CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2) infection. In our observational study, we compared the epidemiology of trauma patients of two periods from 1 April to 31 May 2019 and 24 March to 31 May 2020 and found out that unique concept of lockdown with stringent implementation of discipline, alcohol ban, behavioural change in visiting family and friends as minimum as possible, promoting work from home and digital classes for school and colleges lead to phenomenal decrease in traffic-related injuries and fatality. The lockdown has grossly decreased 'disability-adjusted life year'(DALY), an outcome indicator for cost-effective analysis, which is calculated as the value of future years of healthy life lost to morbidity/disability and future years of life lost to premature mortality.","Jain, Amita; Goyal, Vishal; Varma, Chaitanya",Indian J Surg,,319
489723,How to fix the GDPR's frustration of global biomedical research,2020,"Introduction: The global Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has resulted in numerous difficulties and drawbacks in our daily life. Despite causing mortality, it has halted the therapeutic facilities because of the in-person interaction involved in it. Communication difficulties have been aggravated which seeks for immediate attention as it can lead to a lack of improvement in communication delays observed in children with Hearing Impairment (HI). Aim: To highlight the communication challenges faced by children with hearing impairment and consequently investigate the effectiveness and need for telepractice during the Lockdown. It also aims to improve the service delivery models. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in MERF Institute of Speech and Hearing, Chennai from July 2020 to August 2020. A convenience sampling was opted for enrolling the participants in the study. The questionnaire was administered to the parents in two modalities-telephonic survey and electronic format. The data analysis was done by frequency counting and percentage calculation. Results: The findings of the current study suggest that the speech and language performances have worsened for 35% (due to lack of formal stimulation, device malfunction, etc.,), improved for 35% (due to intensive home training, adequate stimulation, etc.,) and no difference has been noted for 30% of children with HI during the lockdown. 23 (57.5%) parents were aware of the Telepractice services, and those unaware were oriented. 12 (40%) respondents opted for other modalities of assistance instead of Telepractice services. Conclusion: The communication challenges faced, calls for seamless intervention during the lockdown. The introduction of Teletherapy proves to be beneficial and hence, the ultimate goal is to integrate telerehabilitation services into clinical facilities. Alternatives of service delivery models should be utilised optimally.

The SARS-CoV-2 uses the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to gain entry inside the human cells where it replicates by using the cell protein synthesis mechanisms. The knowledge of the tissue distribution of ACE2 in human organs is therefore important to predict the clinical course of the COVID-19. Also important is the understanding of the viral receptor-binding domain (RBD), a region within the spike (S) proteins, that enables the entry of the virus into the host cells to synthesize vaccine and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We performed an exhaustive search of human protein databases to establish the tissues that express ACE2 and performed an in-depth analysis like sequence alignments and homology modeling of the spike protein (S) of the SARS-CoV-2 to identify antigenic regions in the RBD that can be exploited to synthesize vaccine and mAbs. Our results show that ACE2 is widely expressed in human organs that may explain the pulmonary, systemic, and neurological deficits seen in COVID-19 patients. We show that though the S protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is a homolog of S protein of SARS-CoV-1, it has regions of dissimilarities in the RBD and transmembrane segments. We show peptide sequences in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 that can bind to the major histocompatibility complex alleles and serve as effective epitopes for vaccine and mAbs synthesis.","Baig, Abdul Mannan; Khaleeq, Areeba; Syeda, Hira",J. med. virol,,319

492831,First CRISPR test for the coronavirus approved in the United States,2020,"A pressing concern in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and other viral outbreaks, is the extent to which the containment measures are halting the viral spread. A straightforward way to assess this is to tally the active cases and the recovered ones throughout the epidemic. Here, we show how epidemic control can be assessed with molecular information during a well characterized epidemic in Iceland. We demonstrate how the viral concentration decreased in those newly diagnosed as the epidemic transitioned from exponential growth phase to containment phase. The viral concentration in the cases identified in population screening decreased faster than in those symptomatic and considered at high risk and that were targeted by the healthcare system. The viral concentration persists in recovering individuals as we found that half of the cases are still positive after two weeks. We demonstrate that accumulation of mutations in SARS-CoV-2 genome can be exploited to track the rate of new viral generations throughout the different phases of the epidemic, where the accumulation of mutations decreases as the transmission rate decreases in the containment phase. Overall, the molecular signatures of SARS-CoV-2 infections contain valuable epidemiological information that can be used to assess the effectiveness of containment measures.","Jonsson, Hakon; Magnusson, Olafur T; Melsted, Pall; Berglund, Jonas; Agustsdottir, Arna B; Eiríksdottir, Berglind; Fridriksdottir, Run; Garðarsdottir, Elisabet Eir; Georgsson, Gudmundur; Gretarsdottir, Olafia S; Guðmundsson, Kjartan R; Gunnarsdottir, Thora Rosa; Eggertsson, Hannes; Gylfason, Arnaldur; Holm, Hilma; Jensson, Brynjar O; Jonasdottir, Aslaug; Jonsson, Frosti; Josefsdottir, Kamilla S; Thordardottir, Marianna; Kristinsson, Karl G; Kristjánsson, Þórður; Magnusdottir, Droplaug N; Roux, Louise le; Saemundsdottir, Jona; Sigurdsson, Asgeir; Sigmundsdottir, Gudrun; Sveinbjornsson, Gardar; Rognvaldsson, Solvi; Eiriksson, Ogmundur; Magnusson, Magnus Karl; Sveinsdottir, Kristin Eva; Sveinsdottir, Maney; Thorarensen, Emil Aron; Thorbjornsson, Bjarni; Löve, Arthur; Norddahl, Gudmundur L; Jonsdottir, Ingileif; Sulem, Patrick; Masson, Gisli; Moller, Alma; Gudnason, Thorolfur; Kristjansson, Mar; Helgason, Agnar; Gudbjartsson, Daniel F; Thorsteinsdottir, Unnur; Stefansson, Kari",Nat Commun,,319

493514,Goodbye to 2020,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In the context of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic in Canada, we aimed to (1) characterize trends in cannabis use in the overall population; and (2) characterize patterns of and identify risk characteristics associated with an increase in cannabis use among those who used cannabis. METHODS: Data were obtained from three waves of an online, repeated cross-sectional survey of adults residing in Canada (May 08-June 23, 2020; Nâ=â3012). Trends were assessed using Cochran-Armitage and chi-square tests, and risk characteristics were identified using logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Cannabis use in the overall population remained stable during the months of May and June. Among those who used cannabis, about half increased their cannabis use compared to before the start of the pandemic. This proportion of an increase in cannabis use among those who used cannabis remained consistent across the survey waves. Risk characteristics associated with higher odds of an increase in cannabis use included residence in the central region (Odds ratio, 95% confidence intervals: 1.93, 1.03-3.62), being 18 to 29 years old (2.61, 1.32-5.17) or 30 to 49 years old (1.85, 1.07-3.19), having less than college or university education (1.86, 1.13-3.06) and being somewhat worried about the pandemic's impact on personal finances (1.73, 1.00-3.00). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of those who used cannabis have increased cannabis use during the pandemic, suggesting a need for interventions to limit increased cannabis use, policy measures to address cannabis-attributable harms, and continued monitoring of cannabis use during and after the pandemic.","Imtiaz, Sameer; Wells, Samantha; Rehm, Jürgen; Hamilton, Hayley A; Nigatu, Yeshambel T; Wickens, Christine M; Jankowicz, Damian; Elton-Marshall, Tara",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,319

494003,News in Brief,2020,"Alveoli are the basic structure of the lungs, consisting of various types of parenchymal and bone marrow-derived cells including alveolar macrophages. These various types of cells have several important functions; thus, communication between these cells plays an important role in homeostasis as well as in the pathophysiology of diseases in the lungs. For a better understanding of the pathophysiology of lung diseases, researchers have isolated each type of lung cell to investigate the changes in their gene expressions, including their humoral factor or adhesion molecules, to reveal the intercellular communication among these cells. In particular, investigations during the past decade have focused on extracellular vesicles, which are lipid bilayer delimited vesicles released from a cell that can move among various cells and transfer substances, including microRNAs, mRNAs and proteins, thus, functioning as intercellular messengers. Extracellular vesicles can be classified into three general groups: apoptotic bodies, exosomes, and microparticles. Extracellular vesicles, especially exosomes and microparticles, are attracting increasing attention from pulmonologists as tools for understanding pathogenesis and disease diagnosis. Here, we review studies, including our own, on exosomes and microparticles and their roles in both lung homeostasis and the pathogenesis of lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive lung diseases, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. This review also addresses the roles of extracellular vesicles in COVID-19, the current global public health crisis.","Yamada, Mitsuhiro",Respir Investig,,319
494541,Big studies dim hopes for hydroxychloroquine,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 is a RNA coronavirus responsible for the pandemic of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (COVID-19). RNA viruses are characterized by a high mutation rate, up to a million times higher than that of their hosts. Virus mutagenic capability depends upon several factors, including the fidelity of viral enzymes that replicate nucleic acids, as SARS-CoV-2 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Mutation rate drives viral evolution and genome variability, thereby enabling viruses to escape host immunity and to develop drug resistance. METHODS: We analyzed 220 genomic sequences from the GISAID database derived from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 worldwide from December 2019 to mid-March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 reference genome was obtained from the GenBank database. Genomes alignment was performed using Clustal Omega. Mann-Whitney and Fisher-Exact tests were used to assess statistical significance. RESULTS: We characterized 8 novel recurrent mutations of SARS-CoV-2, located at positions 1397, 2891, 14408, 17746, 17857, 18060, 23403 and 28881. Mutations in 2891, 3036, 14408, 23403 and 28881 positions are predominantly observed in Europe, whereas those located at positions 17746, 17857 and 18060 are exclusively present in North America. We noticed for the first time a silent mutation in RdRp gene in England (UK) on February 9th, 2020 while a different mutation in RdRp changing its amino acid composition emerged on February 20th, 2020 in Italy (Lombardy). Viruses with RdRp mutation have a median of 3 point mutations [range: 2-5], otherwise they have a median of 1 mutation [range: 0-3] (p value < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the virus is evolving and European, North American and Asian strains might coexist, each of them characterized by a different mutation pattern. The contribution of the mutated RdRp to this phenomenon needs to be investigated. To date, several drugs targeting RdRp enzymes are being employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection treatment. Some of them have a predicted binding moiety in a SARS-CoV-2 RdRp hydrophobic cleft, which is adjacent to the 14408 mutation we identified. Consequently, it is important to study and characterize SARS-CoV-2 RdRp mutation in order to assess possible drug-resistance viral phenotypes. It is also important to recognize whether the presence of some mutations might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.","Pachetti, Maria; Marini, Bruna; Benedetti, Francesca; Giudici, Fabiola; Mauro, Elisabetta; Storici, Paola; Masciovecchio, Claudio; Angeletti, Silvia; Ciccozzi, Massimo; Gallo, Robert C; Zella, Davide; Ippodrino, Rudy",J Transl Med,,319

496274,Unsupervised Abnormality Detection Using Heterogeneous Autonomous Systems,2020-06-05,"A general strategy is provided to identify the most general metric for diagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian and anti-pseudo-Hermitian Hamilton operators represented by two-dimensional matrices. It is investigated how a permutation of the eigen-values of the Hamilton operator in the process of its diagonalization influences the metric and how this permutation equivalence affects energy eigen-values. We try to understand on one hand, how the metric depends on the normalization of the chosen left and right eigen-basis of the matrix representing the diagonalizable pseudo-Hermitian or anti-pseudo-Hermitian Hamilton operator, on the other hand, whether there has to exist a positive semi-definite metric required to set up a meaningful Quantum Theory even for non-Hermitian Hamilton operators of this type. Using our general strategy we determine the metric with respect to the two elements of the two-dimensional permutation group for various topical examples of matrices representing two-dimensional Hamilton operators found in the literature assuming on one hand pseudo-Hermiticity, on the other hand anti-pseudo-Hermiticity. The (unnecessary) constraint inferred by C. M. Bender and collegues that the ${\cal C}$-operator of ${\cal PT}$-symmetric Quantum Theory should be an involution (${\cal C}^2=1$) is shown - in the unbroken phase of ${\cal PT}$-symmetry - to require the Hamilton operator to be symmetric. This inconvenient restriction had been already - with hesitation - noted by M. Znojil and H. B. Geyer in 2006 (arXiv:quant-ph/0607104). A Hamilton operator proposed by T. D. Lee and C. G. Wick is used to outline implications of the formalism to higher dimensional Hamilton operators.","Kleefeld, Frieder",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08182v1.pdf,319

We compared the clinical data with colorectal cancer during the same 4-month period in 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients with colorectal cancer underwent elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was 66% of the number of patients that underwent the procedure during the same period in 2018 and 2019. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of patients without any digestive system symptoms decreased to 3% and severe clinical symptoms decreased by 20.9%. The proportion of right colon cancer decreased by 17.9%, while the proportion of rectal cancer increased by 52.2%, as compared with 2018 and 2019. The fraction of protective stoma was significantly higher than in 2018 (23.9% vs. 8.7%, p = 0.011). Compared with 2019, the average post-operative stay was significantly shorter than in 2018 (9.6 ± 3.7 vs. 12.1 ± 9.1, p = 0.015).

502632,Why it takes a village to manage and share data,2021-09-03,"The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, COVID-19, is challenging international public health and healthcare efforts. As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor. Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face of an international outbreak.","Popescu, Saskia",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,319

An instructor was appointed for each participating institution to lead the discussion and encourage collaboration among preinterns. Pre- and postcurriculum surveys utilized 20 statements adapted from the eight applicable Milestones to measure the evolution of preintern self-reported perceived preparedness (PP) as well as actual clinical knowledge (CK) performance on a case-based examination. Results: A total of 11 institutions collaborated and 151 preinterns were contacted, 127 of whom participated. After participating in the Slack intern curriculum (SIC), preinterns reported significant improvements in PP regarding multiple Milestone topics. They also showed improved CK regarding the airway management Milestone based on examination performance. Conclusions: Implementation of our SIC may ease the difficult transition between medical school and internship for emergency medicine preinterns. Residency leadership and medical school faculty will benefit from knowledge of preintern PP, specifically of their perceived strengths and weaknesses, because this information can guide curricular focus at the end of medical school and beginning of internship. Limitations of this study include variable participation and a high attrition rate. Further studies will address the utility of such a virtual curriculum for preinterns and for rotating medical students who have been displaced from clinical rotations during the novel coronavirus pandemic.","McLean, Mary E.; Huls, Thomas A.; Cotarelo, Adrian A.; Husain, Abbas; Park, Joel C.; Chan, Jonathan C.; So, Elizabeth S.; Anana, Michael C.; Chen, Angela S.; Chien, Gordon K.; Chung, Arlene S.; Cygan, Lukasz D.; Gupta, Suman J.; Kanter, Marc P.; Lee, Eric; Mishra, Diksha; Ng, Kristen M.; Restivo, Andrew J.; Russell, James T.; Shah, Kaushal; Surles, R.

All patients had at least 3 months of follow-up and those who underwent combined surgeries were excluded. Ulcers were assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 3 months. Population demographics, follow-up time, ulcer etiologies, ulcer size, and complications were also recorded. Results : Baseline characteristics and clinical features of both groups were comparable. There was no statistically significant difference in the number of overlay amniotic membrane transplantations (p= 0.52) or early fall (p=0.57). At 3 months, the corneal healing rate was almost the same in both groups (89% and 91% for FD-AM and C-AM, respectively;p=0.85). Complications were evenly unusual (11% and 9% respectively;p=0.92). In logistic regression, the nature of the membrane did not influence corneal healing at 1 month (p=0.42) and 3 months (p=0.99) regardless of the depth of the ulcer. However, whatever the type of AM used, the deeper the ulcer was, the less likely it was to heal at 3 months (p=0.02). Conclusions : This first study provides positive insight into the effectiveness of FD-AM as compared to C-AM when used as overlay transplantation for treating corneal ulcers.","Memmi, B.; Leveziel, L.; Knoeri, J.; Leclere, A.; Despiaux, M.

Such an event would necessitate a large-scale evacuation, with implications for the trajectory of the pandemic. Here we model how a hypothetical hurricane evacuation from four counties in southeast Florida would affect COVID-19 case levels. We find that hurricane evacuation increases the total number of COVID-19 cases in both origin and destination locations; however, if transmission rates in destination counties can be kept from rising during evacuation, excess evacuation-induced case numbers can be minimized by directing evacuees to counties experiencing lower COVID-19 transmission rates. Ultimately, the number of excess COVID-19 cases produced by the evacuation depends on the ability of destination counties to meet evacuee needs while minimizing virus exposure through public health directives. These results are relevant to disease transmission during evacuations stemming from additional climate-related hazards such as wildfires and floods.","Pei, Sen; Dahl, Kristina A; Yamana, Teresa K; Licker, Rachel; Shaman, Jeffrey",Geohealth,,319

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this retrospective, international multicenter study, we reviewed the electronic medical records and imaging of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from March 3, 2020, to June 25, 2020. Our inclusion criteria were patients diagnosed with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection with acute neurologic manifestations and available chest CT and brain imaging. The 5 lobes of the lungs were individually scored on a scale of 0-5 (0 corresponded to no involvement and 5 corresponded to >75% involvement). A CT lung severity score was determined as the sum of lung involvement, ranging from 0 (no involvement) to 25 (maximum involvement). RESULTS: A total of 135 patients met the inclusion criteria with 132 brain CT, 36 brain MR imaging, 7 MRA of the head and neck, and 135 chest CT studies. Compared with 86 (64%) patients without acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging, 49 (36%) patients with these findings had a significantly higher mean CT lung severity score (9.9 versus 5.8, P < .001). These patients were more likely to present with ischemic stroke (40 [82%] versus 11 [13%], P < .0001) and were more likely to have either ground-glass opacities or consolidation (46 [94%] versus 73 [84%], P = .01) in the lungs. A threshold of the CT lung severity score of >8 was found to be 74% sensitive and 65% specific for acute abnormal findings on neuroimaging. The neuroimaging hallmarks of these patients were acute ischemic infarct (28%), intracranial hemorrhage (10%) including microhemorrhages (19%), and leukoencephalopathy with and/or without restricted diffusion (11%). The predominant CT chest findings were peripheral ground-glass opacities with or without consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: The CT lung disease severity score may be predictive of acute abnormalities on neuroimaging in patients with COVID-19 with neurologic manifestations. This can be used as a predictive tool in patient management to improve clinical outcome.","Mahammedi, A; Ramos, A; Bargalló, N; Gaskill, M; Kapur, S; Saba, L; Carrete, H; Sengupta, S; Salvador, E; Hilario, A; Revilla, Y; Sanchez, M; Perez-Nuñez, M; Bachir, S; Zhang, B; Oleaga, L; Sergio, J; Koren, L; Martin-Medina, P; Wang, L; Benegas, M; Ostos, F; Gonzalez-Ortega, G; Calleja, P; Udstuen, G; Williamson, B; Khandwala, V; Chadalavada, S; Woo, D; Vagal, A",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,319

This exploratory descriptive study used a 49-item online survey, distributed to health care professionals working with hospitalized infants and families. The sample consisted of 96 participants from 22 countries. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 87% of units welcomed families and 92% encouraged skin-to-skin care. During the pandemic, family presence was restricted in 83% of units, while participation in infant care was restricted in 32%. Medium-sized (20-40 beds) units applied less restriction than small (<20 beds) units (p = 0.03). Units with single-family rooms that did not restrict parental presence, implemented fewer restrictions regarding parents' active participation in care (p = 0.02). Restrictions to families were not affected by geographic infection rates or developmental care education of health care professionals. Restrictions during the pandemic increased separation between the infant and family.","Litmanovitz, Ita; Silberstein, Dalia; Butler, Samantha; Vittner, Dorothy",J Perinatol,,319

512434,By the Numbers,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To avoid the significant risks posed by the use of COVID-19 serology tests with supply chain constraints or poor performance characteristics, we developed an in-house SARS-CoV-2 total antibody test. Our test was compared with three commercial methods, and was used to determine COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. METHODS: Seventy-nine plasma and serum samples from 50 patients 4-69 days after symptom onset who tested positive by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab were used to evaluate our test's clinical performance. Seropositive samples were analyzed for IgG titers in a follow-up assay. Thirty plasma and serum from 12 patients who tested negative by a SARS-CoV-2 PCR method using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and 210 negative pre-pandemic serum samples were also analyzed. Among samples from patients > 14 days after symptom onset, the assay had 100% clinical sensitivity and 100% clinical specificity, 100% positive predictive value and 100% negative predictive value. Analytical specificity was 99.8%, indicating minimal cross-reactivity. A screening study was conducted to ascertain COVID-19 seroprevalence among healthcare workers and outpatients in Minnesota. RESULTS: Analysis of serum collected between April 13 and May 21, 2020 indicated a COVID-19 seroprevalence of 2.96% among 1,282 healthcare workers and 4.46% among 2,379 outpatients.

Methods: A cross-sectional, observational study was done to assess determinants of stress and its impact on glycemic control in adolescents and young adults (aged 12-24 years) living with T1D in India. An online, semi-structured survey including Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) was distributed and results were analyzed. Results: A total of 89 participants (46 males, mean age 19.61 ± 3.8 years) with T1D completed the survey. Age (r = 0.325, p = 0.005) and HBA1C level within the preceding 3 months (r = 0.274, p = 0.036) correlated positively with PSS-10 scores. There was a statistically significant difference in PSS-10 score based on gender (t(70) = - 2.147; p = 0.035), education (F (4,67) = 4.34, p = 0.003), and occupation (F(3,68) = 4.50, p = .006). On multiple linear regression, gender, occupation, and HbA1C were the significant determinants of PSS-10 (F(3,55) = 12.01, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.363). One-way ANOVA showed a significant impact of mean PSS-10 score on the glycemic control (F(2,69) = 3.813, p = 0.027). Conclusion: An increased prevalence of stress was seen among Indian adolescents and young adults living with T1D. Female gender, salaried individuals, and pre-existing poorly controlled diabetes contributed to an increased risk of stress. Increased stress resulted in worsened glycemic control.","Agarwal, Neha; Harikar, Mandara; Shukla, Rishi; Bajpai, Anurag",Int J Diabetes Dev Ctries,,319

517378,Outcomes and Risk Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a North American Registry of Patients With Multiple Sclerosis,2021,"Autopsy is a postmortem investigation of the body to determine the cause of death or extent of disease, also serving a quality assurance role by evaluating diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and outcomes in clinical medicine. Autopsy also holds promise in medical education as a focal point for integration and correlation of basic & clinical medical knowledge. Unfortunately, the vast educational potential goes unrealized due to several barriers such as clinicolegal risks, potential exposure to biohazardous materials, limited time, space, and negative stigma. On the other hand, cadaveric dissection in gross anatomy is in rapid decline in medical education as sweeping curricular changes continue to reduce contact hours in favor of systemic and clinical integration. The situation was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which demanded expeditious online migration of classes and will likely have a long lasting and transformative impact on the educational landscape. At this time, a unique opportunity exists to adopt an autopsy protocol for cadaveric dissection in gross anatomy to actualize the untapped potential of clinical practice. Therefore, in a pilot project, the feasibility and perceived value of adopting autopsy protocol in cadaveric dissection were evaluated. Four students with regional gross anatomy dissection experience and faculty (n=2) completed dissections of four cadavers using an en masse autopsy protocol. First, external examination of the whole body noting all surface anatomy including scars, abrasions, contusions, and tumors, provided an opportunity to make acquaintance with the body donor. Second, thoracic and abdominopelvic organs were removed en masse (Figure 1) with minimal disruption to the musculoskeletal framework, preserving most neurovascular supply and anatomic relationships of multiple organ systems. The en masse organ block was further dissected into organ system blocks to demonstrate relationships of individual organs. Finally, the musculoskeletal system of the main body frame was regionally dissected. Unstructured interviews of faculty and students were conducted to gauge experience and perceptions of autopsy protocol in cadaveric dissection. A survey of student dissectors (n=4) and observers (n=4) was conducted to qualitatively assess educational value. All participants unanimously reported that autopsy protocol and the en masse organ blocks would benefit gross anatomy education. Students reported new knowledge gained on the boundary of the peritoneum, retroperitoneal structures, ligaments of the visceral organs, and spatial relationships of organ systems that are lost in regional dissections. These outcomes suggest that integrating an en masse autopsy protocol in a gross anatomy course is a viable option that offers a clinical approach to learning gross anatomy. Taken together, adopting autopsy protocol in some form in medical education holds ample opportunity to integrate multiple basic science subjects and clinical practice. Educational value of the autopsy protocol in gross anatomy education will be investigated in the future studies.","Lee, Lisa Hight Marissa Wagner Matilda Wahl Lauren Fiebig Caleb Lohman Bonfiglio Chelsea",The FASEB Journal,,319

518467,Pioneering a new publishing model,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread around the world. While the first case was recorded in Hubei in December 2019, the extent of early community spread in Central Europe before this period is unknown. A high proportion of asymptomatic cases and undocumented infections, high transmissibility, and phylogenetic genomic diversity have engendered the controversial possibility of early international community spread of SARS-CoV-2 before its emergence in China. METHODS: To assess the early presence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland, we retrospectively performed an analysis of deaths at University Hospital Basel between October 2019 and February 2020 (n = 310), comparing the incidence of clinical causes of death with March 2020 (n = 72), the month during which the first lethal COVID-19 cases in Basel were reported. Trends of COVID-19-suggestive sequelae, such as bronchopneumonia with organization, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or pulmonary embolisms (PE) were evaluated. In cases where autopsy was performed (n = 71), analogous analyses were conducted on the cause of death and pulmonary histological findings. Eight cases with a COVID-19-suggestive clinical history and histopathology between October 2019 and February 2020, and 3 cases before October 2019, were selected for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. RESULTS: A statistically significant rise in pulmonary causes of death was observed in March 2020 (p = 0.03), consistent with the reported emergence of lethal COVID-19 in Switzerland. A rise in lethal bronchopneumonia was observed between December 2019 and January 2020, which was likely seasonal. The incidence of lethal ARDS and PE was uniformly low between October 2019 and February 2020. All autopsy cases analyzed by means of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR yielded negative results. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the absence of early lethal community spread of COVID-19 in Basel before its initial reported emergence in Switzerland in March 2020.","Haslbauer, Jasmin Dionne; Perrina, Valeria; Matter, Matthias; Dellas, Athanassios; Mihatsch, Michael J; Tzankov, Alexandar",Pathobiology,,319

The aim of this study was to explore whether hypertension is an independent risk factor for critical COVID-19 and mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched until November 2020. Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated by using random-effect models, and the effect of covariates was analyzed using the subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. A total of 24 observational studies with 99,918 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The proportions of hypertension in critical COVID-19 were 37% (95% CI: 0.27 -0.47) when compared with 18% (95% CI: 0.14 -0.23) of noncritical COVID-19 patients, in those who died were 46% (95%CI: 0.37 -0.55) when compared with 22% (95% CI: 0.16 -0.28) of survivors. Pooled results based on the adjusted OR showed that patients with hypertension had a 1.82-fold higher risk for critical COVID-19 (aOR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.77; P = 0.005) and a 2.17-fold higher risk for COVID-19 mortality (aOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.67 - 2.82; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis results showed that male patients had a higher risk of developing to the critical condition than female patients (OR: 3.04; 95%CI: 2.06 - 4.49; P < 0.001) and age >60 years was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR: 3.12; 95% CI: 1.93 - 5.05; P < 0.001). Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age (Coef. = 2.3×10-2, P = 0.048) had a significant influence on the association between hypertension and COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that hypertension was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and inhospital mortality of COVID-19.","Du, Yanbin; Zhou, Nan; Zha, Wenting; Lv, Yuan",Nutr. metab. cardiovasc. dis,,319

Additionally, there is no systematic way to explore data stored in the largest transcriptome repository, NCBI GEO. To fill these gaps, we have developed eVITTA (easy Visualization and Inference Toolbox for Transcriptome Analysis; https://tau.cmmt.ubc.ca/eVITTA/). eVITTA provides modules for analysis and exploration of studies published in NCBI GEO (easyGEO), detailed molecular- and systems-level functional profiling (easyGSEA), and customizable comparisons among experimental groups (easyVizR). We tested eVITTA on transcriptomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected human nasopharyngeal swab samples, and identified a downregulation of olfactory signal transducers, in line with the clinical presentation of anosmia in COVID-19 patients. We also analyzed transcriptomes of Caenorhabditis elegans worms with disrupted S-adenosylmethionine metabolism, confirming activation of innate immune responses and feedback induction of one-carbon cycle genes. Collectively, eVITTA streamlines complex computational workflows into an accessible interface, thus filling the gap of an end-to-end platform capable of capturing both broad and granular changes in human and model organism transcriptomes.","Cheng, Xuanjin; Yan, Junran; Liu, Yongxing; Wang, Jiahe; Taubert, Stefan",Nucleic Acids Res,,319

AIM: This study aims to reveal more data on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients outside of Wuhan, Zhejiang, China. DESIGN: This study was a retrospective case series. METHODS: Eighty-eight cases of laboratory-confirmed and three cases of clinically confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to five hospitals in Zhejiang province, China. Data were collected from 20 January 2020 to 11 February 2020. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of all 91 patients, 88 (96.70%) were laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 with throat swab samples that tested positive for SARS-Cov-2, three (3.30%) cases were clinically diagnosed. The median age of the patients was 50 (36.5-57) years, and female accounted for 59.34%. In this sample, 40 (43.96%) patients had contracted the disease from local cases, 31 (34.07%) patients had been to Wuhan/Hubei, eight (8.79%) patients had contacted with people from Wuhan, and 11 (12.09%) patients were diagnosed after having flown together in the same flight with no passenger that could later be identified as the source of infection. In particular within the city of Ningbo, 60.52% cases can be traced back to an event held in a temple. The most common symptoms were fever (71.43%), cough (60.44%) and fatigue (43.96%). The median of incubation period was 6 (interquartile range 3-8) days and the median time from the first visit to a doctor to the confirmed diagnosis was 1 (1-2) days. According to the chest computed tomography scans, 67.03% cases had bilateral pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Social activity cluster, family cluster and flying alongside with persons already infected with COVID-19 were how people got infected with COVID-19 in Zhejiang.","Qian, G-Q; Yang, N-B; Ding, F; Ma, A H Y; Wang, Z-Y; Shen, Y-F; Shi, C-W; Lian, X; Chu, J-G; Chen, L; Ren, D-W; Li, G-X; Chen, X-Q; Shen, H-J; Chen, X-M",QJM,,319

In the case of the RP2.1, an additional 21 viral and bacterial pathogens can be detected. Both tests have received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration and Interim Order authorization from Health Canada for use in clinical laboratories. We evaluated the performance characteristics of these tests in comparison to a laboratory-developed real-time PCR assay targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and E genes. A total of 78 tests were performed using the BioFire COVID-19 Test, including 30 clinical specimens and 48 tests in a limit of detection study; 57 tests were performed using the RP2.1 for evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 detection, including 30 clinical specimens and 27 tests for limit of detection. Results showed 100% concordance between the BioFire assays and the laboratory-developed test for all clinical samples tested, and acceptable performance of both BioFire assays at their stated limits of detection.

There are numerous strategies followed in healthcare facilities to minimize pathogen transfer, but complete infection control has not, as yet, been achieved. However, based on traditional use in many cultures, the introduction of copper products and surfaces to significantly and positively retard pathogen transmission invites further investigation. For example, many microbes are rendered unviable upon contact exposure to copper or copper alloys, either immediately or within a short time. In addition, many disease-causing bacteria such as E. coli O157:H7, hospital superbugs, and several viruses (including SARS-CoV-2) are also susceptible to exposure to copper surfaces. It is thus suggested that replacing common touch surfaces in healthcare facilities, food industries, and public places (including public transport) with copper or alloys of copper may substantially contribute to limiting transmission. Subsequent hospital admissions and mortality rates will consequently be lowered, with a concomitant saving of lives and considerable levels of resources. This consideration is very significant in times of the COVID-19 pandemic and the upcoming epidemics, as it is becoming clear that all forms of possible infection control measures should be practiced in order to protect community well-being and promote healthy outcomes.","Abraham, Joji; Dowling, Kim; Florentine, Singarayer",Materials (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ma14133444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34206230/,319
589955,Deterministic analysis of extrinsic and intrinsic noise in an epidemiological model,2016-05-13,"Growing clinical evidence has implicated complement as a pivotal driver of COVID-19 immunopathology. Deregulated complement activation may fuel thrombotic microangiopathy and NET-driven immunothrombosis, thereby exacerbating cytokine-driven hyper-inflammation and multi-organ failure. Complement therapeutics have gained traction as candidate drugs for countering the detrimental consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whether blockade of terminal complement effectors (C5, C5a, or C5aR1) can elicit similar outcomes to upstream intervention at the level of C3 remains debated. Here we have compared the clinical efficacy of the C5-targeting mAb eculizumab with that of the compstatin-based C3-targeted drug candidate AMY-101 in small independent cohorts of severe, mainly non-intubated COVID-19 patients. Our exploratory study indicates that therapeutic complement inhibition abrogates COVID-19 hyper-inflammation. Both C3 and C5 inhibitors elicit a robust anti-inflammatory response, reflected by a steep decline in CRP and IL-6 levels, associated with marked lung function improvement and resolution of SARS-CoV-2-associated ARDS. C3 inhibition afforded broader therapeutic control in COVID19 patients by attenuating both C3a and sC5b-9 generation and preventing FB consumption. This broader inhibitory profile of anti-C3 treatment was associated with a more robust decline of neutrophil counts, a greater decline of median LDH levels and more prominent lymphocyte recovery within the first 7 days of treatment. These early clinical results offer important insight into the differential mechanistic basis and underlying biology of C3 and C5 inhibition in COVID-19. They point to a broader pathogenic involvement of C3-mediated pathways and set the stage for larger prospective trials that will benchmark these complement-targeting agents in COVID-19.","Mastellos, D.

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey recruited 387 Mozambicans aged 18 to 70 years. The psychometric properties of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S were evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis and Rash analysis. Additionally, the association of the FCV-19S with sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables was investigated using the two-sample t-test, one-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression. RESULTS: The unidimensional factor structure of the Portuguese version of the FCV-19S was confirmed, and the scale showed good internal consistency reliability. The FCV-19S properties tested from the Rasch analysis were satisfactory. Women and those with lower education levels had higher scores of fear. Moreover, significantly higher levels of fear were observed among those being in an at-risk group for COVID-19, having family members or friends diagnosed or with death confirmed by COVID-19, and not being confident that they would receive adequate care from the public health services in case of COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: The Portuguese version of FCV-19S has strong psychometric properties and can be used to assess the fear of COVID-19 in the Portuguese-speaking population of Mozambique. As the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health represents a challenge to clinical psychiatry, and information on mental health in African countries is still scarce, our findings may assist in the planning of public mental health policies, aimed mainly at specific segments of the population, such as women and people in extreme poverty.","Giordani, Rubia Carla Formighieri; Giolo, Suely Ruiz; Muhl, Camila; Estavela, Arune João; Mabuie Gove, Janete Ismael",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33776494/; https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s298948,319

The potential role played by the asymptomatic COVID-19 patients in transmitting the disease via the fecal-oral route is now under investigation. Hence, in the present scenario, wastewater-based epidemiology, and sewage surveillance may provide valuable insights into the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among the human population and could serve as a sensitive surveillance system and a crucial early warning tool. Further studies are required to determine the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, transmissibility through wastewater, and the potential to infect humans via the fecal-oral route.

592351,The Latest Trends in Electric Vehicles Batteries,2021-05-26,"Early shock wave lithotripsy is associated with higher stone-free rate compared to delayed treatment of ureteral stones, but may constitute overtreatment because ureteral stones can pass spontaneously. We studied the association between time to treatment and stone-free rate in patients with ureteral stones to determine optimal shock wave lithotripsy timing. We retrospectively analyzed 537 patients undergoing shock wave lithotripsy for ureteral stones. Patients were divided into five groups according to time from onset of symptoms to lithotripsy—urgent (0–3 days), early (4–30 days), late (31–60 days), long-delayed lithotripsy (≥ 61 days), and asymptomatic. Stone-free rates were compared among groups. Mean age and stone size were 55.6 ± 13.1 years and 7.48 ± 3.29 mm, respectively. Mean number of shock wave lithotripsy sessions and stone-free rate were 1.37 and 91.6%, respectively, in the overall population. Stone-free rates were 95.2%, 96.8%, 91.3%, 86.3%, and 82.7% in urgent, early, late, long-delayed lithotripsy, and asymptomatic groups, respectively. Long-delayed lithotripsy and asymptomatic groups had significantly more lithotripsy sessions and lower stone-free rate, compared to urgent and early lithotripsy groups. In multivariate analysis, time to lithotripsy [long-delayed lithotripsy (odds ratio: 0.273, p = 0.004) and asymptomatic nature (odds ratio: 0.236, p = 0.002)] and age (odds ratio: 0.959, p = 0.003) independently affected stone-free rate. In conclusion, time to lithotripsy is a strong predictive factor for stone-free status following shock wave lithotripsy. Urgent shock wave lithotripsy did not improve stone-free rate if performed within 1 month. However, time to shock wave lithotripsy > 2 months reduced likelihood of stone-free status.

592637,Human Activity Pattern Implications for Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Transmission,2020-12-08,"PURPOSE: The COVID‐19 pandemic has presented an international health crisis of a scope not seen in our lifetime. While much attention has been paid to health workers in critical care and acute areas, nurses working outside of hospitals are also significantly affected. This study sought to investigate the experience of nurses working in Australian primary healthcare during the COVID‐19 pandemic. In particular, it sought to understand the implications on their employment status, role, and access to personal protective equipment. DESIGN AND METHODS: Nurses employed in primary healthcare across Australia were invited to participate in a cross‐sectional online survey through social media and professional organizations. The survey tool was composed of demographics, and of questions about the nurses’ employment, work role, and access to personal protective equipment. FINDINGS: Of the 637 responses received, nearly half (43.7%) reported a decrease in hours and threatened or actual loss of employment. While most respondents felt that they had sufficient knowledge about COVID‐19, they expressed concern about work‐related risks to themselves and their family. Most respondents described never or only sometimes having sufficient personal protective equipment in their workplace. Just over half of respondents (54.8%) felt well supported by their employer. A third of respondents (34%) perceived that care provided in their workplace was significantly or slightly worse than before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of primary healthcare nurses’ experiences during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The study findings highlighted a concerning level of insecurity around primary healthcare nursing employment, as well as issues with the availability of personal protective equipment for these nurses. The perception that the pandemic has resulted in reduced quality of care needs further exploration to ensure that those with chronic conditions are supported to maintain and promote health. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Understanding the implications of COVID‐19 on the primary healthcare nursing workforce is vital to ensure staff retention and care quality. Ensuring that the community remains healthy and supported at home is vital to both reduce the burden on the health system and reduce secondary mortality.","Halcomb, Elizabeth; McInnes, Susan; Williams, Anna; Ashley, Christine; James, Sharon; Fernandez, Ritin; Stephen, Catherine; Calma, Kaara",J Nurs Scholarsh,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32735758/; https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12589,319

The pathogenesis and complications advanced with infection mainly involve immune-inflammatory cascade. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy relies on immune modulation, reducing infectivity and inflammation. Given the interplay of infection and immune-inflammatory axis, the natural products received attention for preventive and therapeutic usage in COVID-19 due to their potent antiviral and anti-immunomodulatory activities. Recently, Echinacea preparations, particularly E. purpurea, have been suggested to be an important antiviral agent to be useful in COVID-19 by modulating virus entry, internalization and replication. In principle, the immune response and the resultant inflammatory process are important for the elimination of the infection, but may have a significant impact on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and may play a role in the clinical spectrum of COVID-19. Considering the pharmacological effects, therapeutic potential, and molecular mechanisms of Echinacea, we hypothesize that it could be a reasonably possible candidate for targeting infection, immunity, and inflammation in COVID-19 with recent recognition of cannabinoid-2 (CB2) receptors and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) mediated mechanisms of bioactive components that make them notable immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and antiviral agent. The plausible reason for our hypothesis is that the presence of numerous bioactive agents in different parts of plants that may synergistically exert polypharmacological actions in regulating immune-inflammatory axis in COVID-19. Our proposition is to scientifically contemplate the therapeutic perspective and prospect of Echinacea on infection, immunity, and inflammation with a potential in COVID-19 to limit the severity and progression of the disease. Based on the clinical usage for respiratory infections, and relative safety in humans, further studies for the evidence-based approach to COVID-19 are needed. We do hope that Echinacea could be a candidate agent for immunomodulation in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.","Nagoor Meeran, M.

In LMIC, three types of public health training have been tried: the university-based model; streamed training for specialised workers; and field-based programs. The first has low rates of production and teaching may not always be based on the needs and priorities of the host country. The second model is efficient, but does not accord the workers sufficient status to enable them to impact on policy. The third has the most potential as a capacity development measure for LMIC, but in practice faces challenges which may limit its ability to promote capacity development. DISCUSSION: We describe Australia's first Master of Applied Epidemiology (MAE) model (established in 1991), which uses field-based training to strengthen the control of communicable diseases. A central attribute of this model is the way it partners and complements health department initiatives to enhance workforce skills, health system performance and the evidence-base for policies, programs and practice. SUMMARY: The MAE experience throws light on ways Australia could collaborate in regional capacity development initiatives. Key needs are a shared vision for a regional approach to integrate training with initiatives that strengthen service and research, and the pooling of human, financial and technical resources. We focus on communicable diseases, but our findings and recommendations are generalisable to other areas of public health.","Patel, Mahomed S; Phillips, Christine B",Aust New Zealand Health Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19358710/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1743-8462-6-5,319
601995,Identifying persistent structures in multiscale ‘omics data,2020-10-03,"BACKGROUND: This paper describes a model for estimating COVID-19 related excess deaths that are a direct consequence of insufficient hospital ward bed and intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. METHODS: Compartmental models were used to estimate deaths under different combinations of ICU and ward care required and received in England up to late April 2021. Model parameters were sourced from publicly available government information and organisations collating COVID-19 data. A sub-model was used to estimate the mortality scalars that represent increased mortality due to insufficient ICU or general ward bed capacity. Three illustrative scenarios for admissions numbers, ‘Optimistic’, ‘Middling’ and ‘Pessimistic’, were modelled and compared with the subsequent observations to the 3rd February. RESULTS: The key output was the demand and capacity model described. There were no excess deaths from a lack of capacity in the ‘Optimistic’ scenario. Several of the ‘Middling’ scenario applications resulted in excess deaths—up to 597 deaths (0.6% increase) with a 20% reduction compared to best estimate ICU capacity. All the ‘Pessimistic’ scenario applications resulted in excess deaths, ranging from 49,178 (17.0% increase) for a 20% increase in ward bed availability, to 103,735 (35.8% increase) for a 20% shortfall in ward bed availability. These scenarios took no account of the emergence of the new, more transmissible, variant of concern (b.1.1.7). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality is increased when hospital demand exceeds available capacity. No excess deaths from breaching capacity would be expected under the ‘Optimistic’ scenario. The ‘Middling’ scenario could result in some excess deaths—up to a 0.7% increase relative to the total number of deaths. The ‘Pessimistic’ scenario would have resulted in significant excess deaths. Our sensitivity analysis indicated a range between 49,178 (17% increase) and 103,735 (35.8% increase). Given the new variant, the pessimistic scenario appeared increasingly likely and could have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of COVID-19 deaths. In the event, it would appear that capacity was not breached at any stage at a national level with no excess deaths. it will remain unclear if minor local capacity breaches resulted in any small number of excess deaths.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the mortality of critically ill cancer patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched online databases and manually searched for studies in English that reported on outcomes of adult cancer patients with COVID-19 admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) or those with severe COVID-19 between December 2019 and October 2020. Risk of bias was assessed by the Modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We also determined the odds of death for cancer patients versus noncancer patients, as also outcomes by cancer subtypes, presence of recent anticancer therapy, and presence of one or more comorbidities. Random-effects modeling was used. RESULTS: In 28 studies (1,276 patients), pooled mortality in cancer patients with COVID-19 admitted to an ICU was 60.2% (95% CI, 53.6 to 6.7; I(2) = 80.27%), with four studies (7,259 patients) showing higher odds of dying in cancer versus noncancer patients (odds ratio 1.924; 95% CI, 1.596 to 2.320). In four studies (106 patients) of patients with cancer and severe COVID-19, pooled mortality was 59.4% (95% CI, –39.4 to 77.5; I(2) = 72.28%); in one study, presence of hematologic malignancy was associated with significantly higher mortality compared with nonhematologic cancers (odds ratio 1.878; 95% CI, 1.171 to 3.012). Risk of bias was low. CONCLUSION: Most studies were reported before the results of trials suggesting the benefit of dexamethasone and tocilizumab, potentially overestimating mortality. The observed mortality of 60% in cancer patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU is not prohibitively high, and admission to the ICU should be considered for selected patients (registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020207209).","Nadkarni, Amogh Rajeev; Vijayakumaran, Swapna C.; Gupta, Sudeep; Divatia, Jigeeshu V.",JCO Glob Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34406802/; https://doi.org/10.1200/go.21.00072,319

The impact of population density, family size, mobility and government actions on mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infections is not well understood. Method(s): This is a retrospective data analysis using the Worldwide WHO situation reports along with population density information and family size information (from ), government response data (7 policies: school closure (SC), workplace closure (WC), public event cancellation (PEC), restriction on gatherings (RG), public transport closure (PTC), stay-at-home (SAH), internal movement restrictions (IMR) - Oxford University) and mobility reports (Apple) to estimate variables associated with COVID-19 mortality from countries with complete information. Poisson regression models were developed to evaluate associations between mortality counts and variables mentioned herein. A 42-day lag was applied to mobility and government response metrics to evaluate the impact thereof on mortality. Result(s): Nine countries were included in the analysis (Australia, Belgium, Chile, Italy, Peru, Saudi Arabia, Spain, UK, USA). The highest quartile of government response index had the greatest protective effect on mortality (incidence proportion ratio (IPR): 0.05 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.32). There was no consistent association impact between walking, driving or transit mobility metric. Government actions with significant protective effect were PTC (IPR: 0.46 (0.28-0.75)) and PEC (IPR: 0.65 (0.47-0.91)). All other government actions did not show a statistically significant association with mortality. Conclusion(s): Our study identified population metrics and government actions potentially associated with mortality, across multiple geographies. Further research on key confounders (such as mask wearing) is required to evaluate further actions to mitigate the mortality from COVID-19.Copyright © 2020","Shah, S.; Ray, B.; Holy, C.; Sakthivel, M.; Elangovanraaj, N.; Krishnan, D.; Gupta, S.; Trivedi, P.; Devulapally, M.; Mohapatra, A.; Coplan, P.",Value in Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.08.956; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301520332125; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098301520332125,319

As of May 2, 2020, more than 3,000,000 confirmed cases have been reported world. In Macao, there were 45 confirmed COVID-19 cases until May 2, 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we summarized the radiological features of these cases and analyzed relationship between the clinical characteristics and radiological findings. We retrospectively analyzed the imaging manifestations of the 45 cases with COVID-19 in Macao, focusing on identifying and characterizing the most common radiological findings of COVID-19. We retrospectively analyze the relationship between the clinical features and radiological finding of COVID-19 pneumonia. RESULTS: This study showed that chest CT manifestations of COVID-19 were multiple ground-glass densities in both lungs. It is dominated by bilateral peripheral subpleural distribution, which may be accompanied by consolidation, interlobular septa thickening, and adjacent pleura thickening. As the disease progresses, it can manifest as consolidation of the lungs in CT scan. We also found the age, smoking and hypertension may be risk factor for predicting the severity of COVID-19 in radiology. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 should be diagnosed based on the clinical feature, nCoV PCR test and radiological manifestation. The main manifestation of COVID-19 is peripheral ground glass opacity. Age, smoking and hypertension may be used to predict the severity of COVID-19. Chest CT is the important radiological method for screening and detecting COVID-19 patients.","Ieong, Chon Man; Xu, Xi; Kong, Soi Chau; Luo, Liangping",Eur J Radiol Open,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352047720300642?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352047720300642; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33047093/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejro.2020.100275,319

Data were collected from two online OSCE simulation trials and the Online National Board of Urology OSCE. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess examiners and candidates’ perception. The average final score of the Online OSCE was compared to previous face-to-face OSCE results. All candidates and examiners (100%) heard and saw clearly the audio-visual in both OSCE simulation trials. None of the candidates had a failing score on the mock exam from all stations. There was a statistically significant difference between the online OSCE and December 2019 face-to-face OSCE. The Online National Board Urology OSCE was feasible and comparable to face-to-face OSCE in evaluating urology candidates. It may be beneficial for the future OSCE method in the medical education system. • Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) which assesses a broad range of urology candidates’ high-level clinical skills, is a more valid and reliable assessment instrument than the traditional oral examination; • The Online National Board of Urology OSCE method can help evaluate urology candidates, especially during the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.","Sihombing, Aaron.T.; Taher, A.; Rodjani, A.; Mochtar, C.A.; Hakim, L.; Daryanto, B.; Danarto, H.R.; Umbas, R.",MethodsX,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34434836/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mex.2021.101316,319

Glioblastoma (GBM) patients are among the most vulnerable due to increased incidence in the elderly and the short survival time. A virtual meeting was convened on May 9, 2020 with a panel of neuro-oncology experts with experience using Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields). The objective was to assess the risk-to-benefit ratio and provide guidance for using TTFields in GBM during the COVID-19 pandemic. PANEL DISCUSSION: Topics discussed included support and delivery of TTFields during the COVID-19 pandemic, concomitant use of TTFields with chemotherapy, and any potential impact of TTFields on the immune system in an intrinsically immunosuppressed GBM population. Special consideration was given to TTFields' use in elderly patients and in combination with radiotherapy regimens. Finally, the panel discussed the need to better capture data on COVID-19positive brain tumor patients to analyze longitudinal outcomes and changes in treatment decision-making during the pandemic. EXPERT OPINION: TTFields is a portable home-use device which can be managed via telemedicine and safely used in GBM patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. TTFields has no known immunosuppressive effects which is important during a crisis where other treatment methods might be limited, especially for elderly patients with multiple co-morbidities. It is too early to estimate the full impact of COVID-19 on the global healthcare system and on patient outcomes and the panel strongly recommended collaboration with existing cancer COVID-19 registries to follow CNS tumor patients.","Gatson, Na Tosha N.; Barnholtz-Sloan, Jill; Drappatz, Jan; Henriksson, Roger; Hottinger, Andreas F.; Hinoul, Piet; Kruchko, Carol; Puduvalli, Vinay K.; Tran, David D.; Wong, Eric T.; Glas, Martin",Front Oncol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2021.679702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026655/,319

607176,Comparison of Full-Reference Image Quality Models for Optimization of Image Processing Systems,2021-01-21,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The viral outbreak started in late 2019 and rapidly became a serious health threat to the global population. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Several therapeutic options have been adopted to prevent the spread of the virus. Although vaccines have been developed, antivirals are still needed to combat the infection of this virus. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus, and its genome encodes polyproteins that can be processed into structural and nonstructural proteins. Maturation of viral proteins requires cleavages by proteases. Therefore, the main protease (3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL(pro)) or M(pro)) encoded by the viral genome is an attractive drug target because it plays an important role in cleaving viral polyproteins into functional proteins. Inhibiting this enzyme is an efficient strategy to block viral replication. Structural studies provide valuable insight into the function of this protease and structural basis for rational inhibitor design. In this review, we describe structural studies on the main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The strategies applied in developing inhibitors of the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 and currently available protein inhibitors are summarized. Due to the availability of high-resolution structures, structure-guided drug design will play an important role in developing antivirals. The availability of high-resolution structures, potent peptidic inhibitors, and diverse compound scaffolds indicate the feasibility of developing potent protease inhibitors as antivirals for COVID-19.","Li, Qingxin; Kang, CongBao",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32824639/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081250,319

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional design. This study used the 2018 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses (NSSRN) public-use file to examine RN employment and earnings. METHODS: Our study population included a sample of 15,373 RNs who were employed at least 1000 hours in nursing in the past year and active in patient care. Characteristics such as race/ethnicity, type of RN degree completed, census region, and union status were included. Multiple regression analyses examined the effect of these characteristics on wages. Logistic regression was used to predict RN employment in LTC settings. RESULTS: RNs in LTC experienced lower wages compared with those in non-LTC settings, yet this difference was not associated with racial/ethnic or international educational differences. Among RNs working in LTC, lower wages were associated with part-time work, less experience, lack of union representation, and regional wage differences. CONCLUSION: Because RNs in LTC earn lower wages than RNs in other settings, policies to minimize pay inequities are needed to support the RN workforce caring for frail older adults.","Wagner, Laura M.; Bates, Timothy; Spetz, Joanne",Med Care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001618; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34524246/,319

However, the difference between the clinical characteristics of fevered and non-fevered patients is still unclear. The aim of the present study was to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients and analyze the predictors for severe events of adult fevered COVID-19 patients. Methods: Clinical and laboratory data of fevered and non-fevered COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, were collected and analyzed. Logistic regression analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve) analysis were adopted to analyze risk factors and evaluate the effectiveness of the predictors for severe events in adult fevered COVID-19 patients. Results: Of the 230 adult COVD-19 patients in this study, 175 patients (76.1%) had fever and 55 patients (23.9%) did not have fever. Compared with non-fevered patients, the fevered patients showed a lower lymphocyte proportion (P = 0.000) and lymphocyte count (P = 0.000) as well as higher levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) (P = 0.000) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P = 0.000). The proportion of severe cases was significantly elevated in adult fevered patients (P = 0.000). Compared to non-severe fevered patients, severe fevered patients showed a lower lymphocyte count (P = 0.000), a lower lymphocyte proportion (P = 0.000), and higher levels of CRP (P = 0.000). As determined by the multivariate analysis, CRP (OR 1.026, P = 0.018) and lymphocyte proportion (OR 0.924, P = 0.009) were significantly associated with the risk of developing severe events in fevered adult COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, ROC Curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for CRP combined with lymphocyte proportion to diagnose severe events in fevered adult COVID-19 patients was 0.874 (95% CI 0.820–0.927).

BACKGROUND: Healthcare professionals working in research were redeployed during the COVID‐19 pandemic to support the delivery of clinical services across the National Health Service. They are experienced clinicians with research knowledge and skills, and specific working patterns. It is important to understand how these professionals were used and supported during their transition to clinical roles during the pandemic. METHOD: Between July and September 2020, 15 research healthcare professionals were recruited into this qualitative study. Each participant completed a single semi‐structured interview lasting approximately 30–60 min, conducted remotely using a teleconferencing platform. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data analysed by the process of inductive thematic analysis with the assistance of NVivo 12.06 (Nov, 2019). FINDINGS: Four main themes were identified from analysis of the transcripts: (a) initial personal response to the pandemic (subthemes: of anxieties due to unknown disease impact and concern for others); (b) mobilization for clinical redeployment (subthemes: motivations for voluntary redeployment, the professional challenges, personal fears and the organization and preparedness for redeployment); (c) adaptive deployment to clinical roles (subthemes: adapting to new roles and responsibilities, challenges faced and coping mechanisms), (d) reflections and learnings (subthemes: reintegration to original roles and sense of achievement). CONCLUSION: Research healthcare professionals are highly adaptable professionals equipped with core transferable skills. With the appropriate support, re‐familiarization and induction they are a valuable resource during the pandemic response. IMPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: Research healthcare professionals are experienced practitioners with transferrable skills and strong sense of duty and resilience. Induction programmes to promote recalibration to clinical settings would improve their adaptability, foster confidence and emotional well‐being.

Therefore, this study was conducted to examine the relationships among nurses’ emotional demands, social support, and health. A cross-sectional survey was conducted at two tertiary hospitals in South Korea. A sample of 117 nurses from eight units participated. Between-group differences in the main variables were analyzed using the t-test or Mann–Whitney test, and analysis of variance or the Kruskal–Wallis test. Nurses were classified into eight groups according to emotional demands and type of social support, and the effects of social support were analyzed based on mean scores. Greater social support from colleagues was associated with better health on all measures. However, greater social support from supervisors was associated with a higher incidence of burnout, stress, and sleeping troubles. Nurses’ high emotional demands must be managed actively by hospitals to maintain and promote their health. Providing appropriate social support with consideration of the nurse’s unit experience would help decrease the effects of emotional demands.

Conservation of RDRP allowed us to use a set of Arteriviridae taxa to root the Coronaviridae phylogeny. We found strong evidence for a recombination breakpoint within SARS-CoV RDRP, based on different, well supported trees for a 5′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to a clade including all other coronaviruses) and a 3′ fragment (supporting SARS-CoV as sister to group three avian coronaviruses). These different topologies are statistically significant: the optimal 5′ tree could be rejected for the 3′ region, and the optimal 3′ tree could be rejected for the 5′ region. We did not find statistical evidence for recombination in analyses of N and S, as there is little signal to differentiate among alternative trees. Comparison of phylogenetic trees for 11 known host-species and 36 coronaviruses, representing coronavirus groups 1–3 and SARS-CoV, based on N showed statistical incongruence indicating multiple host-species shifts for coronaviruses. Inference of host-species associations is highly sensitive to sampling and must be considered cautiously. However, current sampling suggests host-species shifts between mouse and rat, chicken and turkey, mammals and manx shearwater, and humans and other mammals. The sister relationship between avian coronaviruses and the 3′ RDRP fragment of SARS-CoV suggests an additional host-species shift. Demonstration of recombination in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates its potential for rapid unpredictable change, a potentially important challenge for public health management and for drug and vaccine development.","Rest, Joshua S; Mindell, David P",Infect Genet Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14522185/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134803000935; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134803000935,319

In vitro, studies indicated that ivermectin (IVM) has antiviral effect. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of ivermectin (IVM) as add-on therapy to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZT) in treatment of COVID-19. Methods: This Pilot clinical trial conducted on hospitalized adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 diagnosed according to WHO interim guidance. Sixteen Patients received a single dose of IVM 200Mcg /kg on admission day as add on therapy to hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ)and Azithromycin (AZT) and were compared with 71 controls received HCQ and AZT matched in age, gender, clinical features, and comorbidities. The primary outcome was percentage of cured patients, defined as symptoms free to be discharged from the hospital and 2 consecutive negative PCR test from nasopharyngeal swabs at least 24 hours apart. The secondary outcomes were time to cure in both groups and evaluated by measuring time from admission of the patient to the hospital till discharge. Results: Of 87 patients included in the study,t he mean age {+/-} SD (range) of patients in the IVM group was similar to controls [44.87 {+/-} 10.64 (28-60) vs 45.23 {+/-} 18.47 (8-80) years, p=0.78] Majority of patients in both groups were male but statistically not significant [11(69%) versus 52 (73%), with male: female ratio 2.21 versus 2.7-, p=0.72) All the patients of IVM group were cured compared with the controls [ 16 (100 %) vs 69 (97.2 %)]. Two patients died in the controls. The mean time to stay in the hospital was significantly lower in IVM group compared with the controls (7.62 {+/-}2.75 versus 13.22 {+/-}.90 days, p=0.00005, effect size= 0.82).

This study collected data with a professional vaccination registration platform for children named ""Xiao Dou Miao"" in February 2021. The psychological anxiety state of the guardians was self-evaluated using the psychological anxiety scale. Factors that might influence the willingness of guardians to vaccinate their children were identified using logistic regression analysis. This study included 12,872 questionnaires with 70.9% of guardians showing willingness to vaccinate their children. Guardians who were male, aged 40-49 and from rural area were more willing to vaccinate their children. Fathers, guardians with higher education and income, whose children have a history of adverse vaccine reactions and allergies were less willing to vaccinate their children (p < .001). More than 80% of the guardians expressed a high level of trust for vaccine information released by official and health-related agencies. Guardians who were not vaccinated were more anxious than those who were vaccinated (&#967;2 = 27.99, p < .001).

Moreover, vaccines and antiviral drugs are not always effective or available for many respiratory viruses. We investigated how induction of effective and appropriate antigen-independent innate immunity in the upper airways can prevent the spread of respiratory virus infection to the vulnerable lower airways. Activation of TLR2, when restricted to the nasal turbinates, resulted in prompt induction of innate immune–driven antiviral responses through action of cytokines, chemokines, and cellular activity in the upper but not the lower airways. We have defined how nasal epithelial cells and recruitment of macrophages work in concert and play pivotal roles to limit progression of influenza virus to the lungs and sustain protection for up to 7 days. These results reveal underlying mechanisms of how control of viral infection in the upper airways can occur and support the implementation of strategies that can activate TLR2 in nasal passages to provide rapid protection, especially for at-risk populations, against severe respiratory infection when vaccines and antiviral drugs are not always effective or available.","Deliyannis, Georgia; Wong, Chinn Yi; McQuilten, Hayley A.; Bachem, Annabell; Clarke, Michele; Jia, Xiaoxiao; Horrocks, Kylie; Zeng, Weiguang; Girkin, Jason; Scott, Nichollas E.; Londrigan, Sarah L.; Reading, Patrick C.; Bartlett, Nathan W.; Kedzierska, Katherine; Brown, Lorena E.; Mercuri, Francesca; Demaison, Christophe; Jackson, David C.; Chua, Brendon Y.",JCI insight,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33561017/; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.140267,319

Ivermectin, an antiparasitic drug, has been shown to possess anti-inflammation, anti-virus, and antitumor properties. However, whether ivermectin affects CRC is still unclear. The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of ivermectin on CRC using CRC cell lines SW480 and SW1116. We used CCK-8 assay to determine the cell viability, used an optical microscope to measure cell morphology, used Annexin V-FITC/7-AAD kit to determine cell apoptosis, used Caspase 3/7 Activity Apoptosis Assay Kit to evaluate Caspase 3/7 activity, used Western blot to determine apoptosis-associated protein expression, and used flow cytometry and fluorescence microscope to determine the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and cell cycle. The results demonstrated that ivermectin dose-dependently inhibited colorectal cancer SW480 and SW1116 cell growth, followed by promoting cell apoptosis and increasing Caspase-3/7 activity. Besides, ivermectin upregulated the expression of proapoptotic proteins Bax and cleaved PARP and downregulated antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Mechanism analysis showed that ivermectin promoted both total and mitochondrial ROS production in a dose-dependent manner, which could be eliminated by administering N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) in CRC cells. Following NAC treatment, the inhibition of cell growth induced by ivermectin was reversed. Finally, ivermectin at low doses (2.5 and 5 µM) induced CRC cell arrest. Overall, ivermectin suppressed cell proliferation by promoting ROS-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway and inducing S phase arrest in CRC cells, suggesting that ivermectin might be a new potential anticancer drug therapy for human colorectal cancer and other cancers.","Zhou, Shican; Wu, Hang; Ning, Wenjuan; Wu, Xiao; Xu, Xiaoxiao; Ma, Yuanqiao; Li, Xingwang; Hu, Junhong; Wang, Chenyu; Wang, Junpeng",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34483925/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2021.717529,319

In nations with aging populations, ensuring equitable use of health check-ups by senior citizens is a public health concern. The objective of this research was to quantify income-related inequality and its effect on the use of health checkup services in Taiwan during the 2007–2008 global financial crisis. We used the 2005 and 2009 datasets of the Taiwan National Health Interview Surveys to assess how income-related inequality influenced health check-up use among older adults in Taiwan during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Corrected concentration indices (CCIs) were calculated and decomposed to determine the influences of explanatory variables. The dependent variable was whether participants had used free senior health check-ups in the past year, and the determinant factors were health behavior, health situation, socioeconomic and demographic factors, and area health care resources accessibility factors. The study assessed 2,460 older adults from the 2005 dataset and 2,514 such individuals from the 2009 dataset. The utilization of health check-ups increased from 21.6% in 2005 to 34.0% in 2009. Income-related inequality in the use of health check-up services was generally tilted toward the higher income individuals among both women and men in 2005 and 2009, and income-related inequality decreased among women group and increased among men group with non significantly from 2005 to 2009 (women: CCI decreased from.0738 in 2005 to.0658 in 2009; men: CCI increased from.1068 in 2005 to.1256 in 2009). We analyzed the effect of explanatory factors on men’s and women’s intention to use health check-ups by using a probit model. After controlling for other factors, we determined that income significantly influenced women’s health check-up service use in 2005 and men’s in 2005 and 2009. Positive health behavior significantly increased health check-up services use among men and women group after the financial crisis, and negative health behavior significantly reduced health check-ups use among men across financial crisis. The 2008 global financial crisis strengthened the effect on health check-ups use of income-related inequality of elderly men, especially in older adults with negative health behaviors. Elderly men with negative health behaviors tended to contribute more income-related inequality in use health check-up services after the financial crisis. Health promotion initiatives should focus their efforts on elderly men with negative health behaviors.","Chu, Chiao-Lee; Lawana, Nozuko",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34111198/,319

Specifically, alongside cancellation and postponements of non-essential surgical services, emergency and essential surgical care delivery may become affected due to the shift of human and material resources towards fighting the pandemic. For surgeries that do get carried through, new difficulties arise in protecting surgical personnel from contracting SARS-CoV-2. This scarcity in LMIC surgical ecosystems may result in higher morbidity and mortality, in addition to the COVID-19 toll. This paper aims to explore the potential consequences of COVID-19 on the emergency and essential surgical care in LMICs, to offer recommendations to mitigate damages and to reflect on preparedness for future crises. Reducing the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on LMIC emergency and essential surgical services can be achieved through empowering communities with accurate information and knowledge on prevention, optimizing surgical material resources, providing quality training of health care personnel to treat SARS-CoV-2, and ensuring adequate personal protection equipment for workers on the frontline. While LMIC health systems are under larger strain, the experience from previous outbreaks may aid in order to innovate and adapt to the current pandemic. Protecting LMIC surgical ecosystems will be a pivotal process in ensuring that previous health system strengthening efforts are preserved, comprehensive care for populations worldwide are ensured, and to allow for future developments beyond the pandemic.","Ma, Xiya; Vervoort, Dominique; Reddy, Ché L.; Park, Kee B.; Makasa, Emmanuel",Int J Surg,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2020.05.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32426019/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1743919120304209; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919120304209?v=s5,319

Some patients develop severe complications including multiple organ failure. It has been suggested that excessive inflammation associated with the disease plays major role in the severity and mortality of COVID-19. To elucidate the inflammatory mechanisms involved in COVID-19, we examined the effects of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (hereafter S1) on the pro-inflammatory responses in murine and human macrophages. Murine peritoneal exudate macrophages produced pro-inflammatory mediators in response to S1 exposure. Exposure to S1 also activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways. Pro-inflammatory cytokine induction by S1 was suppressed by selective inhibitors of NF-κB and JNK pathways. Treatment of murine peritoneal exudate macrophages and human THP-1 cell-derived macrophages with a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) antagonist attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and the activation of intracellular signaling by S1 and lipopolysaccharide. Similar results were obtained in experiments using TLR4 siRNA-transfected murine RAW264.7 macrophages. In contrast, TLR2 neutralizing antibodies could not abrogate the S1-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine induction in either RAW264.7 or THP-1 cell-derived macrophages. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit activates TLR4 signaling to induce pro-inflammatory responses in murine and human macrophages. Therefore, TLR4 signaling in macrophages may be a potential target for regulating excessive inflammation in COVID-19 patients.","Shirato, Ken; Kizaki, Takako",Heliyon,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2405844021002929; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06187; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644468/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405844021002929,319
630980,"Impfen, Kontakte beschränken und monoklonale Antikörper",2021-05-17,"It is widely accepted in clinical practice that chronological age is a poor predictor of treatment tolerance and outcomes in older adults with cancer. Intrinsic vulnerability is more a function of underlying frailty, rather than chronological age. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to stressors, such as cancer and its treatment, which can lead to adverse health outcomes for patients. Capturing this heterogeneity in reserve capacity is the cornerstone of management in geriatricmedicine, but remains poorly understood or adopted in radiation oncology. A two-step approach, using a shorter screening tool, followed by full assessment for those who need it, is the mostresourceful way of implementing frailty assessment in radiotherapy departments. It is important for radiation oncology professionals to identify frailty and to use this information in multidisciplinary decision making in order to develop a personalised radiotherapy approach for the older person. There are many ways we can effectively use this information, such as considering treatment fractionation schedules that would limit the burden of travel for those with social frailty, or reviewing the range of modalities at our disposal, which might limit toxicity in the older person at high risk of deterioration during treatment. Frailty assessment is not carried out in many radiotherapy departments presently, but there are many international models to use as exemplars as to how it may be implemented in clinical practice.

Parmi les patients, 77,9 % ont été hospitalisés, 32,4 % ont reçu des antipaludéens de synthèse (APS), 3 % ont développé des complications thromboemboliques, 15,4 % ont été admis en réanimation et 22,1 % sont décédés. Les caractéristiques des patients ayant développé une forme grave étaient : l’âge plus élevé, l’existence de pathologies chroniques cardiovasculaires ou respiratoires, la présence initiale de signes respiratoires dont l’oxygénorequérance et un taux faible de vitamine D plasmatique. Les facteurs associés au risque de décès étaient : l’âge>70 ans, l’existence d’une pathologie respiratoire au préalable ou d’une artériopathie et les patients n’ayant pas reçu d’APS. Conclusion Notre cohorte confirme l’excès de mortalité dans la population dialysée chronique et des facteurs de risque déjà identifiés (maladie respiratoire, maladie cardiovasculaire).

However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. OBJECTIVES: The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. STUDY DESIGN: Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children’s hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. RESULTS: Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. CONCLUSIONS: Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.","Morikawa, Saeko; Kohdera, Urara; Hosaka, Taisuke; Ishii, Kousuke; Akagawa, Shohei; Hiroi, Satoshi; Kase, Tetsuo",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215006848; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26521224/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215006848,319

Despite negative imaging, we initiated treatment for presumptive VITT given the striking clinical picture that included the timing of his recent adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine, leg symptoms, marked thrombocytopenia, and consumptive coagulopathy. He received intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), prednisone, and argatroban and was discharged seven days later much improved. His positive Platelet Factor 4 (PF4) ELISA antibody test returned after treatment was initiated. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of VITT following Ad26.COV2.S vaccination presenting without radiographically-demonstrable thrombosis.

635554,Infectious Disease Threats in the Twenty-First Century: Strengthening the Global Response,2019-03-28,"BACKGROUND: High flow oxygen therapy (HFO) is a widely used intervention for pulmonary complications. Amid the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, HFO became a popular alternative to conventional oxygen supplementation therapies. Risk stratification tools have been repurposed –and new ones developed– to estimate outcome risks among COVID-19 patients. This study aims to provide a simple risk stratification system to predict invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death among COVID-19 inpatients on HFO. METHODS: Among 529 adult inpatients with COVID-19 pneumonia, we selected unadjusted clinical risk factors for developing the composite endpoint of IMV or death. The risk for the primary outcome by each category was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. Bootstrapping was used to validate the results. RESULTS: Age above 62, eGFR under 60 ml/min, room air SpO2 ≤89 % upon admission, history of hypertension, history of diabetes, and any comorbidity (cancer, cardiovascular disease, COPD/ asthma, hypothyroidism, or autoimmune disease) were considered for the score. Each of the six criteria scored 1 point. The score was further simplified into 4 categories: 1) 0 criteria, 2) 1 criterion, 3) 2-3 criteria, and 4) ≥4 criteria. Taking the first category as the reference, risk estimates for the primary endpoint were HR; 2.94 [1.67 – 5.26], 4.08 [2.63 – 7.05], and 6.63 [3.74 – 11.77], respectively. In ROC analysis, the AUC for the model was 0.72. CONCLUSIONS: Our score uses simple criteria to estimate the risk for IMV or death among COVID-19 inpatients with HFO. Higher category reflects consistent increases in risk for the endpoint.","Aguirre-García, Gloria Mayela; Ramonfaur, Diego; Torre-Amione, Guillermo; Ramírez-Elizondo, María Teresa; Lara-Medrano, Reynaldo; Moreno-Hoyos, Juan Francisco; Velázquez-Ávila, Edna Sophia; Diaz-Garza, Carlos Andres; Sanchez-Nava, Victor M.; Castilleja-Leal, Fernando; Rhoades, Gerald M.; Martínez-Reséndez, Michel Fernando",Pulmonology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2531043721001963?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2531043721001963,319

640016,RLadyBug—An R package for stochastic epidemic models,2007-10-15,"Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are used to test patients and key workers for infection with the causative SARS-CoV-2 virus. RT-PCR tests are highly specific and the probability of false positives is low, but false negatives can occur if the sample contains insufficient quantities of the virus to be successfully amplified and detected. The amount of virus in a swab is likely to vary between patients, sample location (nasal, throat or sputum) and through time as infection progresses. Here, we analyse publicly available data from patients who received multiple RT-PCR tests and were identified as SARS-CoV-2 positive at least once. We identify that the probability of a positive test decreases with time after symptom onset, with throat samples less likely to yield a positive result relative to nasal samples. Empirically derived distributions of the time between symptom onset and hospitalisation allowed us to comment on the likely false negative rates in cohorts of patients who present for testing at different clinical stages. We further estimate the expected numbers of false negative tests in a group of tested individuals and show how this is affected by the timing of the tests. Finally, we assessed the robustness of these estimates of false negative rates to the probability of false positive tests. This work has implications both for the identification of infected patients and for the discharge of convalescing patients who are potentially still infectious.","Wikramaratna, Paul; Paton, Robert S; Ghafari, Mahan; Lourenco, Jose",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20053355,319

Moreover, HCV has become a role model to study fundamental principles that govern the replication cycle of a positive strand RNA virus. In fact, for most HCV proteins high-resolution X-ray and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance)-based structures have been established and profound insights into their biochemical and biological properties have been gained. One example is p7, a small hydrophobic protein that is dispensable for RNA replication, but crucial for the production and release of infectious HCV particles from infected cells. Owing to its ability to insert into membranes and assemble into homo-oligomeric complexes that function as minimalistic ion channels, HCV p7 is a member of the viroporin family. This review compiles the most recent findings related to the structure and dual pore/ion channel activity of p7 of different HCV genotypes. The alternative conformations and topologies proposed for HCV p7 in its monomeric and oligomeric state are described and discussed in detail. We also summarize the different roles p7 might play in the HCV replication cycle and highlight both the ion channel/pore-like function and the additional roles of p7 unrelated to its channel activity. Finally, we discuss possibilities to utilize viroporin inhibitors for antagonizing p7 ion channel/pore-like activity.","Madan, Vanesa; Bartenschlager, Ralf",Viruses,https://doi.org/10.3390/v7082826; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26258788/,319

Although the virus-induced lung damage and inflammatory cytokine storm are believed to be directly associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) clinical manifestations, the underlying mechanisms of virus-triggered inflammatory responses are currently unknown. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates caspase-8 to trigger cell apoptosis and inflammatory cytokine processing in the lung epithelial cells. The processed inflammatory cytokines are released through the virus-induced necroptosis pathway. Virus-induced apoptosis, necroptosis, and inflammation activation were also observed in the lung sections of SARS-CoV-2-infected HFH4-hACE2 transgenic mouse model, a valid model for studying SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Furthermore, analysis of the postmortem lung sections of fatal COVID-19 patients revealed not only apoptosis and necroptosis but also massive inflammatory cell infiltration, necrotic cell debris, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, typical of immune pathogenesis in the lung. The SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered a dual mode of cell death pathways and caspase-8-dependent inflammatory responses may lead to the lung damage in the COVID-19 patients.

640848,"Of Viruses, Vaccines, and Variability: Qualitative Meaning Matters",2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have indicated that the risk of infectious disease spread is greatest in locations where a population has massive and convenient access to the epicenter of an outbreak. However, the spatiotemporal variations and risk determinants of COVID-19 in typical labor export regions of China remain unclear. Understanding the geographical distribution of the disease and the socio-economic factors affecting its transmission is critical for disease prevention and control. METHODS: A total of 2152 COVID-19 cases were reported from January 21 to February 24, 2020 across the 34 cities in Henan and Anhui. A Bayesian spatiotemporal hierarchy model was used to detect the spatiotemporal variations of the risk posed by COVID-19, and the GeoDetector q statistic was used to evaluate the determinant power of the potential influence factors. RESULTS: The risk posed by COVID-19 showed geographical spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Temporally, there was an outbreak period and control period. Spatially, there were high-risk regions and low-risk regions. The high-risk regions were mainly in the southwest areas adjacent to Hubei and cities that served as economic and traffic hubs, while the low-risk regions were mainly in western Henan and eastern Anhui, far away from the epicenter. The accessibility, local economic conditions, and medical infrastructure of Wuhan in Hubei province all played an important role in the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of COVID-19 transmission. The results indicated that the q statistics of the per capita GDP and the proportion of primary industry GDP were 0.47 and 0.47, respectively. The q statistic of the population flow from Wuhan was 0.33. In particular, the results showed that the q statistics for the interaction effects between population density and urbanization, population flow from Wuhan, per capita GDP, and the number of doctors were all greater than 0.8. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 showed significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the labor export regions of China. The high-risk regions were mainly located in areas adjacent to the epicenter as well as in big cities that served as traffic hubs. Population access to the epicenter, as well as local economic and medical conditions, played an important role in the interactive effects of the disease transmission.

However, this research often fails to consider basic epidemiologic concepts to prevent bias in the design, selection, and analysis of observational data. One suspected marker of risk that has been repeatedly assessed is ABO blood type. Given the ease of measuring this biomarker, it is an appealing target for identifying high-risk individuals. However, this same ease of measurement makes associational research on ABO blood type and COVID prone to a range of common epidemiologic errors. We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing correlations between ABO blood type and COVID incidence, hospitalization, and mortality to determine the quality of evidence these studies provide and whether the overall evidence suggests ABO blood type could provide a useful indicator of COVID risk. We conclude that most existing studies are low quality and suffer from major methodological flaws. The few higher-quality studies which do exist find no association between ABO blood type and COVID outcomes.

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the molecular characteristics of influenza B viruses circulating in a region of Northern Italy, Lombardia, during the influenza season of 2015–2016. METHODS: Influenza B virus was detected using a respiratory virus panel of assays and an influenza B-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction. The complete influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) gene was amplified and sequenced directly from clinical specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using nucleotide sequences. RESULTS: A total of 71 hospitalized pediatric patients were influenza B positive. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the great majority of influenza B strains (66/71, 93.0%) belonged to the Victoria-lineage and were antigenically like vaccine strain (B/Brisbane/60/2008) included only in the quadrivalent vaccine. In the detected influenza B strains, a series of amino acid changes were observed in the antigenic regions: I117V, V124A, N129D, V146I, N197D, T199A, and A202T. However, only 2 amino acid changes were observed in the HA regions involved in receptor binding or in antibody recognition. CONCLUSIONS: All the influenza B strains identified in this study belonged to the influenza B Victoria lineage not included in the trivalent vaccine commonly used by the general population during the 2015–2016 influenza season in Italy. This indicates that protection against influenza B infection in the vaccinated population was in general very poor during the 2015–2016 influenza season.","Piralla, Antonio; Lunghi, Giovanna; Ruggiero, Luca; Girello, Alessia; Bianchini, Sonia; Rovida, Francesca; Caimmi, Silvia; Marseglia, Gian Luigi; Principi, Nicola; Baldanti, Fausto; Esposito, Susanna",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29049310/,319

The vector‐based approach is a sampling method that has the ability to survey both arboviruses and non‐arboviruses by distinguishing engorged vector specimens from entire vector samples. Accordingly, five arboviruses and three non‐arboviruses were detected in a study using a vector‐based approach conducted during 2012–2015.

METHODS: The online survey targeting adults was distributed in April 2020 and collected information on dietary behaviors, physical activity, and mental health. All questions were presented as “before” and “since” the COVID‐19 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 7,753 participants were included. The sample included 32.2% of individuals with normal weight, 32.1% overweight, and 34.0% had obesity. During the pandemic, overall scores for healthy eating increased (p<0.001), due to less eating out and increased cooking (p<0.001). Sedentary leisure behaviors increased while time spent in physical activity (absolute time and intensity‐adjusted) declined (p<0.001). Anxiety scores increased 8.78±0.21 during the pandemic and the magnitude of increase was significantly greater in people with obesity (p≤0.01).

648937,Afrika im Sog des Coronavirus,2020-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Health workers are crucial to the successful implementation of infection prevention and control strategies to limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at healthcare facilities. The aim of our study was to determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control knowledge and attitudes of frontline health workers in four provinces of South Africa as well as explore some elements of health worker and health facility infection prevention and control practices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was utilised. The study population comprised both clinical and non-clinical staff working in casualty departments, outpatient departments, and entrance points of health facilities. A structured self-administered questionnaire was developed using the World Health Organization guidance as the basis for the knowledge questions. COVID-19 protocols were observed during data collection. RESULTS: A total of 286 health workers from 47 health facilities at different levels of care participated in the survey. The mean score on the 10 knowledge items was 6.3 (SD = 1.6). Approximately two-thirds of participants (67.4%) answered six or more questions correctly while less than a quarter of all participants (24.1%) managed to score eight or more. A knowledge score of 8 or more was significantly associated with occupational category (being either a medical doctor or nurse), age (< 40 years) and level of hospital (tertiary level). Only half of participants (50.7%) felt adequately prepared to deal with patients with COVD-19 at the time of the survey. The health workers displaying attitudes that would put themselves or others at risk were in the minority. Only 55.6% of participants had received infection prevention and control training. Some participants indicated they did not have access to medical masks (11.8%) and gloves (9.9%) in their departments. CONCLUSIONS: The attitudes of participants reflected a willingness to engage in appropriate SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention and control practices as well as a commitment to be involved in COVID-19 patient care. Ensuring adequate infection prevention and control training for all staff and universal access to appropriate PPE were identified as key areas that needed to be addressed. Interim and final reports which identified key shortcomings that needed to be addressed were provided to the relevant provincial departments of health.","Moodley, Saiendhra Vasudevan; Zungu, Muzimkhulu; Malotle, Molebogeng; Voyi, Kuku; Claassen, Nico; Ramodike, Jonathan; Thunzi, Nkululeko; Mlangeni, Nosimilo",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-05812-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33526033/,319

They thus become APCs themselves. We investigate the functional outcome of T-T cell antigen presentation by CD4 T cells and find that the antigen-presenting T cells (Tpres) predominantly differentiate into regulatory T cells (Treg), whereas T cells that have been stimulated by Tpres cells predominantly differentiate into Th17 pro-inflammatory cells. Using mice deficient in pMHC uptake by T cells, we show that T-T antigen presentation is important for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalitis and Th17 cell differentiation in vivo. By varying the professional APC:T cell ratio, we can modulate Treg versus Th17 differentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that T-T antigen presentation underlies proinflammatory responses in conditions of antigen scarcity.","Boccasavia, Viola L.; Bovolenta, Elena R.; Villanueva, Ana; Borroto, Aldo; Oeste, Clara L.; van Santen, Hisse M.; Prieto, Cristina; Alonso-López, Diego; Diaz-Muñoz, Manuel D.; Batista, Facundo D.; Alarcón, Balbino",Cell Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730591/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108861,319

In this retrospective study, we assessed the clinical effects of HCQ/AZI, with a 28-days follow-up. METHODS: In a registry-study which included patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 15 and April 2, 2020, we compared patients who received HCQ/AZI to those who did not, regarding a composite outcome of mortality and mechanical ventilation with a 28-days follow-up. QT was monitored for patients treated with HCQ/AZI. Were excluded patients in intensive care units, palliative care and ventilated within 24 hours of admission. Three analyses were performed to adjust for selection bias: propensity score matching, multivariable survival, and inverse probability score weighting (IPSW) analyses. RESULTS: Overall, 203 patients were included: 60 patients treated by HCQ/AZI and 143 control patients. During the 28-days follow-up, 32 (16.3%) patients presented the primary outcome and 23 (12.3%) patients died. Propensity-score matching identified 52 unique pairs of patients with similar characteristics. In the matched cohort (n = 104), HCQ/AZI was not associated with the primary composite outcome (log-rank p-value = 0.16). In the overall cohort (n = 203), survival and IPSW analyses also found no benefit from HCQ/AZI. In the HCQ/AZI group, 11 (18.3%) patients prolonged QT interval duration, requiring treatment cessation. CONCLUSIONS: HCQ/AZI combination therapy was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality and mechanical ventilation rate, with a 28-days follow-up. In the HCQ/AZI group, 18.3% of patients presented a prolonged QT interval requiring treatment cessation, however, control group was not monitored for this adverse event, making comparison impossible.","Saib, Anis; Amara, Walid; Wang, Pascal; Cattan, Simon; Dellal, Azeddine; Regaieg, Kais; Nahon, Stephane; Nallet, Olivier; Nguyen, Lee S.",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0252388; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34106964/,319

A Survey Within the Max Planck Society,2021-01-22,"The recent emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has posed formidable challenges for clinical laboratories seeking reliable laboratory diagnostic confirmation. The swift advance of the crisis in the United States has led to Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) facilitating the availability of molecular diagnostic assays without the more rigorous examination to which tests are normally subjected prior to FDA approval. Our laboratory currently uses two real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) platforms, the Roche Cobas SARS-CoV2 and the Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2. The two platforms demonstrate comparable performances; however, the run times for each assay are 3.5 h and 45 min, respectively. In search for a platform with a shorter turnaround time, we sought to evaluate the recently released Abbott ID Now COVID-19 assay, which is capable of producing positive results in as little as 5 min. We present here the results of comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media and comparisons between Abbott ID Now COVID-19 and Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 using nasopharyngeal swabs transported in viral transport media for Cepheid and dry nasal swabs for Abbott ID Now.

The findings help to identify people who have difficulty accessing healthcare services during a pandemic situation. DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional study using a proportionate quota sampling method according to five major districts, sex and age, using an online survey. We analysed the key characteristics of influencing factors of unmet healthcare needs based on the Andersen behavioural model of healthcare utilisation: predisposing factors (eg, sex, age), need factors (eg, health status, illness) and enabling factors (eg, income, efficacy belief). SETTING: The questionnaire was sent via email and mobile text messages from the end of April to the beginning of May 2020 during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 813 respondents was used, and the respondent information was anonymised in the analysis process. RESULTS: For the predisposing factors, sex, age, education level and occupational cluster were associated with unmet needs for healthcare. Chronic diseases and mental health were the influencing factors as an enabling factor that exerted an influence on the unmet need for healthcare in South Korea. Women, younger persons, those with lower education and persons with white-collar jobs were more likely to experience unmet healthcare needs. In addition, the more chronic diseases people had, the more COVID-19 negatively affected them mentally; and the more people felt fear of COVID-19, the higher chances they experienced unmet healthcare needs. CONCLUSION: Government and policymakers are guided to draw out measures such as health communication and telemedicine to reduce the unmet healthcare needs during the pandemic and to recognise the different influencing factors.","Kim, Jungah; You, Myoungsoon; Shon, Changwoo",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34446482/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045845,319

Traditional video- and presentation-based road safety training has average output results as it lacks physical practice and the involvement of children during training, without any practical testing examination to check the learned abilities of a child before their exposure to real-world environments. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a 3D realistic open-ended VR and Kinect sensor-based training setup using the Unity game engine, wherein children are educated and involved in road safety exercises. The proposed system applies the concepts of VR in a game-like setting to let the children learn about traffic rules and practice them in their homes without any risk of being exposed to the outside environment. Thus, with our interactive and immersive training environment, we aim to minimize road accidents involving children and contribute to the generic domain of healthcare. Furthermore, the proposed framework evaluates the overall performance of the students in a virtual environment (VE) to develop their road-awareness skills. To ensure safety, the proposed system has an extra examination layer for children’s abilities evaluation, whereby a child is considered fit for real-world practice in cases where they fulfil certain criteria by achieving set scores. To show the robustness and stability of the proposed system, we conduct four types of subjective activities by involving a group of ten students with average grades in their classes. The experimental results show the positive effect of the proposed system in improving the road crossing behavior of the children.","Khan, Noman; Muhammad, Khan; Hussain, Tanveer; Nasir, Mansoor; Munsif, Muhammad; Imran, Ali Shariq; Sajjad, Muhammad",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21113661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34070237/,319

A modified Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) was used to assess disease activity among 3435 patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA) who participated in a survey designed to assess the effect of their disease and its treatment on the susceptibility and severity of Covid-19. Chi square testing was used to compare BASDAI scores between HLA-B27 positive and negative subjects. 2836 survey respondents were HLA B27 positive. The average BASDAI for the HLA-B27 negative cohort was 4.92 compared to 4.34 for the HLA-B27 positive subjects. Based on linear regression, a subject’s sex could not fully account for the differing BASDAI score in HLA-B27 negative subjects compared to those who are HLA-B27 positive. The difference between B27 positive and negative subjects was skewed by those with a BASDAI score of one or two. HLA-B27 positive subjects were more than twice as likely to have a BASDAI score of 1 compared to HLA B27 negative subjects and about 60% more likely to have a BASDAI score of 2 (p < 0.0001). HLA-B27 positive subjects have less active spondyloarthritis compared to HLA-B27 negative subjects as measured by a BASDAI score. Our data indicate that patients with mild back pain and a diagnosis of AxSpA are disproportionately HLA-B27 positive. The HLA-B27 test facilitates the diagnosis of axial spondyloarthritis such that patients from a community survey with mild back pain may be disproportionately diagnosed as having AxSpA if they are HLA-B27 positive. The test result likely introduces a cognitive bias into medical decision making and could explain our observations.","Rosenbaum, James T.; Weisman, Michael H.; Hamilton, Hedley; Shafer, Cassie; Aslanyan, Elin; Howard, Richard A.; Ogle, Kimberly; Reveille, John D.; Winthrop, Kevin L.; Choi, Dongseok",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-91829-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34112886/,319

Methods Patients admitted to a large academic hospital in Ontario, Canada from March-June 2020 with COVID-19 and who had an echocardiogram within 4-weeks of their diagnosis were included in this study. Their demographics, hospitalization details and echocardiographic findings were analyzed. Results 76 patients are included in our study, 83% of whom required ICU. Mean age was 58.9 years (+/-15.7 years). Cardiovascular comorbidities were common: diabetes (35.5%), hypertension (50%), CKD (11.8%), prior CAD (13.2%) or stroke (11.8%). Median length of admission was 25.5 days (IQR 22days). Overall, in-hospital mortality was high at 35.5%, with increased mortality in the ICU vs. non-ICU group (32.9% vs. 15.4%). A large number of patients required invasive support: intubation (77.6%), Extracorporeal life support (23.7%), or renal replacement therapy (19.7%). Cardiac complications included new AF (13.2%), hemodynamically significant VT (3.9%), moderate or more pericardial effusion (2.6%) and acute stroke (9.2%). Echocardiographic analysis demonstrated that 7.9% of patients developed moderate or more LV dysfunction on visual assessment. RV dysfunction was more common (27.6%) with 11.8% being visually classified as moderate or greater in severity. High sensitivity troponin was elevated in 59.2% of patients and was statistically higher in patients experiencing cardiac complications (Chi-Square 0.005). Although not achieving significance, there was a trend towards elevated troponin and development of moderate or greater LV/RV dysfunction (Chi-square 0.30). Conclusion In acute patients hospitalized with COVID-19, there was a high prevalence of cardiovascular co-morbidities. Troponin elevations was common and associated with a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular events and a trend towards moderate or greater ventricular dysfunction.","Rahman, T.; Woo, A.; Doufle, G.; Thavendiranathan, D.",The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1053249821007117; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053249821007117,319

In Colombia the first case was reported on March 6th of 2020. The disease has unfavorable outcomes and mortality in patients with high risk factors like solid-organ transplant recipients. In Colombia the data of the behavior disease in liver transplant patients are limited. Objectives To describe the prevalence, need of admission to hospital, complications and mortality of COVID-19 in liver transplant recipients. Methods A descriptive study of case series was performed from March 1st of 2020 to January 31st of 2021 in liver transplant recipients at Fundación Cardioinfantil-IC in Bogotá, Colombia. An analysis of clinical variables, severity laboratories, imaging and clinical follow-up were performed. Qualitative variables were described in percentage and quantitative variables were applied to a normality test using Kolmogorov Smirnov and Shapiro Wilk and the results were expressed as medians and IRQ or means and SD. Results Out of 540 adults liver transplant recipients on Fundación Cardioinfantil-IC, 34 patients (6.2%) were diagnosed with Covid 19, median age 62 years (IQR: 26), 20 (58%) male, 13 (38.2%) were admitted to hospitalization, and 4 (11.7%) required ICU. More frequent symptoms were fever in 17/34 patients (50%), cough in 17/34 (50%) and dyspnea 10/34 (29.4%). Ten patients (29.4%) had pneumonia as radiographic findings. Four patients required mechanical ventilation. Complications like acute renal injury were found in 3 patients, 1 patient required renal replacement therapy and 1 patient had gastrointestinal bleeding. 3 patients died (8.8%) on average 14 days of hospital length in ICU. Conclusion Although the group of liver transplant patients is considered to be at high risk for unfavorable outcomes in SARS COV2 infection, the data on mortality and complications were similar to the few data described in the literature.","Gutiérrez, Margarita; Pérez, Leonardo; Beltrán, Oscar; Garzón, Martín; Amaya, Alejandra; Salinas, Carolina; Hernández, Geovanny; Torres, Cristina; Rivera, Jairo; Murcia, Andrés; Mejía, Gilberto; Varón, Adriana",Annals of Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aohep.2021.100468; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1665268121001678; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1665268121001678,319

While most primary physicians’ offices were closed, hospitals prepared for a pandemic surge and emergency departments (EDs) stayed open to provide care for urgent needs. We sought to determine whether ED paediatric presentations prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic changed and review acuity compared with seasonal adjusted prior year. METHODS: We analysed records from 18 EDs in British Columbia, Canada, serving 60% of the population. We included children 0–16 years old and excluded those with no recorded acuity or discharge disposition and those left without being seen by a physician. We compared prepandemic (before the first COVID-19 case), early pandemic (after first COVID-19 case) and peak pandemic (during public health emergency) periods as well as a similar time from the previous year. RESULTS: A reduction of 57% and 70% in overall visits was recorded in the children’s hospital ED and the general hospitals EDs, respectively. Average daily visits declined significantly during the peak-pandemic period (167.44±40.72) compared with prepandemic period (543.53±58.8). Admission rates increased mainly due to the decrease in the rate of visits with lower acuity. Children with complaints of ‘fever’ and ‘gastrointestinal’ symptoms had both the largest overall volume and per cent reduction in visits between peak-pandemic and prior year (79% and 74%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Paediatric emergency medicine attendances were reduced to one-third of normal numbers during the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in British Columbia, Canada, with the reduction mainly seen in minor illnesses that do not usually require admission.","Goldman, Ran D; Grafstein, Eric; Barclay, Neil; Irvine, Michael A; Portales-Casamar, Elodie",Emerg Med J,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-210273; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33127743/,319

Awareness campaigns are highly influential tools to expand healthy behavior practices among individuals during epidemics and pandemics. Mathematical modeling has become an important tool in analyzing the effects of media awareness on the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, a fractional-order epidemic model incorporating media coverage is presented and analyzed. The problem is formulated using susceptible, infectious and recovered compartmental model. A long-term memory effect modeled by a Caputo fractional derivative is included in each compartment to describe the evolution related to the individuals’ experiences. The well-posedness of the model is investigated in terms of global existence, positivity, and boundedness of solutions. Moreover, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium points are given alongside their local stabilities. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, the global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria is proven according to the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] . Finally, numerical simulations are performed to support our analytical findings. It was found out that the long-term memory has no effect on the stability of the equilibrium points. However, for increased values of the fractional derivative order parameter, each solution reaches its equilibrium state more rapidly. Furthermore, it was observed that an increase of the media awareness parameter, decreases the magnitude of infected individuals, and consequently, the height of the epidemic peak.","Akdim, Khadija; Ez-Zetouni, Adil; Zahid, Mehdi",Model Earth Syst Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33851007/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40808-021-01158-9,319

We report systemic and mucosal antibody responses in convalescent individuals who experienced varying severity of disease. Whereas assessment of neutralization and antibody-mediated effector functions revealed polyfunctional antibody responses in serum, only robust neutralization and phagocytosis were apparent in nasal wash samples. Serum neutralization and effector functions correlated with systemic SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG response magnitude, while mucosal neutralization was associated with nasal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA. Antibody depletion experiments support the mechanistic relevance of these correlations. Associations between nasal IgA responses, virus neutralization at the mucosa, and less severe disease suggest the importance of assessing mucosal immunity in larger natural infection cohorts. Further characterization of antibody responses at the portal of entry may define their ability to contribute to protection from infection or reduced risk of hospitalization, informing public health assessment strategies and vaccine development efforts.","Butler, Savannah E.; Crowley, Andrew R.; Natarajan, Harini; Xu, Shiwei; Weiner, Joshua A.; Bobak, Carly A.; Mattox, Daniel E.; Lee, Jiwon; Wieland-Alter, Wendy; Connor, Ruth I.; Wright, Peter F.; Ackerman, Margaret E.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33584712/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.618685,319

Established cancer referral pathways were modified in response to reduced diagnostic availability. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of COVID‐19 on colorectal cancer referral, presentation and stage. METHODS: This was a single centre, retrospective cohort study performed at a tertiary referral centre. Patients diagnosed and managed with colorectal adenocarcinoma between January and December 2020 were compared with patients from 2018 and 2019 in terms of demographics, mode of presentation and pathological cancer staging. RESULTS: In all, 272 patients were diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma during 2020 compared with 282 in 2019 and 257 in 2018. Patients in all years were comparable for age, gender and tumour location (P > 0.05). There was a significant decrease in urgent suspected cancer referrals, diagnostic colonoscopy and radiological imaging performed between March and June 2020 compared with previous years. More patients presented as emergencies (P = 0.03) with increased rates of large bowel obstruction in 2020 compared with 2018–2019 (P = 0.01). The distribution of TNM grade was similar across the 3 years but more T4 cancers were diagnosed in 2020 versus 2018–2019 (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a relatively short‐term impact on the colorectal cancer referral pathway can have significant consequences on patient presentation leading to higher risk emergency presentation and surgery at a more advanced stage. It is therefore critical that efforts are made to make this pathway more robust to minimize the impact of other future adverse events and to consolidate the benefits of earlier diagnosis and treatment.","Shinkwin, Michael; Silva, Louise; Vogel, Irene; Reeves, Nicola; Cornish, Julie; Horwood, James; Davies, Michael M; Torkington, Jared; Ansell, James",Colorectal Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33793063/; https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15662,319

The “cytokine storm,” the most prominent underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of this disease, can theoretically be targeted at several stages. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors constitute a drug class that could ameliorate the inflammatory response and enhance antibody production. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of JAK inhibitors in patients with COVID-19, performing the most updated relevant meta-analysis. We searched two major databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling adult patients with documented COVID-19 in the in-hospital setting, assigned either to JAK inhibitor treatment plus standard of care or standard of care alone. We set as primary efficacy outcome the endpoint of COVID-19 death on day 28 and as secondary efficacy composite outcome that of mechanical ventilation or initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). We finally pooled data of interest from 4 RCTs in a total of 1338 subjects with documented COVID-19 infection, utilizing the following JAK inhibitors: baricitinib, ruxolitinib, tofacitinib, and nezulcitinib. Treatment with JAK inhibitor compared to control resulted in a significant reduction in the risk for COVID-19 death by 43%, while it also led to a significant decrease in the risk for mechanical ventilation or ECMO initiation by 36%. Herein, we demonstrate a clear benefit with JAK inhibitors added to standard of care in patients with COVID-19 in terms of risk reduction concerning major outcomes.

Results Six patients had positive rectal swabs but negative throat swabs, and one patient had positive throat swabs. All the patients continued to be asymptomatic and had unchanged chest computed tomography from previous images. The time from hospital discharge to positive RT-PCR after recovery was 7–11 days. The time from positive to negative rectal swabs was 5-23 days. Conclusion The study might suggest the positive RT-PCR after recovery did not mean disease relapse or virus reinfection.

SGTA consists of three structural domains with individual functions, an N-terminal dimerization domain that assists protein sorting pathways, a central tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain that mediates interactions with heat-shock proteins, proteasomal, and hormonal receptors, and viral proteins, and a C-terminal glutamine rich region that binds hydrophobic substrates. SGTA has been linked to viral lifecycles and hormone receptor signaling, with implications in the pathogenesis of various disease states. Thus far, a range of biophysical techniques have been employed to characterize SGTA structure in some detail, and to investigate its interactions with binding partners in different biological contexts. A complete description of SGTA structure, together with further investigation into its function as a co-chaperone involved quality control, could provide us with useful insights into its role in maintaining cellular proteostasis, and broaden our understanding of mechanisms underlying associated pathologies. This review describes how some structural features of SGTA have been elucidated, and what this has uncovered about its cellular functions. A brief background on the structure and function of SGTA is given, highlighting its importance to biomedicine and related fields. The current level of knowledge and what remains to be understood about the structure and function of SGTA is summarized, discussing the potential direction of future research.","Roberts, Joanna D.; Thapaliya, Arjun; Martínez-Lumbreras, Santiago; Krysztofinska, Ewelina M.; Isaacson, Rivka L.",Front Mol Biosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2015.00071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26734616/,319

Background To collect disease information and provide data for early detection of epidemics, two surveillance systems were established for influenza‐like illness (ILI) and unexplained pneumonia (UP) in Wuxi, People’s Republic of China. Objectives The current study aims to describe the performance of these surveillance systems during 2004–2009 and to evaluate the value of surveillance data in detection of influenza epidemics. Methods Two national ILI sentinel hospitals and three UP sentinel hospitals provided data to the surveillance systems. The surveillance data from hospital‐based outpatient clinics and emergency rooms were compared by year. The ILI data of 2009 were further modeled based on previous data using both a control chart method and a moving average regression method. Alarms of potential epidemics would be raised when the input surveillance data surpassed a threshold. Results In 2009, the proportions of ILI and respiratory illness with fever (one surveillance syndrome of the UP system) to total patient visits (3·40% and 11·76%, respectively) were higher than the previous years. The surveillance data of both systems also showed developing trends similar to the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009. When the surveillance data of 2009 were fitted in the two detection models, alarms were produced on the occurrence of the first local case of influenza A (H1N1), outbreaks in schools and in general populations. Conclusions The results indicated the potential for using ILI and UP surveillance data as syndromic indicators to detect and provide an early warning for influenza epidemics.","Qian, Yan‐Hua; Su, Jing; Shi, Ping; He, En‐Qi; Shao, Jie; Sun, Na; Zu, Rong‐Qiang; Yu, Rong‐Bin",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21668678/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2011.00248.x,319
670764,"Emotions in tourist experiences: Advancing our conceptual, methodological and empirical understanding",2020-05-23,"Scientific advancement is hindered without proper genome annotation because biologists lack a complete understanding of cellular protein functions. In bacterial cells, hypothetical proteins (HPs) are open reading frames with unknown functions. HPs result from either an outdated database or insufficient experimental evidence (i.e., indeterminate annotation). While automated annotation reviews help keep genome annotation up to date, often manual reviews are needed to verify proper annotation. Students can provide the manual review necessary to improve genome annotation. This paper outlines an innovative classroom project that determines if HPs have outdated or indeterminate annotation. The Hypothetical Protein Characterization Project uses multiple well-documented, freely available, web-based, bioinformatics resources that analyze an amino acid sequence to (1) detect sequence similarities to other proteins, (2) identify domains, (3) predict tertiary structure including active site characterization and potential binding ligands, and (4) determine cellular location. Enough evidence can be generated from these analyses to support re-annotation of HPs or prioritize HPs for experimental examinations such as structural determination via X-ray crystallography. Additionally, this paper details several approaches for selecting HPs to characterize using the Hypothetical Protein Characterization Project. These approaches include student- and instructor-directed random selection, selection using differential gene expression from mRNA expression data, and selection based on phylogenetic relations. This paper also provides additional resources to support instructional use of the Hypothetical Protein Characterization Project, such as example assignment instructions with grading rubrics, links to training videos in YouTube, and several step-by-step example projects to demonstrate and interpret the range of achievable results that students might encounter. Educational use of the Hypothetical Protein Characterization Project provides students with an opportunity to learn and apply knowledge of bioinformatic programs to address scientific questions. The project is highly customizable in that HP selection and analysis can be specifically formulated based on the scope and purpose of each student’s investigations. Programs used for HP analysis can be easily adapted to course learning objectives. The project can be used in both online and in-seat instruction for a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate classes as well as undergraduate capstone, honor’s, and experiential learning projects.","Amatore, Zoie; Gunn, Susan; Harris, Laura K.",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.577497; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33365016/,319

A total of 521 participants aged 18–65 years were recruited from 29 regions of mainland China. Situation‐specific coping strategies, including support seeking, personal hygiene practice and social distancing, were measured at Time 1. Benefit finding and well‐being were assessed 1 month later. A multilevel mediation model was conducted with region included in level 2 as cluster ID. Support seeking and personal hygiene practice were positive predictors of benefit finding, which further mediated their relationships with well‐being, while social distancing negatively predicted well‐being. These results highlight the relationships of support seeking, personal hygiene practice and benefit finding with well‐being during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists followed suit with guidance on the curtailment of all elective activity, aimed at protecting both patients and staff. Ophthalmology is one of the busiest outpatient specialities, and risk stratification of patients with appointments cancelled or on review lists was paramount to ensure there was no serious, permanent harm to sight. Our way of working, as we knew it, had to change in a short period of time. Local emergency eye care was changed from a walk in service, with the implementation of a strict triage protocol. Ophthalmologists, as well as Otorhinolaryngology colleagues, were identified as being at high risk of infection, due to the close proximity of clinical examination. The redesign of clinical areas to allow for social distancing, slit lamp barriers and personal protective equipment was all implemented.

To alleviate these problems, healthcare organisations have been providing support for their staff, including organisational, cognitive behavioural and physical and mental relaxation interventions. This paper reports the findings of a study commissioned by a Scottish NHS health board area during the initial outbreak of COVID-19. The study aimed to understand the experience of NHS staff relating to the provision of wellbeing interventions between March and August 2020. METHODS: Data were gathered from free-text comments of eight surveys completed by a wide range of staff across sites within one NHS health board in Scotland. We conducted a framework analysis of the data. RESULTS: Our findings show that despite the provision of relaxational and cognitive behavioural interventions to support staff wellbeing during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were barriers to access, including heavy workload, understaffing, inconvenient locations and the stigma of being judged. Organisational factors were the most frequently reported support need amongst frontline staff across sites. CONCLUSIONS: While relaxational and cognitive behavioural interventions were well received by staff, barriers to accessing them still existed. Staff support in the context of organisational factors, such as engagement with managers was deemed as the most important for staff wellbeing. Managers play a key role in everyday organisational processes and therefore are in the right position to meet increasing frontline staff demands due to the pandemic and removing barriers to accessing wellbeing support. Healthcare managers should be aware of organisational factors that might increase job demands and protect organisational resources that can promote wellbeing for frontline staff.","Clarissa, Catherine; Quinn, Sam; Stenhouse, Rosie",BMC Health Serv Res,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07103-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34645439/,319

Curative-intent multimodality treatment should be considered in all patients with stage III NSCLC. For patients with unresectable disease who are fit, have adequate lung function, and have a disease that can be encompassed within a radical radiation volume, concurrent chemoradiation therapy (cCRT) is the standard of care and can produce cure rates of 20–30%. Recently, consolidation immunotherapy with durvalumab has been recognized as the standard of care following cCRT based on significant improvement rates in overall survival at 4 years. The large heterogeneity of the stage III NSCLC population, along with the need for extensive staging procedures, multidisciplinary care, intensive cCRT, and now consolidation therapy makes the delivery of timely and optimal treatment for these patients complex.

The PEDV is one of the major concerns of the pig industry around the world, including Asian countries and Noth America since first identified in Europe. Currently, there is no PEDV licensed vaccine to effectively prevent this disease. This study was performed for the development of a mucosal PEDV vaccine and B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) as a carrier was employed to surpass the tolerogenic nature of GALT and induce potent immune responses against the target antigen fused to CTB. An epitope (S1D) alone or conjugated with CTB was constructed into the tobacco chloroplasts expression vector which is controlled under the chloroplast rRNA operon promoter with T7g10 5′ UTR and the psbA 3′UTR as a terminator. The homoplastomic lines were obtained by third round screening via organogenesis from the leaf tissues which were verified by PCR with antigen and chloroplast specific primers and then confirmed by Southern blot analysis. While the expression level of the S1D alone as detected by Western blotting was approximately 0.07% of total soluble protein, the CTB-S1D fusion protein was expressed up to 1.4%. The fusion protein showed binding to the intestinal membrane GM1-ganglioside receptor, demonstrating its functionality. The result shows that the highest expression of S1D could be achieved by fusion with a stable CTB protein and chloroplast transformation. Furthermore, the CTB-S1D expressed in chloroplasts of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Maryland could be assembled to pentameric form which increases the possibility to develop a mucosal vaccine against PEDV.","Tien, Nguyen-Quang-Duc; Huy, Nguyen-Xuan; Kim, Mi-Young",Plant Cell Tissue Organ Cult,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11240-019-01562-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32214566/,319

We aimed to determine the impact of SARS-CoV2 on the monthly incidence rates and type of pacemaker (PM) and implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantations in Catalonia before and after the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain on 14 March 2020. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data on new CIED implantations for 2017–20 were prospectively collected by nine hospitals in Catalonia. A mixed model with random intercepts corrected for time was used to estimate the change in monthly CIED implantations. Compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, an absolute decrease of 56.5% was observed (54.7% in PM and 63.7% in ICD) in CIED implantation rates. Total CIED implantations for 2017–19 and January and February 2020 was 250/month (>195 PM and >55 ICD), decreasing to 207 (161 PM and 46 ICD) in March and 131 (108 PM and 23 ICD) in April 2020. In April 2020, there was a significant fall of 185.25 CIED implantations compared to 2018 [95% confidence interval (CI) 129.6–240.9; P < 0.001] and of 188 CIED compared to 2019 (95% CI 132.3–243.7; P < 0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial decrease in CIED implantations was observed in Catalonia. Our findings call for measures to avoid long-term social impact.","Arbelo, Elena; Angera, Ignasi; Trucco, Emilce; Rivas-Gándara, Nuria; Guerra, José M; Bisbal, Felipe; Jáuregui-Abularach, Miguel; Vallés, Ermengol; Martin, Gabriel; Sbraga, Fabrizio; Tolosana, José María; Linhart, Markus; Francisco-Pascual, Jaume; Montiel-Serrano, José; Pereferrer, Damià; Menéndez-Ramírez, Diego; Jiménez, Jesús; Elamrani, Amin; Borrás, Roger; Dallaglio, Paolo Domenico; Benito, Eva; Santos-Ortega, Alba; Rodríguez-Font, Enrique; Sarrias, Axel; González-Matos, Carlos E; Martí-Almor, Julio; Cabrera, Sandra; Mont, Lluis",Europace,https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euab011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595062/,319

It shows how the experience of parental care leads to the discovery of new ways of human interaction and expressions of personhood. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Framed within literary-cultural age studies, the article shows how humanities-based inquiry can illuminate important aspects of aging and care of the oldest old, which are significant and revealing, but often hidden under the dark shadow of dementia. RESULTS: Newly discovered ways of communication challenge the notion of the loss of agency as they demonstrate that the body itself has the power of creative and intentional capacities and self-expression. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Care-related narratives offer new insights into aging, dementia and subjectivity that can help pursue a better analysis of the ‘deep’ old age, strengthen collective solidary and manage increasing ageism, especially pronounced during the Covid-19 pandemic.","Stončikaitė, Ieva",Gerontologist,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003885/; https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gnab066,319

With no widely acceptable pharmaceutical cure, the best form of prevention may be precautionary measures which will guide against infections and curb the spread of the disease. This study explored the relationship between COVID-19 knowledge, risk perception, and precautionary behavior among Nigerians. The study also sought to determine whether this relationship differed for men and women. A web-based cross-sectional design approach was used to recruit 1,554 participants (mean age = 27.43, SD = 9.75; 42.7% females) from all geopolitical zones in Nigeria, through social media platforms using a snowball sampling technique. Participants responded to web-based survey forms comprising demographic questions and adapted versions of the Ebola knowledge scale, SARS risk perception scale, and precautionary behavior scale. Moderated mediation analysis of the data showed that risk perception mediated the association between COVID-19 knowledge and precautionary behavior and this indirect effect was in turn moderated by gender. Results indicate that having adequate knowledge of COVID-19 was linked to higher involvement in precautionary behavior through risk perception for females but not for males. It was also noted that awareness campaigns and psychological intervention strategies on COVID-19 related activities may be particularly important for males more than females. Drawing from the health belief model, we recommend that COVID-19 awareness campaigns should target raising more awareness of the risks associated with the infection to make individuals engage more in precautionary behaviors.","Iorfa, Steven K.; Ottu, Iboro F.

Objective: To examine the influence of these measures on the longitudinal development of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and body mass index (BMI) of primary school children. Design: Cohort study with baseline measurements in September 2019, before the COVID-19 mitigation measures and follow-ups in June and September 2020. Setting: Twelve randomly selected primary schools in urban and rural districts of Klagenfurt, Austria. Participants: Legal guardians of 860 children provided written consent. A total of 764 children (88.8%) aged 7-10 years completed all measurements and were included for analyses. Exposure: COVID-19 mitigation measures. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study was planned as a randomized controlled trial, but analyzed as a longitudinal study due to stopped intervention because of COVID-19 mitigation regulations. CRF was measured with a 6-min run test. Height and weight were objectively measured. Age- and gender-specific national and international standard deviation scores (SDS) were calculated for CRF and BMI. Changes over time were analysed using ANOVAs. Secondary analyses were performed for subgroups divided by gender and sports club membership. Results: From September 2019 to September 2020, CRF SDS decreased by -1.06 (95% CI, -1.13 to -1.00), with a similar rate of decrease in both boys and girls. In June 2020, BMI SDS had increased by 0.12 (95% CI, 0.06-0.16), and in September 2020 by 0.16 (95% CI, 0.12-0.20), compared to September 2019. The rate of increase in BMI SDS was higher in boys (0.23 [95% CI, 0.18-0.29]) than in girls (0.09 [95% CI, 0.04-0.15]). Over the 1-year period, the proportion of children with overweight or obesity increased from 20.3% to 24.1% (+3.8%, P < .001), according to International Obesity Taskforce thresholds. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 mitigation measures have negative indirect consequences of on relevant health parameters of children. Since these mitigation measures continued after our last assessments, consequences will have increased. Collaborative efforts are required to negate and reverse these effects on children's health, to prevent long-term negative health consequences.","Jarnig, G.; Jaunig, J.; Van Poppel, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.09.21255185v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.09.21255185,319

Since vaccination is voluntary, it is necessary to deal with the fact that some health care team members refuse to receive it. Here I put forward different bioethical arguments: Kantian deontology and the principles of universalizability, humanity, and autonomy; Mill's utilitarianism, with selfprotection as the sole end for which humankind is authorized to interfere with its members' freedom of action; Beauchamp and Childress' principlism and the concepts of beneficence and autonomy; Varo Baena's principle of opportunity; and the principle of solidarity resulting from the ethics of human rights. The contributions of contemporary philosophers like Roberto Espósito, Jean-Luc Nancy, and Alberto Giubilini are also included. Two counterarguments are presented: nonmaleficence and counter-production.

686292,Biogas production from anaerobic co-digestion using kitchen waste and poultry manure as substrate—part 1: substrate ratio and effect of temperature,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Many studies investigate the role of pharmacological treatments on disease course in Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sex disparities in genetics, immunological responses, and hormonal mechanisms may underlie the substantially higher fatality rates reported in male COVID-19 patients. To optimise care for COVID-19 patients, prophylactic and therapeutic studies should include sex-specific design and analyses. Therefore, in this scoping review, we investigated whether studies on pharmacological treatment in COVID-19 were performed based on a priori sex-specific design or post-hoc sex-specific analyses. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, UpToDate, clinical trial.org, and MedRxiv for studies on pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 until June 6th, 2020. We included case series, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies in humans (≥18 years) investigating antiviral, antimalarial, and immune system modulating drugs. Data were collected on 1) the proportion of included females, 2) whether sex stratification was performed (a priori by design or post-hoc), and 3) whether effect modification by sex was investigated. FINDINGS: 30 studies were eligible for inclusion, investigating remdesivir (n = 2), lopinavir/ritonavir (n = 5), favipiravir (n = 1), umifenovir (n = 1), hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine (n = 8), convalescent plasma (n = 6), interleukin-6 (IL-6) pathway inhibitors (n = 5), interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway inhibitors (n = 1) and corticosteroids (n = 3). Only one study stratified its data based on sex in a post-hoc analysis, whereas none did a priori by design. None of the studies investigated effect modification by sex. A quarter of the studies included twice as many males as females. INTERPRETATION: Analyses assessing potential interference of sex with (side-)effects of pharmacological therapy for COVID-19 are rarely reported. Considering sex differences in case-fatality rates and genetic, immunological, and hormonal mechanisms, studies should include sex-specific analyses in their design to optimise COVID-19 care.

In this unprecedented situation, the cross approach and interaction between the French pharmacovigilance network and French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines and Health Products (ANSM) has been optimized to provide a real-time safety related to COVID-19 vaccines. Every week, pair of regional pharmacovigilance centers gathered safety data from the French pharmacovigilance network, to acutely expertise all the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported with each COVID-19 vaccine within a direct circuit with ANSM. Results of this expertise are presented and discussed with ANSM in order to raise safety signals and take appropriate measures if necessary. These reports are then published online. At the 25th of March 2021, more than 9 815 000 doses were injected and 20 265 ADRs were reported, mostly non-serious (76%). Several potential or confirmed signals were raised at the european level for those vaccines and others ADRs are under special attentions. This underlines the adaptiveness of the French pharmacovigilance system to both the identification of new patient profiles experiencing ADRs and the evolution of the vaccine strategy. Such an efficiency is necessary to manage a careful and acute surveillance of these new COVID-19 vaccines for and to face the pandemic at the same time.","Lacroix, Clémence; Salvo, Francesco; Gras-Champel, Valérie; Gautier, Sophie; Massy, Nathalie; Valnet-Rabier, Marie-Blanche; Grandvuillemin, Aurélie; Mounier, Céline; Benkebil, Mehdi; Pariente, Antoine; Jonville-Bera, Annie-Pierre; Micallef, Joëlle",Therapie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34059351/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2021.05.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0040595721001268; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040595721001268?v=s5,319

689541,"SARS‐CoV‐2, COVID‐19, skin and immunology ‐ what do we know so far?",2020-07-13,"INTRODUCTION: COVID‐19 has significantly impacted endonasal surgery, and recent experimentation has demonstrated that sinonasal drilling and cautery have significant propensity for airborne particulate generation immediately adjacent to the surgical field. In the present investigation, we assess nasopharyngeal suctioning as a mitigation strategy to decrease particulate spread during simulated endonasal surgical activity. METHODS: Airborne particulate generation in the 1‐10μm range was quantified with an optical particle sizer in real‐time during cadaveric‐simulated anterior and posterior endonasal drilling and cautery conditions. To test suction mitigation, experiments were performed both with and without a rigid suction placed in the contralateral nostril, terminating in the nasopharynx. RESULTS: Both anterior (medial maxillary wall and nasal septum) and posterior (sphenoid rostrum) drilling produced significant particulate generation in the 1‐10μm range throughout the duration of drilling (p<0.001) without the use of suction, while nasopharyngeal suction use eliminated the detection of generated airborne particulate. A similar effect was seen with nasal cautery, with significant particle generation (p<0.001) that was reduced to undetectable levels with the use of nasopharyngeal suction. CONCLUSIONS: The use of nasopharyngeal suctioning via the contralateral nostril minimizes airborne particulate spread during simulated sinonasal drilling and cautery. In the era of COVID‐19, this technique offers an immediately available measure that may increase surgical safety. This article is protected by copyright.
