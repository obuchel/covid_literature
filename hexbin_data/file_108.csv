However, additional surveillance programs are needed. To meet this need, an active surveillance program was conducted at pig farms throughout the midwestern United States. From June 2009 through December 2011, nasal swab samples were collected monthly from among 540 groups of growing pigs and tested for influenza A virus by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Of 16,170 samples, 746 were positive for influenza A virus; of these, 18.0% were subtype H1N1, 16.0% H1N2, 7.6% H3N2, and 14.5% (H1N1)pdm09. An influenza (H3N2) and (H1N1)pdm09 virus were identified simultaneously in 8 groups. This active influenza A virus surveillance program provided quality data and increased the understanding of the current situation of circulating viruses in the midwestern US pig population.","Corzo, Cesar A.; Culhane, Marie; Juleen, Kevin; Stigger-Rosser, Evelyn; Ducatez, Mariette F.; Webby, Richard J.; Lowe, James F.",Emerg Infect Dis,108,3

SciColl offered a novel opportunity for the US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, to explore the value of scientific research collections under the science preparedness initiative and integrate it as a research resource at each stage in the emergence of the infectious diseases cycle. Under the leadership of SciColl’s executive secretariat at the Smithsonian Institution, and with multiple federal and international partners, a workshop during October 2014 fully explored the intersections of the infectious disease cycle and the role scientific collections could play as an evidentiary scientific resource to mitigate risks associated with emerging infectious diseases.","DiEuliis, Diane",Emerg Infect Dis,108,3
2171,2171,2171,CPT-cGMP Is A New Ligand of Epithelial Sodium Channels,12.662856,6.8884997,2016-01-28,"Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are localized at the apical membrane of the epithelium, and are responsible for salt and fluid reabsorption. Renal ENaC takes up salt, thereby controlling salt content in serum. Loss-of-function ENaC mutations lead to low blood pressure due to salt-wasting, while gain-of-function mutations cause impaired sodium excretion and subsequent hypertension as well as hypokalemia. ENaC activity is regulated by intracellular and extracellular signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, protein kinases, and small compounds. Cyclic nucleotides are broadly involved in stimulating protein kinase A and protein kinase G signaling pathways, and, surprisingly, also appear to have a role in regulating ENaC. Increasing evidence suggests that the cGMP analog, CPT-cGMP, activates αβγ-ENaC activity reversibly through an extracellular pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the parachlorophenylthio moiety and ribose 2'-hydroxy group of CPT-cGMP are essential for facilitating the opening of ENaC channels by this compound. Serving as an extracellular ligand, CPT-cGMP eliminates sodium self-inhibition, which is a novel mechanism for stimulating salt reabsorption in parallel to the traditional NO/cGMP/PKG signal pathway. In conclusion, ENaC may be a druggable target for CPT-cGMP, leading to treatments for kidney malfunctions in salt reabsorption.","Ji, Hong-Long; Nie, Hong-Guang; Chang, Yongchang; Lian, Qizhou; Liu, Shan-Lu",Int J Biol Sci,108,1

This systematic investigation of HBV stability and susceptibility to different antiseptics revealed that HBV infectivity was very stable, with a half-life of >22 days at 37°C. At 4°C, infectivity was barely reduced for up to 9 months. Different alcohols and commercially available hand antiseptics had a virucidal effect against HBV.

5223,5223,5223,Neurovirulence of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 isolates in diseases of the central nervous system,13.133881,11.125327,1990,"The genome of Ryegrass mottle virus (RGMoV) comprises 4210 nucleotides. The genomic RNA contains four open reading frames (ORFs). The largest ORF 2 encodes a polyprotein of 947 amino acids (103.6 kDa), which codes for a serine protease and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The viral coat protein is encoded on ORF 4 present at the 3′-proximal region. Other ORFs 1 and 3 encode the predicted 14.6 kDa and 19.8 kDa proteins of unknown function. The consensus signal for frameshifting, heptanucleotide UUUAAAC and a stem-loop structure just downstream is in front of the AUG codon of ORF 3. Analysis of the in vitro translation products of RGMoV RNA suggests that the 68 kDa protein may represent a fusion protein of ORF 2-ORF 3 produced by frameshifting. The protease region of the polyprotein and coat protein have a low similarity with that of the sobemoviruses (approximately 25% amino acid identity), while the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region has particularly strong similarity (54 to 60% of more than 350 amino acid residues). The sequence similarities of RGMoV to the sobemoviruses, together with the characteristic genome organization indicate that RGMoV is a new species of the genus Sobemovirus.","ZHANG, Feiyun; TORIYAMA, Shigemitsu; TAKAHASHI, Mami",J,108,3

METHODS: Clinical data were collected from critical infants with EV71 infection. The infants were grouped into PE, non-PE, and control groups. The control group included infants in the preoperative period of elective inguinal hernia surgery. Biochemical changes in PE fluid were evaluated, and Ang-2 levels in serum and PE fluid were measured. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs) were incubated with serum from the control and PE groups and human recombinant Ang-2 or serum from the PE group and human recombinant Ang-1, and changes in the intercellular junctions were recorded via immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Of the 161 infants with critical EV71 infection admitted to the hospital, 39 had PE. PE fluid was collected from 18 of these infants. The PE fluid-to-serum (P/S) ratio of total protein was 0.9 ± 0.2, and all P/S ratios of albumin were 1.0 ± 0.3. The Ang-2 level was higher in the non-PE group (333.2 ± 79.7 pg/ml) than in the control group (199.9 ± 26.7 pg/ml), although without statistical significance (P = 0.115). The Ang-2 level in the PE group (2819.2 ± 908.7 pg/ml) was higher than those in both the non-PE and the control groups (both, P < 0.001). Serum samples from the PE group had damaged cell junctions of confluent HPMEC monolayers that were reversed by Ang-1. CONCLUSIONS: The PE fluid of infants with EV71-induced PE was protein-rich, and elevated Ang-2 expression was associated with PE. The mechanism through which PE develops may be related to Ang-2-induced cell junction damage.","Qi, Zhijiang; Li, Zhi; Hao, Dong; Wang, Tao; Xia, Yongfu; Sun, Ting; Wang, Juan; Zhuang, Fuju; Wang, Xiaozhi",Indian J Pediatr,108,3

Lower detection rates were observed in HIV-seronegative (15%) and asymptomatic HIV-seropositive (16%) men. In the patients with diarrhea, 95% of the isolates of virus were found in the most immuno suppressed patients, those patients with AIDS-related complex or opportunistic infections associated with AIDS. High excretion rates of these viruses are probably associated with both anal-oral transmission and immunosuppression. These viruses apparently cause acute episodes or relapses of diarrhea in some patients but may be co-pathogens or noncontributory to chronic diarrhea in others.","Cunningham, Anthony L.; Grohman, Gerhard S.; Harkness, John; Law, Carmela; Marriott, Deborah; Tindall, Brett; Cooper, David A.",J Infect Dis,108,3

Parainfluenza infections were not prevented, but symptoms in associated episodes of disease were significantly reduced. The medication was generally well tolerated, but side effects were often observed. The most commonly reported symptom was blood-tinged mucus. A pilot study of IFN-α2b or placebo administered on a once-daily dose schedule was also carried out in 150 participants. There was a suggestion of continued efficacy with reduced side effects. Overall, these findings would limit the use of IFN-α2b on the twice-daily schedule to shorter time periods or to special situations in which the efficacy clearly outweighs side effects, and they encourage further examination of other dosage schedules.","Monto, Arnold S.; Shope, Thomas C.; Schwartz, Stanley A.; Albrecht, Janice K.",J Infect Dis,108,3

OUTCOMES: Outcomes evaluated include need and effectiveness of antibiotics to prevent infections in obstetrical procedures. EVIDENCE: Published literature was retrieved through searches of Medline and The Cochrane Library on the topic of antibiotic prophylaxis in obstetrical procedures. Results were restricted to systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials/controlled clinical trials, and observational studies. Searches were updated on a regular basis and articles published from January 1978 to June 2009 were incorporated in the guideline. Current guidelines published by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology were also incorporated. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified through searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology assessment-related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies. VALUES: The evidence obtained was reviewed and evaluated by the Infectious Diseases Committee of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada under the leadership of the principal authors, and recommendations were made according to guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care (Table 1). BENEFITS, HARMS, AND COSTS: Implementation of this guideline should reduce the cost and harm resulting from the administration of antibiotics when they are not required and the harm resulting from failure to administer antibiotics when they would be beneficial. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: 1. Available evidence does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infectious morbidity following operative vaginal delivery. (II-1); 2. There is insufficient evidence to argue for or against the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infectious morbidity for manual removal of the placenta. (III); 3. There is insufficient evidence to argue for or against the use of prophylactic antibiotics at the time of postpartum dilatation and curettage for retained products of conception. (III); 4. Available evidence does not support the use of prophylactic antibiotics to reduce infectious morbidity following elective or emergency cerclage. (II-3). RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. All women undergoing elective or emergency Caesarean section should receive antibiotic prophylaxis. (I-A); 2. The choice of antibiotic for Caesarean section should be a single dose of a first-generation cephalosporin. If the patient has a penicillin allergy, clindamycin or erythromycin can be used. (I-A); 3. The timing of prophylactic antibiotics for Caesarean section should be 15 to 60 minutes prior to skin incision. No additional doses are recommended. (I-A); 4. If an open abdominal procedure is lengthy (> 3 hours) or estimated blood loss is greater than 1500 mL, an additional dose of the prophylactic antibiotic may be given 3 to 4 hours after the initial dose. (III-L); 5. Prophylactic antibiotics may be considered for the reduction of infectious morbidity associated with repair of third and fourth degree perineal injury. (I-B); 6. In patients with morbid obesity (BMI > 35), doubling the antibiotic dose may be considered. (III-B); 7.

METHODS: The LAMP primer set was designed from E. histolytica hemolysin gene HLY6. Genomic DNA of E. histolytica trophozoites strain HK9 was used to optimize the LAMP mixture and conditions. Amplification of DNA in the LAMP mixture was monitored through visual inspection for turbidity of the LAMP mix as well as addition of fluorescent dye. RESULTS: Positive LAMP reactions turned turbid while negative ones remained clear. Upon addition of a fluorescent dye, all positive reactions turned green while the negative control remained orange under ambient light. After elecrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gels, a ladder of multiple bands of different sizes can be observed in positive samples while no bands were detected in the negative control. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be 5 parasites per reaction which corresponds to approximately 15.8 ng/μ L DNA. The specificity of the assay was verified by the absence of amplified products when DNA from other gastrointestinal parasites such as the morphologically similar but non-pathogenic species, Entamoeba dispar 39, and other diarrhea-causing organisms such as Blastocystis hominis and Escherichia coli were used. CONCLUSIONS: The LAMP assay we have developed enables the detection of E. histolytica with rapidity and ease, therefore rendering it is suitable for laboratory and field diagnosis of amebiasis.","Rivera, Windell L.; Ong, Vanissa A.",Asian Pac J Trop Med,108,3

This study aimed to explore the impact of bacterial colonization on the severity of virus-induced wheezing, and accompanying airway inflammation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 68 hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and 85 children with recurrent wheezing were obtained. Eleven common respiratory viruses were sought by PCR and/or direct fluorescence assay. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Cell numbers and concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the NPAs were measured, and nucleated cells were characterized. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with an initial attack of bronchiolitis. Bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection had no effect on clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization, concentrations of cytokines/chemokines (except interleukin-10 (IL-10)) or cellularity in the children with bronchiolitis; however, among the children with recurrent wheezing, those who had coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization and virus infection presented more frequent cyanosis, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher concentration of IL-10 and a higher percentage of neutrophils in NPAs than those with virus infection but without bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization was common in children with virus-induced wheezing, particularly in the situation of recurrent wheezing. To some extent, bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection may contribute to the severity of the wheezing because of its impact on airway inflammation.","Yu, D.; Wei, L.; Zhengxiu, L.; Jian, L.; Lijia, W.; Wei, L.; Xiqiang, Y.; Xiaodong, Z.; Zhou, F.; Enmei, L.",Clin Microbiol Infect,108,1

Inhaled hydrogen gas diminishes ischemia-reperfusion injury in models of shock, stroke, and cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to investigate the safety of inhaled hydrogen gas at doses required for a clinical efficacy study. DESIGN: Prospective, single-arm study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Eight healthy adult participants. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects underwent hospitalized exposure to 2.4% hydrogen gas in medical air via high-flow nasal cannula (15 L/min) for 24 (n = 2), 48 (n = 2), or 72 (n = 4) hours. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Endpoints included vital signs, patient- and nurse-reported signs and symptoms (stratified according to clinical significance), pulmonary function testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram, mini-mental state examinations, neurologic examination, and serologic testing prior to and following exposure. All adverse events were verified by two clinicians external to the study team and an external Data and Safety Monitoring Board. All eight participants (18–30 yr; 50% female; 62% non-Caucasian) completed the study without early termination. No clinically significant adverse events occurred in any patient. Compared with baseline measures, there were no clinically significant changes over time in vital signs, pulmonary function testing results, Mini-Mental State Examination scores, neurologic examination findings, electrocardiogram measurements, or serologic tests for hematologic (except for clinically insignificant increases in hematocrit and platelet counts), renal, hepatic, pancreatic, or cardiac injury associated with hydrogen gas inhalation. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of 2.4% hydrogen gas does not appear to cause clinically significant adverse effects in healthy adults. Although these data suggest that inhaled hydrogen gas may be well tolerated, future studies need to be powered to further evaluate safety. These data will be foundational to future interventional studies of inhaled hydrogen gas in injury states, including following cardiac arrest.","Cole, Alexis R.; Sperotto, Francesca; DiNardo, James A.; Carlisle, Stephanie; Rivkin, Michael J.; Sleeper, Lynn A.; Kheir, John N.",Crit Care Explor,108,3

The purpose of this study was to identify the mortality risk factors among hospitalized children with severe pertussis. METHODS: This study evaluated the medical records of 144 hospitalized children with severe pertussis at the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Centre between January 2016 and December 2019. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 2 months (IQR 1–4 months), with 90.3% of the patients aged < 6 months and 56.9% of the patients aged < 3 months. A total of 38 patients were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU), 13 patients died, and the mortality of severe pertussis was 34.2%, with patients younger than 6 weeks accounting for 76.9% of the deaths. On the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors for death were WBC > 70.0 × 10(9)/L (odds ratio [OR], 230.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.16–10,319.09 P = 0.005) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) (OR 323.29; 95% CI 16.01–6529.42; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Severe pertussis mainly occurred in children aged < 3 months. The mortality of severe pertussis was 34.2%, with patients younger than 6 weeks accounting for the majority of the deaths. We recommend the first dose of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) should be advanced to the age of 2 months or even 6 weeks.

Baicalein (BAI), a natural antioxidant used in traditional Chinese medicine, eliminates excessive free radicals and protects the structure of the cell membrane. However, its protective mechanism against HIRI is still unclear. The present study investigated underlying mechanism using a mouse HIRI model. Liver injury was evaluated using serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, and hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed to evaluate the pathological changes in liver tissue. Apoptosis of hepatocytes was detected by TUNEL staining. The expression levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver were detected to evaluate oxidative stress. Western blotting was performed to assess expression levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/antioxidant response elements (ARE) pathway proteins in liver tissue. BAI pre-treatment significantly decreased elevation of serum aminotransferase levels induced by IR and alleviated histological damage to the liver. BAI decreased production of ROS and MDA in liver tissue induced by IR and increased the activity of SOD. At the same time, BAI inhibited apoptosis of liver cells induced by oxidative stress. Furthermore, BAI promoted the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and increased the expression of total heme oxygenase-1 and NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone-1. The Nrf2 inhibitor ML385 reversed the protective effect of BAI on HIRI. These results indicated that BAI served a protective effect in HIRI by regulating the Nrf2/ARE pathway.","Zhou, Yi; Tan, Zhi; Huang, Hao; Zeng, Yonglian; Chen, Shilian; Wei, Jie; Huang, Guozhen; Qian, Chaosi; Yuan, Guandou; He, Songqing",Exp Ther Med,108,3

Yet, there is little research investigating the extent to which, and for whom, nature experiences deliver such benefits outside Europe, North America, and Australia. Here, we assessed the relationships between nature dose (frequency, duration, and intensity) and three mental wellbeing (depression, stress, and anxiety) and two physical health (high blood pressure, diabetes) outcomes in Singapore, an intensely urbanised tropical city. Our analyses accounted for individual factors, including socio-economic status, nature connection (nature relatedness), and whether people with poor health are prevented by their condition from visiting green spaces. Our results show that the association between nature dose (specifically duration) and mental wellbeing is moderated by a nature connection. Specifically, people with a stronger nature connection were less likely to be depressed, stressed, and anxious, regardless of the duration of their nature dose.

This study identified the characteristics of individuals who did not receive consultations and the relevant determinants, and proposed the available measures to address this issue. Altogether, 32,699 participants aged 16 years or older and residing in the disaster area at Fukushima were surveyed. Those with no one to consult showed a significantly higher prevalence of psychological distress (16.2%, p < 0.001) and drinking problems (21.5%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that these behaviors were associated with the middle age group (i.e., 40–64 years old) (odds ratio [OR]: 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16–1.46), men (OR = 2.46; 95% CI, 2.27–2.66), bad financial circumstances (OR = 2.11; 95% CI, 1.96–2.27), and living alone (OR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.39–1.68). This research verifies that people with such characteristics were more likely to be isolated and vulnerable to psychiatric problems, such as depression. We suggest that it is integral for local care providers to recognize those who have no one to consult and provide targeted support.","Horikoshi, Naoko; Maeda, Masaharu; Harigane, Mayumi; Iwasa, Hajime; Murakami, Michio; Momoi, Maho; Goto, Saori; Yasumura, Seiji",Int J Environ Res Public Health,108,3

The rate of marijuana use is increasing in young adults in the US. The current environment of legalizing marijuana use is further contributing to an increase of users. The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics of adults who abuse marijuana (20–49 years old) and analyze behavior and social relation variables related to depression and suicide risk using machine-learning algorithms. A total of 698 participants were identified from the 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health survey as marijuana dependent in the previous year. Principal Component Analysis and Chi-square were used to select features (variables) and mean imputation method was applied for missing data. Logistic regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbor machine-learning algorithms were used to build depression and suicide risk prediction models. The results showed unique characteristics of the group and well-performing prediction models with influential risk variables. Identified risk variables were aligned with previous studies and suggested the development of marijuana abuse prevention programs targeting 20–29 year olds with a regular depression and suicide screening. Further study is suggested for identifying specific barriers to receiving timely treatment for depression and suicide risk.","Choi, Jeeyae; Chung, Joohyun; Choi, Jeungok",Int J Environ Res Public Health,108,3

The goal of the synthesizer is to automatically find integer values for the holes so that the resulting program satisfies the assertions. The most popular sketching tool, Sketch, can efficiently solve complex program sketches, but uses an integer encoding that often performs poorly if the sketched program manipulates large integer values. In this paper, we propose a new solving technique that allows Sketch to handle large integer values while retaining its integer encoding. Our technique uses a result from number theory, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, to rewrite program sketches to only track the remainders of certain variable values with respect to several prime numbers. We prove that our transformation is sound and the encoding of the resulting programs are exponentially more succinct than existing Sketch encodings. We evaluate our technique on a variety of benchmarks manipulating large integer values. Our technique provides speedups against both existing Sketch solvers and can solve benchmarks that existing Sketch solvers cannot handle.","Pan, Rong; Hu, Qinheping; Singh, Rishabh; D’Antoni, Loris",Programming Languages and Systems,108,11

The present study was conducted to investigate the relationship between self-compassion and the experience of memorial symptoms in patients with GI cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This descriptive-correlational study was conducted in July to August 2019. The study sample included 190 patients admitted to Seyed Al-Shohada Hospital, with GI cancer who entered the study by convenience sampling. Data were collected using a patient demographic information form, Neff's Self-Compassion Scale (SCS), and the Memorial Symptoms Assessment Scale (MSAS) and then analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient in SPSS-20. RESULTS: The mean (SD) total score of self-compassion was 86.67 (16.65) out of 130, and the mean (SD) total score of memorial symptoms was 1.40 (0.64) out of 4 in patients with GI cancer. The most frequently reported physical symptom was lack of energy, with an 86.84% prevalence, and the most frequently reported psychological symptoms included worrying and feeling nervous, with 70.52% prevalence rates. The total score of self-compassion was inversely correlated with the total score of memorial symptoms, the score of psychological symptoms, and the score of physical symptoms. Furthermore, the total score of the memorial symptoms was inversely correlated with the scores of all the self-compassion components (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients had memorial symptoms in both physical and psychological domains. These symptoms decrease with an increase in self-compassion, so compassion-based educational interventions by nurses can be used to reduce these symptoms.","Zarei, Kolsoom; Musarezaie, Amir; Ashouri, Elaheh",Iran J Nurs Midwifery Res,108,0

TECHNIQUE An 85-year-old man who had a Zenith endovascular graft deployed 3 years earlier for a 10-cm infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm presented with separation of the right iliac stent-graft limb from the main body, resulting in type III endoleak and sac enlargement. The disconnected limb occluded the ostium of the main stent-graft body, blocking all conventional endovascular techniques to traverse the graft limb-main body intersection. To overcome the problem, the cephalad portion of the proximal disconnected limb overlying the main body gate was successfully fenestrated with an endoscopic FNA needle and continuity restored with a Viabahn stent-graft across the balloon-modeled fenestration. CONCLUSION In situ fenestration of endovascular stent-grafts may be a useful adjunct in performing rescues of late complications in patients not suitable for open repair.","Kassavin, Daniel S; Constantinopoulos, George",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,108,1

Faculty responses were coded by two researchers, and 21 themes emerged. Seventeen coding themes corresponded to one of four facets of adult personal resilience theory, and we used nonparametric statistical tests to compare resilience between inexperienced and experienced online instructors, as well as trained and untrained instructors. Experienced online instructors were more likely to describe an act of kindness in their memory but were also more likely to include negative student behavior as a difficulty. Untrained faculty were the only instructors who included student engagement as a difficulty and were more likely to describe a negative, discouraging memory. We used conditional forest analysis to identify polarizing themes between faculty with and without previous experience teaching online and between faculty who did and did not receive formal training.

Within the framework of this concept, a persistent increase in resistance to various pathogens, which occurs after an infectious disease or exposure to certain microbial agents, is associated with epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells and their bone marrow progenitors. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention of scientists and practitioners to BCG as an inducer of trained immunity. A number of epidemiological studies have suggested a negative association between the coverage of the population with BCG vaccination and the burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A series of independent clinical studies of the effectiveness of this vaccine in non-specific prevention of COVID-19 has been initiated in different countries. Recently, the key role of cytosolic NOD2 receptors in BCG-induced trained immunity has been proven. This actualizes the search for effective immunoactive preparations for prevention of respiratory infections in the pandemic among low molecular weight peptidoglycan fragments of the bacterial cell wall, muramylpeptides (MPs), which are known to be NOD2 agonists. The review highlights the proven and proposed linkages between BCG, MPs, NOD2 and trained immunity in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the data presented indicates the prospects for preclinical and clinical studies of MPs as potential drugs for nonspecific prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or other respiratory infections in risk groups during the pandemic. First of all, attention should be paid to glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide, approved for clinical use in Russia and a number of post-Soviet countries for the complex treatment and prevention of acute and recurrent respiratory infections.","Kalyuzhin, O V; Andronova, T M; Karaulov, A V",Terapevticheskii arkhiv,108,29

METHODS Sixty-two patients underwent LA for the treatment of PHE at two centers in Rome and Ancona (Italy). Two patients had bilateral lesions, for a total of 64 adrenalectomies. Sporadic PHE occurred in 57 patients (91.9 %) and in 5 (8.0 %) it was familiar. Thirty-six patients (58.0 %) underwent right adrenalectomy, 24 (38.7 %) left adrenalectomy, and in 2 cases (3.2 %) LA was bilateral. In 38 cases of right adrenalectomy (59.3 %) and in 5 cases of left adrenalectomy (7.8 %), the approach was a transperitoneal anterior one. A transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach was used in 21 left adrenalectomy cases (32.8 %). RESULTS Mean operative time for right and left transperitoneal anterior LA was 101 min (range 50-240) and 163 min (range 50-190), respectively. Mean operative time for left transperitoneal anterior submesocolic LA was 92 min (range 50-195). For bilateral adrenalectomy, mean operative time was 210 min (range 200-220). Conversion to open surgery occurred in 2 cases (3.22 %) due to extensive adhesions (1) and hemorrhage (1). One major and three minor complications were observed. Mobilization occurred on the first postoperative day. Hospitalization was 4.8 days (range 2-19). The lesions had a mean diameter of 4.5 cm (range 0.5-10). CONCLUSIONS Early identification with no gland manipulation prior to closure of the adrenal vein is the main advantages of the transperitoneal anterior approach. PHE may be treated safely and effectively by a laparoscopic transperitoneal anterior approach for right-sided lesions and with a transperitoneal anterior submesocolic approach for left-sided ones.","Paganini, Alessandro M; Balla, Andrea; Guerrieri, Mario; Lezoche, Giovanni; Campagnacci, Roberto; D'Ambrosio, Giancarlo; Quaresima, Silvia; Antonica, Maria Vittoria; Lezoche, Emanuele",Surgical endoscopy,108,31

In this context, males seem to not only be more susceptible to the infection compared to female subjects, at least in western countries, but their case fatality rate attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection is also highest. Therefore, we may speculate that the different hormonal milieu could have a more profound pathophysiological role in association with SARS-CoV-2, with endogenous testosterone leaving men more prone to develop more serious complications related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Another option is that SARS-CoV-2 infection per se causes an acute stage of male hypogonadism, the depletion of androgenic action triggering serious or an even fatal course of the disease.

Up to 85% of PDAC patients are diagnosed with diabetes or hyperglycaemia at the time of diagnosis indicating that impaired glucose homeostasis is a common event in this cancer. A mechanism of association between PDAC and diabetes is very complex and still not fully understood. Currently, the various classes of anti-diabetic drugs are used in diabetes treatment. It is possible that specific types of anti-diabetic drugs for diabetes may have different impacts on pancreatic cancer development. Moreover, the intriguing question of whether diabetes can facilitate PDAC development remains unanswered.

The aim of this paper is to present the results of the study, which gathered expert opinions on gaps and inconsistencies concerning preparedness and response planning for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and SARS-like diseases. The Delphi technique was employed, which comprised a pilot round, two written rounds and a face-to-face meeting. The Delphi panel consisted of 38 experts from 22 countries, who highlighted the necessity to test plans and stressed the importance of surveillance measures for the swift containment of communicable disease outbreaks and the inclusion of detailed triage plans in national pandemic plans. The experts also suggested a need to define criteria for testing pandemic preparedness plans at different regional levels. New policy alternatives were identified, such as the need for generic plans on pandemics and universal access to healthcare during an outbreak. The usefulness of some non-medical interventions, such as bans on travel, could not be established and need further research. Dissemination of the findings will help to bridge gaps and rectify inconsistencies in current pandemic planning and response strategies for SARS and SARS-like diseases, as well as add valuable knowledge towards the development of national and international emerging infectious disease policies.","Syed, A M; Hjarnoe, L; Krumkamp, R; Reintjes, R; Aro, A R",Global public health,108,16

This subanalysis of the Extended Prophylaxis for Venous ThromboEmbolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients With Prolonged Immobilization (EXCLAIM) study investigated extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin, compared with placebo following standard-duration enoxaparin, in ischemic stroke patients. METHODS Acutely ill medical patients with recently reduced mobility received open-label enoxaparin 40 mg for 10±4 days, and they were then randomized to double-blind enoxaparin 40 mg daily or placebo for further 28±4 days. Venous thromboembolism incidence (symptomatic/asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, symptomatic/fatal pulmonary embolism) up to day 28 after randomization and major bleeding rates up to 48 h after the last dose of study treatment were reported. RESULTS In total, 389 of 5963 (6.5%) randomized patients had ischemic stroke: 198 received extended-duration prophylaxis and 191 placebo. Extended-duration prophylaxis reduced venous thromboembolism incidence versus placebo (2.4% versus 8.0%; absolute risk difference, -5.6%; 95% CI, -10.5% to -0.7%), but it was associated with an increase in major bleeding (1.5% versus 0% in enoxaparin and placebo groups; absolute risk difference, +1.5%; 95% CI, -0.2% to 3.2%).

Conventional CVD management strategies in CKD largely target atherosclerotic CVD and have had a limited impact on the cardiovascular mortality in this population. Multiple in vivo and in vitro studies and epidemiological evidence from the rheumatologic cohorts have shown that low-dose hydroxychloroquine has beneficial effects on inflammation, endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, and metabolic syndrome. Our recent proof-of-concept animal study showed that hydroxychloroquine has marked protection against atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness. We hypothesize that hydroxychloroquine has the potential to provide significant cardiovascular benefits in patients with CKD. METHODS The Management of Cardiovascular disease in Kidney disease study (NCT03636152) is a phase 2B, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the effects of low-dose hydroxychloroquine therapy on the parameters of atherosclerosis, inflammation, and vascular stiffness in patients with CKD. The study plans to enroll 100 CKD patients estimated to be at high cardiovascular risk by a combination of low estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria and treat them for 18 months with hydroxychloroquine or placebo in 1:1 allocation. RESULTS The study will assess the change in the total carotid plaque volume as measured by serial noncontrast carotid MRI as the primary outcome and the serial changes in plasma inflammation markers, vascular stiffness, renal function, and the composition characteristics of the carotid plaque as secondary outcome measures. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION The results of this trial will provide the proof-of-applicability for hydroxychloroquine in the CVD in CKD. If positive, this trial should lead to phase-3 trials with clinical end points for this potentially transformative, novel, and inexpensive therapy for CVD in CKD.","Shukla, Ashutosh M; Segal, Mark S; Pepine, Carl J; Cheung, Alfred K; Shuster, Jonathan; Mohandas, Rajesh; Martinez, Wanda M; Flint, Jeremy J; Shah, Sudhir V",American journal of nephrology,108,28

METHODS This study was conducted with patients aged 65 years and older from the Family Medicine Clinic of Health Sciences University Şişli Hamidiye Etfal Hospital over a 1-month period. A telephone survey was administered to evaluate patients' sociodemographic data and knowledge level on the COVID-19 pandemic and the degree of its impact. The fear levels of participants were determined using the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19 S). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0. A p value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS The study included 315 participants: 178 were female and 137 were male. The mean age was 71.5 ± 5.6 (min: 65, max: 94) years, and 26 participants were living alone. Moreover, 47.6% participants considered they had sufficient information about the COVID-19 outbreak, and 61.6% received information about the pandemic from television and 22.2% from their inner circle. While 11.7% participants considered they would require psychological support after the COVID-19 pandemic, 30.8% had sleep disorders for the last month. The mean FCV-19 S score was 16.0 ± 6.4; the FCV-19 S scores were statistically higher in participants who were women, living alone, had partial information about the COVID-19 pandemic, had sleep disorders for the last month, and were in requirement of psychological support after the pandemic. CONCLUSION It is necessary to screen the older people for the COVID-19-related fear and accompanying psychological disorders and to develop appropriate intervention programs for individuals at risk.","Gokseven, Yagmur; Ozturk, Guzin Zeren; Karadeniz, Ecem; Sarı, Ecem; Tas, Beray Gelmez; Ozdemir, Hacı Mustafa",Journal of geriatric psychiatry and neurology,108,32

However, generally subunit vaccines have low antigenicity. Adjuvants are used in vaccine formulations to increase their immunogenicity, but current research suggests that adjuvants could induce serious side effects in susceptible individuals; therefore, the improvement of antigens and adjuvants is important. AREAS COVERED Here we reviewed some self-aggregating peptides (SAPs) used as antigen delivery systems. SAPs are based on a short sequence of amino acids, which have self-aggregating properties, inducing self-interaction among peptide molecules by means of non-covalent interactions to generate nanoparticles (NPs). EXPERT COMMENTARY SAPs increase the immunogenicity of fused/conjugated antigens because they can interact with antigen-presenting cells and induce adaptive immunity based on both humoral and cellular responses. As an example, we report an antigen delivery system based on SAPs forming NPs. These NPs are synthesized using a recombinant baculovirus. We fused the green fluorescent protein to the first 110 amino acids of polyhedrin protein from Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus, which has self-aggregating properties. We showed that these NPs prompt high antibody levels without inducing inflammation, similarly to some SAPs reported here.","Zepeda-Cervantes, Jesus; Vaca, Luis",Expert review of vaccines,108,29

This study aimed to investigate the social-spatial aspects of public spaces in one UK city, Cardiff, in order to suggest possible barriers and facilitators to breastfeeding in public spaces. METHODS The study observation location guide prioritised places that had been reported as hostile to breastfeeding or breastfeeding friendly in the existing literature. Data were collected between April and September 2018 at various times of day, in several areas of the city, and included transport (n = 4), transport hubs (n = 3), high streets (n = 4), cafes (n = 2), a large city centre shopping complex, comprising of three joined shopping malls and a large city centre department store containing a third café. Low inference field notes were written on an encrypted smart phone and expanded soon after. Data were analysed thematically using deductive codes based on the observation schedule. Additional inductive codes relating to places were added. RESULTS Overall, public transport and the city centre were inhospitable environments for those who might need to breastfeed, and even more so for those who need to express breastmilk. The core barriers and facilitators across locations were the availability of appropriate seating coupled with either high privacy or politely unimposing strangers (civil inattention). The one variation to this model arose from the department store café, where civil inattention was not performed and there was low privacy, but breastfeeding occurred anyway. CONCLUSIONS This research highlights the physical and social barriers to breastfeeding within one urban city centre in the UK and its associated transport links. It is clear that there is an urgent need for change in urban city centres and public transport if countries are to meet their aims in relation to increasing breastfeeding rates. Interventions will need to be multifaceted, accounting for social norms relating to infant feeding as well as changes to the physical environment, policy and potentially legal change. Further research should be undertaken in other countries to examine the extent to which hostile environments exist, and if correcting these could facilitate breastfeeding and reduce gender-based violence.","Grant, Aimee",International breastfeeding journal,108,33

However, there are still difficulties concerning effective triangulation and countertraction. The study's purpose was to clarify the usefulness of the colon-lifting technique (CLT) in SILS for colorectal cancer. METHODS SILS was performed for cancer (cT2N0 or less) of the right-sided colon (near the ileocecum), sigmoid, or rectosigmoid. The SILS™ Port was used for transumbilical access. A suture string was inserted through the abdominal wall and passed through the mesocolon. The colon was retracted anteriorly and fixed to the abdominal wall. The main mesenteric vessels were placed under tension. Lymph node dissection was performed by medial approach. Short-term surgical outcomes and access port costs were compared between SILS (using CLT) and the standard multiport technique (MPT). The two groups were case-matched by propensity scoring. Analyzed variables included preoperative Dukes stage and tumor location. RESULTS From June 2009 to April 2011, 27 patients underwent SILS, and from April 2005 to April 2011, 85 patients underwent MPT. Propensity scoring generated 23 matched patients per group for SILS versus MPT comparisons. There were no significant differences in operating time, blood loss, early complications, postoperative analgesic frequency, or length of hospital stay. One MPT patient was converted to open surgery (4.5%); no SILS patients were converted. There were no significant differences in the length of distal cut margin and the number of harvested lymph nodes, except incision length (SILS vs. MPT: 33 vs. 55 mm, P < 0.001). Significant differences favored SILS in access instrument cost (SILS vs. MPT: 62,761 vs. 77,130 Japanese yen, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS SILS performed using CLT was safe and effective in providing radical treatment of cT2N0 cancer in the right-sided colon, sigmoid, or rectosigmoid.

Paradoxically, autophagy dysfunction also contributes to cancer and aging. It is well known that regulating autophagy by targeting specific regulatory molecules in its machinery can modulate multiple disease processes. Therefore, autophagy represents a significant pharmacological target for drug development and therapeutic interventions in various diseases, including cancers. According to the framework of autophagy, the suppression or induction of autophagy can exert therapeutic properties through the promotion of cell death or cell survival, which are the two main events targeted by cancer therapies. Remarkably, natural products have attracted attention in the anticancer drug discovery field, because they are biologically friendly and have potential therapeutic effects. In this review, we summarize the up-to-date knowledge regarding natural products that can modulate autophagy in various cancers.

Here, the antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) was conjugated with amphiphilic poly(2-oxazoline) (POx) block copolymers to investigate whether the activity of the antibiotic was enhanced due to additionally induced membrane activity. The resulting polymer-antibiotic conjugates (PACs) are an order of magnitude more active against the bacterial strain Staphylococcus aureus than CIP and show high activities against numerous pathogenic bacterial strains. Their high activity depends on an optimal hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance (HHB) of the POx tail. Mechanistic studies revealed that the derivatization of CIP required for the polymer conjugation lowers the affinity of the antibiotic to its target topoisomerase IV. However, the amphiphilic PACs are most likely concentrated within the bacterial cytoplasm, which overcompensates the loss of affinity and results in high antibacterial activity. In addition, the development of resistance in S. aureus and Escherichia coli is slowed down. More importantly, the amphiphilic PACs are active against CIP-resistant S. aureus and E. coli. The PACs with the highest activity are not cytotoxic toward human stem cells and do not lyse blood cells in saturated solution.","Romanovska, Alina; Keil, Johanna; Tophoven, Jonas; Oruc, Murat Furkan; Schmidt, Martin; Breisch, Marina; Sengstock, Christina; Weidlich, Daniela; Klostermeier, Dagmar; Tiller, Joerg C",Molecular pharmaceutics,108,1

Cox regression modeling with adjustment for relevant covariates demonstrated no significant difference in the likelihood of successful task completion for independent versus proctored training [Hazard Ratio (HR) 1.28; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.96-1.72; p=0.09]. Trainees who observed the actual procedure were more likely to be successful than those who watched the instructional video alone (HR 1.47; 95% CI 1.09-1.98; p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS Proctored VR training is no more effective than independent training with respect to surgical performance. Therefore, time-consuming human expert feedback during VR training may be unnecessary. Instructional videos, while useful, may not be adequate substitutes for actual observation when trainees are learning minimally invasive surgical procedures.","Snyder, Christopher W; Vandromme, Marianne J; Tyra, Sharon L; Porterfield, John R; Clements, Ronald H; Hawn, Mary T",World journal of surgery,108,24

METHODS We linked population based surveillance of acute respiratory illness hospitalizations to national administrative data, to estimate seasonal RSV hospitalization rates among adults aged 18-80 years with certain pre-existing CMCs: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary artery disease (CAD), cerebrovascular accidents (CVA), diabetes mellitus (DM), and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Age and ethnicity adjusted rates stratified by age group were estimated. RESULTS Among 883,999 adult residents aged 18-80 years, 281 RSV positive hospitalizations were detected during 2012-2015 winter seasons. Across all ages, RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with COPD, asthma, CHF, and CAD compared to those without each corresponding condition. RSV hospitalization rates were significantly higher among adults with ESRD aged 50-64 years and adults with DM aged 65-80 years compared to adults in each age group without these conditions. No increased risk was seen for adults with CVA. The CMC with the highest risk of RSV hospitalization was CHF (Incidence Rate Ratio [IRR] range: 4.6-36.5 across age strata) and COPD (IRR range: 9.6-9.7). Among RSV positive adults, CHF and COPD were independently associated with increased length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Adults with specific CMCs are at increased risk of RSV hospitalizations. Age affects this relationship for some CMCs. Such populations maybe relevant for future RSV prevention strategies.","Prasad, Namrata; Walker, Tiffany A; Waite, Ben; Wood, Tim; Trenholme, Adrian A; Baker, Michael G; McArthur, Colin; Wong, Conroy A; Grant, Cameron C; Huang, Q Sue; Newbern, E Claire",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,108,7

Decellularization of existing tissues have formed the basis of one major approach to producing 3D scaffolds for such purposes. In this study, we utilize the native hypanthium tissue of apples and a simple preparation methodology to create implantable cellulose scaffolds. To examine biocompatibility, scaffolds were subcutaneously implanted in wild-type, immunocompetent mice (males and females; 6-9 weeks old). Following the implantation, the scaffolds were resected at 1, 4 and 8 weeks and processed for histological analysis (H&E, Masson's Trichrome, anti-CD31 and anti-CD45 antibodies). Histological analysis revealed a characteristic foreign body response to the scaffold 1 week post-implantation. However, the immune response was observed to gradually disappear by 8 weeks post-implantation. By 8 weeks, there was no immune response in the surrounding dermis tissue and active fibroblast migration within the cellulose scaffold was observed. This was concomitant with the deposition of a new collagen extracellular matrix. Furthermore, active blood vessel formation within the scaffold was observed throughout the period of study indicating the pro-angiogenic properties of the native scaffolds. Finally, while the scaffolds retain much of their original shape they do undergo a slow deformation over the 8-week length of the study. Taken together, our results demonstrate that native cellulose scaffolds are biocompatible and exhibit promising potential as a surgical biomaterial.","Modulevsky, Daniel J; Cuerrier, Charles M; Pelling, Andrew E",PloS one,108,1

A systematic review.,13.056056,10.9393215,2021-04-17,"BACKGROUND Cancer patients are vulnerable to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) given their compromised immune system. The purpose of this study was to describe the presenting symptoms, inpatient stay trajectory, and survival outcomes, for cancer patients infected with COVID-19; who presented to the emergency department (ED) of a single center during the early months of the pandemic. METHODS We reviewed the electronic medical records of all cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution for demographic information, clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment intervention and outcomes. All patients had at least 14 days of follow-up. We determined their survival outcomes as of August 5, 2020. RESULTS Twenty-eight cancer patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and 16 (57%) presented to the ED during the study period. The median age of patients who presented to the ED was 61 years, 69% were women, and the median length of hospitalization was 11 days. There was no difference between the groups (ED vs. no ED visit) for demographics, treatment status or solid tumor versus hematologic malignancies or treatments. Dyspnea was a significant symptom with 67% of ED patients experiencing it versus only 17% of those that did not come to the ED (P=0.009). Do not resuscitate orders were initiated in eight patients, as early as two days from ED presentation and two of these patients died, while 88% of patients were discharged alive. CONCLUSIONS Most cancer patients with COVID-19 infection admitted though the ED experienced dyspnea and were discharged from the hospital. We did not notice a statistically significant difference between cancer types or type of therapy. A broad differential is of utmost importance when caring for cancer patients with COVID-19 due to the complexity of this population.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language therapists and their patients experienced restrictions regarding the usual face-to-face therapy. Teletherapy has become a highly discussed medium for providing therapy services. This study aimed at assessing Austrian therapists' attitudes towards teletherapy, including perceived barriers, during and before the COVID-19 lockdown. Further interest referred to therapists' technical affinity and experiences with the application of teletherapy. METHODS Therapists (n = 325) completed an online survey amid the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Retrospective indications referred to the time prior to the lockdown. Ratings were opposed across the three therapeutic professions. Subgroup analyses investigated the role of gender and age regarding technical affinity. Measures included custom-made attitudinal statements towards teletherapy and the standardized TA-EG survey. RESULTS The COVID-19 lockdown caused attitude changes towards teletherapy - for example, in terms of interest (r = 0.57, p > 0.01), perceived skills for performance of teletherapy (r = 0.33, p > 0.01) and perceived need for physical contact with patients (r = 0.35, p > 0.01). Regarding technical affinity, women reported significantly higher values than men did (r = 0.32, p > 0.01). Nearly half of the participants already applied teletherapy, with mainly positive ratings regarding perceived skills and feasibility. Barriers identified were missing or unstable reimbursement policies by insurance companies and therapeutic software with guaranteed data security. DISCUSSION Austrian therapists indicate a relatively high level of telehealth positivity, with an improvement in the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. However, therapists outline the need for stable reimbursement policies and secure software solutions.","Rettinger, Lena; Klupper, Carissa; Werner, Franz; Putz, Peter",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,108,31

Currently, no potent medicine is available to treat COVID-19. Quest for new drugs especially from natural plant sources is an area of immense potential. The current study aimed to repurpose stilbenoid analogs, reported for some other biological activities, against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE2 receptor complex for their affinity and stability using molecular dynamics simulation and binding free energy analysis based on molecular docking. Four compounds in total were probed for their binding affinity using molecular docking. All of the compounds showed good affinity (> -7 kcal/mol). However, fifty nanoseconds molecular dynamic simulation in aqueous solution revealed highly stable bound conformation of resveratrol to the viral protein: ACE2 receptor complex. Net free energy of binding using MM-PBSA also affirmed the stability of the resveratrol-protein complex. Based on the results, we report that stilbene based compounds in general and resveratrol, in particular, can be promising anti-COVID-19 drug candidates acting through disruption of the spike protein. Our findings in this study are promising and call for further in vitro and in vivo testing of stiblenoids, especially resveratrol against the COVID-19.","Wahedi, Hussain Mustatab; Ahmad, Sajjad; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,108,1

The authors examined thermograms to analyze distributions between central and peripheral body temperature in extremely low birth weight infants. The authors have also used this technology to examine the relationship between body temperature and development of necrotizing enterocolitis in premature infants. RESULTS Handheld, uncooled, infrared cameras are easy to use and produce high-quality thermograms that can be visualized in grayscale or color palettes to enhance qualitative and quantitative analyses.

Surgeons and patients may choose from a range of implant components and combinations that make up knee replacement constructs, all with potential implications for how long a knee replacement will last. To inform surgeon and patient decisions, a comprehensive synthesis of data from randomised controlled trials is needed to evaluate the effects of different knee replacement implants on overall construct survival. Due to limited follow-up in trials, joint registry analyses are also needed to assess the long-term survival of constructs. Finally, economic modelling can identify cost-effective knee replacement constructs for different patient groups. METHODS AND ANALYSIS In this protocol, we describe systematic reviews and network meta-analyses to synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of knee replacement constructs used in total and unicompartmental knee replacement and analyses of two national joint registries to assess long-term outcomes. Knee replacement constructs are defined by bearing materials and mobility, constraint, fixation and patella resurfacing. For men and women in different age groups, we will compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of knee replacement constructs.

The use of digital storytelling in knowledge translation (KT) is emerging as technology advances in healthcare to address the challenging tasks of disseminating and transferring knowledge to key stakeholders. We conducted a scoping review of the literature available on the use of patient digital storytelling as a tool in KT interventions. METHODS We followed by Arksey and O'Malley (Int J Soc Res Methodol 8(1):19-32, 2005), and Levac et al. (Implement Sci 5(1):69, 2010) recommended steps for scoping reviews. Search strategies were conducted for electronic databases (Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, ProQuest dissertations and theses global, Clinicaltrials.gov and Psychinfo). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) was used to report the review process. RESULTS Of 4656 citations retrieved, 114 full texts were reviewed, and twenty-one articles included in the review. Included studies were from nine countries and focused on an array of physical and mental health conditions. A broad range of interpretations of digital storytelling and a variety of KT interventions were identified. Digital storytelling was predominately defined as a story in multi-media form, presented as a video, for selective or public viewing and used as educational material for healthcare professionals, patients and families. CONCLUSION Using digital storytelling as a tool in KT interventions can contribute to shared decision-making in healthcare and increase awareness in patients' health related experiences. Concerns centered on the accuracy and reliability of some of the information available online and the impact of digital storytelling on knowledge action and implementation.","Park, Elly; Forhan, Mary; Jones, C Allyson",Research involvement and engagement,108,19

METHODS Patients undergoing primary enucleation for uveal melanoma between May 2005 and November 2012 at the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre, United Kingdom, were randomized between hydroxyapatite and acrylic implants. Questionnaires were sent to patients and ocularists to comment on the main outcomes. RESULTS A total of 416 patients were recruited in the study, of whom 281 were included, with 49.5% (139/281) and 50.5% (142/281) receiving a hydroxyapatite (HA) or acrylic (AC) implant. Mailed questionnaires completed at ≥18 months by patients showed no significant differences between the groups in eyelid position, prosthetic motility, socket complications, and patient satisfaction. Complications included implant extrusion (1% vs 4%), enophthalmos (26% vs 26%), and superior sulcus deformity (24% vs 24%) with HA and AC implants, respectively, (Fisher exact test p > 0.0125 in all, Bonferroni correction).

Here, we report an interesting, counter-intuitive observation that interfacial triplet energy transfer from QDs is not retarded but rather enabled by an insulating shell. Specifically, photoluminescence of red-emitting CdSe QDs could not be quenched by surface-anchored Rhodamine B molecules; in contrast, after ZnS shell coating, their emission was effectively quenched. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the shell eliminates ultrafast hole trapping in the QDs and hence opens up the triplet exciton transfer pathway.

Purpose To screen the phytochemicals for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 in silico and evaluate their safety and efficacy in vitro and in vivo. Method The phytochemicals for Anti-SARS-CoV-2 were screened in silico using molecular docking. The hits generated from in silico screening were subjected for extraction, isolation and purification. The anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of plant extracts of Z. piperitum (ATRI-CoV-E1), W. somnifera (ATRI-CoV-E2), C. inophyllum (ATRI-CoV-E3), A. paniculata (ATRI-CoV-E4), and C. Asiatica (ATRI-CoV-E5). The in vitro safety and anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of plant extracts were performed in VeroE6 cells using Remdesivir as positive control. The acute and sub-acute toxicity study was performed in Wistar male and female rats. Results The percentage of cell viability for ATRI-COV-E4, ATRI-COV-E5 and ATRI-COV-E2 treated VeroE6 cells were remarkably good on the 24th and 48th hour of treatment. The in vitro anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of ATRI-COV-E4, ATRI-COV-E5 and ATRI-COV-E2 were significant for both E gene and N gene. The percentage of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition for ATRI-COV-E4 was better than Remdesivir. For E gene and N gene, Remdesivir showed IC50 of 0.15 µM and 0.11 µM respectively, For E gene and N gene, ATRI-CoV-E4 showed IC50 of 1.18 µg and 1.16 µg respectively. Taking the clue from in vitro findings, the plant extracts A. paniculata (ATRI-COV-E4), W. somnifera extract (ATRI-COV-E5) and C. asiatica extract (ATRI-COV-E2) were combined (ATRICOV 452) and evaluated for acute and sub-acute toxicity in Wistar male and female rats. No statistically significant difference in haematological, biochemical and histopathological parameters were noticed. Conclusion The study demonstrated the Anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in vitro and safety of plant extracts in both in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions.","Damle, Latha; Damle, Hrishikesh; Ganju, Shiban; Chandrashekar, C; Bharath, BR",bioRxiv,108,1

Out of 632 known metabolites detected, 60 were significantly altered in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Bioinformatics analysis identified an altered “metabotype” in RRMS patients, represented by 4 changed metabolic pathways of glycerophospholipid, citrate cycle, sphingolipid, and pyruvate metabolism. Interestingly, the common upstream metabolic pathway feeding these 4 pathways is the glycolysis pathway. Real-time bioenergetic analysis of the patient derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells, showed enhanced glycolysis, supporting the altered metabolic state of immune cells. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice treated with the glycolytic inhibitor, 2-deoxy-D-glucose ameliorated the disease progression and inhibited the disease pathology significantly by promoting the anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes/macrophage in the central nervous system.

However, limited information is currently available about its impact on other ancestry groups. Here, we investigated how different evolutionary processes affected the common variant heritability of traits and diseases in East Asians. Leveraging genome-wide association statistics from the Biobank Japan (up to 158,284 participants), we assessed natural selection (negative and positive), archaic introgression from Neanderthal and Denisova, and several genomic functional categories with respect to the heritability of physiological and pathological conditions. Similar to reports in European descent populations, the heritability estimates for East Asian traits were ubiquitously enriched for negative selection annotations (false discovery rate, FDR q<0.05). Enrichment of Denisovan introgression was identified in coronary artery disease (1.69-fold enrichment, p=0.003). We followed up these enrichments by conducting a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) of Denisovan and Neanderthal alleles in participants of six ancestral backgrounds from the UK Biobank. In East Asians, Denisovan-inherited alleles were associated with 22 phenotypes, including metabolic, immunological, cardiovascular, endocrine, and dermatological traits. The strongest association was observed for the Denisovan-inherited locus rs59185462 with rheumatoid arthritis (beta=0.82, p=1.91×10−105). In summary, our study provides the first evidence regarding the impact of evolutionary processes on the genetics of complex traits in worldwide populations, highlighting the specific contribution of Denisovan introgression in East Asian populations.","Koller, Dora; Wendt, Frank R; Pathak, Gita A; De Lillo, Antonella; De Angelis, Flavio; Cabrera-Mendoza, Brenda; Tucci, Serena; Polimanti, Renato",bioRxiv,108,8

All training days were cancelled and the majority of trainees were redeployed to general medicine.By early May 2020, there was a shift in the focus back towards specialty training as COVID-19 related hospital admissions continued to decrease. With the help of the team from King’s College London, a remote rheumatology training programme was developed and accessible to trainees from four different regions – South London, North West London, North East/North Central London and Kent/Surrey/Sussex. The collaboration between different regions gave access to a greater pool of speakers and reduced the administrative workload. Subsequent collaboration with the British Society for Rheumatology facilitated the delivery of the webinars on a national level, supporting other regions that had not yet set up any remote training.Feedback was particularly important for this innovative programme in order to understand how this experience could be optimised for trainees. There were no additional difficulties related to the training taking place online, with one trainee responding that it was ‘very easy to log on’. There was also positive feedback regarding the recording – ‘[it] was great to have a link to the recording to watch it later’.By having a shared vision for change, we were able to work across regions and organisations, delivering a high quality training programme on a national scale, benefitting a greater number of trainees. Remote training has the additional benefit of removing the need to travel between hospitals. Therefore, there may be a push towards blended learning (a combination of online and face-to-face learning) in the future. Using a robust feedback mechanism, we are confident that the programme will continue to improve as it evolves alongside the pandemic, aiming to at least in part, satisfy the speciality rheumatology training needs within our regions.","Yik Long, Man Ludwig Dalia Glanville James Pollard Louise C.; Gorman, Claire Mukherjee Jaita Logan Victoria Coakley Gerald Galloway James",BMJ Leader,108,7

However, the waning of humoral immunity over time has raised concern over the durability of immune memory following vaccination. Thus, we conducted a non-randomized trial among the healthcare professionals (HCWs) to investigate the long-term sustainability of SARS-CoV-2-specific B cells and T cells stimulated by inactivated vaccine and the potential need for a third booster dose for the HCWs. Although neutralizing antibodies elicited by the standard two-dose vaccination schedule dropped from a peak of 31.2 AU/ml to 9.2 AU/ml 5 months after the second vaccination, spike-specific memory B and T cells were still detectable, forming the basis for a quick recall response. As expected, the faded humoral immune response was vigorously elevated to 66.8 AU/ml by 7.2 folds 1 week after the third dose along with abundant spike-specific circulating follicular helper T cells in parallel. Meanwhile, spike-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were also robustly elevated by 5.9 and 2.7 folds respectively. Robust expansion of memory pools by the third dose potentiated greater durability of protective immune responses. Another key finding in this trial was that HCWs with low serological response to 2 doses were not truly no responders but fully equipped with immune memory that could be quickly recalled by a third dose even 5 months after the second vaccination. Collectively, these data provide insights into the generation of long-term immunological memory by the inactivated vaccine, which has implications for future booster strategies that the frontline HCWs, individuals with low serological response to 2 dose of vaccine and immune compromised patients could benefit from a third dose of inactivated vaccine.","Liu, Y.; Zeng, Q.; Deng, C.; Li, M.; Li, L.; Liu, D.; Mei, J.; Mo, R.; Zhou, Q.; Liu, M.; Peng, S.; Wang, J.; Zhang, H.; Xiao, H.",,108,12

One strategy is to directly prioritize groups that are likely to experience medical complications due to COVID-19, such as older adults. A second strategy is to limit community spread by reducing importations, for example by vaccinating members of the mobile labour force, such as rotational workers. This second strategy may be appropriate for regions with low disease prevalence, where importations are a substantial fraction of all cases and reducing the importation rate reduces the risk of community outbreaks, which can provide significant indirect protection for vulnerable individuals. Current studies have focused on comparing vaccination strategies in the absence of importations, and have not considered allocating vaccines to reduce the importation rate. Here, we provide an analytical criteria to compare the reduction in the risk of hospitalization and intensive care unit (ICU) admission over four months when either older adults or rotational workers are prioritized for vaccination. Vaccinating rotational workers (assumed to be 6,000 individuals and about 1% of the Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) population) could reduce the average risk of hospitalization and ICU admission by 42%, if no community spread is observed at the time of vaccination, because epidemic spread is reduced and vulnerable individuals are indirectly protected. In contrast, vaccinating all individuals aged 75 and older (about 43,300 individuals, or 8% of the NL population) would lead to a 24% reduction in the average risk of hospitalization, and to a 45% reduction in the average risk of ICU admission, because a large number of individuals at high risk from COVID-19 are now vaccinated. Therefore, reducing the risk of hospitalization and ICU admission of the susceptible population by reducing case importations would require a significantly lower number of vaccines. Benefits of vaccinating rotational workers decrease with increasing infection prevalence in the community. Prioritizing members of the mobile labour force should be considered as an efficient strategy to indirectly protect vulnerable groups from COVID-19 exposure in regions with low disease prevalence.","Martignoni, M.

Methods: The study included 1 125 officially reported PCR-confirmed cases of COVID-19 from 20 February 2020 to 20 April 2020 in 90 regions in Qom city, Iran. The Bayesian hierarchical spatial model was used to model the relative risk of COVID-19 in Qom city, and the segmented regression model was used to estimate the trend of COVID-19 incidence rate. The Poisson distribution was applied for the observed number of COVID-19, and independent Gamma prior was used for inference on log-relative risk parameters of the model. Results: The total incidence rate of COVID-19 was estimated at 89.5 per 100 000 persons in Qom city (95% CI: 84.3, 95.1). According to the results of the Bayesian hierarchical spatial model and posterior probabilities, 43.33% of the regions in Qom city have relative risk greater than 1;however, only 11.11% of them were significantly greater than 1. Based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial analysis, 10 spatial clusters were detected as active and emerging hotspot areas in the south and central parts of the city. The downward trend was estimated 10 days after the reporting of the first case (February 7, 2020);however, the incidence rate was decreased by an average of 4.24% per day (95%CI:-10.7, -3.5). Conclusions: Spatial clusters with high incidence rates of COVID-19 in Qom city were in the south and central regions due to the high population density. The GIS could depict the spatial hotspot clusters of COVID-19 for timely surveillance and decision-making as a way to contain the disease.","Mohammadbeigi, A.; Arsang-Jang, S.; Sharifipour, E.; Koohpaei, A.; Vahedian, M.; Mohammadsalehi, N.; Jafaresmaeili, M.; Karami, M.; Mohebi, S.",Journal of Acute Disease,108,15

Previous studies with JHMV have established a role for the immune system in both viral clearance and demyelination. To further clarify the role of the immune system in JHMV pathogenesis, several strains of congenitally immunodeficient mice were studied. Infection of immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice with JHMV resulted in severe paralysis and demyelination and complete clearance of infectious virus from the brain (C+D+ phenotype). In contrast, infected SCID mice showed little or no paralysis or demyelination and were unable to clear infectious virus (C-D- phenotype). Athymic nude mice and a proportion of mice lacking MHC Class I or II expression exhibited robust demyelination but did not completely clear infectious virus from the brain (C-D+ phenotype). These results are consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism for JHMV-induced demyelination, but indicate that the immune mechanisms which participate in demyelination and viral clearance are distinct. It may thus be possible to experimentally alter immunopathological responses without impairing antimicrobial immunity.","Houtman, J J; Fleming, J O",Journal of neurovirology,108,1

Despite calls for solidarity and social justice during the pandemic, vaccine nationalism, stockpiling of limited vaccine supplies by high-income countries and profit-driven strategies of global pharmaceutical manufacturers have brought into sharp focus global health inequities and the plight of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) as they wait in line for restricted tranches of vaccines. Even in high-income countries that received vaccine supplies first, vaccine roll-out globally has been fraught with logistic and ethical challenges. South Africa (SA) is no exception. Flawed global institutional strategies for vaccine distribution and delivery have undermined public procurement platforms, leaving LMICs facing disproportionate shortages necessitating strict criteria for vaccine prioritisation. In anticipation of our first consignment of vaccines, deliberations around phase 1 roll-out were intense and contentious. Although the first phase focuses on healthcare personnel (HCP), the devil is in the detail. Navigating the granularity of prioritising different categories of risk in healthcare sectors in SA is complicated by definitions of risk in personal and occupational contexts. The inequitable public-private divide that characterises the SA health system adds another layer of complexity. Unlike other therapeutic or preventive interventions that are procured independently by the private health sector, COVID-19 vaccine procurement is currently limited to the SA government only, leaving HCP in the private sector dependent on central government allocation. Fair distribution among tertiary, secondary and primary levels of care is another consideration. Taking all these complexities into account, procedural and substantive ethical principles supporting a prioritisation approach are outlined. Within the constraints of suboptimal global health governance, LMICs must optimise progressive distribution of scarce vaccines to HCP at highest risk.","Moodley, K; Blockman, M; Pienaar, D; Hawkridge, A J; Meintjes, J; Davies, M-A; London, L",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,108,33

RESULTS The decrease during March-October 2020 was 40.2% for new referrals overall (with the most significant drop in April, of 80%), 52.5% for medical oncology inpatients, 39% for paediatric oncology department inpatients, 69% for radiotherapy inpatients, 34.9% for surgical interventions and 31% decrease of issued pathology reports. The decrease was less important for outpatients: only 10% for medical oncology outpatient department, 33% for radiotherapy and 27% for breast cancer unit outpatients. Imaging investigations were only slightly influenced by the pandemic (reduction of 5% for MRI scans, 19% for mammograms,whereas performed CT scans were even more after the outbreak of COVID-19). CONCLUSION Our results show a decrease in the number of patients during the period after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more for inpatients and less significant for outpatient departments, probably because of the internal circuits reorganization but also because of health care measures taken nationally and locally to limit the spread of the pandemic.","Crisan, Cristina; Cainap, Calin; Deac, Andrada; Havasi, Andrei; Balacescu, Ovidiu; Balacescu, Loredana; Bochis, Ovidiu; Vlad, Catalin; Cainap, Simona",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,108,10

Furthermore, mobile applications that accompany wearable devices can be used to collect relevant self-reported symptoms and demographic data. This makes consumer devices a valuable tool in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Data on 2745 subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 (active infection, PCR test) were collected from May 21 to September 11, 2020, consisting of PCR positive tests conducted between February 16 and September 9. Considering male (female) participants, 11.9% (11.2%) of the participants were asymptomatic, 48.3% (47.8%) recovered at home by themselves, 29.7% (33.7%) recovered at home with the help of someone else, 9.3% (6.6%) required hospitalization without ventilation, and 0.5% (0.4%) required ventilation. There were a total of 21 symptoms reported, and the prevalence of symptoms varies by sex. Fever was present in 59.4% of male subjects and in 52% of female subjects. Based on self-reported symptoms alone, we obtained an AUC of 0.82 ± 0.017 for the prediction of the need for hospitalization. Based on physiological signs, we obtained an AUC of 0.77 ± 0.018 for the prediction of illness on a specific day. Respiration rate and heart rate are typically elevated by illness, while HRV is decreased. Measuring these metrics, taken in conjunction with molecular-based diagnostics, may lead to better early detection and monitoring of COVID-19.","Natarajan, Aravind; Su, Hao-Wei; Heneghan, Conor",NPJ Digit Med,108,1

Therefore, this study was conducted to combat major CoVs via a trivalent subunit vaccine, which was engineered by implementing sequences of spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N), envelope (E), membrane (M) protein, non-structural protein (nsp) 3, and nsp8 antigens. The CTL, HTL, MHC I, and IFN-Î³ epitopes were predicted via CTLPRED, IEDB, and IFN epitope servers, respectively. Also, to stimulate strong helper T lymphocytes (HTLs) responses, Pan HLA DR-binding epitope (PADRE) was used. Also, for boosting the immune response, ß-defensin 2 was added to the construct as an adjuvant. Furthermore, TAT was applied to the vaccine to facilitate the intracellular delivery. Finally, TAT, adjuvant, PADRE, and selected epitopes were appropriately assembled. Based on the predicted epitopes, a trivalent multi-epitope vaccine with a molecular weight of 74.8 kDa was constructed. Further analyses predicted the molecule to be a strong antigen, and a non-allergenic and soluble protein. Secondary and tertiary structures were predicted. Additionally, analyses validated the stability of the proposed vaccine. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) showed binding affinity and stability of the vaccine-TLR3 complex was favorable. The predicted epitopes demonstrated a strong potential to stimulate T and B-cell mediated immune responses. Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning guaranteed increased expression. In summary, investigations demonstrated that this next-generation approach might provide a new horizon for the development of a highly immunogenic vaccine against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.

The aim of our study was to characterize mild courses and to determine the antibody status for these patients. METHODS: We initiated an appeal for convalescent plasma donations. 615 people contacted us, and we ultimately included 426 in our analyses, in whom it was possible to assume COVID-19 based on detection of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies or virus detection during the disease using RT-PCR. RESULTS: The median duration of the disease was 12 days and the most common symptoms were fatigue, cough and olfactory and gustatory dysfunction. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was detected in 82.4% of the persons and IgA antibodies were found in 73.9%. In 10.8%, no antibodies were detectable despite a positive RT-PCR result during the disease. Nevertheless, of 24 persons with asymptomatic courses of COVID-19, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in 23 (96%). Furthermore, there was a correlation between the duration of the disease and the detection of IgG antibodies. In addition, a correlation between the determined IgG antibodies and neutralizing antibodies was shown. CONCLUSION: In this study, we were able to describe mild COVID-19 courses and determine antibody statuses for them. It could be shown that, despite SARS-CoV-2 detection during the disease, not all individuals developed antibodies or their level of antibodies had dropped below the detection limit shortly after the end of the disease. The extent to which immunity to re-infection is given in persons with undetectable antibodies (IgG, IgA) needs to be investigated in future studies.","Flieder, Tobias; Vollmer, Tanja; Müller, Benjamin; Dreier, Jens; Fischer, Bastian; Knabbe, Cornelius; Birschmann, Ingvild",PLoS One,108,20

Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase that forms a dimer and serves as the cellular receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). ACE2 is also a key negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system that modulates vascular functions. We report here the properties of a trimeric ACE2 ectodomain variant, engineered using a structure-based approach. The trimeric ACE2 variant has a binding affinity of ~60 pM for the spike protein of SARS­CoV­2 (compared with 77 nM for monomeric ACE2 and 12-22 nM for dimeric ACE2 constructs), and its peptidase activity and the ability to block activation of angiotensin II receptor type 1 in the renin-angiotensin system are preserved. Moreover, the engineered ACE2 potently inhibits SARS­CoV­2 infection in cell culture. These results suggest that engineered, trimeric ACE2 may be a promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agent for treating COVID-19.","Xiao, Tianshu; Lu, Jianming; Zhang, Jun; Johnson, Rebecca I; McKay, Lindsay G A; Storm, Nadia; Lavine, Christy L; Peng, Hanqin; Cai, Yongfei; Rits-Volloch, Sophia; Lu, Shen; Quinlan, Brian D; Farzan, Michael; Seaman, Michael S; Griffiths, Anthony; Chen, Bing",Nat Struct Mol Biol,108,27

We analyzed the associations of changes in mortality rates with clinical profiles and respiratory support strategies in COVID-19 critically ill patients. METHODS: A multicenter cohort of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted at 126 Brazilian intensive care units between February 27th and October 28th, 2020. Assessing temporal changes in deaths, we identified distinct time periods. We evaluated the association of characteristics and respiratory support strategies with 60-day in-hospital mortality using random-effects multivariable Cox regression with inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Among the 13,301 confirmed-COVID-19 patients, 60-day in-hospital mortality was 13%. Across four time periods identified, younger patients were progressively more common, non-invasive respiratory support was increasingly used, and the 60-day in-hospital mortality decreased in the last two periods. 4188 patients received advanced respiratory support (non-invasive or invasive), from which 42% underwent only invasive mechanical ventilation, 37% only non-invasive respiratory support and 21% failed non-invasive support and were intubated. After adjusting for organ dysfunction scores and premorbid conditions, we found that younger age, absence of frailty and the use of non-invasive respiratory support (NIRS) as first support strategy were independently associated with improved survival (hazard ratio for NIRS first [95% confidence interval], 0.59 [0.54-0.65], p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Age and mortality rates have declined over the first 8 months of the pandemic. The use of NIRS as the first respiratory support measure was associated with survival, but causal inference is limited by the observational nature of our data.","Kurtz, Pedro; Bastos, Leonardo S L; Dantas, Leila F; Zampieri, Fernando G; Soares, Marcio; Hamacher, Silvio; Salluh, Jorge I F; Bozza, Fernando A",Intensive Care Med,108,20

During both the initial and peak phases of the epidemic, the administration of disease-modifying drugs, typically immunosuppressants administered in pulses, was suspended due to the uncertainty about their impact on SARS-CoV-2 infection, mainly in contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic patients. The purpose of this study is to present a safety algorithm enabling patients to resume pulse immunosuppressive therapy (PIT) during the easing of lockdown measures. METHODS: We developed a safety algorithm based on our clinical experience with MS and the available published evidence; the algorithm assists in the detection of contagious asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases and of patients with mild symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection with a view to withdrawing PIT in these patients and preventing new infections at day hospitals. RESULTS: We developed a clinical/microbiological screening algorithm consisting of a symptom checklist, applied during a teleconsultation 48hours before the scheduled session of PIT, and PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal exudate 24hours before the procedure. CONCLUSION: The application of our safety algorithm presents a favourable risk-benefit ratio despite the fact that the actual proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals is unknown. Systematic PCR testing, which provides the highest sensitivity for detecting presymptomatic cases, combined with early detection of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection may reduce infections and improve detection of high-risk patients before they receive PIT.","Valero-López, G; Carreón-Guarnizo, E; Hernández-Clares, R; Iniesta-Martínez, F; Jiménez-Veiga, J; Moreno-Docon, A; Iborra-Bendicho, M A; Aznar-Robles, E; Hellín-Gil, M F; Morales-Ortiz, A; Meca-Lallana, J E",Neurologia,108,20

The tool is based on the implementation of business intelligence methods with which you can understand the behavior of the pandemic in Colombia and generate structured data for decision-making by government levels. The tool displays, on a single screen, information on the number of cases, patient status, age ranges, city, location department, and gender. This information can be dynamically filtered and focus analyzes on the national, departmental, or municipal order. Additionally, methods are implemented for trend analysis, both on a linear and semi-log scale, as well as for calculating the case fatality rate in each of the municipalities. Results A web-based data analysis dashboard is implemented for semi-continuous monitoring of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. With the use of the tool, a situational analysis is carried out for five of the most important cities in Colombia. Conclusions The application is effective, flexible, and easy to use. The situational analysis reflects that public policies for the control of the disease have been favorable for Medellín, but for Cartagena, Bogotá, Barranquilla, and Cali, complementary measures are required.","Aristizábal-Torres, Daniel; Peñuela-Meneses, Cesar A.; Barrera-Rodríguez, Ana M.",Rev. salud pública,108,1

Rate of recanalisation is varied and can range from 43-57% and the factors that affect recanalisation are still a dilemma. Objective To know the factors for recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis. Method This is a single institution based retrospective-prospective analytical study encompassing all ultrasonologically diagnosed cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis in adults from January 2015 to November 2017. All the cases were admitted with oral warfarin bridged by Heparin/ Enoxaparin and were discharged once International Normalization Ratio was in therapeutic range. The patients were followed up for three months with minimal of three outpatient followup. Best finding in the doppler ultrasonography (done by Acuson P500, Seimens) in relation to recanalisation was taken for the study. Result There were 67 cases of Deep Vein Thrombosis. Of these cases male to female ratio was 0.91. The mean age was 48.07. Most common extent was up to common femoral vein (47.8%) followed by upto popliteal vein (40.3%). Remaining 11.9% had extension upto iliac veins. There was no recanalisation in 2 cases (3%). Partial recanalisation was seen in 23 cases (34.3%) while complete recanalisation was seen in 42 cases (62.7%). Recanalisation is more in DVT involving popliteal vein while it decreases as the extension goes up. In contrast to 79.4% complete recanalisation in popliteal vein, that in common femoral vein is 62.5% while in iliac vein is only 37.5%. Mean age in no recanalisation group is much younger than partial or complete recanalisation groups. Conclusion Recanalisation following Deep Vein Thrombosis distal to popliteal vein is more than that in proximal Deep Vein Thrombosis. The information on recanalization can be considered to use to decide upon the duration of medical management of Deep Vein Thrombosis.","Karmacharya, R M; Shrestha, B; Devbhandari, M; Tuladhar, S M; Pradhan, A",Kathmandu Univ Med J (KUMJ),108,1

As early reports suggested disproportionate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on women, the ESMO W4O Committee initiated a study on the impact of the pandemic on the lives of female and male oncologists. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to ESMO members and put on the ESMO website between 8 June 2020 and 2 July 2020. Questions focused on the working (hospital tasks, laboratory tasks, science) and home (household management, childcare, parent care, personal care) lives of oncologists during and after COVID-19-related lockdowns. RESULTS: Of 649 respondents, 541 completed the questionnaire. Of these, 58% reported that COVID-19 had affected their professional career, 83% of whom said this was in a negative way (85% of women versus 76% of men). Approximately 86% reported that COVID-19 had changed their personal life and 82% their family life. Women were again significantly more affected than men: personal life (89% versus 78%; P = 0.001); family life (84% versus 77%; P = 0.037). During lockdowns, women reported increased time spent on hospital and laboratory tasks compared with men (53% versus 46% and 33% versus 26%, respectively) and a significantly higher proportion of women than men spent less time on science (39% versus 25%) and personal care (58% versus 39%). After confinement, this trend remained for science (42% versus 23%) and personal care (55% versus 36%). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the professional and home lives of oncologists, especially women.

Most papers refer to the need for respiratory rehabilitation in the acute phase; however, the fact that the infection also affects other organ systems has to be considered in rehabilitation interventions. Long-term symptoms in many cases severely limit activity and participation and alter quality of life, leading to rehabilitation needs. This article proposes a phase-adapted model of linking the acute, postacute, and long-term symptoms of COVID-19 with the well-established matrix of acute, postacute, and long-term rehabilitation services. A review of currently available recommendations for phase-adapted rehabilitation strategies, including the relevance of prehabilitation within this context, is provided.","Gutenbrunner, Christoph; Nugraha, Boya; Martin, Lidia Teixido",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,108,26

Identified references underwent screening, full-text analyses and data extraction in duplicate. The search identified 15 230 references. Five systematic reviews that provided a narrative syntheses of a combined 38 studies were included. Health professional participants generally reported being satisfied with the training interventions. Heterogeneity between and within included reviews, non-controlled designs of individual studies and low quality of evidence at an individual study level and review level made it difficult to draw firm conclusions regarding what interventions are most effective in changing health professionals' knowledge, skills, self-efficacy, attitudes and practice. However, similar gaps in the literature were identified across included reviews. Key areas that could be addressed in future interventions including organization and system-level barriers to providing advice, health professionals' attitudes and motivation and weight stigma have been highlighted. Health professionals and patients could be more involved in the planning and development of interventions that work towards improving diet and physical activity advice and support provided in healthcare.","Yazdizadeh, Bahareh; Walker, Ruth; Skouteris, Helen; Olander, Ellinor K; Hill, Briony",Health promot. internation,108,20

For this purpose, a quantitative methodology was used, whereby a questionnaire was given to higher education students in these two chronological moments. From the obtained results, it was possible to ascertain that, given the motivational dimension, the attitude towards behavior and perceived behavioral control are having a positive impact on entrepreneurial intentions during the pandemic and that subjective norms have a negative impact on entrepreneurial intentions. This relationship of influences is unchanged, either before or during the pandemic. Regarding the environmental dimension, both of the variables under analysis are having a negative impact on entrepreneurial intention during the pandemic period, which corresponds to an aggravation or loss of positive influences when compared to the context before the pandemic, and the next assessment had a positive impact on entrepreneurial intentions. On the theoretical contributions, the findings are very important, as they strengthen the literature on entrepreneurial intentions, and in specific contexts of social and economic instability. As for practical contributions, this research suggests actions to agents with an important intervention role in the community, one of these agents is Higher Education Institutions, which play a determining role by creating a positive environment to support their students’ entrepreneurial intent. This research is original, as far as we are informed, and it is the first to study entrepreneurial intention in academia during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Portuguese context.

Methods: We performed widespread severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction testing and collected risk factor information at all homeless shelters in Chicago with at least 1 reported case of COVID-19 (n = 21). Multivariable, mixed-effects log-binomial models were built to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for SARS-CoV-2 infection for both individual- and facility-level risk factors. Results: During March 1 to May 1, 2020, 1717 shelter residents and staff were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 472 (27%) persons tested positive. Prevalence of infection was higher for residents (431 of 1435, 30%) than for staff (41 of 282, 15%) (prevalence ratio = 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.78-3.58). The majority of residents with SARS-CoV-2 infection (293 of 406 with available information about symptoms, 72%) reported no symptoms at the time of specimen collection or within the following 2 weeks. Among residents, sharing a room with a large number of people was associated with increased likelihood of infection (aPR for sharing with >20 people compared with single rooms = 1.76; 95% CI, 1.11-2.80), and current smoking was associated with reduced likelihood of infection (aPR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85). At the facility level, a higher proportion of residents leaving and returning each day was associated with increased prevalence (aPR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16), whereas an increase in the number of private bathrooms was associated with reduced prevalence (aPR for 1 additional private bathroom per 100 people = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.98). Conclusions: We identified a high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections in homeless shelters. Reducing the number of residents sharing dormitories might reduce the likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection. When community transmission is high, limiting movement of persons experiencing homelessness into and out of shelters might also be beneficial.","Ghinai, Isaac; Davis, Elizabeth S; Mayer, Stockton; Toews, Karrie-Ann; Huggett, Thomas D; Snow-Hill, Nyssa; Perez, Omar; Hayden, Mary K; Tehrani, Seena; Landi, A Justine; Crane, Stephanie; Bell, Elizabeth; Hermes, Joy-Marie; Desai, Kush; Godbee, Michelle; Jhaveri, Naman; Borah, Brian; Cable, Tracy; Sami, Sofia; Nozicka, Laura; Chang, Yi-Shin; Jagadish, Aditi; Chee, Mark; Thigpen, Brynna; Llerena, Christopher; Tran, Minh; Surabhi, Divya Meher; Smith, Emilia D; Remus, Rosemary G; Staszcuk, Roweine; Figueroa, Evelyn; Leo, Paul; Detmer, Wayne M; Lyon, Evan; Carreon, Sarah; Hoferka, Stacey; Ritger, Kathleen A; Jasmin, Wilnise; Nagireddy, Prathima; Seo, Jennifer Y; Fricchione, Marielle J; Kerins, Janna L; Black, Stephanie R; Butler, Lisa Morrison; Howard, Kimberly; McCauley, Maura; Fraley, Todd; Arwady, M Allison; Gretsch, Stephanie; Cunningham, Megan",Open Forum Infect Dis,108,20

Whether adults with obesity can achieve weight loss with once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg as an adjunct to lifestyle intervention has not been confirmed. METHODS: In this double-blind trial, we enrolled 1961 adults with a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 or greater (&#8805;27 in persons with &#8805;1 weight-related coexisting condition), who did not have diabetes, and randomly assigned them, in a 2:1 ratio, to 68 weeks of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (at a dose of 2.4 mg) or placebo, plus lifestyle intervention. The coprimary end points were the percentage change in body weight and weight reduction of at least 5%. The primary estimand (a precise description of the treatment effect reflecting the objective of the clinical trial) assessed effects regardless of treatment discontinuation or rescue interventions. RESULTS: The mean change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -14.9% in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.4% with placebo, for an estimated treatment difference of -12.4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -11.5; P<0.001). More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group achieved weight reductions of 5% or more (1047 participants [86.4%] vs. 182 [31.5%]), 10% or more (838 [69.1%] vs. 69 [12.0%]), and 15% or more (612 [50.5%] vs. 28 [4.9%]) at week 68 (P<0.001 for all three comparisons of odds). The change in body weight from baseline to week 68 was -15.3 kg in the semaglutide group as compared with -2.6 kg in the placebo group (estimated treatment difference, -12.7 kg; 95% CI, -13.7 to -11.7). Participants who received semaglutide had a greater improvement with respect to cardiometabolic risk factors and a greater increase in participant-reported physical functioning from baseline than those who received placebo. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common adverse events with semaglutide; they were typically transient and mild-to-moderate in severity and subsided with time. More participants in the semaglutide group than in the placebo group discontinued treatment owing to gastrointestinal events (59 [4.5%] vs. 5 [0.8%]). CONCLUSIONS: In participants with overweight or obesity, 2.4 mg of semaglutide once weekly plus lifestyle intervention was associated with sustained, clinically relevant reduction in body weight.

AIMS: This study aims to identify key factors related to psychological distress resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic across highly vulnerable districts in Guatemala. METHODS: The Covid Care Calls (CCC) survey was administered to households in 11 districts in Guatemala to gather information about medical, mental health, and psychosocial status during the lockdown period; provide referral for care; and disseminate information on evidence-based protective measures to stem the spread of the virus. The 330 individuals participated the survey. Conventional content analysis was used to analyze survey data. RESULTS: Most commonly reported mental health issues since the start of the pandemic were anxiety (46%), stress (36%), and exacerbation of pre-Covid-19 mental health conditions (19%). Depression and burnout were equally reported by 12% of participants. Only 2% reported issues with safety in the home. Concerns about catching the virus and economic worries were the most commonly reported sources of psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Results of this study indicate a high prevalence of anxiety, stress, and increased prior mental health symptoms resulting from the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in low-income, high-risk communities across Guatemala.

Methods: The study included 30 Covid-19 patients using L-Glutamine and 30 Covid-19 patients who did not use L-Glutamine with similar age, gender and clinical status. Diagnostic tests, laboratory examinations, clinical findings and computed thorax tomography imaging of the patients were evaluated. Results: Hospitalization time was 10.4 ± 1.9 days in Covid-19 without L-Glutamine group and 8.9 ± 1.8 days in Covid-19 with L-Glutamine group (p = 0.005). In Covid-19 without the L-Glutamine group, four patients require the ICU though no one in the other group required that (p = 0.038). Only one mortality was observed in Covid-19 without the L-Glutamine group (p = 0.999). Conclusions: Nutritional supplements such as L-Glutamine boost immune system especially by inhibition of inflammatory responses. Our results suggest adding enteral L-glutamine to the normal nutrition in the early period of Covid-19 infection may lead to a shortened hospital stay and lead to less need for ICU. Larger-scale studies are needed to evaluate the effect of adding enteral L-Glutamine to the currently used treatments in the infectious diseases especially like Covid-19.","Cengiz, Mahir; Borku Uysal, Betul; Ikitimur, Hande; Ozcan, Erkan; Islamoğlu, Mehmet Sami; Aktepe, Emre; Yavuzer, Hakan; Yavuzer, Serap",Clin.

Residential water consumption data, obtained through telemetry in two periods (before and after a governmental action imposing quarantine and social isolation), were analyzed. Complementarily, the analyses were also applied to the commercial, industrial and public consumption categories. For the analysis, Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric tests were applied and Prais-Winsten regression models were adjusted. The results of the Wilcoxon test show that there are significant differences between the analyzed periods, indicating a water consumption drop in the commercial, industrial and public categories, and an increase in the residential category. The regression model results confirm the effect of the restrictive actions in reducing consumption in non-residential categories. The results also indicate an increase in water consumption, which was steeper in apartment buildings than in houses, whether isolated or grouped in condominiums. A weak association was found between the variation in water consumption and the spatial distribution of buildings. Understanding water consumption related aspects is important to gather essential information to ensure the urban water supply system is resilient in a pandemic situation.","Kalbusch, Andreza; Henning, Elisa; Brikalski, Miqueias Paulo; Luca, Felipe Vieira de; Konrath, Andrea Cristina",Resour.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of ACEI/ARB on COVID-19 disease severity and mortality through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched PubMed and CINAHL databases as well as pre-print servers for studies investigating usage of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with COVID-19 compared to a control group of COVID-19 patients without ACEI/ARB use. COVID-19 related severity of disease, and death were identified as end points. Pooled odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects model. RESULTS: 21 studies were included in the meta-analysis. For mortality with ACEI/ARB use, the pooled odds ratio was 1.29 [0.89-1.87] p = 0.18 with heterogeneity of 91%, while the pooled OR for COVID-19 severity was 0.94 [0.59-1.50] p = 0.81 with heterogeneity of 89% (Figure 2). In combining both mortality and severe disease outcomes, the pooled odds ratio was 1.09 [0.80-1.48] p = 0.58 but with heterogeneity of 92%. EXPERT OPINION: Even on pooled analysis of both un-adjusted data, adjusted data(studies with matched controls) and taking into account factors such as risk of bias of studies via meta regression and sensitivity analyses, the results hold true that ACEI/ARB use is not associated with COVID-19 disease severity or mortality. To look for any potential beneficial effects, randomized controlled trials are needed. CONCLUSION: use of ACEI/ARB was not associated with increased mortality or severe COVID-19.","Lo, Kevin Bryan; Bhargav, Ruchika; Salacup, Grace; Pelayo, Jerald; Albano, Jeri; McCullough, Peter A; Rangaswami, Janani",Expert Rev Cardiovasc Ther,108,23

Design/methodology/approach: A netnographic approach was employed which involved collecting online posts and comments which were stored and analysed in NVivo. This was supplemented with field notes and reflections from authors with an intimate knowledge of the context. These were analysed thematically. The overall methodology is inspired by decolonising methodologies that seek to restore the agency of Indigenous Peoples in research towards self-determination. Findings: Findings suggest that during and beyond the crisis, social media (a new means) is being used to facilitate barter and determinations of/accounting for value within. This is being done through constant appeals to, and adaptation of, tradition (old ways). Indigenous accounting is therefore best understood as so through Indigenous accountability values and practices. Originality/value: This paper propose a re-orientation of accounting for barter research that incorporates recent debates between the disciplines of economics and anthropology on the nature of barter, debt and exchange. The authors also propose a re-imagining of accounting and accountability relations based on Indigenous values within an emerging online barter system in Fiji during COVID-19 as “old ways and new means” to privilege Indigenous agency and overcome excessive essentialism. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Finau, G.; Scobie, M.","Accounting, Auditing and Accountability Journal",108,20

Aside from using the number of confirmed cases and the fatality to measure the impact caused by COVID-19, few adopted the inflection point (IP) to represent the control capability of COVID-19. How to determine the IP days related to the capability is still unclear. This study aims to (i) build a predictive model based on item response theory (IRT) to determine the IP for countries, and (ii) compare which countries (or continents) are hit most. METHODS: We downloaded COVID-19 outbreak data of the number of confirmed cases in all countries as of October 19, 2020. The IRT-based predictive model was built to determine the pandemic IP for each country. A model building scheme was demonstrated to fit the number of cumulative infected cases. Model parameters were estimated using the Solver add-in tool in Microsoft Excel. The absolute advantage coefficient (AAC) was computed to track the IP at the minimum of incremental points on a given ogive curve. The time-to-event analysis (a.k.a. survival analysis) was performed to compare the difference in IPs among continents using the area under the curve (AUC) and the respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). An online comparative dashboard was created on Google Maps to present the epidemic prediction for each country. RESULTS: The top 3 countries that were hit severely by COVID-19 were France, Malaysia, and Nepal, with IP days at 263, 262, and 262, respectively. The top 3 continents that were hit most based on IP days were Europe, South America, and North America, with their AUCs and 95% CIs at 0.73 (0.61-0.86), 0.58 (0.31-0.84), and 0.54 (0.44-0.64), respectively. An online time-event result was demonstrated and shown on Google Maps, comparing the IP probabilities across continents. CONCLUSION: An IRT modeling scheme fitting the epidemic data was used to predict the length of IP days. Europe, particularly France, was hit seriously by COVID-19 based on the IP days. The IRT model incorporated with AAC is recommended to determine the pandemic IP.","Lee, Keng-Wei; Chien, Tsair-Wei; Yeh, Yu-Tsen; Chou, Willy; Wang, Hsien-Yi",Medicine (Baltimore),108,16

Here, we report an antiviral necroptosis-based genetic screen to identify novel host cell factors required for infection with the ß-herpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Our genome-wide CRISPR-based screen harnessed the capacity of herpesvirus mutants that trigger antiviral necroptotic cell death upon early viral gene expression. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and semaphorin-binding receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp-1) emerge as crucial determinants of MCMV infection. We find that elimination of Nrp-1 impairs early viral gene expression and reduces infection rates in endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages. Furthermore, preincubation of virus with soluble Nrp-1 dramatically inhibits infection by reducing virus attachment. Thus, Nrp-1 is a key determinant of the initial phase of MCMV infection.","Lane, Rebecca K; Guo, Hongyan; Fisher, Amanda D; Diep, Jonathan; Lai, Zhao; Chen, Yidong; Upton, Jason W; Carette, Jan; Mocarski, Edward S; Kaiser, William J",Proc.

This study aimed to investigate the preoperative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in elective and emergency surgery and to calculate the patient contacts during hospital stay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All surgeries defined by the German procedural classification (starting with a 5) from 1 June until 29 November 2020 were retrospectively evaluated regarding the preoperative SARS-CoV­2 nasopharyngeal swab test. The results were then divided in emergency and elective surgeries. To show the personal contacts of the patients in a university hospital, we calculated the patient pathway within the department of urology and urosurgery for April 2020. Therefor we used the electronic patient records. RESULTS: Altogether 7745 surgical procedures in 5985 patients were performed, whereby 39 (0.5%) SARS-CoV­2 tests were positive. 2833 (37%) surgical procedures were emergency cases and 4912 (63%) were elective procedures. 25 (0.9%) of the emergency group and 14 (0.3%) of the elective surgeries had a positive SARS-CoV­2 test. The average number of contacts in the patient room was 12.83 (0-50) and 84.22 (0-249) at the ward level, not counting contacts with the clinic staff. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1% of the preoperative SARS-CoV­2 tests of either emergency or elective surgeries tested positive in the 6 months prior to November 2020. Although the risk of undetected SARS-CoV­2 infection appears to be low in terms of costs and personnel, preoperative screening is useful in high-risk areas to ensure further necessary surgeries, especially concerning cancer patients and to prevent virus spread in a hospital.","Rassweiler-Seyfried, M-C; Miethke, T; Becker, K-P; Siegel, F",Urologe A,108,20

Here, we explore the use of CR3022 as a molecularly targeted radiotherapeutic. Methods: CR3022 was labeled with Iodine-131 using the Iodogen-method and purified, yielding 131I-CR3022. Using a magnetic bead assay and a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein fragment, we tested binding of 131I-CR3022 in the presence and absence of CR3022. Results: We conjugated the antibody CR3022 with a purity > 98% and a molar activity >7.9 mCi/mg. Using a bead-based assay, we confirmed that binding of 131I-CR3022 is selective, and is significantly reduced in the presence of unlabeled antibody (3.14 ± 0.14 specific uptake and 0.10 ± 0.01 specific uptake, respectively; P < 0.0001). Conclusion: Our results confirm the potential of CR3022 as a molecularly targeted probe for SARS-CoV-2.

Majorly associated genetic variants are found in human leukocyte antigen (HLA), angiotensin convertase enzyme (ACE; rs1799752: ACE2; rs73635825), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS-2; rs12329760) genes. Identifying highly prone population having these variants is imperative for determining COVID-19 therapeutic strategy. Ayurveda (Indian traditional system of medicine) concept of Prakriti holds potential to predict genomic and phenotypic variations. Reported work on Prakriti correlates HLA-DR alleles with three broad phenotypes (Tridosha) described in Ayurveda (AyuGenomics). This is suggestive of differences in immune responses in individuals with specific constitutions. Therefore, the reported studies provide clues for clinically relevant hypotheses to be tested in systematic studies. The proposed approach of Ayurveda based phenotype screening may offer a way ahead to design customized strategies for management of COVID-19 based on differences in Prakriti, immune response and drug response. However, this needs clinical evaluation of the relation between Prakriti and genetic or phenotypic variants in COVID-19 prone and resistant populations.","Bhat, Vedika; Borse, Swapnil; Chavan-Gautam, Preeti; Joshi, Kalpana",,108,24

The standard avoidance techniques estimate the locations of obstacles with respect to the robot but are unaware of the obstacles' identities. Consequently, the robot cannot take advantage of semantic information about obstacles when making decisions about how to navigate. We propose an obstacle avoidance module that combines visual instance segmentation with a depth map to classify and localize objects in the scene. The system avoids obstacles differentially, based on the identity of the objects: for example, the system is more cautious in response to unpredictable objects such as humans. The system can also navigate closer to harmless obstacles and ignore obstacles that pose no collision danger, enabling it to navigate more efficiently. We validate our approach in two simulated environments: one terrestrial and one underwater. Results indicate that our approach is feasible and can enable more efficient navigation strategies.","Hong, Jungseok; Langis, Karin de; Wyeth, Cole; Walaszek, Christopher; Sattar, Junaed",,108,24

Para maximizar a chance de sucesso, algumas estratégias para o lançamento de novo produto podem ser aplicadas, como a prospecção de mercado e os testes de palatabilidade (preferência e aceitabilidade). O presente trabalho teve como objetivo realizar estudo exploratório sobre o mercado de petiscos para gatos, desenvolver e testar dois biscoitos (um à base de farinha de trigo e outro à base de carne) com alta fibra para gatos através dos testes de aceitabilidade e preferência. Para isso, foi realizado uma prospecção de mercado, questionário foi aplicado (utilizando-se a mídia digital como veículo) em busca do perfil dos tutores, o perfil dos gatos e a opinião sobre petiscos para seus animais. Foram confeccionados dois tipos de biscoitos, um à base de farinha de trigo (acrescido de palatabilizante) e outro à base de carne. Para o teste de aceitabilidade e de preferência foram utilizados 32 gatos adultos, alocados em gaiolas metabólicas, por um período experimental de cinco dias consecutivos. No teste de aceitabilidade, os produtos foram fornecidos individualmente por três minutos, e no teste de preferência os produtos foram fornecidos simultaneamente, durante três minutos. O teste de prospecção de mercado obteve 127 respostas, distribuídas em 11 estados brasileiros, com predominância dos tutores do sexo feminino, de escolaridade de nível superior, poder aquisitivo médio e que consomem produtos com características funcionais. Em relação aos gatos, a maioria convivia com outros animais (maioria cães), foram adotados e não tinham raça definida (SRD). Com relação aos tutores, 60% compravam petiscos para seus gatos, e utilizavam como critério para compra a sequência, indicação veterinária, marca, preço, facilidade para encontrar, condição financeira. Os tutores estavam dispostos a experimentar novos produtos, desde que, sejam saudáveis. No teste de aceitabilidade, não houve diferença (P>0,05) entre o consumo dos biscoitos, sendo que 58,19% dos gatos consumiram o biscoito à base de carne e 59,32% consumiram o biscoito à base de farinha de trigo. No teste de preferência, não foi observado efeito (P>0,05) para a primeira escolha, sendo que a frequência de escolha de ambos foi de 59,05%. O mercado de alimentos para gatos é receptivo a novos produtos com apelo de funcionalidade, desde que apresente preço convidativo, de fácil acesso e seja aceito pelo gato.

Worldwide mandates to slow down the spread of the disease resulted in significant reductions in travel. This study analyzes the changes in individuals' travel outcomes and their risk perceptions related to exposure and specific travel modes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We use data collected through an online survey with residents of Columbus, OH from April 30 to May 7, 2020. Employing multiple generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a logit link function, we analyze the perceived risk of infection while traveling with different modes controlling for socio-demographics. The findings show that on average individuals are more likely to find shared modes (i.e., transit, ride-hailing, carsharing) riskier as compared to individual ones (i.e., walking, autos) when it comes to COVID-19 exposure. This study also suggests that the associations between perceptions related to exposure and various travel modes vary across groups with (1) different primary mode preferences (auto users vs non-auto users (e.g., transit users, bicyclists, etc.)), and (2) different socio-demographics. For example, auto users are more likely to find shared modes such as ride-hailing or transit riskier as compared to personal car. The conclusions present recommendations for future transportation policies in the post-COVID era. These include building upon the emerging positive perceptions towards non-motorized modes as an opportunity to promote sustainable transportation as well as formulating viable solutions to address the high-risk perceptions associated with transit.","Ozbilen, Basar; Slagle, Kristina M; Akar, Gulsah",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,108,16

AIMS: To describe the evolution of liver involvement during SARS-CoV-2 infection and its effect on clinical course and mortality. METHODS: Data of 515 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were collected at baseline and during follow-up, last evaluation or death. Stratification based on need for hospitalisation, severe disease and admission to intensive care unit (ICU) was performed. The association between liver test abnormalities (baseline and peak values) and ICU admission or death was also explored. RESULTS: Liver test abnormalities were found in 161 (31.3%) patients. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) were increased in 20.4%, 19% and 13.6% of patients, respectively. Baseline liver test abnormalities were associated with increased risk of ICU admission (OR 2.19 [95% CI 1.24-3.89], P = 0.007) but not with mortality (OR 0.84 [95% CI 0.49-1.41], P = 0.51). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) peak values were correlated with risk of death (OR 1.007 [95% CI 1.002-1.01], P = 0.005) along with age, multiple comorbidities, acute respiratory distress syndrome , ICU admission and C-reactive protein. Alterations of liver test worsened within 15 days of hospitalisation; however, in patients with the longest median follow-up, the prevalence of liver test alterations decreased over time, returning to around baseline levels. CONCLUSIONS: In SARS-CoV-2-positive patients without pre-existing severe chronic liver disease, baseline liver test abnormalities are associated with the risk of ICU admission and tend to normalise over time. ALP peak value may be predictive of a worse prognosis.","Ponziani, Francesca Romana; Del Zompo, Fabio; Nesci, Antonio; Santopaolo, Francesco; Ianiro, Gianluca; Pompili, Maurizio; Gasbarrini, Antonio",Aliment. pharmacol. ther,108,16

Given prior quality concerns about antibiotic management for children during telemedicine visits outside of primary care, we sought to examine acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) visit volume and antibiotic management for children via telemedicine integrated within pediatric primary care. METHODS: Using electronic health record data from 47 practices within a large pediatric primary care network, we identified visits for ARTI from April to September 2020. For these visits, we categorized antibiotic management consistent with clinical guidelines as guideline concordant. We compared telemedicine and in-person visit guideline-concordant antibiotic management, diagnoses, and antibiotic prescribing using chi-square tests and examined trends over time using descriptive statistics. Antibiotic stewardship during the study period included learning collaborative videoconferences and sharing of clinic and clinician-level metrics through an interactive dashboard. RESULTS: During the 6-month period, 8332 ARTI visits were identified, with 3003 (36%) via telemedicine. Guideline-concordant antibiotic management occurred in 92.5% of telemedicine visits compared to 90.7% of in-person office visits (P = .004). Telemedicine ARTI visits receiving diagnoses of acute otitis media or streptococcal pharyngitis declined from peak of 52% (May) to 7% (September). Guideline-concordant antibiotic management of sinusitis and viral ARTI during telemedicine visits increased from 88% (April) to 97% (September). CONCLUSION: With active antibiotic stewardship, pediatricians practicing within certified medical homes consistently delivered highly guideline-concordant care for ARTIs to their patient population via telemedicine integrated into primary care.","Ray, Kristin N; Martin, Judith M; Wolfson, David; Schweiberger, Kelsey; Schoemer, Pam; Cepullio, Christine; Iagnemma, Jennifer; Hoberman, Alejandro",,108,10

So far, chemotherapy has not been totally effective for treatment of the disease. The immunomodulation and tissue repairing capability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), ease of isolation, detection and in-vitro culture, have encouraged the biologists to use MSCs for cell therapy in different infections such as cutaneous leishmaniasis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6-8 week BALB/c mice were infected with L. major and divided into four groups and treated with MSCs, Glucantime, Glucantime + MSCs and PBS. The regression of the lesions, potency of macrophages for phagocytosis, proliferation of immune cells against Leishmania soluble antigen, reduction of spleen parasite burden and healing of the lesions were evaluated on days 10, 20 and 30 of treatment. RESULT: The results indicated that the mice intralesionally injected with MSCs showed a significant regression in the lesions produced by L. major by day 30. Proliferation of the splenocytes stimulated with SLA (Soluble Leishmania Antigen) in-vitro in MSC treated mice on day 20 was significantly higher than those of the other groups. The potency of phagocytosis in macrophages of the mice treated with MSCs was significantly higher by day 30 and healing of the lesions in this group of mice showed more progress in histopathological examinations. Spleen parasite burden showed significant reduction in the mice treated with Glucantime + MSCs by day 30. CONCLUSION: The results showed that using MSCs in treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. major is a promising approach for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","Navard, Sahar Hamoon; Rezvan, Hossein; Feiz Haddad, Mohammad Hossein; Ali, S A; Nourian, Alireza; Eslaminejad, Mohamadreza Baghaban; Behmanesh, Mohammad Amin",J.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the main and interactive relationships of social support and resilience on individual mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic across three age groups: emerging adults, adults, and older adults. METHODS: A survey was conducted with 23,192 participants aged 18-85. Respondents completed a questionnaire, including items on the COVID-19-related support they perceived from different sources, the abbreviated version of the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and the Mental Health Inventory. RESULTS: Latent profile analysis identified five profiles of social support, and the patterns of potential profiles were similar in all groups. However, category distribution in the five profiles was significantly different among the age groups. Furthermore, analysis using the BCH command showed significant differences in mental health among these profiles. Lastly, interactive analyses indicated resilience had a positive relationship with mental health, and social support served as a buffer against the negative impact of low resilience on mental health. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides quantitative evidence for socioemotional selectivity theory (SST) and enables several practical implications for helping different age groups protecting mental health during pandemic.","Li, Fugui; Luo, Sihui; Mu, Weiqi; Li, Yanmei; Ye, Liyuan; Zheng, Xueying; Xu, Bing; Ding, Yu; Ling, Ping; Zhou, Mingjie; Chen, Xuefeng",BMC Psychiatry,108,16

In case of the QIAstat-Dx SARS-CoV-2 Panel, 99.11% of the genomes matched with a 100% coverage all oligonucleotides, and critical variations were tested in vitro corroborating no loss of sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis stresses the importance of targeting more than one region in the viral genome for SARS-CoV-2 detection to mitigate the risk of loss of sensitivity due to the unknown mutation rate during this SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.","Peñarrubia, Luis; Ruiz, Maria; Porco, Roberto; Rao, Sonia N; Juanola-Falgarona, Martí; Manissero, Davide; López-Fontanals, Marta; Pareja, Josep",Int J Infect Dis,108,16

We report a case of 34-year-old man who was diagnosed as negative for COVID-19 based on the four sequential RT-PCR tests of his pharyngeal swab. Chest CT showed patchy ground-glass opacity on admission, and it rapidly progressed to segmental mixed consolidation and ground-glass opacity 3 days after admission, and it resolved in left upper lobe, but showed multifocal ground-glass opacities 7 days after admission, and they resolved within 2 weeks. The fifth RT-PCR test finally revealed positive results at the fifth day after admission. It is difficult to distinguish COVID-19 pneumonia from other viral pneumonia on CT findings alone; however, we emphasize the utility of chest CT to detect early change of COVID-19 in cases which RT-PCR tests show negative results.","Feng, Hao; Liu, Yujian; Lv, Minli; Zhong, Jianquan",Jpn J Radiol,108,24

This study focuses on their psychological status, and analyzes the main factors affecting their emotions of pregnant women so as to provide guidance for psychological counseling and social intervention during epidemics. METHODS: Multiple researchers distributed a questionnaire online via the Internet. Pregnant women volunteered, and the questionnaire was automatically collected in the background. RESULTS: The 298 valid questionnaires recovered showed that 82 cases of pregnant women were in states of anxiety, accounting for 27.51%, of which 78.05% were mild (82 cases), 19.51% were moderate (16 cases), and 2.44% were severe (2 cases). Moreover, 31.21% of pregnant women were in states of depression (93 cases), of which 52.69% were mild (49 cases), 40.86% were moderate (38 cases), and 6.45% were severe (6 cases). The risk factors for states of anxiety or depression were fear of fetal malformation or genetic disease, history of adverse pregnancy, can't do routine prenatal examination, and insufficient support and care from husbands and families. Besides, 16 cases had sought psychological help during the epidemic, among whom 62.50% (10 cases) experienced anxiety, 68.75% (11 cases) had depression. CONCLUSIONS: During the outbreak of COVID-19, obstetricians may take use of the Internet, based on the advantages in epidemic prevention, controlling health education, and popularizing science. In addition, husbands and family members should provide greater care for pregnant women, to protect their mental health during public health incidents.","Cao, Yuming; Liu, Juan; Zhang, Yuanzhen; Li, Yating; Chen, Zhenlie; Lu, Jing",J. perinat. med,108,24

BACKGROUND: COVID-19 has spread globally, causing an unprecedentedly large number of casualties. Nurses face challenges in dealing with patients with COVID-19 with limited information about the pathogen. DESIGN: This qualitative study followed the COREQ guidelines. METHODS: Fifteen nurses were recruited from two university hospitals in South Korea using a snowballing technique for in-depth interviews in May 2020. All interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was performed on the interview data. RESULTS: Two themes emerged: access to COVID-19 information and the impact of information on nursing care. The categories of access to COVID-19 information were lack of nursing-specific information, limited information cascading from top management and confusion due to varying points of view. The categories of the impact of information on nursing care were unprepared management that aggravates exhaustion, lack of personal protective equipment that creates anxiety and being a nurse leader to overcome the pandemic. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic of emerging infectious diseases, nurses should have access to up-to-date information tailored to their working environment. Human resources, material resources and systematic support are needed for nurses who provide care for patients with an infectious disease. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: A collaborative interprofessional education system for emerging infectious diseases is needed for effective communication and consistent care during a pandemic. Nurse leaders should be prepared to deliver profession-specific information for standardised care and respond to nursing management needs by using resources and tailoring the workforce.","Cha, Chiyoung; Park, Suhyun",J. clin. nurs,108,16

Governmental measures to reduce physical contact range from the closing of public facilities and schools to restrictions on mobility, lockdowns, quarantines, and curfews. These extreme measures though necessary, should be used as last resources, due to the their economical and personal negative impacts. Of great help in these situations are the physical and psychological benefits of physical exercises, walking included[1, 2]. On the other hand, physical contact and proximity should be avoid to reduce the spread of pathogens such as Covid-19[3]. This paper studies how organizing the traffic of pedestrians affects the number of walking or running people passing by each other. One example is the traffic of pedestrians on sidewalks. Another is the use of walking or running tracks in parks. As it will be demonstrated, the number of people crossing each other can be drastically reduced if one-way traffic is enforced and runners are separated from walkers.","Mello, Bernardo A.",,108,16

This exposes them to a higher risk of developing chronic stress, psychological distress, and any other mental health symptoms. OBJECTIVE: to evaluate stress and burnout in a health workers population and, in addition, to measure hair cortisol concentration as a current biomarker of stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 234 health workers from Hospital de Clínicas ""José de San Martín"", Buenos Aires University, were included in this study. In this population hair samples were obtained from the posterior vertex as close to the scalp as possible and the individuals completed the following surveys: perceived stress, social support, burnout scale, life event scale, and sociodemographic data. Hair cortisol was measured by an automated chemiluminescent method. The studied population was divided into three groups considering those individuals below the healthy reference sample range (< 40 pg/mg hair), within the healthy reference range (40-128 pg/mg hair) and above the reference range (> 128 pg/mg hair). This study used a transversal and observational design. RESULTS: Our results show that 40% of the studied population presented hair cortisol values outside of the healthy reference range. In the whole studied population, a direct correlation was found between hair cortisol concentration and perceived stress as well as between hair cortisol concentration and the emotional exhaustion component of burnout (r = 0.142, p = 0.030; r = 0.143, p = 0.029, respectively). 12% of the studied population showed Burnout (52% doctors and residents, 19% nurses, 19% administrative personnel). Higher values in hair cortisol levels were found in the group with burnout versus individuals without burnout (p = 0.034). Finally, a mediation analysis was performed, finding that depersonalization is a mediating variable in the relationship between self-perceived stress and hair cortisol level (F = 4.86, p = 0.0086; indirect effect IC: 0.0987-1.8840). CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which a stress biomarker such as hair cortisol is evaluated in this population and in this context. Healthcare workers are subjected to increased levels of stress and burnout. High depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and decreased personal sense of accomplishment characterize this population. It is the responsibility of the health authorities to implement strategies to manage this psychological emergency.","Ibar, Carolina; Fortuna, Federico; Gonzalez, Diego; Jamardo, Juan; Jacobsen, Dario; Pugliese, Lucas; Giraudo, Laura; Ceres, Veronica; Mendoza, Cynthia; Repetto, Esteban M; Reboredo, Graciela; Iglesias, Silvia; Azzara, Sergio; Berg, Gabriela; Zopatti, Damian; Fabre, Bibiana",Psychoneuroendocrinology,108,6

The study included 50 patients who were randomly assigned to the dexamethasone group or control group. Dexamethasone was administered at a dose of 20 mg/day from day 1-5 and then at 10 mg/day from day 6-10. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation, death rate, duration of clinical improvement, length of hospital stay, and radiological changes in the computed tomography scan were assessed. The results revealed that 92% and 96% of patients in the dexamethasone and control groups, respectively, required noninvasive ventilation (P = 0.500). Among them, 52% and 44% of patients in the dexamethasone and control groups, respectively, required invasive mechanical ventilation (P = 0.389). At the end of the study, 64% of patients in the dexamethasone group and 60% of patients in the control group died (P = 0.500); the remaining patients were discharged from the hospital during the 28-day follow-up period.

This article critically evaluates the existing research on e-learning in plastic surgery. METHODS: A systematic review of e-learning in plastic surgery was conducted using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase databases. Studies were limited to those written in English and published after 1995 and excluded short communications, letters to the editor, and articles focused on in-person simulation. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were identified. Represented subspecialties include breast, burns, craniofacial/pediatrics, hand, and microsurgery. Most e-learning resources target surgeons and trainees, but a small number are for patients, parents, and referring physicians. Users reported high levels of satisfaction with e-learning and significant gains in knowledge after completion, although there may be more variable satisfaction with teaching technical skills. Two studies showed no differences in knowledge gains from e-learning compared with traditional learning methods. Subgroup analysis showed greater benefit of e-learning for novice learners when evaluated. Surveys of plastic surgeons and trainees showed high interest in and growing utilization of e-learning. CONCLUSIONS: Research in plastic surgery e-learning shows high user satisfaction and overall improvements in learning outcomes with knowledge gains equivalent to traditional teaching methods and greater benefit in novice learners. Thus, e-learning can serve an important role in plastic surgery education, especially in the current state of social distancing. Future work should aim to define learner preferences and educational needs and better establish how e-learning can augment plastic surgical education, particularly among other teaching methods.","Lin, Ines C; Lee, Alfred; Mauch, Jaclyn T",Ann Plast Surg,108,30

Studies to date are largely surveys and lack meaningful involvement from service users in their design, planning, and delivery. The study aimed to examine the mental health status and coping strategies of young people during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown using coproduction methodology. METHODS: The mental health status of young people (aged 16-24) in April 2020 was established utilizing a sequential explanatory coproduced mixed methods design. Factors associated with poor mental health status, including coping strategies, were also examined using an online survey and semi-structured interviews. RESULTS: Since the lockdown, 30.3% had poor mental health, and 10.8% had self-harmed. Young people identifying as Black/Black-British ethnicity had the highest increased odds of experiencing poor mental health (odds ratio [OR] 3.688, 95% CI .54-25.40). Behavioral disengagement (OR 1.462, 95% CI 1.22-1.76), self-blame (OR 1.307 95% CI 1.10-1.55), and substance use (OR 1.211 95% CI 1.02-1.44) coping strategies, negative affect (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.07-1.15), sleep problems (OR .915 95% CI .88-.95) and conscientiousness personality trait (OR .819 95% CI .69-.98) were significantly associated with poor mental health. Three qualitative themes were identified: (1) pre-existing/developed helpful coping strategies employed, (2) mental health difficulties worsened, and (3) mental health and nonmental health support needed during and after lockdown. CONCLUSION: Poor mental health is associated with dysfunctional coping strategies. Innovative coping strategies can help other young people cope during and after lockdowns, with digital and school promotion and application.","Dewa, Lindsay H; Crandell, Caroline; Choong, Elizabeth; Jaques, Jack; Bottle, Alex; Kilkenny, Catherine; Lawrence-Jones, Anna; Di Simplicio, Martina; Nicholls, Dasha; Aylin, Paul",J Adolesc Health,108,26

Several viruses, including coronaviruses (CoVs), take advantage of cellular autophagy to facilitate their own replication. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a beta-coronavirus (ß-CoVs) that mediates its replication through a dependent or independent ATG5 pathway using specific double-membrane vesicles that can be considered as similar to autophagosomes. With due attention to several mutations in NSP6, a nonstructural protein with a positive regulatory effect on autophagosome formation, a potential correlation between SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis mechanisms and autophagy can be expected. Certain medications, albeit limited in number, have been indicated to negatively regulate autophagy flux, potentially in a way similar to the inhibitory effect of ß-CoVs on the process of autophagy. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support their direct antagonizing effect on CoVs. Off-target accumulation of a major fraction of FDA-approved autophagy modulating drugs may result in adverse effects. Therefore, medications that have modulatory effects on autophagy could be considered as potential lead compounds for the development of new treatments against this virus. This review discusses the role of autophagy/virophagy in controlling SARS-CoV-2, focusing on the potential therapeutic implications.","Sargazi, Saman; Sheervalilou, Roghayeh; Rokni, Mohsen; Shirvaliloo, Milad; Shahraki, Omolbanin; Rezaei, Nima",Cell Biol Int,108,1

In particular, it analyzes how resource factors moderate the impact of health beliefs on preventive behavior. A regression analysis showed that gender (female), age, number of elderly people in one's family, perceived severity, perceived benefit, self-efficacy, poor family health, media exposure, knowledge, personal health status, and social support positively affected preventive actions, whereas perceived susceptibility negatively affected them. In explaining preventive actions, self-efficacy had the greatest explanatory power, followed by gender (female), knowledge, personal health status, perceived severity, and social support.

The relative importance of vaccination strategies and nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) is not well understood. Objective: To assess the association of simulated COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and coverage scenarios with and without NPIs with infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Design, Setting, and Participants: An established agent-based decision analytical model was used to simulate COVID-19 transmission and progression from March 24, 2020, to September 23, 2021. The model simulated COVID-19 spread in North Carolina, a US state of 10.5 million people. A network of 1â¯017â¯720 agents was constructed from US Census data to represent the statewide population. Exposures: Scenarios of vaccine efficacy (50% and 90%), vaccine coverage (25%, 50%, and 75% at the end of a 6-month distribution period), and NPIs (reduced mobility, school closings, and use of face masks) maintained and removed during vaccine distribution. Main Outcomes and Measures: Risks of infection from the start of vaccine distribution and risk differences comparing scenarios. Outcome means and SDs were calculated across replications. Results: In the worst-case vaccination scenario (50% efficacy, 25% coverage), a mean (SD) of 2â¯231â¯134 (117â¯867) new infections occurred after vaccination began with NPIs removed, and a mean (SD) of 799â¯949 (60â¯279) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained during 11 months. In contrast, in the best-case scenario (90% efficacy, 75% coverage), a mean (SD) of 527â¯409 (40â¯637) new infections occurred with NPIs removed and a mean (SD) of 450â¯575 (32â¯716) new infections occurred with NPIs maintained. With NPIs removed, lower efficacy (50%) and higher coverage (75%) reduced infection risk by a greater magnitude than higher efficacy (90%) and lower coverage (25%) compared with the worst-case scenario (mean [SD] absolute risk reduction, 13% [1%] and 8% [1%], respectively). Conclusions and Relevance: Simulation outcomes suggest that removing NPIs while vaccines are distributed may result in substantial increases in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. Furthermore, as NPIs are removed, higher vaccination coverage with less efficacious vaccines can contribute to a larger reduction in risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with more efficacious vaccines at lower coverage. These findings highlight the need for well-resourced and coordinated efforts to achieve high vaccine coverage and continued adherence to NPIs before many prepandemic activities can be resumed.","Patel, Mehul D; Rosenstrom, Erik; Ivy, Julie S; Mayorga, Maria E; Keskinocak, Pinar; Boyce, Ross M; Hassmiller Lich, Kristen; Smith, Raymond L; Johnson, Karl T; Delamater, Paul L; Swann, Julie L",JAMA Netw Open,108,1

Many patients with this infection have an asymptomatic or mild illness, but a small percentage of patients require hospitalization and intensive care. Patients with respiratory tract involvement have a spectrum of presentations that range from scattered ground-glass infiltrates to diffuse infiltrates with consolidation. Patients with the latter radiographic presentation have severe hypoxemia and usually require mechanical ventilation. In addition, some patients develop multiorgan failure, deep venous thrombi with pulmonary emboli, and cytokine storm syndrome. The respiratory management of these patients should focus on using low tidal volume ventilation with low intrathoracic pressures. Some patients have significant recruitable lung and may benefit from higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels and/or prone positioning. There is no well-established anti-viral treatment for this infection; the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has provided emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma and remdesivir for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. In addition, randomized trials have demonstrated that dexamethasone improves outcomes in patients on mechanical ventilators or on oxygen. There are ongoing trials of other drugs which have the potential to moderate the acute inflammatory state seen in some of these patients. These patients often need prolonged high-level intensive care.

Since these interventions applied at the societal level cannot be evaluated through traditional experimental means, public health officials and other decision makers must rely on statistical and mathematical epidemiological models. Nonpharmaceutical interventions are typically focused on contacts between members of a population, and yet most epidemiological models rely on homogeneous mixing which has repeatedly been shown to be an unrealistic representation of contact patterns. An alternative approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM designed to evaluate nonpharmaceutical interventions.

While addition of other common metal ions did not bring about substantial change of the fluorescence. Thus the probe can be used for fluorescence turn-on detection of Fe2+ ion in ethanol/water (9:1) medium. The detection limit of the probe for Fe2+ is 0.77 µM.

The study was conducted during the first week of lockdown declared by the Spanish Government. The Brief Symptom Inventory BSI-18 and a risk perception questionnaire about vulnerable groups was administered. The study revealed the appearance of distress in 9.6% of the sample (85.7% women). Experiencing distress influenced risk perception. This study's main contribution is the link between experiencing distress and the risk perception with respect to vulnerable groups. Risk perception is relevant since it can influence how the population faces the pandemic.

The increasing prevalence of malignancy has become a leading cause of human mortality. However, conflicting findings have been published on the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. This study aims to assess the pooled proportion of malignancy amongst 2019-nCov patients and to investigate the association between malignancy and COVID-19 severity. METHODS: Correlative studies were identi?ed by systematically searching electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Sciences and Embase) up to September 2, 2020. All data analyses were carried out using Stata 15.0. RESULTS: Twenty-nine studies consisting of 9475 confirmed COVID-19 patients (median age 54.4 years [IQR 49-62], 54.0% men) were included. The overall proportion of malignancy was 2.5% (95% CI 1.6%-3.4%). The proportion of malignancy was higher in patients with severe/critical 2019-nCoV than those in non-severe/non-critical group (3.9% [95% CI 2.0-6.3] vs 1.4% [95% CI 0.8-2.2]). Furthermore, pre-existing malignancy was associated with more than twofold higher risk of severe/critical patients with COVID-19 (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.65-3.06 I2 = 0.0%). CONCLUSION: Malignancy was associated with up to 2.3-fold higher risk of severe/critical COVID-19 and may serve as a clinical predictor for adverse outcomes.","Liu, G E; Cai, Wei; Liu, Huan; Jiang, Hai Hong; Yi Bi, Yong; Wang, Hong",Turkish journal of medical sciences,108,20

Museums, libraries, archives, and other cultural institutions have been closed in lockdowns all around the European Union, and their content presented and consumed online. This paper will analyse how copyright rules affect cultural heritage institutions (publicly accessible libraries or museums, archives or film or audio heritage institutions) in the digital age. Four recent legal documents at the European level refer to the digitalisation of their collections and the digitised content's exposure to the public in the Digital Single Market. These are Directive 2001/29/EC, Directive 2012/28/EU, Directive (EU) 2019/790 and Directive (EU) 2019/1024. This paper willfirst analyse how exclusive rights are regulated for authors, other creators, publishers, and producers in the digital age. Those rights need to be respected and exercised effectively by their owners. On the other hand, there is also a public interest, in that digitisation and access to digitised content should be free in cultural heritage institutions. To resolve the tension inherent in this relationship is not easy. The recent rapid change in consumption of creative, cultural and artistic content in the Single Digital Market (due to the pandemic caused by the COVID-19 virus) has triggered the need for swifter digitisation of cultural heritage institutions' collections. The European legal framework offers some solutions to this need, which will be presented here. It does not resolve the situation generally, but refers to particular issues, such as orphan works, out-of-commerce works, text and data mining and the re-use of public sector information. In general, copyright protection prevails. Nevertheless, the tendencies towards free access grow stronger every day. This paper will analyse how these four directives interact with each other in the effort to resolve the tension between copyright, digitisation and free access to digitised content in cultural heritage institutions. At the end, two ideas for a new balance are presented.","Vuckovic, R. M.; Kanceljak, I.; Juric, M.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,108,22

This study examined mental health as a potential mediating factor linking self-stigmatization and PTSD to quality of life and sleep. METHODS: Using a cross-sectional design, 844 people who had recovered from COVID-19 were called and interviewed. Data were collected using structured scales. Structural equation modeling was applied to assess fitness of a mediation model including self-stigma and PTSD as independent factors and quality of life and insomnia as dependent variables. RESULTS: Mental health, COVID-19-related self-stigma, and mental quality of life were associated. Insomnia, PTSD, and COVID-19-related self-stigma displayed significant direct associations (r = .334 to 0.454; p < .01). A mediation model indicated satisfactory goodness of fit (CFI = 0.968, TLI = 0.950, SRMR = 0.071, RMSEA = 0.068). Mental health as a mediator had negative relationships with COVID-19-related self-stigma, PTSD, and insomnia and positive associations with quality of life. CONCLUSION: Mental health may mediate effects of COVID-19-related self-stigma and PTSD on quality of life and insomnia. Designing programs to improve mental health among patients with COVID-19 may include efforts to reduce negative effects of PTSD and COVID-19-related self-stigma on quality of life and insomnia.","Mahmoudi, Hosein; Saffari, Mohsen; Movahedi, Mahmoud; Sanaeinasab, Hormoz; Rashidi-Jahan, Hojat; Pourgholami, Morteza; Poorebrahim, Ali; Barshan, Jalal; Ghiami, Milad; Khoshmanesh, Saman; Potenza, Marc N; Lin, Chung-Ying; Pakpour, Amir H",Brain Behav,108,10

Crowding and congestions in parks has been a perennial problem and the ability to socially distance within them is an unproven assumption. Is it possible to socially distance in a busy national park that has been designed to concentrate use? METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: An observational study was conducted in July 2020 at the outside foyer of the Visitor Center of Arches National Park. Motion sensor cameras were placed to record one-minute videos when a person entered the field of view. Number of groups, group size, facial coverings and encounters within 6 feet (1.83 meters) of other groups were recorded. Groups were smaller on average than recorded in previous studies. Approximately 61% of the visitors wore masks. Most groups (69%) were able to experience the visitor center with no intergroup encounters. We model the probability of intergroup encounters and find as group size and number of groups increases, the probability of encounters rises. With four groups present, the probability of one or more encounters ranges from 19% to 40% for common group sizes, while if eight groups are present, the probability of one or more encounters increases from 34% to 64% for common group sizes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under conditions in which park visitors have the physical space to avoid close encounters with other groups they are taking advantage of the opportunity. Visitors are minimizing group size, wearing masks, and remaining socially distant. However, encounters increase as the number or the size of the groups increases. In other areas of the parks this ability to avoid encounters may not be as possible. We recommend that park managers continue to appeal for compliance with CDC guidelines, especially the wearing of masks and encouraging visitors to split up into small groups when visiting.","Miller, Zachary D; Freimund, Wayne; Dalenberg, Douglas; Vega, Madison",PLoS One,108,16

Ursonic acid (UNA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpenoid extracted from certain medicinal herbs such as Ziziphus jujuba. Since the pharmacological effects and associated mechanisms of UNA are not well-known, in this work, we attempt to introduce the therapeutic potential of UNA with a comparison to ursolic acid (ULA), a well-known secondary metabolite, for beneficial effects. UNA has a keto group at the C-3 position, which may provide a critical difference for the varied biological activities between UNA and ULA. Several studies previously showed that UNA exerts pharmaceutical effects similar to, or stronger than, ULA, with UNA significantly decreasing the survival and proliferation of various types of cancer cells. UNA has potential to exert inhibitory effects in parasitic protozoa that cause several tropical diseases. UNA also exerts other potential effects, including antihyperglycemic, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and antioxidant activities. Of note, a recent study highlighted the suppressive potential of UNA against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular modifications of UNA may enhance bioavailability, which is crucial for in vivo and clinical studies. In conclusion, UNA has promising potential to be developed in anticancer and antiprotozoan pharmaceuticals.

Here we combine microscopy imaging with virus viability assays to study survival of three bacteriophages suggested as good models for respiratory pathogens: the enveloped Phi6 (a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2), and the non-enveloped PhiX174 and MS2. We measured virus viability in human saliva microdroplets, SM buffer, and water following deposition on glass surfaces at various relative humidities (RH). Saliva and water microdroplets dried out rapidly, within minutes, at all tested RH levels (23%, 43%, 57%, and 78%), while SM microdroplets remained hydrated at RH &#8805; 57%. Generally, the survival of all three viruses in dry saliva microdroplets was significantly greater than those in SM buffer and water under all RH (except PhiX174 in water under 57% RH survived the best among 3 media). Thus, atmosphere RH and microdroplet hydration state are not sufficient to explain virus survival, indicating that the virus-suspended medium, and association with saliva components in particular, likely play a role in virus survival. Uncovering the exact properties and components that make saliva a favorable environment for the survival of viruses, in particular enveloped ones like Phi6, is thus of great importance for reducing transmission of viral respiratory pathogens including SARS-CoV-2.","Fedorenko, Aliza; Grinberg, Maor; Orevi, Tomer; Kashtan, Nadav",Sci Rep,108,29

We also investigated the effect of social distance policies on the level of economic activities and on the prices of stock indexes. Data were collected from stock exchanges on four continents: North America, Africa, Asia and Europe. We extracted information from the stock market on the closing price (PF), lowest price (PB) and highest price (PMA) of the main stock market indicators on the four continents: the FTSE 500 index (United Kingdom);SP 500 (USA);Nikkei 225 (Japan);and the SA Top 40 index (South Africa). In the estimates, we adopted the natural logarithm of each price data to reduce the asymmetry observed in the distribution of stock price data. We concentrated the analysis in the period from January to May 2020, when the coronavirus started to spread to other countries and international markets. We empirically examine the impact of social distance policies on economic activities and stock market indices. The findings reveal that the increasing number of blocking days, monetary policy decisions and international travel restrictions have severely affected the level of economic activities and the closing, opening, lower and higher share prices of the main stock indexes. On the other hand, the restriction imposed on the domestic movement and the increase in spending on fiscal policies had a positive impact on the level of economic activities, although the growing number of confirmed cases of coronavirus virus did not significantly affect the level of economic activities.

The lack of effective therapeutics for the management of the pandemic calls for the discovery of new drugs and vaccines. OBJECTIVE: In the present study, a chemical library was screened for molecules against three coronavirus 3CL-like protease enzymes (SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, SARS-CoV 3CLpro and MERS-CoV 3CLpro), which are a key player in the viral replication cycle. METHODS: Extensive computational methods, such as virtual screening and molecular docking, were employed in this study. RESULTS: Two lead molecules- ZINC08825480 (4-bromo-N'-{(E)-[1-phenyl-3-(pyridin-3-yl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl]methylidene}benzene-1-sulfonohydrazide) and ZINC72009942 (N-[[2-[[(3S)-3-methyl-1-piperidyl]methyl]phenyl]methyl]-6-oxo-1-(p-tolyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-triazine-3-carboxamide) were identified with better affinity with the three target enzymes as compared to the approved antiviral drugs. Both the lead molecules possess favourable drug-like properties, fit well into the active site pocket close to His-Cys dyad and show a good number of hydrogen bonds with the backbone as well as side chains of key amino acid residues. CONCLUSION: Thus, the present study offers two novel chemical entities against coronavirus infections, which can be validated through various biological assays.","Gurung, Arun Bahadur; Al-Anazi, Khalid Mashay; Ali, Mohammad Ajmal; Lee, Joongku; Farah, Mohammad Abul",Curr pharm. biotechnol,108,13

Ultimately, the public's response to announcements of lockdowns-defined as restrictions on both local movement or long distance travel-will determine how effective these kinds of interventions are. Here, we evaluate the effects of lockdowns on human mobility and simulate how these changes may affect epidemic spread by analyzing aggregated mobility data from mobile phones. We show that in 2020 following lockdown announcements but prior to their implementation, both local and long distance movement increased in multiple locations, and urban-to-rural migration was observed around the world. To examine how these behavioral responses to lockdown policies may contribute to epidemic spread, we developed a simple agent-based spatial model. Our model shows that this increased movement has the potential to increase seeding of the epidemic in less urban areas, which could undermine the goal of the lockdown in preventing disease spread. Lockdowns play a key role in reducing contacts and controlling outbreaks, but appropriate messaging surrounding their announcement and careful evaluation of changes in mobility are needed to mitigate the possible unintended consequences.","Kishore, Nishant; Kahn, Rebecca; Martinez, Pamela P; De Salazar, Pablo M; Mahmud, Ayesha S; Buckee, Caroline O",Sci Rep,108,1

This paper investigates the COVID-19 transmission risk between different counties in the state of New York during the first month of the pandemic. This study constructs a comparable measure of COVID-19 outbreak status in different counties and quantifies their levels of severity. The study then conducts a transportation network analysis using historical inter-county commute data to establish transportation connections between counties and measures the county’s ability to spread/receive the disease. Results show that Queens, Kings, Westchester, Nassau, Bronx, Suffolk, and New York were all identified as the outbreak centers. Queens, Kings, Westchester, New York, and Monroe were major spreaders because of high volume, bi-directional commuting patterns. Saratoga and Oneida spread fewer outgoing cases, while Suffolk and Bronx were more affected by incoming cases. All other counties in the state are regarded as “community spreaders” with relatively low inter-county commutes, among which Rockland, Richmond, Essex, Orange were at mid-levels of severity in the outbreak. besides current outbreak centers as listed in results, specific attention should be given to Monroe, Saratoga, and Oneida.

This produces the perception of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, or umami stimuli, depending on the chemical nature of the tastant. Taste impairments (dysgeusia) are alterations of this normal gustatory functioning that may result in complete taste losses (ageusia), partial reductions (hypogeusia), or over-acuteness of the sense of taste (hypergeusia). Taste impairments are not life-threatening conditions, but they can cause sufficient discomfort and lead to appetite loss and changes in eating habits, with possible effects on health. Determinants of such alterations are multiple and consist of both genetic and environmental factors, including aging, exposure to chemicals, drugs, trauma, high alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking, poor oral health, malnutrition, and viral upper respiratory infections including influenza. Disturbances or loss of smell, taste, and chemesthesis have also emerged as predominant neurological symptoms of infection by the recent Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as by previous both endemic and pandemic coronaviruses such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV.

In this study, we investigated three COVID-19 patients who represented the symptoms after recovery. Chest CT scan was applied to assess the patients along with the viral samples from oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal which were subjected to RT-PCR. The viral genome sequencing was applied where possible to distinguish possible re-infection or latent reactivation. Moreover, COVID-19-specific antibodies available data were evaluated in each incidence. The second episode of SARS-CoV-2 infection was different among the investigated subjects who experienced an interval between positive PCR tests ranged between 63 and 156 days. The disease presentation was less or more severe in the second infection. All cases were found IgG positive in the re-infection phase. The sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 sample obtained from two cases revealed a D614G mutation of S gene from the second isolated sample strengthens the case for the re-infection. The possibility of re-infection and reactivation could have significant effect on clinical implications and also vaccination.

While California nursing education regulations require 75% direct patient contact for all clinical courses, meeting this requirement became impossible as clinical agencies closed to nursing students during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nursing regulatory change was urgently needed to provide greater flexibility in meeting clinical course objectives using simulation and other online learning modalities. At stake was the graduation of over 14,971 RN students from public and private nursing programs. While state regulators opposed a legislative approach, CACN collaborated with stakeholders to support legislation that led to a reduction in direct patient care hours, allowing nursing students to progress and graduate. This longstanding advocacy work was accelerated by the pandemic and required leadership and knowledge about the legislative process for nurse educators to succeed.

Yet the neural substrates underlying predatory hunting remain largely undefined. Here, we report that basal forebrain (BF) GABAergic neurons play an important role in regulating predatory hunting. Our results showed that BF GABAergic neurons were activated during the prey (cricket)-hunting and food feeding in mice. Optogenetic activation of BF GABAergic neurons evoked immediate predatory-like actions to both artificial and natural preys, significantly reducing the attack latency while increasing the attack probability and the number of killed natural prey (crickets). Similar to the effect of activating the soma of BF GABAergic neurons, photoactivation of their terminals in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) also strongly promotes predatory hunting. Moreover, photoactivation of GABAergic BF - VTA pathway significantly increases the intake of various food in mice. By synchronous recording of electroencephalogram and electromyogram, we showed that photoactivation of GABAergic BF - VTA pathway induces instant arousal and maintains long-term wakefulness. In summary, our results clearly demonstrated that the GABAergic BF is a key neural substrate for predatory hunting, and promotes this behavior through GABAergic BF - VTA pathway.","Cai, Ping; Chen, Li; Guo, Yu-Rou; Yao, Jing; Chen, Hui-Yun; Lu, Yi-Ping; Huang, Sheng-Nan; He, Peng; Zheng, Ze-Hong; Liu, Ji-Yuan; Chen, Jian; Hu, Li-Huan; Chen, Shang-Yi; Huang, Le-Tong; Chen, Guo-Qiang; Tang, Wei-Tao; Su, Wei-Kun; Li, Huang-Yuan; Wang, Wen-Xiang; Yu, Chang-Xi",Neuropharmacology,108,20

As we wait for the approved vaccines to become widely distributed, the best approach to fighting the spread of this disease is mostly preventative depending largely on individuals' compliance. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19 in Lebanon. METHODS: A descriptive analysis was performed to describe the outcome measures of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 on a convenience sample from the Lebanese population in relation to socio-demographic characteristics and level of concern towards COVID-19. One thousand eight hundred sixty-one participants filled in an online survey (response rate: 18.5%) distributed by social media to social networks of the research team members. RESULTS: Participants were mainly young (49.4% between 18 and 24 years) and males (73.7%). Participants showed an overall appropriate knowledge of COVID-19 (67.1%) and positive attitude (around 90% were optimistic about treatment and vaccination) and had good preventive practices towards COVID-19 (around 75% washed hands and avoided public places). Knowledge and practices correlated positively with marriage, age, education, working in a healthcare field and with the level of concern about getting COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: This study found good overall levels of KAP among the studied Lebanese population. This can help in controlling the spread of COVID-19 if individuals were forced to adhere to social distancing and appropriate preventative practices.","Sakr, Samer; Ghaddar, Ali; Sheet, Imtithal; Eid, Ali H; Hamam, Bassam",BMC Public Health,108,1

Soon, transmission from person to person was confirmed and the virus spread to many other countries. To date, many cases have been reported in the pediatric age group, most of which were from China. The management and treatment strategies have also been improved, which we believe would be helpful to pediatric series in other countries as well.

The data we present on Australia's COVID-19 situation pertain to the initial wave of the pandemic from January through to 20 April 2020. The results of our study indicate the number of reported COVID-19 cases in Australia reduced, and Australia initially managed to successfully flatten the curve-from an initial doubling time of 3.4 days at the end of March 2020 to a doubling time of 112 days as of 20 April 2020. Using SEIR mathematical modelling, we investigate a scenario assuming infections increase once mitigation measures are lifted. In this case, Australia could experience over 15,000 confirmed cases by the end of April 2020.

The reasons of this geographical pattern might involve several concurrent factors. The main objective of this work is to investigate whether any correlations exist between the spatial distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the different Italian regions and the amount of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the Earth's surface. To this purpose, in this environmental ecological study a mixed-effect exponential regression was built to explain the incidence of COVID-19 based on the environmental conditions, and demographic and pathophysiologic factors. Observations and estimates of the cumulative solar UV exposure have been included to quantify the amount of radiation available e.g., for pre-vitamin D3 synthesis or SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by sunlight. The analysis shows a significant correlation (p-value <5 × 10-2) between the response variables (death percentage, incidence of infections and positive tests) and biologically effective solar UV radiation, residents in nursing homes per inhabitant (NHR), air temperature, death percentage due to the most frequent comorbidities. Among all factors, the amount of solar UV radiation is the variable contributing the most to the observed correlation, explaining up to 83.2% of the variance of the COVID-19 affected cases per population. While the statistical outcomes of the study do not directly entail a specific cause-effect relationship, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that solar UV radiation impacted on the development of the infection and on its complications, e.g. through the effect of vitamin D on the immune system or virus inactivation by sunlight. The analytical framework used in this study, based on commonly available data, can be easily replicated in other countries and geographical domains to identify possible correlations between exposure to solar UV radiation and the spread of the pandemic.","Isaia, Giancarlo; Diémoz, Henri; Maluta, Francesco; Fountoulakis, Ilias; Ceccon, Daniela; di Sarra, Alcide; Facta, Stefania; Fedele, Francesca; Lorenzetto, Giuseppe; Siani, Anna Maria; Isaia, Gianluca",Sci Total Environ,108,9

Secondary attack rates among household contacts are estimated to be five to ten times higher than among non-household contacts, but it is unclear which individuals are more prone to transmit infection within their households. METHODS: Using address matching, a cohort was assembled of all laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 residing in private households in Ontario, Canada. Descriptive analyses were performed to compare characteristics of cases in households that experienced secondary transmission versus those that did not. Logistic regression models were fit to determine index case characteristics and neighbourhood characteristics associated with transmission. RESULTS: Between January and July, 2020, there were 26,714 cases of COVID-19 residing in 21,226 households. Longer testing delays (&#8805;5 days versus 0 days OR=3.02, 95% CI: 2.53 - 3.60) and male gender (OR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.18 - 1.38) were associated with greater odds of household secondary transmission, while being a healthcare worker (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.50 - 0.62) was associated with lower odds of transmission. Neighbourhoods with larger average family size and a higher proportion of households with multiple persons per room were also associated with greater odds of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for individuals to get tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as symptoms appear, and to isolate away from household contacts; this is particularly important in neighbourhoods with large family sizes and/or crowded households.","Paul, Lauren A; Daneman, Nick; Brown, Kevin A; Johnson, James; van Ingen, Trevor; Joh, Eugene; Wilson, Sarah E; Buchan, Sarah A",Clin. infect. dis,108,16

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of these variants on severity of maternal infection and perinatal outcomes within the time-periods in which they predominated. MethodsThis national, prospective cohort study collated data on hospitalised pregnant women with symptoms of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and compared the severity of infection and perinatal outcomes across the Wildtype (01/03/20-30/11/20), Alpha (01/12/20-15/05/21) and Delta dominant periods (16/05/21-11/07/21), using multivariable logistic regression. FindingsOf 3371 pregnant women, the proportion that experienced moderate to severe infection significantly increased between Wildtype and Alpha periods (24.4% vs. 35.8%; aOR1.75 95%CI 1.48-2.06), and between Alpha and Delta periods (35.8% vs. 45.0%; aOR1.53, 95%CI 1.07-2.17). Compared to the Wildtype period, symptomatic women admitted in the Alpha period were more likely to require respiratory support (27.2% vs. 20.3%, aOR1.39, 95%CI 1.13-1.78), have pneumonia (27.5% vs. 19.1%, aOR1.65, 95%CI 1.38-1.98) and be admitted to intensive care (11.3% vs. 7.7%, aOR1.61, 95%CI 1.24-2.10). Women admitted during the Delta period had further increased risk of pneumonia (36.8% vs. 27.5%, aOR1.64 95%CI 1.14-2.35). No fully vaccinated pregnant women were admitted between 01/02/2021 when vaccination data collection commenced and 11/07/2021. The proportion of women receiving pharmacological therapies for SARS-CoV-2 management was low, even in those critically ill. InterpretationSARS-CoV-2 infection during Alpha and Delta dominant periods was associated with more severe infection and worse pregnancy outcomes compared to the Wildtype infection, which itself increased risk compared to women without SARS-CoV-2 infection.1 Clinicians need to be aware and implement COVID-specific therapies in keeping with national guidance.

These poly plant extracts were investigated and optimized for the stability, safety and moisturizing ability. The combination moisturizing effect was determined by measuring the expression of FLG mRNA, CLDN-1 mRNA and AQP3 protein. Toxicological analysis included a red blood cell hemolysis test and a 3T3 phototoxicity test. It has been observed that by using polysaccharide yield as the evaluation criterion showed optimal extraction at a material-to-liquid ratio of 1:100, an extraction temperature of 100 °C, and an extraction time of 3 h. Moisturizing effect experiments showed that the expression of FLG mRNA, CLDN-1 mRNA and AQP3 protein was significantly increased. Toxicological tests showed that the composition was safe and caused no irritating effects. Based on these results, this poly TCM moisturizing formulation is safe within moisturizing effects and can be used as a moisturizing raw material in cosmetics. This article is protected by copyright.

As of April 11, 2020, the state of New York was the epicenter of the global health emergency with more confirmed cases of COVID-19 then any country worldwide. New York. Biomarkers have been studied in the context of COVID-19, but there have only been a few studies of a limited population. COVID-19 is a resource intensive disease with a high mortality. Therefore, being able to define predictive/associated biomarkers may not only facilitate early diagnosis of presumptive COVID, but also provide guidelines for early aggressive treatment and acuity of care triage.METHODS We examined all patients, admitted the MICU and adult medicine service for confirmed positive cases COVID or presumed COVID admitted to the Manhattan and Brooklyn campuses of our institution in the first 60 days of the COVID-19 pandemic, March 1-April 30, 2020. Our natural history study was accomplished by the review of the electronic medical records (EMR) of those diagnosed with COVID-19. Subjects were examined from the time of admission to discharge from each of the participating institutions. All data was collected in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 11 and approved by the NYU IRB#20-00473.RESULTS Of the N=13,307 COVID-19 positive patients admitted, N=4136 were of Hispanic/Latino descent, and N=932 were admitted to the ICU. The cohort was followed longitudinally with serial labs including inflammatory markers: d-dimers, ferritin, IL-1, IL-6, and CRP. Peak d-dimer, ferritin, and IL-6 was significantly associated with ICU admission (p&lt;0.001, p&lt;0.001, p=0.001 respectively), whereas IL-1 was not by Student's t-test (p=0.226). Hispanic/Latino descent was not significantly associated with ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS. Biomarkers of COVID-19 may potentially prognosticate ICU admission status. Further analysis is needed to assess the model's sensitivity and specificity for predicting morbidity and mortality.","Kwon, S.; Crowley, G.; Liu, M.; Nolan, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,108,24

Notably, COVID-19 is characterized by systemic inflammation. However, the potential mechanisms of the ""cytokine storm"" of COVID-19 are still limited. In this study, fourteen peripheral blood samples from COVID-19 patients (n = 10) and healthy donors (n = 4) were collected to perform the whole-transcriptome sequencing. Lung tissues of COVID-19 patients (70%) presenting with ground-glass opacity. Also, the leukocytes and lymphocytes were significantly decreased in COVID-19 compared with the control group (p < 0.05). In total, 25,482 differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DE mRNA), 23 differentially expressed microRNAs (DE miRNA), and 410 differentially expressed long noncoding RNAs (DE lncRNAs) were identified in the COVID-19 samples compared to the healthy controls. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that the upregulated DE mRNAs were mainly involved in antigen processing and presentation of endogenous antigen, positive regulation of T cell mediated cytotoxicity, and positive regulation of gamma-delta T cell activation. The downregulated DE mRNAs were mainly concentrated in the glycogen biosynthetic process. We also established the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of up/downregulated DE mRNAs and identified 4 modules. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that these module targets were associated with positive regulation of cytokine production, cytokine-mediated signaling pathway, leukocyte differentiation, and migration. A total of 6 hub genes were selected in the PPI module networks including AKT1, TNFRSF1B, FCGR2A, CXCL8, STAT3, and TLR2. Moreover, a competing endogenous RNA network showed the interactions between lncRNAs, mRNAs, and miRNAs. Our results highlight the potential pathogenesis of excessive cytokine production such as MSTRG.119845.30/hsa-miR-20a-5p/TNFRSF1B, MSTRG.119845.30/hsa-miR-29b-2-5p/FCGR2A, and MSTRG.106112.2/hsa-miR-6501-5p/STAT3 axis, which may also play an important role in the development of ground-glass opacity in COVID-19 patients. This study gives new insights into inflammation regulatory mechanisms of coding and noncoding RNAs in COVID-19, which may provide novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic avenues for COVID-19 patients.","Li, Cai-Xia; Chen, Jian; Lv, Shu-Kai; Li, Jin-Hui; Li, Lei-Lei; Hu, Xiao",Mediators Inflamm,108,21

The DNA repair gene, thymine DNA glycosylase, is important to cell survival because it stops cells from becoming cancerous protecting/preventing DNA. Exposure to CS may induce genetic changes such as single nucleotide polymorphisms in DNA repair genes. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the genotype and allele distributions of four TDG SNPs with only smoking behavior in normal patients. Four TDG SNPs-rs4135066 (C/T), rs3751209 (A/G), rs1866074 (C/T), and rs1882018 (C/T) were analyzed by genotyping 235 and 239 blood samples collected from cigarette smokers and non-smokers, among the Saudi population. The results showed that TDG rs4135066 has a significant susceptibility effect observed in long-term smokers (>5 years; OR = 4.53; P = 0.0347) but not in short-term smokers (&#8804;5 years) in contrast with non-smokers. Also, in smokers aged less than 29 years, the ""CT,"" ""TT,"" and ""CT+TT"" alleles of rs1882018 increased the risk of developing all diseases related to smoking by approximately 6, 4, and 5 times, respectively, in contrast with the ancestral ""CC"" homozygous allele. A comparison of the allele distributions of TDG SNPs in a Saudi population with those in other populations represented in the HapMap project showed that the genetic makeup of the Saudi Arabian population appears to differ from that of other ethnicities. Exceptions include the Yoruba people in Ibadan, Nigeria; those of Mexican ancestry in Los Angeles, California; the Luhya population in Webuye, Kenya; Gujarati Indians in Houston, Texas; and the Tuscan population in Italy, which showed similar allelic frequencies for rs3751209 compared to our Saudi population. In this ethnic, we have found a high variation in the distribution of the alleles and genotype frequencies on TDG gene. This variation on TDG SNP's with smoking could lead to increase the susceptibility to many diseases related to smoking habits in this population.","Almutairi, Mikhlid; Rouabhia, Mahmoud; Sahab Almutairi, Mohammed; Al-Zahrani, Mohammed; Al-Numair, Nouf S; Mohammad Alhadeq, Abdullah; Reddy Parine, Narasimha; Semlali, Abdelhabib",Gene,108,19

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of 5 early warning scores based on the admission data of critical COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Overall, medical records of 319 COVID-19 patients were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission were used for calculating the Standardized Early Warning Score (SEWS), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2), Hamilton Early Warning Score (HEWS), and Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS). Data on the outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for overall and subgroup analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were performed. RESULTS: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the SEWS, NEWS, NEWS2, HEWS, and MEWS in predicting mortality were 0.841 (95% CI: 0.765-0.916), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.809 (95% CI: 0.727-0.891), 0.821 (95% CI: 0.748-0.895), and 0.670 (95% CI: 0.573-0.767), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: SEWS, NEWS, NEWS2, and HEWS demonstrated moderate discriminatory power and, therefore, offer potential utility as prognostic tools for screening severely ill COVID-19 patients.

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serology-based tests are currently being used. However, the speed and accuracy of these tests may not meet the current demand; thus, alternative technology platforms are being developed. Nano biosensor technology platforms have been established as a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and accurate detection of viruses as well as other life-threatening diseases even in resource-limited settings. This review aims to provide a short overview of recent advancements in molecular and biosensor-based diagnosis of viruses, including the human coronaviruses, and highlight the challenges and future perspectives of these detection technologies.","Demeke Teklemariam, Addisu; Samaddar, Manalee; Alharbi, Mona G; Al-Hindi, Rashad R; Bhunia, Arun K",Mol Cell Probes,108,16

Then, we use this framework to explore and organize information from the rapidly growing number of scientific papers, preprints, preliminary scientific reports, and journalistic pieces that give insights into the pandemic crisis. With this work, we point out that the pandemic should be understood as the result of preconditions that led to depletion of human, biological, and geochemical diversity as well as of feedback that differentially impacted the three spheres.

In the context of cancer patients, COVID-19 has a severe impact, regarding pulmonary infection but also cancer treatments in this fragile and immunocompromised population, and ICU admission for cancer patients in the context of COVID-19 requires ethical and clinical consideration. In our cancer center, intensivists, oncologists, pharmacists, and hospital administrators had to prepare for a substantial increase in critical care bed capacity (from 10 ICU beds, 6 medical intensive care beds, and 12 surgical intensive care beds, bed capacity was increased to 28 medical intensive care beds with ventilating capacity) and to adapt infrastructure (i.e., ICU beds), supplies (i.e., drugs, ventilators, protective materials), and staff (i.e., nurses and medical staff). Overall, thirty-three COVID-19 patients were admitted in our ICU, 17 cancer-free and 16 with cancer, and 23 required mechanical ventilation, resulting in 4 deaths (of them two patients with cancer).

DESIGN: Using a cross-sectional study, we recruited English-language migrants (n = 411) living in Israel to respond to an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 3 April to 16 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The dependent variable comprised the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, which attained an internal consistency of 0.91 in this sample. RESULTS: PSS scores were related to lower age (p < 0.0001), being single (p = 0.0095), not possessing high (p = 0.0069) or medium resilience (p = 0.0002), reporting below average SES (p = 0.0196), being ""extremely"" worried about getting COVID-19 (p < 0.0001), and having high health literacy (p = 0.0007). Additionally, the interaction between health literacy and resilience (p < 0.0001) showed that migrants with high resilience and high health literacy had the lowest perceived stress; and migrants with low resilience and high health literacy had the highest perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions are needed to assist migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal intervention will aim to address the psychological distress while increasing both health literacy and resilience.","Zlotnick, Cheryl; Dryjanska, Laura; Suckerman, Suzanne",Psychol Health,108,24

However, the situation rapidly changed since Covid-19 outbreak, when migration has fallen off the radar as a political issue. The aim of this paper is to analyse students attitudes towards migrants, in the period before COVID-19, and our initial thesis is that the fact that attitudes towards migrants are rooted in individual values and when established can be resistant to change. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part of the paper, we give an overview of available reports on the impact of Covid-19 to public attitudes towards migrants. Although is too early to make some general conclusions about it, the surveys made so far show that external factors, such as Covid-19, does not make important changes to public attitudes towards migrants. Having this in mind, in the second part of the paper we present the results of our research which was developed as a part of the project ""Creating Welcoming Communities of the Association ""MI"". The purpose of this research was to identify the attitudes of students of the Faculty of Law Osijek for the acceptance and integration of migrant into society. The target group of survey participants covered by the research was defined so as to include students of different levels (Intergrated Undergraduate and Graduate Study Programme, Professional Administrative Study Programme, University Undergraduate Study of Social Work) and the sample of students included 300 persons.

Therefore, understanding the risk factors related to a high mortality rate can enable the physicians for a better decision-making process. METHODS: Information was collected regarding clinical, demographic, and epidemiological features of the definite COVID-19 cases. Through Cox regression and statistical analysis, the risk factors related to mortality were determined. The Kaplan-Meier curve was used to estimate survival function and measure the mean length of living time in the patients. RESULTS: Among about 3000 patients admitted in the Taleghani hospital as outpatients with suspicious signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in 2 months, 214 people were confirmed positive for this virus using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Median time to death was 30 days. In this population, 24.29% of the patients died and 24.76% of them were admitted to the ICU (intensive care unit) during hospitalization. The results of Multivariate Cox regression Analysis showed that factors including age (HR, 1.031; 95% CI, 1.001-1.062; P value=0.04), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.000-1.015; P value=0.04) could independently predict mortality. Furthermore, the results showed that age above 59 years directly increased mortality rate and decreased survival among our study population.

It is also important to explore the link between the social media exposure and well-being. Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to identify the levels of anxiety, depression, and social isolation among individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we explored the relationship between exposure to misleading social media news and anxiety, depression, and social isolation. A cross sectional design was employed to collect data from 371 Saudi participants (aged 16-60 years), using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale.

We found that exposure to misinformation via social media has a significant positive relationship with anxiety, depression, and social isolation. However, Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study it cannot be determined whether social media causes negative mental health outcomes, or if individuals experiencing greater depression, anxiety and social isolation turn to social media more than others, or if some third variable might explain both.

The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. Measurement of viral load requires the use of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), which in turn requires advanced equipment and techniques. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the viral load measurement using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP), which is a simpler procedure compared to RT-qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RNA was extracted by using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. The RT-LAMP assay was performed by using the Loopamp® 2019-SARS-CoV-2 detection reagent kit and 10-fold serial dilutions of known viral load RT-LAMP were used to measure Tt, which is the time until the turbidity exceeds the threshold. Based on the relationship between viral load and Tt, the linearity and detection sensitivity of the calibration curve were evaluated. In addition, 117 clinical specimens were measured, and RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP assay results were compared. RESULTS: The dilution linearity of the calibration curve was maintained at five orders of magnitude 1.0× 106 to 1.0 × 101 copies/µL, and was confirmed to be detectable down to 1.0 × 100 copies/µL. The limit of quantification of RNA extracted from clinical specimens using RT-LAMP correlated well with that obtained using RT-qPCR (r2 = 0.930).

They are also at higher risk of becoming infected and transmitting this virus. In Saudi Arabia, it was noticed that the healthcare workforce suffered from anxiety, and that this more evident in women than men. Objective: This study aimed to assess the knowledge of nurses regarding COVID-19 and the level of anxiety toward the COVID-19 outbreak in the current pandemic situation. Design: A cross-sectional design was used and a validated self-administered online questionnaire with a set of questions related to COVID-19 was distributed to 87 participating nurses. Results: The results showed that more than half of the nurses (71.90%) had an adequate and good knowledge about the causes, transmission, symptoms, treatment, and death rate of COVID-19. The main sources of information for the nurses were social media (51.7%) and the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health (36.8%). Conclusions: The results allowed the conclusion that, though the nurses had satisfactory knowledge about COVID-19, more than 50% of them experienced mental health issues such as anxiety. To address this, along with providing more knowledge about COVID-19, nurses should be supported in managing their anxiety.","Alsharif, Fatmah",Nursing Reports,108,1

Compared with non-pregnant women of reproductive age, pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 were less likely to report symptoms of fever (odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.22 to 0.85; I2=74%; 5 studies; 80 521 women) and myalgia (0.48, 0.45 to 0.51; I2=0%; 3 studies; 80 409 women) and were more likely to need admission to an intensive care unit (1.62, 1.33 to 1.96; I2=0%) and invasive ventilation (1.88, 1.36 to 2.60; I2=0%; 4 studies, 91 606 women). 73 pregnant women (0.1%, 26 studies, 11 580 women) with confirmed covid-19 died from any cause. Increased maternal age (1.78, 1.25 to 2.55; I2=9%; 4 studies; 1058 women), high body mass index (2.38, 1.67 to 3.39; I2=0%; 3 studies; 877 women), chronic hypertension (2.0, 1.14 to 3.48; I2=0%; 2 studies; 858 women), and pre-existing diabetes (2.51, 1.31 to 4.80; I2=12%; 2 studies; 858 women) were associated with severe covid-19 in pregnancy. Pre-existing maternal comorbidity was a risk factor for admission to an intensive care unit (4.21, 1.06 to 16.72; I2=0%; 2 studies; 320 women) and invasive ventilation (4.48, 1.40 to 14.37; I2=0%; 2 studies; 313 women). Spontaneous preterm birth rate was 6% (95% confidence interval 3% to 9%; I2=55%; 10 studies; 870 women) in women with covid-19. The odds of any preterm birth (3.01, 95% confidence interval 1.16 to 7.85; I2=1%; 2 studies; 339 women) was high in pregnant women with covid-19 compared with those without the disease. A quarter of all neonates born to mothers with covid-19 were admitted to the neonatal unit (25%) and were at increased risk of admission (odds ratio 3.13, 95% confidence interval 2.05 to 4.78, I2=not estimable; 1 study, 1121 neonates) than those born to mothers without covid-19. CONCLUSION: Pregnant and recently pregnant women are less likely to manifest covid-19 related symptoms of fever and myalgia than non-pregnant women of reproductive age and are potentially more likely to need intensive care treatment for covid-19. Pre-existing comorbidities, high maternal age, and high body mass index seem to be risk factors for severe covid-19. Preterm birth rates are high in pregnant women with covid-19 than in pregnant women without the disease. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020178076.

On Feb 20-21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in an individual's home city predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon individuals' existing chronic health issues and their hours of exercise. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not infected by the virus, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","Zhang, Stephen X; Wang, Yifei; Rauch, Andreas; Wei, Feng",Psychiatry Res,108,16

OBJECTIVE: To characterize mucocutaneous disease and its relation to clinical course among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and MIS-C. METHODS: Descriptive cohort study of prospectively and consecutively hospitalized eligible patients between May 11, 2020 and June 5, 2020. RESULTS: In COVID-19 patients, 4 of 12 (33%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform pattern, and lip mucositis. In MIS-C patients, 9 of 19 (47%) had rash and/or mucositis, including erythema, morbilliform, retiform purpura, targetoid and urticarial patterns, along with acral edema, lip mucositis, tongue papillitis, and conjunctivitis. COVID-19 patients with rash had less frequent respiratory symptoms, pediatric intensive care unit admission, invasive ventilation, and shorter stay versus COVID-19 patients without rash. MIS-C patients with rash had less frequent pediatric intensive care unit admission, shock, ventilation, as well as lower levels of C-reactive protein, ferritin, D-dimer, and troponin (vs MIS-C without rash). Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was similar for patients with and without rash in both groups. None of the MIS-C patients met criteria for Kawasaki disease. LIMITATIONS: Small sample sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous disease is common among children and adolescents with COVID-19 and MIS-C. Laboratory trends observed in patients with rash may prognosticate a less severe course.","Rekhtman, Sergey; Tannenbaum, Rachel; Strunk, Andrew; Birabaharan, Morgan; Wright, Shari; Garg, Amit",J Am Acad Dermatol,108,24

We hypothesised that changes in pulmonary blood distribution may be partially responsible and used functional respiratory imaging on CT scans to calculate pulmonary blood volume. We found that patients with COVID-19 had significantly reduced blood volume in the smaller calibre blood vessels (here defined as <5 mm2 cross-sectional area) compared with matched ARDS patients and healthy controls. This suggests that using high levels of PEEP may not alone be enough to oxygenate these patients and that additional management strategies may be needed.,"Thillai, Muhunthan; Patvardhan, Chinmay; Swietlik, Emilia M; McLellan, Tom; De Backer, Jan; Lanclus, Maarten; De Backer, Wilfried; Ruggiero, Alessandro",Thorax,108,13

The purpose of this study is to present the results of the integration of 3D printing technology in a Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology and to identify the productive model of the point-of-care manufacturing as a paradigm of personalized medicine. METHODS: Observational, descriptive, retrospective and monocentric study of a total of 623 additive manufacturing processes carried out in a Department of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology from November 2015 to March 2020. Variables such as product type, utility, time or materials for manufacture were analyzed. RESULTS: The areas of expertise that have performed more processes are Traumatology, Reconstructive and Orthopedic Oncology. Pre-operative planning is their primary use. Working and 3D printing hours, as well as the amount of 3D printing material used, vary according to the type of product or material delivered to perform the process. The most commonly used 3D printing material for manufacturing is polylactic acid, although biocompatible resin has been used to produce surgical guides.

Inter-Homines works both indoor and outdoor, in public and private crowded areas. The software is applicable to already installed cameras or low-cost cameras on industrial PCs, equipped with an additional embedded edge-AI system for temporary measurements. From the AI-side, we exploit a robust pipeline for real-time people detection and localization in the ground plane by homographic transformation based on state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms; it is a combination of a people detector and a pose estimator.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was undertaken, with spatial examination and genomic sequencing of cases. The cohort included all patrons who attended the restaurant on Saturday 25 July 2020. A case was identified as a person who tested positive to a validated specific Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid test. Associations were tested using chi-squared analysis of case versus non-case behaviours. RESULTS: Twenty cases were epidemiologically linked to exposure at the restaurant on 25 July 2020. All cases dined indoors. All cases able to be genomic sequenced were found to have the same unique mutational profile. Factors tested for an association to the outcome included attentiveness by staff, drink consumption, bathroom use and payment by credit card. No significant results were found. CONCLUSION: Indoor dining was identified as a key factor in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and outdoor dining as a way to limit transmission.

Depending on the amount of cytokines released as the result of the immunological activation induced by SARS-CoV2, three major clinical phenotypes can be identified: ""mild"",symbolized as a ""drizzle"" of cytokines, severe as a ""storm"", and critical as a ""hurricane"". In patients with mild symptoms, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines is balanced to obtain a defense response against the virus which is often self-limiting and overcomes without tissue damage. In severe phenotype, resembling a ""cytokine-release syndrome"", SARS-CoV2 causes the lysis of the immune-mediators leading to a cytokine storm able to induce lung epithelium damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In critical patients, the immune response may become uncontrolled, thus the cytokine burst resembles a form of secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis which may result in a multi organ failure. In addition to the standard of care, an immune-modulatory therapy tailored to each one of the different phenotypes should be used in order to prevent or reduce the release of cytokines responsible for organ damage and disease progression.","Bindoli, S; Felicetti, M; Sfriso, P; Doria, A",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),108,16

Along with psychosocial consequences, it is possible that sexual behavior was also affected. AIMS: With the present study, we evaluated the impact of the community-wide containment and consequent social distancing on the intrapsychic, relational, and sexual health through standardized psychometric tools. METHODS: A case-control study was performed through a web-based survey and comparing subjects of both genders with (group A, N = 2,608) and without (group B, N = 4,213) sexual activity during lockdown. The Welch and chi-square tests were used to assess differences between groups. Univariate analysis of covariance, logistic regression models, and structural equation modeling were performed to measure influence and mediation effects of sexual activity on psychological, relational, and sexual outcomes. OUTCOMES: Main outcome measures were General Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression, Dyadic Adjustment Scale for quality of relationship and a set of well-validated sexological inventories (International Index of Erectile Function, Female Sexual Function Index, and male-female versions of the Orgasmometer). RESULTS: Anxiety and depression scores were significantly lower in subjects sexually active during lockdown. Analysis of covariance identified gender, sexual activity, and living without partner during lockdown as significantly affecting anxiety and depression scores (P < .0001). Logistic regression models showed that lack of sexual activity during lockdown was associated with a significantly higher risk of developing anxiety and depression (OR: 1.32 [95% CI: 1.12 - 1.57, P < .001] and 1.34 [95% CI: 1.15 - 1.57, P < .0001], respectively). Structural equation modeling evidenced the protective role of sexual activity toward psychological distress (ßmales = -0.18 and ßfemales = -0.14), relational health (ßmales = 0.26 and ßfemales = 0.29) and sexual health, both directly (ßmales = 0.43 and ßfemales = 0.31), and indirectly (ßmales = 0.13 and ßfemales = 0.13). CLINICAL TRANSLATION: The demonstrated mutual influence of sexual health on psychological and relational health could direct the clinical community toward a reinterpretation of the relationship among these factors. STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS: Based on a large number of subjects and well-validated psychometric tools, this study elucidated the protective role of sexual activity for psychological distress, as well for relational and sexual health. Main limitations were the web-based characteristics of the protocol and the retrospective nature of prelockdown data on psychorelational and sexual health of subjects recruited. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 lockdown dramatically impacted on psychological, relational, and sexual health of the population. In this scenario, sexual activity played a protective effect, in both genders, on the quarantine-related plague of anxiety and mood disorders. Mollaioli D, Sansone A, Ciocca G, et al.

However, it is unclear if these changes are reversible. Methods: We prospectively assessed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores and 18F-FDG PET scans of 8 COVID-19 patients at the subacute stage (once no longer infectious) and the chronic stage (Ë6 mo after symptom onset). The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related covariance pattern was analyzed at both stages to examine the time course of post-COVID-19 cognitive impairment. For further validation, we also conducted a conventional group analysis. Results: Follow-up 18F-FDG PET revealed that there was a significant reduction in the initial frontoparietal and, to a lesser extent, temporal hypometabolism and that this reduction was accompanied by a significant improvement in cognition. The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related pattern was significantly lower at follow-up and correlated inversely with Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance. However, both 18F-FDG PET and cognitive assessment suggest a residual impairment. Conclusion: Although a significant recovery of regional neuronal function and cognition can be clearly stated, residuals are still measurable in some patients 6 mo after manifestation of COVID-19. Given the current pandemic situation and tremendous uncertainty concerning the long-term effects of COVID-19, the present study provides novel insights of the highest medical and socioeconomic relevance.","Blazhenets, Ganna; Schroeter, Nils; Bormann, Tobias; Thurow, Johannes; Wagner, Dirk; Frings, Lars; Weiller, Cornelius; Meyer, Philipp T; Dressing, Andrea; Hosp, Jonas A",J Nucl Med,108,24

We propose a time-varying sparse vector autoregressive (VAR) model to retrospectively analyze and visualize the dynamic transmission routes of this outbreak in mainland China over January 31-February 19, 2020. Our results demonstrate that the influential inter-location routes from Hubei have become unidentifiable since February 4, 2020, whereas the self-transmission in each provincial-level administrative region (location, hereafter) was accelerating over February 4-15, 2020. From February 16, 2020, all routes became less detectable, and no influential transmissions could be identified on February 18 and 19, 2020. Such evidence supports the effectiveness of government interventions, including the travel restrictions in Hubei. Implications of our results suggest that in addition to the origin of the outbreak, virus preventions are of crucial importance in locations with the largest migrant workers percentages (e.g., Jiangxi, Henan and Anhui) to controlling the spread of COVID-19.","Jiang, Xiandeng; Chang, Le; Shi, Yanlin",Sci Rep,108,16

This paper presents the design of a healthcare system that makes use of these technologies in a cost-effective and intuitive way which highlights the application of these technologies in the battle against the pandemic. The wearable can give real-time analysis reports of body vitals so that necessary precautions can be taken in case of infection. The wearable is designed in such a way that it can be used as a precautionary measure for people who are not infected with the virus and as a monitoring device for affected patients during the curse of their treatment. This low-cost design can not only be used to prevent the community spread of the virus but also for the early prediction of the disease. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Ashwin, V.; Menon, A.; Devagopal, A.

Early career women and those with intersectional identities associated with greater inequities, are facing unique challenges during this time. We argue that women will fall further behind unless academic reward systems adjust how and what they evaluate.

We aimed to assess the impact of deferred treatment during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on the need for blood transfusions in 3 Italian urology departments. METHODS: We reviewed hospital chart data on blood transfusions at the urology units of 3 academic centers in the north of Italy from March to April 2020. Data were compared with values from the same time frame in 2019 (March to April 2019). RESULTS: We observed significant reductions of the number of patients admitted to the urology units from March to April 2020 (373 vs. 119) and the number of performed surgeries (242 vs. 938) compared to 2019. Though, the number of transfused blood units was comparable between the 2 years (182 vs. 252), we found a greater mean number of blood units transfused per admission in 2020 (0.49 vs. 0.22; p < 0.0001). As a whole, the transfusion rate for hematuria was higher in 2020 than in 2019 (36 vs. 7.9%; p < 0.0001). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: The observed increased number of blood transfusions needed throughout the SARS-CoV-2 era could have had a negative impact on both patients and the healthcare system. It is possible to speculate that this is the consequence of a delayed diagnosis and deferred treatment of acute conditions.","Capogrosso, Paolo; Candela, Luigi; Rossi, Piercarlo; Guarasci, Cristian; Muttin, Fabio; Roscigno, Marco; Chianese, Rosa; Santoleri, Luca; Tassara, Michela; Carcano, Giulio; Naspro, Richard; Da Pozzo, Luigi; Montorsi, Francesco; Salonia, Andrea; Dehò, Federico",Urol Int,108,11

One of the driving reasons behind its high rate of infection is due to the unreliability and lack of RT-PCR testing. At times the turnaround results span as long as a couple of days, only to yield a roughly 70% sensitivity rate. As an alternative, recent research has investigated the use of Computer Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. Due to an inherent lack of available COVID-19 CT data, these research efforts have been forced to leverage the use of Transfer Learning. This commonly employed Deep Learning technique has shown to improve model performance on tasks with relatively small amounts of data, as long as the Source feature space somewhat resembles the Target feature space. Unfortunately, a lack of similarity is often encountered in the classification of medical images as publicly available Source datasets usually lack the visual features found in medical images. In this study, we propose the use of Multi-Source Transfer Learning (MSTL) to improve upon traditional Transfer Learning for the classification of COVID-19 from CT scans. With our multi-source fine-tuning approach, our models outperformed baseline models fine-tuned with ImageNet. We additionally, propose an unsupervised label creation process, which enhances the performance of our Deep Residual Networks. Our best performing model was able to achieve an accuracy of 0.893 and a Recall score of 0.897, outperforming its baseline Recall score by 9.3%.","Martinez, Alejandro R.",,108,22

The VOC has been detected in 40 out of 46 countries that reported at least 50 genomes in January 2021. We have estimated that the replicative advantage of the VOC is in the range 1.83-2.18 [95% CI: 1.71-2.40] with respect to the 20A.EU1 variant that dominated in England in November 2020, and in range 1.65-1.72 [95% CI: 1.46-2.04] in Wales, Scotland, Denmark, and USA. As the VOC strain will likely spread globally towards fixation, it is important to monitor its molecular evolution. We have estimated growth rates of expanding mutations acquired by the VOC lineage to find that the L18F substitution in spike has initiated a fast growing VOC substrain. The L18F substitution is of significance because it has been found to compromise binding of neutralizing antibodies. Of concern are immune escape mutations acquired by the VOC: E484K, F490S, S494P (in the receptor binding motif of spike) and Q677H, Q675H (in the proximity of the polybasic cleavage site at the S1/S2 boundary). These mutants may hinder efficiency of existing vaccines and expand in response to the increasing after-infection or vaccine-induced seroprevalence.","Grabowski, Frederic; Preibisch, Grzegorz; Gizinski, Stanislaw; Kochanczyk, Marek; Lipniacki, Tomasz",Viruses,108,10

Previous research on the impact of increased Sino-African mediated engagements has been inconclusive. Some researchers hold that public opinion toward China in African nations has been improving because of the increased media presence. Others argue that the impact is rather limited, particularly when it comes to affecting how African media cover China-related stories. This article contributes to this debate by exploring the extent to which news media in 30 African countries relied on Chinese news sources to cover China and the COVID-19 outbreak during the first-half of 2020. By computationally analyzing a corpus of 500,000 written news stories, this paper shows that, compared to other major global players (e.g. Reuters, AFP), content distributed by Chinese media (e.g. Xinhua, China Daily) is much less likely to be used by African news organizations, both in English and French speaking countries. The analysis also reveals a gap in the prevailing themes in Chinese and African media?s coverage of the pandemic. The implications of these findings for the sub-field of Sino-African media relations, and the study of global news flows are discussed.","Madrid-Morales, Dani",Global Media and China,108,8

This led to a concern that loneliness may increase, facilitating poorer mental and physical health. Twenty qualitative interviews were conducted, with a diverse group of UK-based men, between January and March 2021, during severe restrictions. Our aim was to generate new insights into mens experience of loneliness during the pandemic, and consider the ramifications of these for continued/future restrictions, the easing of restrictions, and the future beyond the pandemic. Thematic analysis, focused on semantic themes, was employed as part of a grounded epistemology whereby the stated perspectives of the interviewees drove the content of the study. Six themes were constructed: i) people to see and things to do (broken, changed, and new); ii) rethought and renewed recognition of what is important; iii) loneliness with a purpose; iv) loneliness as normal; v) anxiety of social contact; and vi) easier for some than others. The restrictions did cause some loneliness, particularly because of lost routines and opportunities, and the reduction in face-to-face interaction. However, a need to reduce transmission of SARS-COV-2, and a fear of catching it, became important features of participants lives that also affected loneliness and its causes. Remote forms of interaction were often utilised, and though they were imperfect, those that were dependable, were smaller than might be desired in person, and ensured a chance to speak, were constructed as more positive. The fear of Covid-19, and a loss of social skills, may mean that reducing restrictions alone will not return everyone to pre-pandemic levels of loneliness. Some believed the building of supportive local communities, and a destigmatisation of loneliness, may allow for the building of a more compassionate and less lonely society.

These questions have become even more urgent as new variants of concern with enhanced transmissibility, such as Delta, continue to emerge. To shed light on how vaccine breakthrough infections compare with infections in immunologically naive individuals, we examined viral dynamics and infectious virus shedding through daily longitudinal sampling in a small cohort of adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 at varying stages of vaccination. The durations of both infectious virus shedding and symptoms were significantly reduced in vaccinated individuals compared with unvaccinated individuals. We also observed that breakthrough infections are associated with strong tissue compartmentalization and are only detectable in saliva in some cases. These data indicate that vaccination shortens the duration of time of high transmission potential, minimizes symptom duration, and may restrict tissue dissemination.","Ke, Ruian; Martinez, Pamela; Smith, Rebecca Lee; Gibson, Laura; Achenbach, Chad; McFall, Sally; Qi, Chao; Jacob, Joshua; Dembele, Etienne; Bundy, Camille; Simons, Lacy M; Ozer, Egon A; Hultquist, Judd F.; Lorenzo-Redondo, Ramon; Opdycke, Anita; Hawkins, Claudia; Murphy, Robert; Mirza, Agha; Conte, Madison; Gallagher, Nicholas; Luo, Chun Huai; Jarrett, Junko; Conte, Abigail; Zhou, Ruifeng; Farjo, Mireille; Rendon, Gloria; Fields, Christopher J.; Wang, Leyi; Fredrickson, Richard; Baughman, Melinda; Chiu, Karen; Choi, Hannah; Scardina, Kevin; Owens, Alyssa; Broach, John; Barton, Bruce; Lazar, Peter; Robinson, Matthew L; Mostafa, Heba; Manabe, Yukari C; Pekosz, Andrew; McManus, David; Brooke, Christopher B",,108,16

The virus itself may directly result in death, and patients with adrenal insufficiency, often a part of hypopituitarism, are thought to represent a particularly susceptible subgroup. Moreover, even in patients that do not contract the virus, the diversion of resources by healthcare institutions to manage the virus may indirectly result in delays in their management. To this end, the aim of this study was to determine the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with pituitary disease. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was adopted, with all adult patients seen by our pituitary service in the year prior to the nationwide lockdown on March 23rd 2020 invited to participate in a telephone survey. RESULTS: In all, 412 patients (412/586; 70.3%) participated in the survey. 66 patients (66/412; 16.0%) reported having suspected COVID-19 infection. Of the 10 patients in this group tested for COVID-19 infection, three received a positive test result. No deaths due to COVID-19 were identified. 267 patients (267/412; 64.8%) experienced a delay or change in the planned care for their pituitary disease, with 100 patients (100/412; 24.3%) perceiving an impact to their care. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst only a small percentage of patients had confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection, over half were still indirectly impacted by the pandemic through a delay or change to their planned care.","Graf, Anneke; Marcus, Hani J; Baldeweg, Stephanie E",Pituitary,108,1

On September 28, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) contacted CDC to report a COVID-19 outbreak in a state prison (prison A). During October 6-20, a CDC team investigated the outbreak, which began with 12 cases detected from specimens collected during August 17-24 from incarcerated persons housed within the same unit, 10 of whom were transferred together on August 13 and under quarantine following prison intake procedures (intake quarantine). Potentially exposed persons within the unit began a 14-day group quarantine on August 25. However, quarantine was not restarted after quarantined persons were potentially exposed to incarcerated persons with COVID-19 who were moved to the unit. During the subsequent 8 weeks (August 14-October 22), 869 (79.4%) of 1,095 incarcerated persons and 69 (22.6%) of 305 staff members at prison A received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from 172 cases among incarcerated persons showed that all clustered in the same lineage; this finding, along with others, demonstrated that facility spread originated with the transferred cohort. To effectively implement a cohorted quarantine, which is a harm reduction strategy for correctional settings with limited space, CDC's interim guidance recommendation is to serial test cohorts, restarting the 14-day quarantine period when a new case is identified (3). Implementing more effective intake quarantine procedures and available mitigation measures, including vaccination, among incarcerated persons is important to controlling transmission in prisons. Understanding and addressing the challenges faced by correctional facilities to implement medical isolation and quarantine can help reduce and prevent outbreaks.","Hershow, Rebecca B; Segaloff, Hannah E; Shockey, Abigail C; Florek, Kelsey R; Murphy, Sabrina K; DuBose, Weston; Schaeffer, Tammy L; Powell Mph, Jo Anna; Gayle, Krystal; Lambert, Lauren; Schwitters, Amee; Clarke, Kristie E N; Westergaard, Ryan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,108,5

In response to the emergency, we employed bioinformatics methods to investigate the virus's pathogenic mechanism, finding possible control methods. We speculated in previous studies that E protein was associated with viral infectivity. The present study adopted the domain search techniques to analyse the E protein. According to the results, the E protein could bind iron or haem. The iron and haem bound by the E protein came from the attacked haemoglobin and phagocytes. When E protein was attached to haem, it synthesised oxygen and water into superoxide anions, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. When the iron-bound E protein and the haem-bound E protein worked together, they converted superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water. These were the ""ROS attack"" and ""ROS escape"" of the virus. ""ROS attack"" damaged the tissues or cells exposed on the surface of the virus, and ""ROS escape"" decomposed the superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide that attacked the virus. When NK cells were exposed to infected cells, viruses that had not shed from the infected cells' surface damaged them through ""ROS attack"". In addition, lymphocytes such as T cells and B cells, which could be close to the antigen of the virus surface, were also easily damaged or killed by the ""ROS attack"", generating a decrease in lymphocytes. When memory B cells were exposed to the virus's surface antigen, they were also damaged by ""ROS attack"", resulting in the patient's re-infection. The virus applied the ""ROS escape"" to decompose hydrogen peroxide released by phagocytes into oxygen and water. The surrounding cells were replenished with oxygen, and the patient was in a ""happy hypoxia"" state. When the phagocytes swallowed the virus, the E protein converted superoxide anions into oxygen and water. In this way, the virus parasitized in the vesicles of the phagocyte. While virus was in the lysosome, the E protein generated ROS to damage nearby hydrolases. In this way, the virus parasitized the lysosome. Excessive hydroxyl free radicals destroyed the membrane structure of the lysosome, causing the hydrolase release from lysosome, autophagy of phagocytic cells and subsequent cell death. As a result, the colonizing phagocytes of the virus was associated with asymptomatic infection or retest-positive. Briefly, the virus inhibited the immune system through ""ROS escape"", and damaged the immune system by ""ROS attack"". The destruction instigated a strong cytokine storm, leading to organ failure and complications.","Wenzhong, Liu; Hualan, Li",Autoimmunity,108,16

However, rigorous methodological expectations and an ever-expanding body of literature present challenges for researchers to produce timely, high-quality SLRs, which remain up to date at the time of HTA submissions, particularly in rapidly evolving therapeutic areas. Concept: Living systematic reviews are an emerging approach for performing regular updates, with pilot projects published by Cochrane, and more recently a collaboration with the World Health Organisation on the COVID-NMA initiative. To our knowledge, these methods have not yet been adapted and applied in a non-Cochrane setting assessing the relative efficacy and safety of multiple interventions and informing NMA preceding HTA submissions. This concept poster will describe key methodological considerations when planning an ongoing SLR approach to support HTA submissions. RECOMMENDATIONS: • Researchers should prepare a comprehensive, transparent search protocol covering the duration of the ongoing SLR, including consideration of: o Relevant interventions and comparators, including pipeline therapies o Date limits and update frequency o Timing of conference proceedings o Capturing revisions to trial registry data available on Internet sources and publication of results o Record management and plans for clearly reporting methodology and results • Resource planning should consider any overlaps between searches and potential for increased publications following conferences • Future requirements should be considered to minimize protocol amendments • Efficiency and quality may be improved through research team continuity • NMA should be repeated less frequently, on an as-needed basis, with consideration of the impact on the rate of false-positive results Conclusions: Ongoing SLRs can provide a powerful, efficient tool in preparation for upcoming HTA submissions. However, researchers should take care to plan appropriately to overcome potential challenges as the relevant therapeutic landscape expands.","Ahdesmaki, O.; Ainsworth, C.; Bell, J.; Hawe, E.",Value in Health,108,1

There were significant positive effects on sleep satisfaction(p<.01,Î·&#961;2=.49) and non-significant improvements in self-reported global sleep quality(p=.35,Î·&#961;2=.08). There was a significant intervention effect on self-reported time in bed(p=.03,Î·&#961;2=.37) and total sleep time(p=.03,Î·&#961;2=.36), and non-significant improvements in self-reported sleep latency (p=.08,Î·&#961;2=.25), sleep efficiency(p=.27,Î·&#961;2=.11), and daytime sleepiness (p=.52,Î·&#961;2=.04;p=.35,Î·&#961;2=.08;p=.51,Î·&#961;2=.04). There was no significant effect of the intervention on device-measured sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: We provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility and efficacy of a physical activity intervention for reducing RLS severity and potentially improving self-reported sleep outcomes in adults with MS.

Currently, myocardial damage is speculated to be associated with COVID-19, which can be seen as one of the main causes of death of patients with COVID-19. We therefore, aim to investigate the effects of COVID-19 disease on myocardial injury in hospitalized patients who have been tested positive for COVID-19 pneumonia in this study. A prospective study was conducted among 201 patients with COVID-19 in the Pakistan Military Hospital from April 1 to August 31, 2020, including non-critical cases and critical cases. COVID-19 patients were stratified as critical and non-critical according to the signs and symptoms severity; with those requiring intensive care and invasive mechanical ventilation as critical, and those did not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation as non-critical. A total of 201 COVID-19 patients with critical and non-critical categories presented with myocardial injury. All patients with myocardial injury had an elevation in CKMB and Troponin-I levels. Of these patients, 43.7% presented with new electrocardiography (ECG) changes, and ST depression was typically observed in 36.3% patients. In addition, 18.7% patients presented with abnormal echocardiography findings, with right ventricular dilatation and dysfunction commonly seen among critical group patients. Results analyzed by a logistic regression model showing COVID-19 direct contribution to myocardial injury in these patients. COVID-19 disease directly leads to cardiovascular damage among critical and non-critical patients. Myocardial injury is associated not only with abnormal ECG changes but also with myocardial dysfunction on echocardiography and more commonly observed among critical patients.","Liaqat, Anam; Ali-Khan, Rao Saad; Asad, Muhammad; Rafique, Zakia",Sci Rep,108,3

Acute infections are accompanied by a sickness symptom complex (SSC) which is a highly conserved symptom complex that protects against infections and hyperinflammation. Aims: To examine the associations of COVID-19, SSC and the NLPR3 rs10157379 T>C and NLPR3 rs10754558 C>G SNV variants; and the protective role of SSC in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection. MethodsWe recruited COVID-19 patients, 308 with critical, 63 with moderate and 157 with mild disease. ResultsIncreased SSC protects against SARS, critical disease, and death due to COVID-19. Increasing age, male sex and rs10754558 CG significantly predict reduced SSC protection. The rs10157379 CT and rs10754558 GG genotypes are positively associated with SARS. Partial Least Squares analysis shows a) that 41.8% of the variance in critical COVID-19 symptoms could be explained by SSC and oxygen saturation (inversely associated), and inflammation, chest computed tomography abnormalities, increased body mass index, SARS and age (positively associated); and b) the effects of the NLRP3 rs10157379 and rs10754558 variants on critical COVID-19 are mediated via SSC (protective) and SARS (detrimental). SSC includes anosmia, dysgeusia and gastrointestinal symptoms. ConclusionsIntersections among the rs10754558 variant, age, and sex increase risk towards critical COVID-19 by attenuating SSC. NLRP3 variants play an important role in SARS, and severe and critical COVID-19 especially in individuals with reduced SSC, elderly people, and those with increased BMI, hypertension, and diabetes type 2. SSC is a new drug target to combat acute COVID-19.","Maes, Michael; Junior, Walton Luiz Del Tedesco; Lozovoy, Marcell; Mori, Mayara; Danelli, Tiago; Almeida, Elaine de; Tejo, Alexandre; Tano, Zuleica; Reiche, Edna M; Simao, Andea Name",,108,3

We compare 10 syndromic gastrointestinal panels, 14 bacteria-specific multiplex panels, seven parasite-specific multiplex panels, and eight virus-specific multiplex panels.Expert opinion: Thanks to the advances made in the diagnostic approaches for gastrointestinal infections, there are various panels to choose. The choice of a specific syndromic gastrointestinal multiplex panel should be made to improve patient care. Diagnostic syndromic multiplex approaches for gastrointestinal infections should be customized; each hospital should develop its diagnostic algorithm for gastrointestinal infections tailored to its setting, study population, and geographical site.

The incidence of thrombosis among critically ill patients in the literature has been highly variable, ranging from 25 to 69%. Similarly, reported mortality among critically ill patients has been highly variable too, and it has ranged from 30 to 97%. In this study, we analyzed data from a large database to address the incidence, the risk factors leading to thrombotic complications, and mortality rates among COVID-19 patients. Material and methods Data were obtained from TriNetX (TriNetX, Inc., Cambridge, MA), a multinational clinical research platform that collects medical records from 42 healthcare organizations (HCOs). All nominal data were compared using the chi-squared test. Alpha of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used Benjamini-Hochberg correction with a false discovery rate of 0.1 to correct for multiple comparisons. Results We identified 18,652 COVID-19-positive patients, with a median age of 50.7 years [interquartile range (IQR): 31.8-69.6]; among them, 51.8% (9,672) were males and 48.2% (8,951) were females. Of these patients, 630 [3.37%; median age: 61 years (IQR: 44.9-77.1)] were critically ill, requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care within one month of their diagnosis. Men were over-represented among the ICU patients when compared to women (3.7% vs 3%, p=0.009, &#935;2=6.66). African Americans were over-represented among the ICU patients when compared to Caucasians (8.5% vs 4%, p<0.0001, &#935;2=76.65). Older patients, i.e., 65 years and older, were over-represented in the ICU compared to patients aged 18-64 years (6.8% vs 2.5%, p<0.0001, &#935;2=121.43). The cumulative incidence of thrombotic events in the ICU population was 20.4% (129/630). Thrombotic events were significantly more common in patients who were 65 years and older when compared to patients in the age group of 18-64 years (24.6% vs 17.31%, p=0.02, &#935;2=5.38). Mortality among ICU patients was higher in those who were 65 years and older when compared to the age group of 18-64 years (31.9% vs 17.3% p=0.0003, &#935;2=18.41). The overall mortality in the study population was higher in patients who were 65 years and older when compared to patients aged 18-64 years (18.55% vs 1.4%, p<0.0001, &#935;2=1915). Conclusions Among COVID-19 patients, men, African Americans, and people who are 65 years and older are more likely to have severe disease and require ICU level of care. Patients who are 65 years and older are more likely to have thrombotic events, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. Overall mortality and ICU mortality are higher among COVID-19 patients who are 65 years and older.","Avula, Akshay; Nalleballe, Krishna; Toom, Sudhamshi; Siddamreddy, Suman; Gurala, Dhineshreddy; Katyal, Nakul; Maddika, Srikanth; Polavarapu, Abhishek D; Sharma, Rohan; Onteddu, Sanjeeva",Cureus,108,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medline, Scopus and the World Health Organization website were searched for global research on COVID-19 conducted from January 2019 up to 23 April 2020. Study inclusion was restricted to English language publications, original articles that reported the prevalence of co-morbidities in individuals with COVID-19, and case series including more than 10 patients. Eighteen studies were selected for inclusion. Data were analysed using random effects meta-analysis models. RESULTS: Eighteen studies with a total of 14 558 individuals were identified. The pooled prevalence for co-morbidities in patients with COVID-19 disease was 22.9% (95% CI: 15.8 to 29.9) for hypertension, 11.5% (9.7 to 13.4) for diabetes, and 9.7% (6.8 to 12.6) for cardiovascular disease (CVD). For chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), cerebrovascular disease and cancer, the pooled prevalences were all less than 4%. With the exception of cerebrovascular disease, all the other co-morbidities presented a significantly increased risk for having severe COVID-19. In addition, the risk of mortality was significantly increased in individuals with CVD, COPD, CKD, cerebrovascular disease and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In individuals with COVID-19, the presence of co-morbidities (both cardiometabolic and other) is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 and mortality.

In the clinical sample, we found an increase in child-reported internalizing problems measures over the course of the pandemic, but parents reported no differences in internalizing problems measures over the course of the pandemic, nor from pre-pandemic to during the pandemic. Overall, the findings indicate that children and adolescents of both the general and clinical population were affected negatively by the pandemic in terms of their internalizing problems. Attention is therefore warranted to investigate what long-term effects this may cause and to monitor if internalizing problems return back to pre-pandemic levels or if they remain elevated post-pandemic.","Fischer, Karen; Tieskens, Jacintha; Luijten, Michiel; Zijlmans, Josjan; Oers, Hedy van; Groot, Rowdy de; Doelen, Daniel van der; Ewijk, Hanneke van; Klip, Helen; Lans, Rikkert van der; Meyer, Ronald de; Mheen, Malindi van der; Muilekom, Maud van; Ruisch, Hyun; Teela, Lorynn; Berg, Germie van den; Bruining, Hilgo; Rijken, Rachel van der; Buitelaar, Jan; Hoekstra, Pieter; Lindauer, Ramon; Oostrom, Kim; Staal, Wouter; Vermeiren, Robert; Cornet, Ronald; Haverman, Lotte; Bartels, Meike; Polderman, Tinca; Popma, Arne",,108,33

Their diverse existence in marine environments is being researched globally and thus a widely known fact; however, their presence in the freshwater counterpart has gained attention lately only. Riverine systems, the most critical freshwater resources serve as an essential link between terrestrial and marine environments and their contamination with MPs is going to create severe environmental issues. Because of their small size and unique morphology, these polymers can exhibit variable toxicity to the interacting biota and alter their habitat properties; thus, causing serious impacts on the environment and health of living beings, including humans. These microplastics can also interact with pollutants like heavy metals and organic pollutants, which further augment their harming potential. Inefficient and poor plastic waste disposal practices play an important role in the generation of microplastic pollutants. In the present COVID 19 pandemics, the excessive use of plastic to contain the spread of infection has further added the plastic load in the environment which will eventually lead to the generation of microplastic particles. Also, a significant amount of microplastic pollutants in riverine systems are delivered through wastewater treatment plant effluents. These trade-offs create a distress situation in the environment. The present study connects these key issues for a better understanding of the diverse existence of microplastic pollutants, their sources, and fate, with a special emphasis on riverine systems.

This relies on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of single layer graphene (SLG) matrices comprising up to ~12000 individual single crystals (SCs), grown to match the geometrical configuration of the devices in the photonic circuit. This is followed by a transfer approach which guarantees coverage over ~80% of the device area, and integrity for up to 150 mm wafers, with room temperature mobility ~5000 cm2 V-1 s-1. We use this process flow to demonstrate double SLG electro-absorption modulators with modulation efficiency ~0.25, 0.45, 0.75, 1 dB V-1 for device lengths ~30, 60, 90, 120 {\mu}m. The data rate is up to 20 Gbps. Encapsulation with single-layer hBN is used to protected SLG during plasma-enhanced CVD of Si3N4, ensuring reproducible device performance. Our full process flow (from growth to device fabrication) enables the commercial implementation of graphene-based photonic devices.","Giambra, Marco A.; Mivseikis, Vaidotas; Pezzini, Sergio; Marconi, Simone; Montanaro, Alberto; Fabbri, Filippo; Sorianello, Vito; Ferrari, Andrea C.; Coletti, Camilla; Romagnoli, Marco",,108,20

However, no randomized study compared the clinical course of COVID-19 in patients with hematologic cancers to patients with solid cancers. Thus, in this study, we intend to reveal the outcome of COVID-19 in hematologic cancer patients and compare their outcomes with COVID-19 patients with solid cancers. The data of 926 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients, including 463 hematologic cancer patients and an age-gender paired cohort of 463 solid cancer patients, were investigated retrospectively. The frequencies of severe and critical disease, hospital and ICU admission, MV assistance were significantly higher in hematologic cancer patients compared with the solid cancer patients (p = 0.001, p = 0.045, p = 0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). The hospital stay was longer in patients with hematologic cancers (p = 0.001); however, the median ICU stay was 6 days in both groups. The case fatality rate (CFR) was 14.9% in patients with hematologic cancers, and it was 4.8% in patients with solid cancers, and there was a statistically significant difference regarding CFR between groups (p = 0.001). Our study revealed that COVID-19 patients with hematologic cancers have a more aggressive course of COVID-19 and have higher CFR compared to COVID-19 patients with solid cancers and support the increased susceptibility of patients with hematologic cancers during the outbreak.","Basci, Semih; Ata, Naim; Altuntas, Fevzi; Yigenoglu, Tugçe Nur; Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Korkmaz, Serdal; Namdaroglu, Sinem; Bastürk, Abdülkadir; Hacibekiroglu, Tuba; Dogu, Mehmet Hilmi; Berber, Ilhami; Dal, Kürsat; Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Turgut, Burhan; Çelik, Osman; Ülgü, Mustafa Mahir; Birinci, Suayip",Intern. emerg. med,108,1

We further relate the contact angle hysteresis and the pinning force experienced by a droplet on a liquid infused surface, and our predictions for the critical sliding angles are consistent with existing experimental observations. Finally, we discuss why a droplet on a liquid infused surface with partially wetting lubricants typically experiences stronger pinning compared to a droplet on a classical superhydrophobic surface.","Sadullah, Muhammad Subkhi; Panter, Jack R; Kusumaatmaja, Halim",,108,1

When infected, children generally remain asymptomatic or develop mild disease. A small number of pediatric cases required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), respiratory support with a mechanical ventilation and additional life-saving interventions. Even if rarely, death can occur. Aim of this manuscript is to highlight the risk factors associated with severe outcome among pediatric patients with COVID-19. MAIN FINDINGS: Early identification of SARS-CoV-2-infected children at risk of developing severe COVID-19 is vital for service planning, as severely affected pediatric patients require high-quality care and should be followed only where an adequately structured PICU is available. However, early identification of children who must be carefully monitored for substantial risk of severe COVID-19 remains difficult. An underlying comorbidity and heart involvement are frequently observed in severe paediatric cases. Reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction < 60%; diastolic dysfunction; and arrhythmias, including ST segment changes, QTc prolongation, and premature atrial or ventricular beat, are the earliest manifestations of heart involvement. Inclusion of heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function among predictive markers could lead to a more effective evaluation of children at risk with proper selection of those to admit to the PICU and with more adequate treatment in case of more severe clinical manifestations. CONCLUSIONS: To appropriately manage severe pediatric COVID-19 cases, greater attention should be paid to risk factors in children and adolescents, especially to cardiovascular alterations (e.g., heart enzyme serum levels and evaluation of ventricular function). Further studies are needed and the development of a validated score based on all the most common presumed markers of disease severity seems essential.","Esposito, Susanna; Caramelli, Fabio; Principi, Nicola",Ital J Pediatr,108,20

In this work we propose a novel metric, the reachability-heterogeneity (RH), to quantify the vulnerability of each node with respect to a spreading process on a network. We then introduce a dataset consisting of four large engineering projects described by their activity networks, including records of the performance of each activity; such data, describing the spreading of performance fluctuations across activities, can be used as a reliable ground truth for the study of spreading phenomena on networks. We test the validity of the RH metric on these project networks, and discover that nodes scoring low in RH tend to consistently perform better. We also compare RH and seven other node metrics, showing that the former is highly interdependent with activity performance. Given the context agnostic nature of RH, our results, based on real-world data, signify the role that network structure plays with respect to overall project performance.","Pozzana, Iacopo; Ellinas, Christos; Kalogridis, Georgios; Sakellariou, Konstantinos",,108,27

Firstly, considerations for setting up a level III intensive care unit (ICU) include that of space, staff, supplies and standards. Secondly, oxygen supply of the entire hospital is a major determinant of the number of ventilators it can support, including those on non-invasive forms of oxygen therapy. Thirdly, air flows due to positive pressure systems within the OR complex need to be addressed. In addition, due to the worldwide shortage of ICU ventilators, the US Food and Drug Administration has granted temporary approval for the use of anaesthesia gas machines for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Lastly, planning of logistics and staff deployment needs to be carefully considered during a crisis. Although OR and PACU are not designed for long-term care of critically ill patients, they may be adapted for ICU use with careful planning in the current pandemic.","Tan, Zihui; Phoon, Priscilla Hui Yi; Tien, Claudia Jong-Chie; Katijo, Johari; Ng, Shin Yi; Goh, Meng Huat",Ann Acad Med Singap,108,17

Angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is the host receptor by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. Although ACE2 is reported to be expressed in lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney and colon, its expressing levels are rather low, especially in the lung. SARS-CoV-2 may use co-receptors/auxiliary proteins as ACE2 partner to facilitate the virus entry. To identify the potential candidates, we explored the single cell gene expression atlas including 119 cell types of 13 human tissues and analyzed the single cell co-expression spectrum of 51 reported RNA virus receptors and 400 other membrane proteins. Consistent with other recent reports, we confirmed that ACE2 was mainly expressed in lung AT2, liver cholangiocyte, colon colonocytes, esophagus keratinocytes, ileum ECs, rectum ECs, stomach epithelial cells, and kidney proximal tubules. Intriguingly, we found that the candidate co-receptors, manifesting the most similar expression patterns with ACE2 across 13 human tissues, are all peptidases, including ANPEP, DPP4 and ENPEP. Among them, ANPEP and DPP4 are the known receptors for human CoVs, suggesting ENPEP as another potential receptor for human CoVs. We also conducted ""CellPhoneDB"" analysis to understand the cell crosstalk between CoV-targets and their surrounding cells across different tissues. We found that macrophages frequently communicate with the CoVs targets through chemokine and phagocytosis signaling, highlighting the importance of tissue macrophages in immune defense and immune pathogenesis.","Qi, Furong; Qian, Shen; Zhang, Shuye; Zhang, Zheng",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,108,10

Some 15 years ago, the discussion was focused on the backlog problem. Other issues have been regularly debated since then, including the risk of error, need for independence, importance and risk of contextualisation, increasing fragmentation into separate processes and specialisations. Proposed solutions to solve one problem often led to other issues in other parts of the process. This paper attempts to address the apparent crisis using a different perspective, through a comparison with established disciplines, namely material science, medicine and historical science. The comparison with material science shows that, despite the varied organisational and legal models and the interdisciplinary nature of the field, a common element to all forensic science endeavours exists: the trace. A greater focus on the trace might thus help the development of a holistic approach in forensic science. The comparison with medicine demonstrates that, through the overall process, the main risk shifts from the risk to overlook important hypotheses or traces at the beginning of the process (e.g. problems in the detection of traces/symptoms and formulation of hypotheses) to the risk of supporting the wrong hypothesis at the end of the process (e.g. erroneous test of the hypotheses/diagnostic). Further, in medicine, symptoms are rarely evaluated in isolation, while traces are often evaluated separately. By analogy, epidemiology illustrates forensic science's critical role in preventing crime through forensic intelligence, supporting a more extensive and more collaborative application of forensic science in security issues. The comparison with historical science also indicates that a single trace (i.e. the observed effect) is rarely sufficient to reason on its cause. Retrodiction (abduction) is proposed as an alternative reasoning approach to reconstruct events from the past based on signs uncovered in the present. Finally, the impact of science in investigating crimes is presented as an evolving process. A new trace or information can bring an entirely different light on the reconstruction of past events or prevention of future issues. Thus, issues or challenges in the first stages of the process (i.e., crime scene investigation) should be addressed in priority for subsequent stages to function correctly.","Weyermann, Céline; Roux, Claude",Forensic Sci Int,108,1

Some centers continued elective surgery, including esophageal cancer surgery, with the use of preoperative screening methods; however, there is no evidence supporting the safety of this strategy as postoperative outcomes after esophageal cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic have not yet been investigated. METHODS: This multicenter study in four European tertiary esophageal cancer referral centers included consecutive adult patients undergoing elective esophageal cancer surgery from a prospectively maintained database in a COVID-19 pandemic cohort (1 March 2020-31 May 2020) and a control cohort (1 October 2019-29 February 2020). The primary outcome was the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The COVID-19 cohort consisted of 139 patients, versus 168 patients in the control cohort. There was no difference in the rate of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation (13.7% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.127) and number of pulmonary complications (32.4% vs. 29.9%, p = 0.646) between the COVID-19 cohort and the control cohort.

OBJECTIVE: We describe the development of a digital contact tracing system that LTC facilities can use to rapidly identify and contain asymptomatic and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infected contacts. A compartmental model was also developed to simulate disease transmission dynamics and to assess system performance versus conventional methods. METHODS: We developed a compartmental model parameterized specifically to assess the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) transmission in LTC facilities. The model was used to quantify the impact of asymptomatic transmission and to assess the performance of several intervention groups to control outbreaks: no intervention, symptom mapping, polymerase chain reaction testing, and manual and digital contact tracing. RESULTS: Our digital contact tracing system allows users to rapidly identify and then isolate close contacts, store and track infection data in a respiratory line listing tool, and identify contaminated rooms. Our simulation results indicate that the speed and efficiency of digital contact tracing contributed to superior control performance, yielding up to 52% fewer cases than conventional methods. CONCLUSIONS: Digital contact tracing systems show promise as an effective tool to control COVID-19 outbreaks in LTC facilities. As facilities prepare to relax restrictions and reopen to outside visitors, such tools will allow them to do so in a surgical, cost-effective manner that controls outbreaks while safely giving residents back the life they once had before this pandemic hit.","Wilmink, Gerald; Summer, Ilyssa; Marsyla, David; Sukhu, Subhashree; Grote, Jeffrey; Zobel, Gregory; Fillit, Howard; Movva, Satish",JMIR Public Health Surveill,108,11

METHODS: Using a large multi-center electronic health record network, we conducted a comparative cohort study of patients with SARDs diagnosed with COVID-19 (identified by diagnostic code or positive molecular test) versus non-SARD comparators with COVID-19, matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and body mass index (primary model) and comorbidities and health care utilization (extended model). Thirty-day outcomes were assessed, including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, acute renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy (ARF), ischemic stroke, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and death. RESULTS: We initially identified 2,379 SARD patients with COVID-19 (mean age 58 years, 79% female) and 142,750 comparators (mean age 47 years, 54% female). In the primary matched model (2,379 SARD patients and 2,379 matched non-SARD comparators with COVID-19), SARD patients had significantly higher risks of hospitalization (RR 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.26), ICU admission (RR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.68), ARF (RR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.07), and VTE (RR 1.74, 95% CI: 1.23 to 2.45) versus comparators but did not have significantly higher risks of mechanical ventilation or death. In the extended model, all risks were largely attenuated except risk of VTE (RR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.25). CONCLUSIONS: SARD patients with COVID-19 may be at higher risk of hospitalization, ICU admission, ARF, and VTE versus matched comparators.

Cancellation of surgery and appointments, medication shortages and fear of the virus itself may have further challenged wellbeing. We aimed to understand how COVID-19 has affected people with endometriosis. METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, we examined; 1) the impact of COVID-19 on endometriosis related healthcare, symptoms and functioning; and 2) the relationship between a measure of fear of COVID-19 and qualitative impact in 162 women with endometriosis. RESULTS: We found that 60% of women reported impact of the pandemic upon healthcare, with sub-themes documenting the difficulty of cancelled and delayed treatment, specific COVID-19 barriers, and the advantages and disadvantages of telehealth. Only 23% reported negative impact on symptoms, specifically stress; 76% reported impact on daily functioning, with sub-themes related to compromised work, social life and healthy living. A 'hidden benefits' theme revealed ways that COVID-19 had improved some women's lives, including working from home, and the opportunity for healthy lifestyle choices.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended vigorous testing to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory infections to aid in guiding appropriate care and management. Situations like this have demanded robust testing strategies and pooled testing of samples for SARS-CoV-2 virus has provided the solution to mass screening of people for COVID-19. A pooled testing strategy can be very effective in testing when resources are limited, yet it comes with its own limitations. These benefits and limitations need critical consideration when it comes to testing highly infectious diseases like COVID-19. METHODS: This study evaluated the pooled testing of nasopharyngeal swabs for SARS-COV-2 by comparing the sensitivity of individual sample testing with 4-and 8-pool sample testing. Median cycle threshold (Ct) values were compared, and the precision of pooled testing was assessed through an inter- and intra-assay of pooled samples. Coefficient of variance was calculated for inter- and intra-assay variability. RESULTS: The sensitivity becomes considerably lower when the samples are pooled. There is a high percentage of false negative reports with larger sample pool size and when the patient viral load is low or weak positive samples. High variability was seen in the intra- and inter-assay, especially among weak positive samples and when more number of samples are pooled together. CONCLUSION: As COVID - 19 infection numbers and need for testing remain high, we must meticulously evaluate the testing strategy for each country depending on its testing capacity, infrastructure, economic strength, and need to determine the optimal balance on the cost-effective strategy of resource saving and risk/ cost of missing positive patients.","Mahmoud, Sally A; Ibrahim, Esra; Thakre, Bhagyashree; Teddy, Juliet G; Raheja, Preety; Ganesan, Subhashini; Zaher, Walid A",BMC Infect Dis,108,32

To robustly examine whether increases in digital technology use are associated with increases in psychological distress during the pandemic it is crucial to (1) collect objective data on digital technology use and (2) account for potential confounding caused by pandemic-related stressors. METHODS: We conducted a four-wave panel study of U.S. young adults (N=384; Mage = 24.5 ± 5.1; 57% female) from August-November of 2020. Participants provided screenshots of their iPhone ""Screen Time"" application and completed measures assessing current mental health status (depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation) and pandemic-related impacts on well-being. We used random-intercept multilevel models to examine the within- and between-person associations between mental health, objective digital technology use, and pandemic-related stressors. RESULTS: Multilevel analyses revealed that none of the objectively-measured digital technology use variables were positively associated with depression, anxiety, or suicidal ideation at the within- or between-person levels. In contrast, pandemic-related impacts on mental health had by far the largest effects on depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. LIMITATIONS: The convenience-based sample and use of single-item measures of pandemic-related impacts are limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Current speculations about the direct harms of digital technology use on mental health may be unfounded and risk diverting attention from a more likely cause: pandemic-related distress.","Sewall, Craig J R; Goldstein, Tina R; Rosen, Daniel",J Affect Disord,108,1

A cohort study,13.017522,11.141703,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic marks an extraordinary global public health crisis unseen in the last century, with its rapid spread worldwide and associated mortality burden. The longevity of the crisis and disruption to normality is unknown. With COVID-19 set to be a chronic health crisis, clinicians will be required to maintain a state of high alert for an extended period. The support received before and during an incident is likely to influence whether clinicians experience psychological growth or injury. An abundance of information is emerging on disease epidemiology, pathogenesis and infection control prevention. However, literature on interventions for supporting the psychological well-being of healthcare workers during disease outbreaks is limited. This article summarises the available management strategies to increase resilience in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. It focuses on self-care and organisational justice. It highlights various individual as well as organisational strategies. With the success of slowing disease spread in many countries to date, and reduced work-load due to limitations on elective surgery in many institutions, there is more time and opportunity to be pro-active in implementing measures to mitigate or minimise potential adverse psychological effects and improve, restore and preserve the well-being of the workforce now and for years to come. The purpose of this review is to review available literature on strategies for minimising the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinicians and to identify pro-active holistic approaches which may be beneficial for healthcare workers both for the current crisis and into the future.","Heath, C; Sommerfield, A; von Ungern-Sternberg, B S",Anaesthesia,108,12

When discharging COVID-19 patients in accordance with throat or nasal swab protocols using RT-PCR, the potential risk of reintroducing the infection source to humans and the environment must be resolved. Here, 14 patients including 10 COVID-19 subjects were recruited; exhaled breath condensate (EBC), air samples and surface swabs were collected and analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in four hospitals with applied natural ventilation and disinfection practices in Wuhan. Here we discovered that 22.2% of COVID-19 patients (n = 9), who were ready for hospital discharge based on current guidelines, had SARS-CoV-2 in their exhaled breath (~10(5) RNA copies/m(3)). Although fewer surface swabs (3.1%, n = 318) tested positive, medical equipment such as face shield frequently contacted/used by healthcare workers and the work shift floor were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2 (3–8 viruses/cm(2)). Three of the air samples (n = 44) including those collected using a robot-assisted sampler were detected positive by a digital PCR with a concentration level of 9–219 viruses/m(3). RT-PCR diagnosis using throat swab specimens had a failure rate of more than 22% in safely discharging COVID-19 patients who were otherwise still exhaling the SARS-CoV-2 by a rate of estimated ~1400 RNA copies per minute into the air. Direct surface contact might not represent a major transmission route, and lower positive rate of air sample (6.8%) was likely due to natural ventilation (1.6–3.3 m/s) and regular disinfection practices. While there is a critical need for strengthening hospital discharge standards in preventing re-emergence of COVID-19 spread, use of breath sample as a supplement specimen could further guard the hospital discharge to ensure the safety of the public and minimize the pandemic re-emergence risk.","Zhou, Lian; Yao, Maosheng; Zhang, Xiang; Hu, Bicheng; Li, Xinyue; Chen, Haoxuan; Zhang, Lu; Liu, Yun; Du, Meng; Sun, Bochao; Jiang, Yunyu; Zhou, Kai; Hong, Jie; Yu, Na; Ding, Zhen; Xu, Yan; Hu, Min; Morawska, Lidia; Grinshpun, Sergey A.; Biswas, Pratim; Flagan, Richard C.; Zhu, Baoli; Liu, Wenqing; Zhang, Yuanhang",J Aerosol Sci,108,10

To assess the effect of early travel restrictions adopted by the health authorities in China, we have implemented an epidemic metapopulation model that is fed with mobility data corresponding to 2019 and 2020. This allows to compare two radically different scenarios, one with no travel restrictions and another in which mobility is reduced by a travel ban. Our findings indicate that i) travel restrictions might be an effective measure in the short term, however, ii) they are ineffective when it comes to completely eliminate the disease. The latter is due to the impossibility of removing the risk of seeding the disease to other regions. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of developing more realistic models of behavioral changes when a disease outbreak is unfolding.","Aleta, Alberto; Hu, Qitong; Ye, Jiachen; Ji, Peng; Moreno, Yamir",Chaos Solitons Fractals,108,7

Seroprevalence rate in recovered COVID-19 patients help us to identify individual with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and its protective nature. The objective of present study was to evaluate seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among potential convalescent plasma donors and analysis of their deferral reasons. Materials and Methods: A total 400 potential convalescent plasma donors were enrolled over five-month period for this prospective study. Inclusion criteria were lab confirmed COVID-19 recovered patients and 14 days of symptoms free period. All prospective plasmapheresis donors were tested for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibody through chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay, CBC, serum protein, blood grouping along with other required test for normal blood donation as per Drugs & Cosmetics Act. After pre donation testing and medical examination if donor was found to be ineligible for plasmapheresis was deferred. Seroprevalence rate was calculated by positive IgG antibody test results among the potential plasma donors. Results: Seroprevalence rate was 87% for IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in prospective convalescent plasma donors (recovered COVID-19 patients). There was no significant difference in seroprevalence rate between different sub-groups with respect to gender, age, blood groups, Rh factor, mode of treatment, day of Ab testing and repeat plasma donation. Most common reason for their deferral was absent IgG SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (13%) followed by absenteeism of eligible screen donors (6.7%), low Hb (1.7%) and poor veins for plasmapheresis (1.7%). Till five-month study period none of the plasmapheresis develop symptoms of reinfection with COVID-19. Conclusion: 13% recovered patients did not develop IgG antibodies after SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies persist for quite some time and are protective against reinfection. More long-term serology studies are needed to understand better antibody response kinetics and duration of persistence of IgG antibodies.","Jain, Romesh; Mallya, M.

Methods: The retrospective cohort study was done in Holy Family Red Crescent Medical College Hospital from May to September 2020. All 112 patients who were admitted to ICU as COVID-19 cases (confirmed by RT-PCR of the nasopharyngeal swab) were included in the study. Demographic data, laboratory reports of predictive biomarkers, treatment schedule, and duration of ICU-stay of 99 patients were available and obtained from hospital records (non-electronic) and treatment sheets, and compared between the survived and deceased patients. Results: Out of 99 patients admitted in ICU with COVID-19, 72 were male and 27 were female. The mean age was 61.08 years. Most of the ICU patients were in the 60 - 69 years of age group and the highest mortality rates (35.89%) were observed in this age range. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the predominant comorbidities in the deceased group of patients. A significant difference was observed in neutrophil count, creatinine and, NLR, d-NLR levels that raised in deceased patients. There was no significant difference as a survival outcome of antiviral drugs remdesivir or favipiravir, while the use of cephalosporin was found much higher in the survived group than the deceased group (46.66% vs 20.51%) in ICU. Conclusions: Susceptibility to developing critical illness due to COVID-19 was found more in comorbid males aged more than 60 years. There were wide variations of the biomarkers in critical COVID-19 patients in a different population, which put the healthcare workers into far more challenge to minimize the mortality in ICU in Bangladesh and around the globe during the peak of the pandemic.","Nasir, M.; Perveen, R.

In search for therapeutic options, researchers have proposed resveratrol, a food supplement with known antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties as an advantageous antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we provide evidence that both resveratrol and its metabolically more stable structural analog, pterostilbene, exhibit potent antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. First, we show that resveratrol and pterostilbene antiviral activity in African green monkey kidney cells. Both compounds actively inhibit virus replication within infected cells as reduced virus progeny production was observed when the compound was added at post-inoculation conditions. Without replenishment of the compound, antiviral activity was observed up to roughly five rounds of replication, demonstrating the long-lasting effect of these compounds. Second, as the upper respiratory tract represents the initial site of SARS-CoV-2 replication, we also assessed antiviral activity in air–liquid interface (ALI) cultured human primary bronchial epithelial cells, isolated from healthy volunteers. Resveratrol and pterostilbene showed a strong antiviral effect in these cells up to 48 h post-infection. Collectively, our data indicate that resveratrol and pterostilbene are promising antiviral compounds to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because these results represent laboratory findings in cells, we advocate evaluation of these compounds in clinical trials before statements are made whether these drugs are advantageous for COVID-19 treatment.","ter Ellen, Bram M.; Dinesh Kumar, Nilima; Bouma, Ellen M.; Troost, Berit; van de Pol, Denise P.I.; van der Ende-Metselaar, Heidi H.; Apperloo, Leonie; van Gosliga, Djoke; van den Berge, Maarten; Nawijn, Martijn C.; van der Voort, Peter H.J.; Moser, Jill; Rodenhuis-Zybert, Izabela A.; Smit, Jolanda M.",Viruses,108,28

The review presents methods and techniques to improve sensitivity in monitoring vital signs, such as the use of doping agents or coatings for optical fiber (OF) that provide stability and resistance to the external factors from which they must be protected in in vivo situations. It has been observed that most of these sensors work with single-mode optical fibers (SMF) in a spectral range of 1550 nm, while only some work in the visible spectrum (Vis); the vast majority, operate through fiber Bragg gratings (FBG), long-period fiber gratings (LPFG), and interferometers. These sensors have brought great advances to the measurement of vital signs, especially with regard to respiratory rate; however, many express the possibility of monitoring other vital signs through mathematical calculations, algorithms, or auxiliary devices.

It is characterized by fever, progressive shortness of breath, joint swelling and skin ulcerations. (1) There is invariable hyper-ferritinemia and radiographically there is a pattern of diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities. Complications with spontaneous pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are not uncommon. Diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy as well as serum antibodies against MDA5. A known trigger is viral infection. (2) CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit on account of respiratory failure and shock. He had a progressive Illness that started 4 days after receiving a novel mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine. He developed bilateral extremities edema, oral sores, worsening fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. He failed outpatient treatment for empiric pneumonia as well as prednisone for vaccine reaction. He presented to the hospital with fever, progressive dyspnea and fatigue. On physical exam he had oral blisters, digital tip ischemia and ulceration. His vital signs were pertinent for a SpO2 of 90% on ventilator support. A chest CT revealed diffuse and sub-pleural ground-glass opacities.There was an extensive negative infectious work up from serum, urine and BAL samples. These included negative SARS COV2 Antigen and SARS-Cov2 IgG. His inflammatory markers were pertinent for a positive ANA with titer of 1:320, Ferritin of 2,143 mcg/L, LDH of 1,105 U/L and CRP of 2.7mg/dL. Based on this information the differential for amyopathic dermatomyositis with progressive interstitial lung disease was considered. A skin biopsy of his index finger confirmed the diagnosis. His therapeutic interventions through his hospitalization included a trial of stress dose steroids, cyclophosphamide, IVIG, colchicine and tacrolimus. His ICU course was complicated by pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax and pericardial effusion. These were managed by placing a chest tube thoracotomy and pericardial drain respectively. His plan of care was changed to comfort measures after he had a drastic and prolonged desaturation episode without recovery. DISCUSSION: For conditions that lead to cytokine storm with subsequent development of ARDS or multi-organ dysfunction;there is a progressive clinical deterioration and high risk of death. We had insufficient evidence to definitively demonstrate a direct correlation between the vaccination and the patient's illness. CONCLUSIONS: In conditions that lead to Cytokine storm with multi-organ dysfunction targeting timely control of this inflammatory cascade via immunomodulation, cytokine antagonist and reduction of inflammatory cell infiltration in particular early in the process could lead to a reduction in mortality.

They have evolved in concert with their hosts and are usually associated with symptomless infections. Mycoviruses are transmitted intracellularly during cell division, sporogenesis and cell fusion, and they lack an extracellular phase to their life cycles. Their natural host ranges are limited to individuals within the same or closely related vegetative compatibility groups. Typically, fungal viruses are isometric particles 25–50 nm in diameter, and possess dsRNA genomes. The best characterized of these belong to the family Totiviridae whose members have simple undivided dsRNA genomes comprised of a coat protein (CP) gene and an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) gene. A recently characterized totivirus infecting a filamentous fungus was found to be more closely related to protozoan totiviruses than to yeast totiviruses suggesting these viruses existed prior to the divergence of fungi and protozoa. Although the dsRNA viruses at large are polyphyletic, based on RDRP sequence comparisons, the totiviruses are monophyletic. The theory of a cellular self-replicating mRNA as the origin of totiviruses is attractive because of their apparent ancient origin, the close relationships among their RDRPs, genome simplicity and the ability to use host proteins efficiently. Mycoviruses with bipartite genomes (partitiviruses), like the totiviruses, have simple genomes, but the CP and RDRP genes are on separate dsRNA segments. Because of RDRP sequence similarity, the partitiviruses are probably derived from a totivirus ancestor. The mycoviruses with unencapsidated dsRNA-like genomes (hypoviruses) and those with bacilliform (+) strand RNA genomes (barnaviruses) have more complex genomes and appear to have common ancestry with plant (+) strand RNA viruses in supergroup 1 with potyvirus and sobemovirus lineages, respectively. The La France isometric virus (LIV), an unclassified virus with multipartite dsRNA genome, is associated with a severe die-back disease of the cultivated mushroom. LIV appears to be of recent origin since it differs from its host in codon usage.","Ghabrial, Said A.",Virus Genes,108,1

Corticosteroids may diminish the inflammatory response, a major factor for lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome in viral respiratory tract infection. However, previous studies on corticosteroid therapy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus illustrated delayed viral clearance, with no survival benefit and perhaps even adverse outcomes.2 Some patients with COVID-19 exhibit biphasic disease evolution with a mild presentation followed by a secondary respiratory deterioration due to a cytokine storm, despite decreasing viral load.2 Therefore, timing of corticosteroid therapy might be particularly consequential, with early administration reducing inflammatory response and viral clearance during the initial phase.","Sichitiu, Joanna; Fakhouri, Fadi; Desseauve, David",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,108,16

This study described the clinical characteristics of children admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and explored factors associated with the need for invasive ventilation or mortality. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective, cohort study was conducted over eight medical centers, including all patients younger than 18 years of age and admitted to the ICU due to a direct consequence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients who were admitted to the ICU for any alternate reason and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by screening test, and patients who were admitted due to multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, were excluded. Demographic, laboratory, imaging, and clinical data were collected. Descriptive statistics were used to compare survivors and non-survivors. Fine and Gray’s hazard model was used to estimate the association between clinical variables and ICU death. RESULTS: During the study period, 25 pediatric COVID-19 patients received care in the ICUs. The median age was 2.78 years (IQR 0.21–8.51), and 60% were male. Only three patients were reported to be previously healthy at admission. Nine (36%) patients required invasive mechanical ventilation, including two were on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Four (16%) patients died during ICU care. In univariate analysis, the presence of comorbidity (HR 0.0001; 95%CI 0.00001–0.00016), platelets count (HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.98–0.99), elevated procalcitonin (HR 1.05; 95%CI 1.016–1.09), and circulatory compromise (HR 16.34; 95%CI 1.99–134.35), all at the time of ICU admission, were associated with in-ICU mortality. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that children admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 infection, generally, have a favorable outcome.

METHODS: We analyzed cyclicity and synchronicity in cases of COVID-19 infection and time series of deaths using Fourier transform, its inverse method, and statistical treatments. Epidemiological indices (e.g., case fatality rate) were used to quantify the observations in the time series. The possible causes of short-term variations are reviewed. RESULTS: We observed that were both short-term and long-term variations in the COVID-19 time series. The short cycles were 7 days and synchronized among all countries. This periodicity is believed to be caused by weekly cycles in community social factors, combined with diagnostic and reporting cycles. This could also be related to virus–host–community dynamics. CONCLUSION: The observed synchronized weekly cycles could serve as herd defense by providing a form of social distancing in time. The effect of such temporal distancing could be enhanced if combined with spatial distancing. Integrated spatiotemporal distancing is therefore recommended to optimize infection control strategies, taking into account the quiescent and active intervals of COVID-19.","Derakhshan, Mahnaz; Ansarian, Hamid Reza; Ghomshei, Mory",J Int Med Res,108,21

Due to lack of comparable incidence data and challenges with disentangling differences in susceptibility from different exposure risks, data are insufficient to determine whether pregnancy increases susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data support pregnancy as a risk factor for severe disease associated with COVID-19; some of the best evidence comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) COVID-19 surveillance system, which reported that pregnant persons were more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), require invasive ventilation, require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and die compared with nonpregnant women of reproductive age. Although intrauterine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been documented, it appears to be rare, possibly related to low levels of SARS-CoV-2 viremia and decreased co-expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) needed for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells in the placenta. Evidence is accumulating that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with a number of adverse pregnancy outcomes including preeclampsia, preterm birth, and stillbirth, especially among pregnant persons with severe COVID-19 disease. In addition to the direct impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy outcomes, there is evidence that the pandemic and its effects on healthcare systems have had adverse effects on pregnancy outcomes, such as increased stillbirths and maternal deaths. These trends may represent widening disparities and an alarming reversal of recent improvements in maternal and infant health. All three COVID-19 vaccines currently available under an Emergency Use Authorization by the United States Food and Drug Administration can be administered to pregnant or lactating persons, with no preference for vaccine type. Although safety data in pregnancy are rapidly accumulating and no safety signals in pregnancy have been detected, additional information about birth outcomes, particularly among persons vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, are needed.","Jamieson, Denise J.; Rasmussen, Sonja A.",Am J Obstet Gynecol,108,26

Design Retrospective cohort Setting and Participants: 73 community-dwelling adults ≥65 years admitted for post-acute care from two SNFs from March 15th, 2020, to May 30th, 2020. Measure (s): COVID-19 status was determined from chart review. Frailty was measured with a deficit accumulation frailty index, categorized into non-frail, mild frailty, and moderate-to-severe frailty. The primary outcome was community discharge. Secondary outcomes included change in functional status from SNF admission to discharge, based on modified Barthel index (mBI) and continuous functional scale scored by physical (PT) and occupational therapists (OT). Results Among 73 admissions (31 COVID-19 negative, 42 COVID-19 positive), mean (SD) age was 83.5 (8.8) and 42 (57.5%) were female, with mean frailty index of 0.31 (0.01) with no differences by COVID-19 status. The mean length of SNF stay for rehabilitation was 21.2 days (SD 11.1) for COVID-19 negative with 20 (64.5%) patients discharged to community, compared to 23.0 (SD 12.2) and 31 (73.8%) among COVID-19 positive patients. Among those discharged to the community, all groups improved in mBI, PT, and OT score. Those with moderate-to-severe frailty (FI >0.35) had lower mBI scores on discharge (92.0 [6.7] not frail, 81.0 [15.4] mild frailty, 48.6 [20.4] moderate-to-severe frailty; p=0.002), lower PT scores on discharge (54.2 [3.9] non-frail, 51.5 [8.0] mild frailty, 37.1 [9.7] moderate-to-severe frailty; p=0.002), and lower OT score on discharge (52.9 [3.2] non-frail, 45.8 [9.4] mild frailty, 32.4 [7.4] moderate or worse frailty; p=0.001). Conclusions and Implications Older adults admitted to a SNF for post-acute care with COVID-19 had community discharge rates and functional improvement comparable to a COVID-19 negative group.

Moreover, students’ socioeconomic status and demographic variables were examined. Partial least square modeling and cluster analysis were performed on the survey data collected from 695 students. The findings show that mental load and mental effort were positively related to academic burnout, which was significantly negatively associated with student engagement in online learning. Digital competence did not directly affect academic burnout, but indirectly via its counteracting effect on cognitive load. However, help-seeking and agency were not found to be significantly negatively related to cognitive load. Among the three SDT constructs, digital competence demonstrated the greatest positive influence on student engagement. In addition, female students from humanities and social sciences disciplines and lower-income families seemed to demonstrate the weakest digital competence, lowest learning agency, and least help-seeking behaviors. Consequently, they were more vulnerable to high cognitive load and academic burnout, leading to the lowest learning engagement. This study contributes to the ongoing arguments related to the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and informs the development of efficient interventions that preserve university students’ psychological well-being in online learning.","Wang, Xinghua; Zhang, Ruixue; Wang, Zhuo; Li, Tiantian",Front Psychol,108,0

Based on this data, the study identified factors that could have facilitated or hindered its sustainability and documented the rationale to suspend the on-demand activities included in the program and limit activities to the care of populations under municipal responsibility (day-care centers, schools and colleges, markets, elder care programs, and employees) and patients with identified cardiometabolic risk. The insufficient institutionalization of the program, conceived as a project with an insufficient vision of its sustainability in time, was mentioned as a possible obstacle by leaders and operational staff.

Plasma NET levels peaked early after ICU admission and correlated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA load in sputum and levels of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and inflammatory markers in plasma. Baseline plasma NET quantity correlated with disease severity, but was not associated with soluble markers of thrombosis nor with development of thrombosis. High NET levels were present in LRT samples and persisted during the course of COVID-19, consistent with the detection of NETs in bronchi and alveolar spaces in lung tissue from fatal COVID-19 patients.

El propósito de este trabajo es compartir nuestra experiencia en el manejo del paciente post-COVID-19 en dos instituciones que han tenido una elevada incidencia de la COVID-19 y proponer unas recomendaciones generales de seguimiento desde una perspectiva clínica y radiológica. Objective To describe the computed tomography (CT) findings in patients with COVID-19 in different phases of the disease and to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of a visual radiologic score to estimate the lung inflammatory burden. Methods We retrospectively reviewed chest CT studies from 182 patients with RT-PCR findings positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patients were classified according to the time elapsed from the onset of symptoms, as follows: early (0-4 days), intermediate/progressive (5-9 days), or advanced (≥10 days). We analyzed the frequency of each radiologic finding, as well as the predominant pattern, appearance, and distribution of lung involvement. A visual tomographic score (range, 0-25) was used to estimate the inflammatory in each lobe and in the entire lung volume. Results The predominant CT finding was the ground-glass pattern (n=110; 60.4%), the most common distribution was peripheral (n = 116; 66.7%), and the most prevalent appearance was typical (n=112; 61.5%). The halo sign was seen most frequently in the early phase, whereas ground-glass opacities, the crazy paving pattern, and subpleural bands were more common in the intermediate/progressive and advanced phases. The median severity score was 10 (IQR: 5-13), and the scores increased as the disease progressed. The interobserver agreement (kappa) was 0.89 for the visual score.

Sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome from patient samples is an important epidemiological tool for monitoring and responding to the pandemic, including the emergence of new mutations in specific communities. METHODS. SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences were generated from positive samples collected, along with epidemiological metadata, at a walk-up, rapid testing site in the Mission District of San Francisco, California during November 22-December 2, 2020 and January 10-29, 2021. Secondary household attack rates and mean sample viral load were estimated and compared across observed variants. RESULTS. A total of 12,124 tests were performed yielding 1,099 positives. From these, 811 high quality genomes were generated. Certain viral lineages bearing spike mutations, defined in part by L452R, S13I, and W152C, comprised 54.9% of the total sequences from January, compared to 15.7% in November. Household contacts exposed to “West Coast” variants were at higher risk of infection compared to household contacts exposed to lineages lacking these variants (0.357 vs 0.294, RR=1.29; 95% CI:1.01-1.64). The reproductive number was estimated to be modestly higher than other lineages spreading in California during the second half of 2020. Viral loads were similar among persons infected with West Coast versus non-West Coast strains, as was the proportion of individuals with symptoms (60.9% vs 64.1%). CONCLUSIONS. The increase in prevalence, relative household attack rates, and reproductive number are consistent with a modest transmissibility increase of the West Coast variants; however, additional laboratory and epidemiological studies are required to better understand differences between these variants.","Peng, James; Mann, Sabrina A; Mitchell, Anthea M; Liu, Jamin; Laurie, Matthew T.; Sunshine, Sara; Pilarowski, Genay; Ayscue, Patrick; Kistler, Amy; Vanaerschot, Manu; Li, Lucy M.; McGeever, Aaron; Chow, Eric D.; Team, IDseq; Marquez, Carina; Nakamura, Robert; Rubio, Luis; Chamie, Gabriel; Jones, Diane; Jacobo, Jon; Rojas, Susana; Rojas, Susy; Tulier-Laiwa, Valerie; Black, Douglas; Martinez, Jackie; Naso, Jamie; Schwab, Joshua; Petersen, Maya; Havlir, Diane; DeRisi, Joseph",medRxiv,108,16

Yet, there are genetically- and antigenically-related lyssaviruses, all capable of causing the disease rabies, circulating globally among bats without causing conspicuous disease outbreaks. The species richness and greater genetic diversity of African lyssaviruses, along with the lack of antibody cross-reactivity among them, has led to the hypothesis that Africa is the origin of lyssaviruses. This hypothesis was tested using a probabilistic phylogeographical approach. The nucleoprotein gene sequences from 153 representatives of 16 lyssavirus species, collected between 1956 and 2015, were used to develop a phylogenetic tree which incorporated relevant geographic and temporal data relating to the viruses. In addition, complete genome sequences from all 16 (putative) species were analysed. The most probable ancestral distribution for the internal nodes was inferred using three different approaches and was confirmed by analysis of complete genomes. These results support a Palearctic origin for lyssaviruses (posterior probability = 0.85), challenging the ‘out of Africa’ hypothesis, and suggest three independent transmission events to the Afrotropical region, representing the three phylogroups that form the three major lyssavirus clades.","Hayman, David T.

In this report, we focus our attention on the Veneto Region, in the North-East of Italy, which is one of the areas that were first affected by the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. We aim to evaluate the trend of all-cause mortality and to give a description of the characteristics of the studied population. METHODS: Data used in the analyses were released by the majority of municipalities and cover the 93% of the total population living in the Veneto Region. We evaluated the trend of overall mortality from Jan.01 to Jun.30. 2020. Moreover we compared the COVID-19-related deaths to the overall deaths. RESULTS: From March 2020, the overall mortality rate increased exponentially, affecting males and people aged > 76 the most. The confirmed COVID-19-related death rate in the Veneto region between Mar.01 and Apr.302020 is 30 per 100,000 inhabitants. In contrast, the all-cause mortality increase registered in the same months in the municipalities included in the study is 219 per 100,000 inhabitants.

These injuries are the result of high shear stresses acting on the skin, caused by friction with the PPE. This study aims to provide a practical lubricating solution for frontline medical staff working a 4+ hours shift wearing PPE. METHODS: A literature review into skin friction and skin lubrication was conducted to identify products and substances that can reduce friction. We evaluated the lubricating performance of commercially available products in vivo using a custom-built tribometer. FINDINGS: Most lubricants provide a strong initial friction reduction, but only few products provide lubrication that lasts for four hours. The response of skin to friction is a complex interplay between the lubricating properties and durability of the film deposited on the surface and the response of skin to the lubricating substance, which include epidermal absorption, occlusion, and water retention. INTERPRETATION: Talcum powder, a petrolatum-lanolin mixture, and a coconut oil-cocoa butter-beeswax mixture showed excellent long-lasting low friction. Moisturising the skin results in excessive friction, and the use of products that are aimed at ‘moisturising without leaving a non-greasy feel’ should be prevented. Most investigated dressings also demonstrate excellent performance.","Masen, Marc A.; Chung, Aaron; Dawczyk, Joanna U.; Dunning, Zach; Edwards, Lydia; Guyott, Christopher; Hall, Thomas A.

There have been many studies seeking to explore the correlations between COVID-19 clinical outcomes and various clinical variables, including age, sex, race, underlying medical problems, and social habits. In particular, the relationship between smoking and COVID-19 outcome is controversial, with multiple conflicting reports in the current literature. In this study, we aim to analyze how smoking may affect the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate. We analyzed sequencing data from lung and oral epithelial samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that the receptor and transmembrane protease necessary for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, respectively, were upregulated in smoking samples from both lung and oral epithelial tissue. We then explored the mechanistic hypothesis that smoking may upregulate ACE2 expression through the upregulation of the androgen pathway. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 upregulation were both correlated to androgen pathway enrichment and the specific upregulation of central pathway regulatory genes. These data provide a potential model for the increased susceptibility of smoking patients to COVID-19 and encourage further exploration into the androgen and tobacco upregulation of ACE2 to understand the potential clinical ramifications.","Chakladar, Jaideep; Shende, Neil; Li, Wei Tse; Rajasekaran, Mahadevan; Chang, Eric Y.; Ongkeko, Weg M.",Int J Mol Sci,108,1

Most of the evidence regarding the use of nivolumab in this setting is provided within clinical trials with strict inclusion criteria. This multicenter retrospective cohort study evaluates the real-world outcomes of nivolumab use in four major cancer centers in England. This study demonstrates similar progression free survival and overall survival as that seen in the CHECKMATE-141 study. In addition, it demonstrates that nivolumab tends to be well tolerated, with only a 15% rate of immune-related toxicity. Our findings support the findings of other real-world studies that demonstrate improved progression free survival and potentially overall survival for those who have immune-related toxicity. ABSTRACT: Nivolumab is an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody currently used as immunotherapy for patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with evidence of disease progression after platinum-based chemotherapy. This study evaluates real-world safety and treatment outcomes of non-trial nivolumab use. A retrospective multicenter cohort study of patients with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC treated with nivolumab between January 2017 and March 2020 was performed. Overall, 123 patients were included. The median age was 64 years, the majority of patients were male (80.5%) and had a smoking history (69.9%). Primary outcomes included overall response rate (ORR) of 19.3%, median progression-free survival (PFS) of 3.9 months, 1-year PFS rate of 16.8%, a median overall survival (OS) of 6.5 months and 1-year OS rate of 28.6%. These results are comparable to the CHECKMATE-141 study. Of 27 patients who had PD-L1 status tested, positive PD-L1 status did not significantly affect PFS (p = 0.86) or OS (p = 0.84). Nivolumab was well tolerated with only 15.1% experiencing immune-related toxicities (IRT) and only 6.7% of patients stopping due to toxicity. The occurrence of IRT appeared to significantly affect PFS (p = 0.01) but not OS (p = 0.07). Nivolumab in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC is well tolerated and may be more efficacious in patients who develop IRT.","Vasiliadou, Ifigenia; Breik, Omar; Baker, Holly; Leslie, Isla; Sim, Van Ren; Hegarty, Gemma; Michaelidou, Andriana; Nathan, Kannon; Hartley, Andrew; Good, James; Sanghera, Paul; Fong, Charles; Urbano, Teresa Guerrero; Lei, Mary; Petkar, Imran; Ferreira, Miguel Reis; Nutting, Chris; Wong, Kee Howe; Newbold, Kate; Harrington, Kevin; Bhide, Shree; Kong, Anthony",Cancers (Basel),108,24

The exponentially spreading pandemic of COVID-19 deserves prime public health attention to evaluate yet unexplored arenas of management. We opine that one of these treatment options is low dose radiation therapy for severe and most critical cases. There is evidence in literature that low dose radiation induces an anti-inflammatory phenotype that can potentially afford therapeutic benefit against COVID-19- related complications that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Herein, we review the effects and putative mechanisms of low dose radiation that may be viable, useful and of value in counter-acting the acute inflammatory state induced by critical stage COVID-19.","Dhawan, Gaurav; Kapoor, Rachna; Dhawan, Rajiv; Singh, Ravinder; Monga, Bharat; Giordano, James; Calabrese, Edward J.",Radiother Oncol,108,16

However, design-based learning is mostly based on forward engineering, in which students’ design thinking can be nurtured by designing unknown solutions. Little is known about whether design thinking can be facilitated in the context of reverse engineering, when students learn from already designed products. This study therefore seeks to explore the perceptions of 38 ninth-grade students on the characteristics of design thinking before and after a four-week reverse engineering project, using Likert scales to measure six aspects of design thinking, namely (a) being comfortable with uncertainty and risks, (b) human-centeredness, (c) mindfulness to the process and impacts on others, (d) collaboratively working with diversity, (e) orientation to learning by making and testing, and (f) being confident and optimistic to use creativity. The data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics, including means, standard deviations, paired-samples t-tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. The results indicate that two aspects, human-centeredness and being confident and optimistic to use creativity, were significant (p = 0.008 and p = 0.043, respectively), with size effects of 0.43 and 0.34, respectively. Based on this potential, reverse engineering can be a design-based learning approach to facilitate students’ design thinking. It is recommended that instructional activities involving reverse engineering maintain some degree of ambiguity and risk to prevent design fixation among students.","Ladachart, Luecha; Cholsin, Jaroonpong; Kwanpet, Sawanya; Teerapanpong, Ratree; Dessi, Alisza; Phuangsuwan, Laksanawan; Phothong, Wilawan",Int J Technol Des Educ,108,18

This review was conducted using MEDLINE PubMed), Embase, IEEE, and Google Scholar. Expert opinions were collected to show existence gaps, useful technologies for each phase of emergency management, and future direction. Results indicated that various IT-based systems such as surveillance systems, artificial intelligence, computational methods, Internet of things, remote sensing sensor, online service, and GIS geographic information system) could have different outbreak management applications, especially in response phases. Information technology was applied in several aspects, such as increasing the accuracy of diagnosis, early detection, ensuring healthcare providers’ safety, decreasing workload, saving time and cost, and drug discovery. We categorized these applications into four core topics, including diagnosis and prediction, treatment, protection, and management goals, which were confirmed by five experts. Without applying IT, the control and management of the crisis could be difficult on a large scale. For reducing and improving the hazard effect of disaster situations, the role of IT is inevitable. In addition to the response phase, communities should be considered to use IT capabilities in prevention, preparedness, and recovery phases. It is expected that IT will have an influential role in the recovery phase of COVID-19. Providing IT infrastructure and financial support by the governments should be more considered in facilitating IT capabilities.","Asadzadeh, Afsoon; Pakkhoo, Saba; Saeidabad, Mahsa Mirzaei; Khezri, Hero; Ferdousi, Reza",Inform Med Unlocked,108,1

As the rise of antimicrobial resistance reaches “alarming” levels according to the World Health Organization, the importance of using biomarkers, such as PCT to limit unnecessary antibiotic exposure has further increased. Randomized trials in patients with respiratory tract infections have shown that PCT has prognostic implications and its use, embedded in stewardship protocols, leads to reductions in the use of antibiotics in different clinical settings without compromising clinical outcomes. However, available data are heterogeneous and recent trials found no significant benefit. Still, from these trials, we have learned several key considerations for the optimal use of PCT, which depend on the clinical setting, severity of presentation, and pretest probability for bacterial infection. For patients with respiratory infections and sepsis, PCT can be used to determine whether to initiate antimicrobial therapy in low-risk settings and, together with clinical data, whether to discontinue antimicrobial therapy in certain high-risk settings. There is also increasing evidence regarding PCT-guided therapy in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

While CEE migrants in Japan benefit from being perceived as implicitly white and Western ‘foreigners’, their whiteness represents a form of enduring exclusion from the ethno-nationalist Japanese society. In the UK, changing political contexts and internal European hierarchies of whiteness contribute to CEE migrants’ ambiguous position in an increasingly anti-migrant society.

Healthcare providers had to alter practice patterns and research priorities. We assessed the frequency of acute respiratory illnesses (ARI) in children, notably those due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza, before and during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted multi-center active prospective ARI surveillance in children as part of the New Vaccine Surveillance Network. Children < 18 years with fever and/or respiratory symptoms were enrolled in emergency department and inpatient settings at seven US medical centers over four respiratory seasons during 2016–2020 (Fig 1). Pandemic-related restrictions to patient access limited enrollment in some sites beginning March 2020. Respiratory specimens were collected and tested at each site for RSV and influenza by qRT-PCR. Data were analyzed by calendar weeks. We compared the cumulative proportions of RSV and influenza detection after week 13 in 2020 to the previous seasons using Fisher’s exact test. Figure 1. Numbers of Eligible and Enrolled Acute Respiratory Illness Cases, and Proportions of RSV and Influenza Detection by Week, Stratified by Study Season [Image: see text] RESULTS: Of 44,247 eligible children, 25,375 (57%) were enrolled and tested for RSV and/or influenza. A total of 6351/25375 (25%) and 3446/25372 (14%) children were RSV and influenza-positive over the four seasons, respectively. In 2020, we noted a rapid drop in eligible and enrolled ARI subjects after weeks 11–13 (Fig 1). During weeks 13–18 in 2016–2019, the three-year average of eligible and enrolled subjects was 1802 and 978, respectively. However, over the same period in 2020, there were 675 eligible and 278 enrolled subjects, representing declines of 62.5% and 71.6% respectively (Fig 1). In 2020, there were no RSV or influenza cases detected in weeks 15–18, and the cumulative proportions of RSV and influenza detection after week 13 were lower compared to previous seasons (p< 0.001) (Figs 1 and 2). Figure 2. Cumulative Proportions of Weekly RSV and Influenza Detection by Study Season [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: There was a considerable decline in ARI visits and the proportion of RSV and influenza detection across seven distinct geographic sites during the pandemic compared with previous seasons.

Initial supply is likely to be limited and will require a judicious vaccination strategy until supply is unrestricted. If vaccines have efficacy as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) in contacts, this provides more policy options. We used a deterministic mathematical model of epidemic response with limited supply (age-targeted or ring vaccination) and mass vaccination for the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. For targeted vaccination, the effectiveness of vaccinating health workers, young people and older adults was compared. For mass vaccination, we tested varying vaccine efficacy (VE) and distribution capacities. With a limited vaccine stockpile of 1 million doses in NSW, if there is efficacy as PEP, the most efficient way to control COVID-19 will be ring vaccination, however at least 90% of contacts per case needs to be traced and vaccinated. Health worker vaccination is required for health system resilience. Age based strategies with restricted doses make minimal impact on the epidemic, but vaccinating older people prevents more deaths. Herd immunity can only be achieved with mass vaccination. With 90% VE, herd immunity can be achieved by vaccinating 66% of the population. A vaccine with less than 70% VE cannot achieve herd immunity and will result in ongoing risk of outbreaks. For mass vaccination, distributing at least 60,000 doses per day is required to achieve control. Slower rates of vaccination will result in the population living with COVID-19 longer, and higher cases and deaths.","Raina MacIntyre, C; Costantino, Valentina; Trent, Mallory",Vaccine,108,1

We evaluated the incidence of VaTE in outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 at our institution in order to assess the potential need for thromboprophylaxis in outpatient COVID-19 management. Methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of electronic medical record data of outpatients in the University of North Carolina Health System who tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 between March 15 and June 20, 2020. Patients were diagnosed at one of 17 ambulatory respiratory diagnostic centers (n=706), or diagnosed and subsequently discharged from one of 11 emergency departments (n=1967) in the UNC system. Diagnosis was made using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab samples. The study outcome was the diagnosis of a vascular thromboembolic event within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis. This included deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and systemic arterial thromboembolism. VaTE was defined based on documentation of an associated ICD-10 code in the patient's electronic medical record within the specified time frame. Outcomes data were reported as incidence rates for the entire study population. Results 2673 outpatients were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the study period. The mean age for this cohort was 37.9 ± 17.3 years and 54% were female. 20 unique individuals (0.7%) experienced a VaTE within 30 days of diagnosis. Of these, 3 (15%) experienced venous thromboembolic events, 16 (80%) experienced arterial events, and 1 patient experienced both. Mean time to VaTE was 12.8 ± 9.3 days. Within 30 days of diagnosis, 188 of these patients (7%) had an emergency department visit or experienced hospital observation or inpatient admission. Conclusions We found that the incidence of VaTE in outpatients with mild COVID-19 is low. Limitations of this study include that patients were not routinely screened for VaTE and may have sought treatment for thrombotic complications outside the hospital system. This may have led to an underestimate of the true incidence; however, the findings are in line with data showing that non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be younger and have fewer medical comorbidities than hospitalized patients.3 This argues against the routine use of thromboprophylaxis in outpatients with COVID-19.

We developed an educational conference for internal medicine residents to practice diagnostic reasoning and examine how biases affect their differential diagnoses through cognitive autopsies. METHODS: We formatted the Virtual Interactive Case-Based Education (VICE) conference as a clinical problem-solving exercise, in which a facilitator presents a case to a single discussant selected from the audience. We delivered VICE on an internet-based conferencing platform with screen-sharing capability over approximately 30 minutes. To maximize learners’ psychological safety, we employed an active facilitation model that normalized uncertainty and prioritized the diagnostic process over arriving at the correct diagnosis. RESULTS: Resident attitudes toward VICE were assessed by utilizing a postconference survey and gathering descriptive data for 11 sessions. Ninety-seven percent of respondents (n = 35) felt that VICE was a novel and valuable addition to their curriculum. Qualitative data suggested that positive features of the conference included the opportunity to practice diagnostic reasoning, the single-discussant format, and the supportive learning environment. Discussants reported that holding the conference in person would have negatively impacted their experience. DISCUSSION: Internal medicine residents universally valued the opportunity to engage in deliberate practice of case-based reasoning in a psychologically safe environment during the VICE conference. The virtual nature of the conference contributed significantly to discussants’ positive experience. This resource includes all materials necessary to implement VICE, as well as an instructional video on facilitation.","Logan, Alexander A.; Rao, Mayuree; Cornia, Paul B.; Hagan, Scott L.; Newman, Thomas A.; Redinger, Jeffrey W.; Woan, Jessica; Albert, Tyler J.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,108,16

The filovirus VP40 matrix protein is essential for virus assembly and budding, and its PPxY L-domain motif interacts with WW-domains of specific host proteins, such as Nedd4 and ITCH, to facilitate the late stage of virus-cell separation. To identify additional WW-domain-bearing host proteins that interact with VP40, we used an EBOV PPxY-containing peptide to screen an array of 115 mammalian WW-domain-bearing proteins. Using this unbiased approach, we identified BCL2 Associated Athanogene 3 (BAG3), a member of the BAG family of molecular chaperone proteins, as a specific VP40 PPxY interactor. Here, we demonstrate that the WW-domain of BAG3 interacts with the PPxY motif of both EBOV and MARV VP40 and, unexpectedly, inhibits budding of both eVP40 and mVP40 virus-like particles (VLPs), as well as infectious VSV-EBOV recombinants. BAG3 is a stress induced protein that regulates cellular protein homeostasis and cell survival through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). Interestingly, our results show that BAG3 alters the intracellular localization of VP40 by sequestering VP40 away from the plasma membrane. As BAG3 is the first WW-domain interactor identified that negatively regulates budding of VP40 VLPs and infectious virus, we propose that the chaperone-mediated autophagy function of BAG3 represents a specific host defense strategy to counteract the function of VP40 in promoting efficient egress and spread of virus particles.","Liang, Jingjing; Sagum, Cari A.; Bedford, Mark T.; Sidhu, Sachdev S.; Sudol, Marius; Han, Ziying; Harty, Ronald N.",PLoS Pathog,108,26

Conventional care included Vitamin-c, Azithromycin, and Paracetamol. Ayurveda formulations used as add-on were Dashamula and Pathyadi decoctions along with Trikatu powder, Sanshamani tablet, AYUSH-64 tablet AND Yastimadhu Ghana tablet for oral administration. Considering Add-on Ayurveda medicines as exposure of interest, patients who received Add-on Ayurveda medicines at least for 7 days were included in the exposed group while those who received only conventional care in unexposed group. Data was collected through record review and telephonic interviews. The outcomes of interest were the development of symptoms, duration of symptomatic phase in those progressing to symptomatic stage and mortality. Total 762 participants were included-[541 (71%) in the exposed group and 221 (29%) in the unexposed. Progression to symptomatic phase did not differ significantly between groups [27.6% in exposed, 24.6% in unexposed, adjusted RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.6-1.2].

Since the start of the pandemic in March 2020, preventive measures, including lockdowns, social isolation, quarantine, and social distancing, have been implemented to reduce viral spread. These measures, while effective for risk prevention, may contribute to increased social isolation and loneliness among older adults and negatively impact their mental and physical health. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting “Stay-at-Home” order on the mental and physical health of older adults and to explore ways to safely increase social connectedness among them. METHODS: This qualitative study involved older adults living in a Continued Care Senior Housing Community (CCSHC) in southern California, USA. Four 90-minute focus groups were convened using the Zoom Video Communications platform during May 2020, involving 21 CCSHC residents. Participants were asked to describe how they were managing during the “stay-at-home” mandate that was implemented in March 2020, including its impact on their physical and mental health. Transcripts of each focus group were analyzed using qualitative methods. RESULTS: Four themes emerged from the qualitative data: (1) impact of the quarantine on health and well-being, (2) communication innovation and technology use, (3) effective ways of coping with the quarantine, and (4) improving access to technology and training. Participants reported a threat to their mental and physical health directly tied to the quarantine and exacerbated by social isolation and decreased physical activity. Technology was identified as a lifeline for many who are socially isolated from their friends and family. CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings suggest that technology access, connectivity, and literacy are potential game-changers to supporting the mental and physical health of older adults and must be prioritized for future research.","Daly, Jessica R; Depp, Colin; Graham, Sarah A; Jeste, Dilip V; Kim, Ho-Cheol; Lee, Ellen E; Nebeker, Camille",JMIR Aging,108,12

We aimed at assessing their level of knowledge and practice of preventive measures in a developing country setting. METHODS: total enumeration of all CHWs in a rural local government area in southern Nigeria was carried out, using cross-sectional descriptive study design. Pretested self-administered 15-item questionnaire was used to assess knowledge of COVID-19 including basic epidemiology, virology, preventive measures and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Practice of preventive measures was also assessed. Each correct response to knowledge question contributed one unit to the total score which was converted to percentage. Total knowledge score of 50% or greater was considered satisfactory. RESULTS: complete data was obtained from eighty-six (86) respondents with mean age of 36.3±8.9 years (18-54 years). Mean total knowledge score was 28.14±12.8% (6.7 to 53.3%), and 9.3% (n=8) had score of at least 50%.

Ly6C(hi)/CCR2(hi) inflammatory monocytes have been identified as the circulating precursors of brain macrophages, dendritic cells and arguably microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis; Alzheimer’s disease; stroke; and more recently in CNS infection caused by Herpes simplex virus, murine hepatitis virus, Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus. The precise differentiation pathways and functions of inflammatory monocyte-derived populations in the inflamed CNS remains a contentious issue, especially in regard to the existence of monocyte-derived microglia. Furthermore, the contributions of monocyte-derived subsets to viral clearance and immunopathology are not well-defined. Thus, understanding the pathways through which inflammatory monocytes migrate to the brain and their functional capacity within the CNS is critical to inform future therapeutic strategies. This review discusses some of the key aspects of inflammatory monocyte trafficking to the brain and addresses the role of these cells in viral encephalitis.","Terry, Rachael L; Getts, Daniel R; Deffrasnes, Celine; van Vreden, Caryn; Campbell, Iain L; King, Nicholas JC",J Neuroinflammation,108,0

Chief among barriers to large-scale testing was unknown feasibility, particularly in non-urban areas. Our objective was to report methods of high-volume, comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing, offering one model to augment disease surveillance in a rural community. METHODS: A community-university partnership created an operational site used to test most residents of Bolinas, California regardless of symptoms in 4 days (April 20th – April 23rd, 2020). Prior to testing, key preparatory elements included community mobilization, pre-registration, volunteer recruitment, and data management. On day of testing, participants were directed to a testing lane after site entry. An administrator viewed the lane-specific queue and pre-prepared test kits, linked to participants’ records. Medical personnel performed sample collection, which included finger prick with blood collection to run laboratory-based antibody testing and respiratory specimen collection for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Using this 4-lane model, 1,840 participants were tested in 4 days. A median of 57 participants (IQR 47–67) were tested hourly. The fewest participants were tested on day 1 (n = 338 participants), an intentionally lower volume day, increasing to n = 571 participants on day 4. The number of testing teams was also increased to two per lane to allow simultaneous testing of multiple participants on days 2–4. Consistent staffing on all days helped optimize proficiency, and strong community partnership was essential from planning through execution. CONCLUSIONS: High-volume ascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence by PCR and antibody testing was feasible when conducted in a community-led, drive-through model in a non-urban area.

We therefore evaluated clinical and microbiological factors associated with the presence of GI symptoms in patients consulting a general practitioner (GP) for ARI. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swabs, stool specimens and clinical data from patients presenting to GPs with an ARI were prospectively collected during two winter seasons (2014-2016). Samples were tested by quantitative real-time PCR for 12 respiratory pathogen groups and for 12 enteric pathogens. RESULTS: Two hundred and four of 331 included patients (61.6%) were positive for at least one respiratory pathogen. Sixty-nine stools (20.8%) were positive for at least one pathogen (respiratory and/or enteric). GI symptoms were more likely declared in case of laboratory confirmed-enteric infection (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 3.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.2–9.9]; p = 0.02) or human coronavirus (HCoV) infection (aOR = 2.7; [1.2–6.8]; p = 0.02). Consumption of antipyretic medication before the consultation seemed to reduce the risk of developing GI symptoms for patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza (aOR = 0.3; [0.1–0.6]; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of GI symptoms in ARI patients could not be explained by the detection of respiratory pathogens in stools. However, the detection of enteric pathogens in stool samples could explained by the presence of GI symptoms in some of ARI cases. The biological mechanisms explaining the association between the presence of HCoVs in nasopharynx and GI symptoms need to be explored.

To help administrators respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and better understand its impacts, we surveyed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among NOVA University employees and assessed community mental health. Methods: Data were collected from voluntary participants at six NOVA University locations, in the Lisbon metropolitan area, from June 15–30, 2020. All subjects provided written informed consent. Of 1,627 recruited participants (mean age 42.0 ± 12.3 years), 1,624 were tested. Prior to blood collection, participants completed a questionnaire that assessed: COVID-19 symptoms during the previous 14 days, chronic non-communicable diseases, chronic medication, anxiety, and depression symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 serology tests were then performed, and results communicated approximately 4 days after blood draw. Participants with positive serology tests were contacted to assess COVID-19 symptoms since February. Results: Estimated prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was 3.1% (n = 50), of which 43.5% reported symptoms in the previous 4 months. The Medical School had the highest seroprevalence (6.2%). Participants reported having at least one chronic disease (63.7%), depression-like symptoms (2.1%), and anxiety symptoms (8.1%). Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms were significantly higher in women, with sleep hours and occasional alcohol consumption negatively associated with depression. Male gender, older age, and sleep hours negatively associated with anxiety symptoms. School of employment and presence of comorbidities positively associated with anxiety. Conclusion: By measuring seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among NOVA employees and assessing subjects' mental health, we aim to help administrators at European public universities in urban areas, such as Lisbon, Portugal, better understand the needs of their communities. This study resulted in implementation of a stricter contingency plan in the Medical School, while other schools continued to follow Government mitigation guidelines. These findings may also guide the development of tailored strategies to ensure physical and mental health of the academic community during this pandemic crisis. We conclude that, together with COVID-19 contingency plans, psychological support services and facilities to help people effectively face pandemic-associated challenges and minimise anxiety and depression should be implemented.","Lopes, David G.; Henriques, Ana Rita; Santos-Dias, Margarida; Nunes-da-Silva, Catarina; Gonçalves, Juliana; de Sousa, Rute D.; Abdulghani, Saba; Eletério, Jair; Braga, Sofia Jacinto; Soares, Helena; Branco, Jaime C.; Canhão, Helena; Rodrigues, Ana M.",Front Public Health,108,16

Objectives: To estimate the effect of the two-stage strong social distancing measures, the closure of all non-essential shopping centers and businesses on March 16 and the shelter in place orders (SIPOs) on March 23 on the COVID-19 growth rate in Greece Methods: We obtained data on COVID-19 cases in Greece from February 26th through May 4th from publicly available sources. An interrupted time-series regression analysis was used to estimate the effect of the measures on the exponential growth of confirmed COVID-19 cases, controlling for the number of daily testing, and weekly fixed-effects. Results: The growth rate of the COVID-19 cases in the pre-policies implementation period was positive as expected (p=0.003). Based on the estimates of the interrupted time-series, our results indicate that the SIPO on March 23 significantly slowed the growth rate of COVID-19 in Greece (p=0.04).

Macrophages are immune cells that sense and actively respond to disturbances in tissue homeostasis by initiating, and subsequently resolving, inflammation. Hypoxic conditions generated at a wound site also strongly recruit macrophages and affect their function. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α is a transcription factor that contributes to both glycolysis and the induction of inflammatory genes, while also being critical for macrophage activation. For the latter, HIF-1α regulates sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) to affect the migration, activation, differentiation, and polarization of macrophages. Recently, S1P and HIF-1α have received much attention, and various studies have been performed to investigate their roles in initiating and resolving inflammation via macrophages. It is hypothesized that the HIF-1α/S1P/S1P receptor axis is an important determinant of macrophage function under inflammatory conditions and during disease pathogenesis. Therefore, in this review, biological regulation of monocytes/macrophages in response to circulating HIF-1α is summarized, including signaling by S1P/S1P receptors, which have essential roles in wound healing.","Hutami, Islamy Rahma; Izawa, Takashi; Khurel-Ochir, Tsendsuren; Sakamaki, Takuma; Iwasa, Akihiko; Tanaka, Eiji",Int J Mol Sci,108,16

The study of ubiquitination has become essential to learning about host–pathogen interactions, and a better understanding of the detailed mechanisms through which pathogens affect ubiquitination processes in host cell will contribute to vaccine development and effective treatment of diseases. Pathogenic bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Legionella pneumophila and Shigella flexneri) encode many effector proteins, such as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), targeting the host ubiquitin machinery and thus disrupting pertinent ubiquitin-dependent anti-bacterial response. We focus here upon the host ubiquitination system as an integral unit, its interconnection with the regulation of inflammation and autophagy, and primarily while examining pathogens manipulating the host ubiquitination system. Many bacterial effector proteins have already been described as being translocated into the host cell, where they directly regulate host defense processes. Due to their importance in pathogenic bacteria progression within the host, they are regarded as virulence factors essential for bacterial evasion. However, in some cases (e.g., Francisella tularensis) the host ubiquitination system is influenced by bacterial infection, although the responsible bacterial effectors are still unknown.","Vozandychova, Vera; Stojkova, Pavla; Hercik, Kamil; Rehulka, Pavel; Stulik, Jiri",Microorganisms,108,5

Here, variable, diversity and joining genes within the ferret kappa, lambda and heavy chain immunoglobulin loci were annotated using available genomic information. A multiplex PCR approach was derived that facilitated the recovery of paired heavy and light chain immunoglobulin sequences from single sorted ferret B cells, allowing validation of predicted germline gene sequences and the identification of putative novel germlines. Eukaryotic expression vectors were developed that enabled the generation of recombinant ferret monoclonal antibodies. This work advances the ferret as an informative immunological model for viral diseases by allowing the in-depth interrogation of antibody-based immunity.","Wong, Julius; Tai, Celeste M.; Hurt, Aeron C.; Tan, Hyon-Xhi; Kent, Stephen J.; Wheatley, Adam K.",PLoS One,108,16

METHODS: Contextual factors are simultaneously tested at the county‐ and state‐level with a multilevel linear model using full maximum likelihood. RESULTS: The variation between states is substantial and significant (ICC = 0.532, u (0) = 8.20E−04, P < .001). At the state level, the cultural value of collectivism and the contextual factor of government spending are positively associated with the outbreak rate. At the county level, the racial and ethnic composition contributes to outbreak differences, disproportionally affecting black/African, native, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as well as native Hawaiians. Counties with a higher median age and a higher household income have a stronger outbreak. Better education and personal health are generally associated with a lower outbreak. Obesity and smoking are negatively related to the outbreak, in agreement with the value expectancy concepts of the health belief model. Air pollution is another significant contributor to the outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Because of a high variation in contextual factors, policy makers need to target pandemic responses to the smallest subdivision possible, so that countermeasures can be implemented effectively.","Messner, Wolfgang; Payson, Sarah E.",Health Sci Rep,108,20

In response to the international threat of WPV transmission and changes in the national vaccination policy, we established an environmental surveillance system to monitor the circulation of wild and vaccine-related poliovirus in Taiwan. From July 2012 to December 2013, we collected sewage specimens every month from 10 sewage treatment plants located throughout Taiwan. The specimens were concentrated by the two-phase separation method and then inoculated into L20B, RD, and A549 cells for virus isolation. Viral isolates were identified and serotyped by immunofluorescence assay or molecular analysis. A total of 300 sewage samples were collected, and the results showed 163 samples (54.3%) were positive for virus, and 268 isolates were identified. Among these, 75 samples (25%) were positive for enterovirus (EV), but no poliovirus was found. In addition, 92 isolates were identified as enteroviruses and the most common serotypes were coxsackievirus B4, coxsackievirus B3, and coxsackievirus B2. Interestingly, 102 (34%) and 82 (27.3%) specimens were positive for mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) and adenovirus, respectively. This study confirmed that sewage surveillance can be a useful additional modality for monitoring the possible presence of wild-type or vaccine-derived poliovirus in wastewater, and can indicate the current types of viruses circulating in the population. Furthermore, since MRV was found in children with acute necrotizing encephalopathy and meningitis, the high incidence of MRV detected by environmental surveillance warrants further investigation.","Lim, Matthew C.

We suggest that research into further increasing this mutation rate artificially as an antiviral treatment requires a theoretical reevaluation, especially relating to the so-called error threshold. The main evolutionary consequence of a high mutation rate appears to have been to restrict RNA viruses to a small genome; they thus rapidly exploit a limited array of possibilities. Investigating this constraint to their evolution, and how it is occasionally overcome, promises to be fruitful.

OBJECTIVES: We aimed to identify patterns of daily coping and individuals' coping repertoires (i.e., range of coping patterns employed across situations) during a COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We investigated day-level covariates (appraisals, worrying, mood) of daily coping patterns and person-level covariates (psychopathology, average mood) of coping repertoires. Design: A non-representative community sample (n = 322, 15-82 years old) participated in a 21-day ambulatory assessment study. METHODS: We applied multilevel latent class analysis.. RESULTS: We identified seven daily coping patterns and ten classes of individuals differing in the size of their coping repertoire and their propensity for polyregulation. Daily coping patterns differed in daily perceived controllability and mood (but not in daily worrying or stress). At the person level, individuals with a higher level of average coronavirus-related worrying more frequently engaged in a high degree of polyregulation. The size of individuals' coping repertoire was unrelated to psychopathology and average mood. CONCLUSION: The findings provide insights into the composition of daily coping patterns and individuals' coping repertoires during crisis periods and contribute to a new polyregulation perspective on coping.","Lischetzke, Tanja; Schemer, Lea; In-Albon, Tina; Karbach, Julia; Könen, Tanja; Glombiewski, Julia Anna",Anxiety Stress Coping,108,26

Exploiting the restricted specificity of a 9-O acetyl sialic acid (9-OAcSA) binding lectin, Achatinin(H) (ATN(H)), we have identified two 9-O acetyl sialoglyconjugates (9-OAcSGs) on lymphoblasts of 87 children suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts induces their 11-fold increased agglutination (81 ± 7.8%) compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors (8 ± 4.3%) which corroborates with flow cytometry studies. Agglutination of MOLT-4 (87 ± 4.8%), a lymphoblastoid cell line and MDCK (91.25 ± 0.01%), a cell line expressing surface 9-OAcSA, confirms the preferential binding of ATN(H) to lymphoblasts through their surface 9-OAcSGs. Furthermore, fluorometric quantitation reveals a 4.6-fold increase in % of 9-OAcSA on lymphoblasts of ALL patients (42.1 ± 4.1%) compared to normal donors (9.2. ± 3.4%). Western blotting confirms that ATN(H) recognizes two membrane sialoglycoconjugates, of MW 120 kDa and 90 kDa, both having 9-OAcSA α2 → 6 GalNAc terminal sugar moiety as their lectinogenic epitope. We propose that these 9-OAcSGs may serve as biomarkers for detection and monitoring of lymphoblasts in ALL and accordingly merit therapeutic considerations.","Sinha, D; Mandal, C; Bhattacharya, DK",Leukemia,108,1

Here we employed unbiased screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 proteins that antagonize type-I interferon (IFN-I) response. Three proteins were found to antagonize IFN-I production via distinct mechanisms: nsp6 binds TBK1 to suppress IRF3 phosphorylation; nsp13 binds and blocks TBK1 phosphorylation; and ORF6 binds importin KPNA2 to inhibit IRF3 nuclear translocation. Two sets of viral proteins were identified to antagonize IFN-I signaling through blocking STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation or nuclear translocation. Remarkably, SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 and nsp6 suppressed IFN-I signaling more efficiently than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Thus, when treated with IFN-I, a SARS-CoV2 replicon replicated to a higher level than chimeric replicons containing nsp1 or nsp6 from SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.

In the setting of waning immunity from infection and vaccination, breakthrough infections are becoming increasingly common and treatment options remain limited. Additionally, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with their potential to escape therapeutic monoclonal antibodies emphasizes the need to develop second-generation oral antivirals targeting highly conserved viral proteins that can be rapidly deployed to outpatients. Here, we demonstrate the in vitro antiviral activity and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of GS-621763, an orally bioavailable prodrug of GS-441524, the parental nucleoside of remdesivir, which targets the highly conserved RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. GS-621763 exhibited significant antiviral activity in lung cell lines and two different human primary lung cell culture systems. The dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile observed after oral administration of GS-621763 translated to dose-dependent antiviral activity in mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic GS-621763 significantly reduced viral load, lung pathology, and improved pulmonary function in COVID-19 mouse model. A direct comparison of GS-621763 with molnupiravir, an oral nucleoside analog antiviral currently in human clinical trial, proved both drugs to be similarly efficacious. These data demonstrate that therapy with oral prodrugs of remdesivir can significantly improve outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice.

Timely and accurate COVID-19 laboratory testing is an essential step in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak. To date, assays based on the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in respiratory samples are the gold standard for COVID-19 diagnosis. Unfortunately, RT-PCR has several practical limitations. Consequently, alternative diagnostic methods are urgently required, both for alleviating the pressure on laboratories and healthcare facilities and for expanding testing capacity to enable large-scale screening and ensure a timely therapeutic intervention. To date, few studies have been conducted concerning the potential utilization of rapid testing for COVID-19, with some conflicting results. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to explore the feasibility of rapid diagnostic tests in the management of the COVID-19 outbreak.

Generation of TCR Tg mice generally requires T cell stimulation and cloning in vitro prior to amplification, processes which introduce biases into selection of the TCR that is ultimately chosen for TCR Tg mouse generation. Here we describe an alternative approach that involves no T cell stimulation or propagation in vitro. We generated mice that were transgenic for a TCR responding to a CD4 T cell epitope (epitope M133) that is immunodominant in mice infected with a neurotropic coronavirus, the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. The CD4 T cell response to epitope M133 is of particular interest because it may be pathogenic, protective or regulatory, depending upon the physiological setting. We applied an iterative process in which we identified a TCR-β chain expressed by all mice that were examined (‘public sequence’). This TCR-β chain was introduced into bone marrow cells with a lentivirus vector, generating TCR-β retrogenic mice. A TCR-α chain that paired with this TCR-β was then identified and used to generate a second set of TCR (α/β) retrogenic mice. After demonstrating that these cells were functional and responded to epitope M133, these TCR chains were used to generate an epitope M133-specific TCR Tg mouse. This method should be generally useful for engineering TCR Tg mice without introduction of bias caused by in vitro manipulation and propagation.","Zhao, Jingxian; Fett, Craig; Pewe, Lecia; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley",Journal of Immunological Methods,108,12

Although SSEs appear to be difficult to predict and therefore difficult to prevent, core public health actions can prevent and reduce the number and impact of SSEs. To prevent and control of SSEs, speed is essential. Prevention and mitigation of SSEs depends, first and foremost, on quickly recognizing and understanding these events, particularly within healthcare settings. Better understanding transmission dynamics associated with SSEs, identifying and mitigating high-risk settings, strict adherence to healthcare infection prevention and control measures, and timely implementation of nonpharmaceutical interventions can help prevent and control severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, as well as future infectious disease outbreaks.","Frieden, Thomas R.; Lee, Christopher T.",Emerg Infect Dis,108,21

The objective of this study was to describe the initial symptoms and laboratory test values of patients who presented to the emergency department with dengue or COVID-19. A cross-sectional study was performed in a single center in Cali, Colombia. The inclusion criteria were patients with a diagnosis of dengue or COVID-19 who were older than 14 years of age. All patients experienced fever or other symptoms for fewer than 10 days. Linear regression was performed to evaluate the differences in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) between patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and dengue, and was adjusted for sex and age group (&#8804; 31 and > 31 years). The sample size was calculated to test the hypothesis that the median NLR in COVID-19 patients is higher than that in dengue patients. A P value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses. A total of 93 patients were included: 70 with dengue and 23 with COVID-19. Dengue patients were younger than COVID-19 patients. There were significant differences between dengue and COVID-19 patients regarding platelet count (P < 0.01), neutrophil count (P < 0.01), NLR (P < 0.01), and abnormal alanine transaminase (ALT) (P = 0.03). The NLR was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients than in dengue patients (P < 0.01). In conclusion, during the first week of symptoms, absolute neutrophil count, NLR, and platelet count could help guide the initial differential approach between dengue and COVID-19. These findings could be useful in geographical areas with a lack of resources.","Rosso, Fernando; Parra-Lara, Luis G; Agudelo-Rojas, Olga L; Martinez-Ruiz, Diana M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,108,29

Currently, there are no vaccines or therapeutics available for COVID-19 that demands an urgent search for a new drug to combat the pandemic of COVID-19. Lipid membrane alternation efficiency of small antimicrobial lipopeptides makes them able to block the viral membrane fusion to the host cell. Lipopeptides could serve as potential antiviral agents by interacting or competing with viral fusion proteins. Here, we screened seven different lipopeptides (tsushimycin, daptomycin, surfactin, bacillomycin, iturin, srfTE, LPD-12) and docked individually against spike (S)-glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. Based on the maximum docked score and minimum atomic contact energy, LPD-12 (-1137.38 kcal) is chosen appropriate molecule for proper binding with the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and thus significantly interrupt its affinity of binding with angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), the only receptor molecule facilitates in disease development. Results confirm a strong binding affinity of LPD-12 with ACE2 with a binding free energy of -1621.62 kcal which can also prevent the binding of S-protein, reciprocally. Thus it can be concluded that LPD-12 may act as a potential therapeutic drug by reducing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 to the human cells via ACE2 receptor and related infections.","Chowdhury, Trinath; Baindara, Piyush; Mandal, Santi M.",Int J Antimicrob Agents,108,24

From late 2002 to mid 2003, it infected more than 8000 people worldwide, of which a majority of cases were found in China. Owing to the absence of definitive therapeutic Western medicines, Houttuynia cordata Thunb. (Saururaceae) (HC) was shortlisted by Chinese scientists to tackle SARS problem as it is conventionally used to treat pneumonia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The present study aimed to explore the SARS-preventing mechanisms of HC in the immunological and anti-viral aspects. RESULTS: Results showed that HC water extract could stimulate the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes significantly and dose-dependently. By flow cytometry, it was revealed that HC increased the proportion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Moreover, it caused a significant increase in the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10 by mouse splenic lymphocytes. In the anti-viral aspect, HC exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3C-like protease (3CL(pro)) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). On the other hand, oral acute toxicity test demonstrated that HC was non-toxic to laboratory animals following oral administration at 16 g/kg.

We have previously reported the synthesis of potent coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors and the efficacy of a protease inhibitor, GC376, in client-owned cats with FIP. In this study, we studied the effect of the amino acid changes in 3CLpro of feline coronavirus from a feline patient who received antiviral treatment for prolonged duration. We generated recombinant 3CLpro containing the identified amino acid changes (N25S, A252S or K260 N) and determined their susceptibility to protease inhibitors in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The assay showed that N25S in 3CLpro confers a small change (up to 1.68-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration) in susceptibility to GC376, but other amino acid changes do not affect susceptibility. Modelling of 3CLpro carrying the amino acid changes was conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings. The results of this study may explain the observed absence of clinical resistance to the long-term antiviral treatment in the patients.","Perera, Krishani Dinali; Rathnayake, Athri D.; Liu, Hongwei; Pedersen, Niels C.; Groutas, William C.; Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Kim, Yunjeong",Veterinary Microbiology,108,28

Barriers to providing care include lack of financial resources, poor road infrastructure, lack of trained first responders and ambulance staff, and issues regarding coordination/communication between different entities involved in Emergency Medical Services. Prior initiatives to characterize and improve the state of pre-hospital care in LMICs have largely focused on improving access to high-quality ambulance services by providing training programs to community first responders and ambulance staff on how to recognize and manage key emergency conditions. In this article, we discuss an alternative strategy for improving pre-hospital care: the creation of a context-specific Emergency Medical Dispatcher (EMD) training curriculum and program. METHODS: We describe the current pre-hospital care setting in Nepal, the process of creating and piloting the Nepal-specific EMD training manual, and the early impact of its implementation. RESULTS: The 30-h EMD training was designed, piloted, and revised in collaboration with the three largest EMS organizations in Nepal. The training is now required for all dispatchers at the Dhulikhel Hospital Dispatch Center, one of the largest ambulance dispatch networks in Nepal. Dispatchers are trained in the following knowledge and skill areas: telecommunication guidelines, triaging and documentation procedures, delivery of Basic Life Support instructions to callers, other medical and trauma-condition specific instructions, and limited resource management. The short-term positive impacts of the training’s implementation include improved documentation procedures, better prioritization of ambulance resources, delivery of Basic Life Support instructions to callers, and improved communication between dispatch, responders, and healthcare facilities. CONCLUSIONS: Context-specific Emergency Medical Dispatch training programs, which aim to optimize the emergency resources available in resource-limited settings, present a promising low-cost, high-impact interventional strategy to strengthen the pre-hospital care systems in low- and middle-income countries.","Jacobson, Claire L.; Basnet, Samjhana; Bhatt, Ajay; Parajuli, Shreejesh; Shrestha, Sanu Krishna",Int J Emerg Med,108,1

STUDY DESIGN: This is a nationwide register-based study. METHODS: To estimate the incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 in Brazilian children aged 0–19 years, we extracted data of confirmed cases and deaths from the de-identified microdata catalog and official bulletins of the 27 Brazilian states' health department websites until September 3, 2020. Social and economic inequalities were evaluated using the Social Vulnerability Index and Gini coefficient, respectively. The relationship between COVID-19 rates in Brazilian children and socio-economic vulnerability at the state level was analyzed using Spearman's rank correlation. RESULTS: Of the 3,998,055 individuals with COVID-19 included in our database, 335,279 (8.4%) were children aged 0–19 years. Eight hundred deaths in children were registered, which accounts for about 0.7% of the deaths related to COVID-19 in the country. There were important differences in the incidence and mortality rates among Brazilian regions, and a correlation between mortality rates and social (ρ = 0.519; P-value = 0.007; effect magnitude: moderate) and economic (ρ = 0.615; P-value < 0.001; effect magnitude: strong) inequalities was found in a state-level analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study showed important regional differences in COVID-19 estimates for children in Brazil and a relationship between mortality rates and socio-economic inequalities.

The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1β and IFN-γ, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease.

METHODS: An observational longitudinal study was conducted during the pandemic peak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (1 March 2020 to 24 April). All patients attended at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain with a medical diagnosis of AIRD and with symptomatic COVID-19 were included. The main outcome was hospital admission related to COVID-19. The covariates were sociodemographic, clinical and treatments. We ran a multivariable logistic regression model to assess risk factors for the hospital admission. RESULTS: The study population included 123 patients with AIRD and COVID-19. Of these, 54 patients required hospital admission related to COVID-19. The mean age on admission was 69.7 (15.7) years, and the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 5 (3–10) days. The median length of stay was 9 (6–14) days.

AIM: FBs performed between 2013 and 2018 at our Pediatric Allergy and Respiratory Medicine Unit of the Department of Women's and Children's Health at Padua University were examined in terms of the indications, findings, and adverse events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The electronic medical records of pediatric patients who underwent FB at least once between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018 were considered. Patients' clinical data, indications for FB, anatomical findings, information derived from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and bronchial brushing, and possible adverse events were analyzed. RESULTS: There were 447 pediatric FBs performed in 428 patients (aged from 1 month to 18 years) for diagnostic purposes (92.4%), to clear secretions (3.6%), or to monitor a known condition (4.0%). The main indications were recurrent lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI, 32.2%) and chronic wet cough (9.4%). Lower airway malacia was the most common abnormal finding in these two groups (36.1% and 28.6%, respectively). BAL bacterial culture was positive in 55 children (39.6%) with recurrent LRTI and in 25 (59.5%) with chronic wet cough, being Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis the microorganisms most commonly isolated. FB proved a safe procedure and was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric FB is an essential tool at our tertiary pediatric respiratory center. It helps establish the anatomical conditions underlying several chronic respiratory conditions and any correlated microbiological findings, with a significant impact on further patient management.","Ferraro, Valentina Agnese; Baraldi, Eugenio; Stabinger, Diana; Zamunaro, Andrea; Zanconato, Stefania; Carraro, Silvia",Pediatr Pulmonol,108,1

During covid-19 pandemia, these cases have continued to require medical attention. Aim of the present study was to share our burn center’s pandemia experience in minor to moderate burns in children. METHODS: Records of 117 victims (age:0 to 17yrs) were documented {study period: 3/11/2020(pandemia decleration by WHO)-9/11/2020}. Data were classified according to treatment modalities (outpatient/inpatient/telemedicine). Age; sex; extent of burns; burn cause; environment in which injury occured; referral history (time interval between injury and referral; other hospitals before arriving at our center) were noted for each case. Thereafter, subjects were divided into two subgroups according to pandemia calender: GroupIconsisted of referrals in march+april+may (national ‘lock-down’ period for children n=60) and GroupIIconsisted of referrals in june+july+august+september (‘new normal’ period with limited social life n=57) (mean±SE,p˂.05). Results: Outpatients comprised 82,1% of all referrals(n=96) with 361 in-person visits. Mean age was 4,2yrs±0,4(min:0 max:17); male/female ratio was 1,04/1. Mean total body surface area(TBSA) burned was 2,6%±0,6(min:0,2 max:20). The most common burn causes were scalds(n=79; 82,3%) and contact burns (n=11;11,5%). Number of referrals on the same day with injury was 41 (42,7%) and 65 referrals were unmediated(67,7%). Inpatients comprised of 11,1% of all referrals (n=13). Mean age was 3,9yrs ± 1,7 (min:1 max: 16). Male/female ratio was 0,9/1. Mean TBSA burned was 9,3%±1,8 (min:1 max:18). The most common burn cause was scalds(92,3%;n=12). Nine patients were hospitalized on the same day with injury (69,2%). Ten patients were referred from other hospitals (76,9%). Mean lenght of hospital stay was 6,77days±1,4 (min:1 max:14). Telemedicine visits (n=33) which were carried out for 23 children via e-mail and phone/video calls included photographic follow up visits for scars, treatment of contact dermatitis and controls of wound-dressings. Comparison of ‘lock-down’ period (groupI) with ‘new normal’ period (groupII) revealed that almost whole telemedicine service was carried out in groupI except two interurban visits in groupII. Findings were similar in both groups except the significant increase of outdoor burns and remarkable presence of sun burns in groupII(p< .05). CONCLUSIONS: Covid pandemia has created extraordinary conditions; however present data suggests that minor to moderate burns in childhood continue to occur anyway. Telemedicine is an advantageous method under pandemia conditions. Therefore, attempts for basic burn-care guidelines including telemedicine facilities should be supported.","Abali, Ayse Ebru; Aydogan, Cem; Turkmen, Nigar; Haberal, Mehmet",J Burn Care Res,108,1

Although diagnostic coding change in response to financial incentives is well documented, no study has examined the association of QM with SARS-CoV-2 cause-of-death attribution (CODA). Calculations of excess all-cause deaths overlook the importance of accurate CODA and of distinguishing policy-related from virus-related mortality. Objective: Examine CODA, overall and for QM and non-QM diagnoses, in 3 pandemic periods: awareness (January 19-March 14), height (March 15-May 16), and late (May 17-June 20). Methods: Retrospective analysis of publicly available national weekly COD data, adjusted for population growth and reporting lags, October 2014-June 20, 2020. CODA in 5 pre-pandemic influenza seasons was compared with 2019-20. Suitability of the data to distinguish policy-related from virus-related effects was assessed. Results: Following federal guidance permitting SARS-CoV-2 CODA without laboratory testing, mortality from the QM diagnoses cancer and chronic lower respiratory disease declined steadily relative to prior-season means, reaching 4.4% less and 12.1% less, respectively, in late pandemic. Deaths for non-QM diagnoses increased, by 21.0% for Alzheimers disease and 29.0% for diabetes during pandemic height. Increases in competing CODs over historical experience, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 underreporting, more than offset declines during pandemic height. However, in the late-pandemic period, declines slightly numerically exceeded increases, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 overreporting. In pandemic-height and late-pandemic periods, respectively, only 83.5% and 69.7% of increases in all-cause deaths were explained by changes in the reported CODs, including SARS-CoV-2, preventing assessment of policy-related mortality or of factors contributing to increased all-cause deaths. Conclusions: Substitution of SARS-CoV-2 for competing CODs may have occurred, particularly for QM diagnoses and late in the pandemic. Continued monitoring of these trends, qualitative research on pandemic CODA, and the addition of place-of-death data and psychiatric CODs to the file would facilitate assessment of policy-related and virus-related effects on mortality.","Fairman, K.

This highlights the importance of implementing HIV testing and linkage interventions with a high uptake in this population. In a cluster randomized controlled trial conducted in Kenya between 2013 and 2015, we found that assisted partner services (APS) for HIV-exposed partners of newly diagnosed PLWH safely reached more HIV-exposed individuals with HIV testing compared with client referral alone. However, more data are needed to evaluate APS implementation in a real-world setting. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability, fidelity, and cost of APS when integrated into existing HIV testing services (HTS) in Western Kenya. METHODS: Our study team from the University of Washington and PATH is integrating APS into 31 health facilities in Western Kenya. We are enrolling females newly diagnosed with HIV (index clients) who consent to receiving APS, their male sexual partners, and female sexual partners of male sexual partners who tested HIV positive. Female index clients and sexual partners testing HIV positive will be followed up at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postenrollment to assess linkage to care, antiretroviral therapy initiation, and HIV viral load suppression. We will evaluate the acceptability, fidelity, and cost of real-world implementation of APS via in-depth interviews conducted with national, county, and subcounty-level policy makers responsible for HTS. Facility health staff providing HTS and APS, in addition to staff working with the study project team, will also be interviewed. We will also conduct direct observations of facility infrastructure and clinical procedures and extract data from the facilities and county and national databases. RESULTS: As of March 2020, we have recruited 1724 female index clients, 3201 male partners, and 1585 female partners. We have completed study recruitment as well as 6-week (2936/2973, 98.75%), 6-month (1596/1641, 97.25%), and 12-month (725/797, 90.9%) follow-up visits. Preliminary analyses show that facilities scaling up APS identify approximately 12-18 new HIV-positive males for every 100 men contacted and tested. We are currently completing the remaining follow-up interviews and incorporating an HIV self-testing component into the study in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results will help bridge the gap between clinical research findings and real-world practice and provide guidance regarding optimal strategies for APS integration into routine HIV service delivery.

During sepsis, immune cells are activated by sensing pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) through pattern recognizing receptors (PRRs). Regulation of the immune response is essential to preventing or managing sepsis. Sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin-G (Siglec-G), a CD33 group of Siglec expressed in B-1a cells and other hematopoietic cells, plays an important immunoregulatory role. B-1a cells, a subtype of B lymphocytes, spontaneously produce natural IgM which confers protection against infection. B-1a cells also produce IL-10, GM-CSF, and IL-35 to control inflammation. Sialic acids are present on cell membranes, receptors, and glycoproteins. Siglec-G binds to the sialic acid residues on the B cell receptor (BCR) and controls BCR-mediated signal transduction, thereby maintaining homeostasis of Ca(++) influx and NFATc1 expression. Siglec-G inhibits NF-κB activation in B-1a cells and regulates B-1a cell proliferation. In myeloid cells, Siglec-G inhibits DAMP-mediated inflammation by forming a ternary complex with DAMP and CD24. Thus, preserving Siglec-G’s function could be a novel therapeutic approach in sepsis. Here, we review the immunoregulatory functions of Siglec-G in B-1a cells and myeloid cells in sepsis. A clear understanding of Siglec-G is important to developing novel therapeutics in treating sepsis.","Royster, William; Wang, Ping; Aziz, Monowar",Front Immunol,108,29

Multiple similarities between the two conditions were drawn in the past. This article seeks to further clarify potential underlying mechanisms related to hypoxia and pulmonary vascular responses. It does so by looking at perfusion imaging of patients with COVID-19 and comparing them with patterns observed in HAPE and hypoxic exposure. Two separate clinical cases are reviewed. The salient aspect of each case that is emphasized is the perfusion scintigraphy results that revealed heterogeneous perfusion patterns in both patients. Heterogeneous or non-homogeneous perfusion is also observed in HAPE. A detailed clinical course of each patient is described. Medications utilized to treat the conditions are outlined as well as laboratory parameters and clinical findings. Interestingly, both of these patients were treated with calcium channel blockers and this class of medications is utilized to prevent HAPE as well. Discussion following the case presentations attempts to contextualize possible implications of this and other studies on the broader pathophysiology of COVID-19 disease. Findings related to pathophysiologic patterns and treatment strategies are also described. Micro-thrombi formation has been reported in both COVID-19 and HAPE as well and may be an accessory complication of perfusion compromise. In a separate study, vasodilatation with calcium channel blocker (CCB) therapy has been associated with improved mortality in COVID-19 and potential pathophysiologic mechanisms were previously presented. This case report provides further clinical findings that support the notion that perfusion deficits are an integral component of hypoxia in COVID-19. It also advances the basis for use of vasodilator therapy as part of treatment regimens in COVID-19. Vasodilators may improve micro-perfusion. In this way, oxygenation may be promoted by decreasing impedance and improving flow via the alveolar-capillary unit.","Solaimanzadeh, Isaac",Cureus,108,33

Further, many publications on COVID-19 have debated the puzzling clinical characteristics of ‘silent hypoxemia’, ‘happy hypoxemics’ and ‘atypical ARDS’, all features consistent with OP. The recent announcement that RECOVERY, a randomised controlled trial comparing dexamethasone to placebo in COVID-19, was terminated early due to excess deaths in the control group further suggests patients present with OP given that corticosteroid therapy is the first-line treatment. Although RECOVERY along with other cohort studies report positive effects with corticosteroids on morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, treatment approaches could be made more effective given that secondary OP often requires prolonged duration and/or careful and monitored tapering of corticosteroid dose, with ‘pulse’ doses needed for the well-described fulminant subtype. Increasing recognition of this diagnosis will thus lead to more appropriate and effective treatment strategies in COVID-19, which may lead to a further reduction of need for ventilatory support and improved survival.","Kory, Pierre; Kanne, Jeffrey P",BMJ Open Respir Res,108,1

While enforced lockdown is an effective strategy to abate the transmission of the virus, it causes significant lifestyle changes in every part of the community. This study aims to assess the changes in eating habits, sleeping behaviour and physical activity status of final-year medical students (interns) whose education was suspended during the pandemic. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional epidemiological study, an online questionnaire was created. Interns were asked questions regarding socio-demographic status, eating habits, sleeping behaviour and physical activity status before and during COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in dietary habits and sleep quality were evaluated under the guidance of Turkey Dietary Guidelines, Determination of Nutritional Status Report, Turkey National Nutrition and Health Survey and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. SETTING: Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine – Ankara, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: Among 536 students, a total of 340 students (63·4 %) answered the questionnaire. RESULTS: After the beginning of lockdown, an increase in BMI was observed in both female (P = 0·002) and male students (P = 0·013). Students having healthy dietary habits increased by 18·8 % and unhealthy dietary habits decreased by 3·2 % during lockdown (P < 0·001). Overall, 63·2 % of students reported a decrease in physical activity, and 33·6 % reported a reduction in sleep quality, whereas 38·6 % reported an improvement in sleep quality. There was no significant difference in sleep quality between genders (P = 0·075). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that medical school suspension and enforced lockdown led to significant changes in interns’ eating behaviour, physical activity and sleeping habits.","Bosi Bağcı, Tülay Ayşe; Kanadıkırık, Ayşegül; Somyürek, Emel; Gerçek, Gülce; Tanrıkulu, Hamza Berdan; Öntaş, Eray; Uzun, Sarp",Public Health Nutr,108,10

Many orthopaedic departments suspended elective surgery, and some re-deployed orthopaedic residents to stressful nonorthopaedic tasks; long hours were commonplace. Stress-reaction symptoms such as anxiety and depression have been reported in about 10% of healthcare workers during previous infectious-diseases outbreaks (including the Ebola virus), but little is known about the psychological needs of residents faced with this global disaster. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Have anxiety and depression symptoms among orthopaedic residents worsened from the period before to the period after the lockdown in Italy? (2) Are there differences in anxiety and depression symptoms between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not? METHODS: The Italian Association of Orthopaedic and Traumatology Residents is comprised of 365 members who were recruited through the organization’s mailing list; they were asked to respond to a survey about their health and well-being at the beginning and end of the first COVID-19 Italian lockdown (March 9, 2020 to May 3, 2020). For the survey’s development, 10 orthopaedic surgery residents at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro were preliminarily asked to answer the surveys, and both face validity and content validity were tested. The test-retest reliability was 0.9. Impact on and future concerns about family life and daily work practice, as well as sleep disorders, were investigated. Anxiety and depression were assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes 14 questions (seven for anxiety, HADS-A; and seven for depression, HADS-D) on a Likert scale (0-3); thus, a patient can have a score between 0 and 21 for either the HADS-A or HADS-D, with higher scores indicating a greater likelihood of anxiety or depression. Previously reported minimum clinically important differences ranged from 1.5 to 1.7. For each scale, total scores of ≤ 7 , 8 to 10, and ≥ 11 were taken to represent normal, borderline, or abnormal level of anxiety or depression, respectively. Overall, 75% (272 of 365) of residents completed the survey at both the beginning and end of the lockdown; 72% (196 of 272) were men, the mean ± SD age was 30 ± 3 years, 72% (197 of 272) worked in a hospital setting with patients who were COVID-19-positive, 20% (55 of 272) served in a COVID-19 department, and 5% (7 of 139) tested positive for COVID-19 by nasal-pharyngeal swab. Overall, 9% (24 of 272) of residents had family members who contracted COVID-19, and 3% (8 of 272) had a relative who died. Because of the risk of possible COVID-19 exposure, 18% (48 of 272) of residents needed to temporarily change their household given that social distancing was considered the best way to slow the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: At the end of the lockdown, orthopaedic residents exhibited signs of worsening anxiety and depression as measured by the overall HADS score (median 9 [IQR 5 to 14] versus median 11 [IQR 6 to 17.8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; effect size [r] = -0.24; p < 0.001) as well as in the depression subscale (median 4 [IQR 2 to 7] versus median 5.5 [IQR 3 to 8], respectively; median difference -1 [95% CI -1.5 to -0.5]; r = -0.36; p < 0.001). We found no difference in the development of anxiety or depression between residents who worked in a COVID-19 department and those who did not, as demonstrated by comparing the change in HADS scores between these groups (median 1 [IQR -3 to 4] versus median 1 [IQR -2 to 4] in HADS change score over time; median difference 0 [95% CI -1 to 2]; r = -0.03; p = 0.61). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the daily practice of orthopaedic residents and has had important, far-reaching consequences on their health and well-being, including social implications. Residents showed higher anxiety and depression symptoms at the end of the lockdown. No differences were found in changes of anxiety and depression, over time, for residents who worked in a COVID-19 department compared with those who did not. The evaluation of anxiety and depression through standardized questionnaires could help to identify residents at risk of higher psychological distress who could be referred to regular psychological counseling as a possible prevention strategy during stressful times. Future studies should confirm the long-term effects of these findings.

OBJECTIVES: Systematic literature review of data on asthma in heroin users. DOCUMENTARY SOURCES: Medline(®), on the period 1980-2017 with the following keywords: keywords: “asthma” or “bronchospasm” and “heroin” or “opiate” or “opiates”, limits “title/abstract”; the selected languages were English or French. Among 97 articles, 67 abstracts have given use to a dual reading to select 23 studies. RESULTS: The seven case reports included 21 patients (mean age: 28 years [19–46 years]; sex-ratio: 2.5 [males: 71.5%]). Heroin was inhaled (71.4%), sniffed (19%) or injected by intravenous route (9.5%). Associated addictive substances were tobacco (81%), cannabis (38%), alcohol (4.7%) and cocaine (4.7%). Outcome was fatal in 3 subjects (14.3%). Other studies included one cross-sectional study, 3 case-control studies and 12 longitudinal studies (11 retrospective studies and one prospective study). The proportion of heroin users was higher in asthmatic subjects and the prevalence of asthma and bronchial hyperreactivity was higher in heroin users. Heroin use can be responsible for asthma onset, with a temporal relationship between the onset of heroin use and asthma onset in 28 to 31% of subjects. A positive association between inhaled heroin use and acute asthma exacerbation was observed. Asthma treatment observance was lower in heroin users. In case of asthma exacerbation, heroin users were more likely to seek care in the emergency department, to be admitted in intensive care units and to require intubation and invasive ventilation. Asthma deaths related to heroin use mainly occurred following an intravenous injection (especially in the case of overdose), but also following heroin use by nasal (sniff) or pulmonary route. CONCLUSION: Heroin use may be responsible for asthma onset, acute asthma exacerbations (which may require intubation and invasive ventilation) or deaths related to asthma. Heroin use must be sought in case of asthma exacerbation in young persons and practitioners must help heroin users to stop their consumption.","Underner, Michel; Perriot, Jean; Peiffer, Gérard; Jaafari, Nematollah",Presse Med,108,24

For patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD), spine surgery often requires extended LOS and non-routine discharge. Given resource limitations during the COVID-19 pandemic and caution regarding hospital stays, surgeons have modified standard postoperative protocols to minimize patient exposure. PURPOSE The primary aim of this study was to compare LOS and discharge disposition of ASD patients undergoing surgery before and during the pandemic. Secondary aims were to compare the rates of 30-day complications, readmissions, and ED visits. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING Retrospective review of an institutional surgical registry. PATIENT SAMPLE A total of 117 patients with adult thoracolumbar deformity. OUTCOME MEASURES Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions and ED visits. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent elective thoracolumbar ASD surgery with ≥5 levels fusion at a tertiary care center during two distinct time intervals: Jul-Dec 2019 (Pre-COVID, N=60) and Jul-Dec 2020 (During-COVID, N=57). Outcome measures included LOS and discharge disposition (home vs non-home), as well as 30-day major complications, reoperations, readmissions, and ED visits. Regression analyses controlled for demographic and surgical factors. RESULTS Patients who underwent ASD surgery during the pandemic were younger (61 vs 67 years) and had longer fusion constructs (9 vs 8 levels) compared to before pandemic (p<0.05 for both). On bivariate analysis, patients undergoing surgery during the pandemic had significantly lower LOS (6 vs 8 days) and were more likely to be discharged home (70% vs 28%) (p<0.05 for both). After controlling for age and levels fused on multivariable regression, patients who had surgery during the pandemic continued to demonstrate a significantly lower LOS (IRR=0.83, p=0.015) and greater odds of home discharge (OR=7.2, p<0.001). Notably, there were no significant differences in reoperations, readmissions, ED visits, or major complications between the two groups (p>0.05 for all). CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, the LOS for patients undergoing thoracolumbar ASD surgery decreased, and more patients were discharged home without adversely affecting complication or readmission rates. Lessons learned during the pandemic may help improve resource utilization without negatively influencing outcomes.

Objectives: This paper describes a PCR-hybridization-immunoenzymatic assay (PCR Adenovirus consensus(®)) used to detect Ad and identify Ad species in respiratory specimens. Results: On seven representative serotypes Ad 12, Ad 3, Ad 7, Ad 11, Ad 1, Ad 8, Ad 4, the mean genome equivalents per ml and the mean 50% infectious doses per ml were 10(6.3)and 10(4), respectively. Using 362 nasal aspirates from children, Ad were detected by immunofluorescence (IF) and culture in 97 cases (27%), by the PCR-Ad hexon method in 107 cases (29.5%) and by the PCR Adenovirus Consensus(®) method in 113 cases (31.2%); 13 samples were found positive by both PCR and negative by the IF and culture methods; five samples were only positive according to the PCR Adenovirus Consensus(®) method. The sensitivity, specificity, predictive positive value and predictive negative value of the PCR Adenovirus Consensus(®) method were 97.9%, 93.2%, 84%, 99.1%, respectively. The method identified the species (sp) from 91 positive amplicons: 1 Ad sp A, 44 Ad sp B, 42 Ad sp C, 3 Ad sp E, and 1 Ad sp F; 85 isolates were identified by IF or the neutralisation in culture, and 86 by a PCR-RE digestion method. The PCR Adenovirus Consensus(®) detected six positive samples that were negative according to the IF and culture methods, and it identified the precise species of nine IF-positive and culture-negative nasal aspirates.

Understanding the transmission dynamics of emerging pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2 and other novel human coronaviruses is imperative in designing effective control measures. Viral load contributes to the transmission potential of the virus, but findings around the temporal viral load dynamics, particularly the peak of transmission potential, remain inconsistent across studies due to limited sample sizes. Methods: We searched PubMed through June 8th 2020 and collated unique individual-patient data (IPD) from papers reporting temporal viral load and shedding data from coronaviruses. We analyzed viral load trajectories using a series of generalized additive models, and the duration of viral shedding by fitting log-normal models accounting for interval censoring. Results: We identified 115 relevant papers and obtained data from 66 (57.4%) - representing a total of 1198 patients across 14 countries. SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to symptom onset and remains elevated for up to three weeks, while MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV viral loads peak after symptom onset. SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV had median viral shedding durations of 4.8, 4.2, and 1.2 days after symptom onset. Disease severity, age, and specimen type all have an effect on viral load, but sex does not. Discussion: Using a pooled analysis of the largest collection of IPD on viral load to date, we are the first to report that SARS-CoV-2 viral load peaks prior to -- not at -- symptom onset.

Thus, viral entry into the host cell sets up the stage for productive infection and disease progression. Different viruses exploit distinct cellular receptors for viral entry; however, numerous viral internalization mechanisms are shared by very diverse viral families. Such is the case of Ebola virus (EBOV), which belongs to the filoviridae family, and the recently emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These two highly pathogenic viruses can exploit very similar endocytic routes to productively infect target cells. This convergence has sped up the experimental assessment of clinical therapies against SARS-CoV-2 previously found to be effective for EBOV, and facilitated their expedited clinical testing. Here we review how the viral entry processes and subsequent replication and egress strategies of EBOV and SARS-CoV-2 can overlap, and how our previous knowledge on antivirals, antibodies, and vaccines against EBOV has boosted the search for effective countermeasures against the new coronavirus. As preparedness is key to contain forthcoming pandemics, lessons learned over the years by combating life-threatening viruses should help us to quickly deploy effective tools against novel emerging viruses.","Muñoz-Basagoiti, Jordana; Perez-Zsolt, Daniel; Carrillo, Jorge; Blanco, Julià; Clotet, Bonaventura; Izquierdo-Useros, Nuria",Membranes (Basel),108,1

In many cases, this is impeded by cellular stress responses. These stress responses swiftly relocate and repurpose translation machinery, resulting in global inhibition of translation and the aggregation of stalled 48S mRNPs into cytoplasmic foci called stress granules. This results in translational silencing of all mRNAs excluding those beneficial for the cell to resolve the specific stress. For example, expression of antiviral factors is maintained during viral infection. Here we investigated stress granule regulation by Gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), which causes the economically important poultry disease, infectious bronchitis. Interestingly, we found that IBV is able to inhibit multiple cellular stress granule signaling pathways whilst at the same time IBV replication also results in induction of seemingly canonical stress granules in a proportion of infected cells. Moreover, IBV infection uncouples translational repression and stress granule formation and both processes are independent of eIF2α phosphorylation. These results provide novel insights into how IBV modulates cellular translation and antiviral stress signaling.","Brownsword, Matthew J.; Doyle, Nicole; Brocard, Michèle; Locker, Nicolas; Maier, Helena J.",bioRxiv,108,20

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have shown its efficacy in the treatment of behaviour disorders. This study aims to evaluate an online mindfulness-based brief intervention skill named ‘STOP (Stop, Take a Breath, Observe, Proceed) touching your face’ in reducing face-touching behaviour. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This will be an online-based, randomised, controlled, trial. We will recruit 1000 participants, and will randomise and allocate participants 1:1 to the ‘STOP touching your face’ (both 750-word text and 5 min audio description by online) intervention group (n=500) and the wait-list control group (n=500). All participants will be asked to monitor and record their face-touching behaviour during a 60 min period before and after the intervention. Primary outcome will be the efficacy of short-term mindfulness-based ‘STOP touching your face’ intervention for reducing the frequency of face-touching. The secondary outcomes will be percentage of participants touching their faces; the correlation between the psychological traits of mindfulness and face-touching behaviour; and the differences of face-touching behaviour between left-handers and right-handers. Analysis of covariance, regression analysis, χ(2) test, t-test, Pearson’s correlations will be applied in data analysis. We will recruit 1000 participants from April to July 2020 or until the recruitment process is complete. The follow-up will be completed in July 2020. We expect all trial results to be available by the end of July 2020. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, an affiliate of Zhejiang University, Medical College (No. 20200401-32).

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is sometimes difficult due to the absence of symptoms and its tendency to be masked by other diseases. In this paper, we report a COVID-19 case in which diagnosis was delayed due to aspiration pneumonia. A 64-year-old man visited our department for evaluation of swallowing function. However, during the examination, the patient aspirated testing food and subsequently developed a fever. Based on his medical history and computed tomography (CT) images, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia and admitted to the hospital to begin treatment. However, after admission, his respiratory condition deteriorated, and the result of a COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive. Previous reports have shown that CT images in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia were normal in the early phase, and abnormalities usually appeared approximately 6–11 days after onset. Common findings of COVID-19 are consolidation, ground-glass opacities, and a distribution of lesions predominantly in the bilateral inferior lung field periphery. It is difficult to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other types of pneumonia; it should therefore be listed as a differential diagnosis during the current pandemic.","Matsushita, Yutaka; Kurihara, Sho; Omura, Kazuhiro; Kojima, Hiromi",Auris Nasus Larynx,108,16

This study aims to look at telemedicine utilization patterns within a large pediatric gastroenterology practice. METHODS: A retrospective study of ambulatory care visits within Yale-New Haven Hospital's pediatric gastroenterology practice during the peak expansion of the telemedicine program was conducted. Zip code-level socioeconomic data were obtained using the Distressed Communities Index. A multivariate logistic regression to evaluate disparities between the use of video versus telephone visits was computed, and unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained. RESULTS: A total of 1273 clinic visits were included in analysis. The majority of the patients listed English as their preferred language, had private insurance, and identified as non-Hispanic White. When adjusting for co-variates, having public insurance/Medicaid was associated with decreased odds of having video over telephone visits (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.60; 95% CI 0.44-0.80). Those whose primary language was not English continued to have a statistically significant decreased odds of using video visits (Spanish aOR 0.24; 95% CI 0.13-0.44; other aOR 0.29; 95% CI 0.12-0.72). Within the adjusted multivariate logistic regression, race/ethnicity and SES were, however, no longer found to have a statistically significant decreased odds of video visits. CONCLUSIONS: The accelerated implementation of telemedicine within pediatric gastroenterology has given rise to disparities in its use. Further studies are needed to understand these disparities and develop interventions to lessen this gap in usage.","Puthenpura, Vidya; Du, Nan; Hauptman, Leora; Porto, Anthony F",J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr,108,1

While attention has focused on the effects of these measures on epidemiological indicators relating directly to the infection, there is increased recognition of their broader health implications. However, assessing these implications in real time is a challenge, due to limitations of existing syndromic surveillance data and tools. Objective: To explore the added value of mobile phone app-based symptom assessment tools as real time health insight providers to inform public health policy makers. Methods: A comparative and descriptive analysis of the proportion of all self-reported symptoms entered by users during an Ada assessment in Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) was conducted between two periods: before and after the implementation of Phase One COVID-19 measures. Additional analyses were performed to explore the association between symptom trends and seasonality, and symptom trends and weather. Differences in the proportion of unique symptoms between the periods were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-squared test and reported as Log2 Fold Changes (Log2 FC). Results: Between 48,300-54,900 symptomatic users reported 140,500-170,400 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods in Germany. Between 34,200-37,400 symptomatic users in the UK reported 112,100-131,900 symptoms during the Baseline and Measures periods. The majority of symptomatic users were female (Germany 68,600/103,200, 66.52%; UK 51,200/71,600, 72.74%). The majority (Germany 68,500/100,000, 68.45%; UK 50,900/68,800, 73.91%) were aged between 10 and 29 years, and about a quarter (Germany 26,200/100,000, 26.15%; UK 14,900/68,800, 21.65%) were between 30-59 years. 103 symptoms were reported either more or less frequently (with statistically significant differences) during the Measures as compared to the Baseline period, and 34 of these were found in both countries. The following mental health symptoms (Log2 FC, P-value) were reported less often during the Measures period: inability to manage constant stress and demands at work (-1.07, P<.001), memory difficulty (-0.56, P<.001), depressed mood (-0.42, P<.001), and impaired concentration (-0.46, P<.001). Diminished sense of taste (2.26, P<.001) and hyposmia (2.20, P<.001) were reported more frequently during the Measures period. None of the 34 symptoms were found to be different between the same dates in 2019. Fourteen of the 34 symptoms had statistically significant associations with weather variables. Conclusions: Symptom assessment apps have an important role to play in facilitating improved understanding of the implications of public health policies such as COVID-19 lockdown measures. Not only do they provide the means to complement and cross-validate hypotheses based on data collected through more traditional channels, they can also generate novel insights through a real-time syndromic surveillance system.","Mehl, A.; Bergey, F.; Cawley, C.; Gilsdorf, A.",,108,23

METHODS Review of the medical records for patients > 60 years of age (n=5,394) hospitalized with COVID-19 from 132 community hospitals between March and June, 2020. We examined the relationships between dementia and treatment intensity (including intensive care unit admission (ICU) and mechanical ventilation (MV) and care processes that may influence them, including advance care planning (ACP) billing and do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders) and in-hospital mortality adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, month of hospitalization, and clustering within hospital. We further explored the effect of ACP conversations on the relationship between dementia and outcomes, both at the individual patient level (effect of having ACP) and at the hospital level (effect of being treated at a hospital with low: <10%, medium 10-20%, or high >20% ACP rates). RESULTS Ten percent (n=522) of the patients had documented dementia. Dementia patients were older (> 80yo: 60% vs. 27%, p< 0.0001), had a lower burden of comorbidity (3+ comorbidities: 31% vs. 38%, p=0.003), were more likely to have ACP (28% vs. 17%, p<0.0001) and a DNR order (52% vs. 22%, p<0.0001), had similar rates of ICU admission (26% vs. 28%, p=0.258), were less likely to receive MV (11% vs. 16%, p=0.001), and more likely to die (22% vs. 14%, p<0.0001). Differential treatment intensity among patients with dementia was concentrated in hospitals with low, dementia-biased ACP billing practices (risk-adjusted ICU use: 21% vs 30%, OR=0.6, p=0.016; risk-adjusted MV use: 6% vs 16%, OR=0.3, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Dementia was associated with lower treatment intensity and higher mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Differential treatment intensity was concentrated in low-ACP billing hospitals suggesting an interplay between provider bias and ""preference-sensitive"" care for COVID-19.","Barnato, Amber E; Birkmeyer, John D; Skinner, Jonathan S; O'Malley, A James; Birkmeyer, Nancy J O",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,108,31

This study sought to define platelet activation dynamics in KD patients by assaying platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs). We measured plasma PDMPs levels in 46 patients with KD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Blood samples were collected before, at 2–5 days, and 9–15 days after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion, 2 months and 4–5 months after the onset of KD. We measured PDMP levels in 23 febrile and 10 afebrile control patients. In the acute phase of KD patients, PDMP levels increased significantly after IVIG treatment (12.04 ± 5.58 nmol before IVIG infusion vs. 19.81 ± 13.21 nmol at 2–5 days after IVIG infusion, P = 0.006). PDMP levels were negatively correlated with age and positively correlated with procalcitonin levels in the acute phase of KD. No significant difference was found in PDMP levels between KD patients with and without coronary artery lesion (CAL). Elevated PDMP levels after IVIG therapy significantly decreased below the pre-IVIG level in subacute phase (19.81 ± 13.21 nmol at 2–5 days after IVIG infusion vs. 8.33 ± 2.02 nmol at 9–15 days after IVIG infusion, P < 0.001), and PDMP levels stayed below the pre-IVIG level in the convalescent phase, during which antiplatelet therapy was given. However, PDMP levels rebounded after discontinuing aspirin in 17 patients. In conclusion, enhanced platelet activation was noted before treatment of KD and peaked immediately after IVIG treatment. Recurrent rising of PDMP levels was observed after discontinuing aspirin, although there were no significant differences between the PDMP levels at 2 months after the onset of KD and those at 4–5 months after the onset of the disease.","Kim, Hyun Jung; Choi, Eun-Hye; Lim, Yeon Jung; Kil, Hong Ryang",J Korean Med Sci,108,0

These were recovered from HIV-1 infected subjects, and several (e.g., PG9, PG16, CH01, CH03) target glycans in the first and second variable (V1/V2) domain of gp120. The V1/V2 domain is thought to play an important role in conformational masking, and antibodies to the V1/V2 domain were recently identified as the only immune response that correlated with protection in the RV144 HIV-1 vaccine trial. While the importance of antibodies to polymeric glycans is well established for vaccines targeting bacterial diseases, the importance of antibodies to glycans in vaccines targeting HIV has only recently been recognized. Antibodies to GDEs may be particularly significant in HIV vaccines based on gp120, where 50% of the molecular mass of the envelope protein is contributed by N-linked carbohydrate. However, few studies have reported antibodies to GDEs in humans or animals immunized with candidate HIV-1 vaccines. In this report, we describe the isolation of a mouse mAb, 4B6, after immunization with the extracellular domain of the HIV-1 envelope protein, gp140. Epitope mapping using glycopeptide fragments and in vitro mutagenesis showed that binding of this antibody depends on N-linked glycosylation at asparagine N130 (HXB2 numbering) in the gp120 V1/V2 domain. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to natural HIV-1 infection, immunization with recombinant proteins can elicit antibodies to the GDEs in the V1/V2 domain of gp120. Although little is known regarding conditions that favor antibody responses to GDEs, our studies demonstrate that these antibodies can arise from a short-term immunization regimen. Our results suggest that antibodies to GDEs are more common than previously suspected, and that further analysis of antibody responses to the HIV-1 envelope protein will lead to the discovery of additional antibodies to GDEs.","Doran, Rachel C.; Morales, Javier F.; To, Briana; Morin, Trevor J.; Theolis, Richard; O’Rourke, Sara M.; Yu, Bin; Mesa, Kathryn A.; Berman, Phillip W.",Molecular Immunology,108,16

We compared the time course of the size and quality of both rectus femoris and diaphragm muscles between critically-ill, COVID-19 survivors and non-survivors, and explored the correlation between the change in muscles size and quality with the amount of nutritional support delivered and the cumulative fluid balance. METHODS: Prospective observational study in the general ICU of a tertiary care hospital for COVID-19. The right rectus femoris cross-sectional area and the right diaphragm thickness, as well as their echodensities were assessed within 24 hours from ICU admission and on day 7. Anthropometric and biochemical data, respiratory mechanics and gas exchange, daily fluid balance and the amount of calories and proteins administered were recorded. RESULTS: 28 patients were analysed (age 65±10 years, 80% males, BMI 30.0±7.8). Rectus femoris and diaphragm sizes were significantly reduced at day 7 (-26.1 [-37.8;-15.2] and -29.2 [-37.8;-19.6]%, respectively) and this reduction was significantly higher in non-survivors. Both rectus femoris and diaphragm echodensity were significantly increased at day 7, with a significantly higher increase in non-survivors. The change in both rectus femoris and diaphragm size at day 7 was related to the cumulative protein deficit (R=0.664, p<0.001 and R=0.640, p<0.001, respectively), while the change in rectus femoris and diaphragm echodensity was related to the cumulative fluid balance (R=0.734, p<0.001 and R=0.646, p<0.001, respectively) CONCLUSIONS: Early changes in muscle size and quality seem related to the outcome of critically-ill, COVID-19 patients, and be influenced by nutritional and fluid management strategies.","Umbrello, Michele; Guglielmetti, Luigi; Formenti, Paolo; Antonucci, Edoardo; Cereghini, Sergio; Filardo, Clelia; Montanari, Giulia; Muttini, Stefano",Nutrition,108,1

Hence, the present study attempts to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the water quality of River Gomti across its stretch of ~960 km through the assessment of ‘Water Quality Index’ (WQI). The study also highlights the potential risk of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 through intake of river water facing the issue of direct discharge of domestic sewage. A deterioration in the water quality was witnessed at ~69% sampling locations during the lockdown period (May 2020). Interestingly, none of the water samples during the pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods across the whole stretch belonged to the “excellent” category (WQI<25). The DO levels fell across ~69% and ~88% of the sites during the lockdown and post-lockdown periods, respectively. Moreover, there was an increase in the BOD(5) levels across ~69% and 75% of the sites during lockdown and post-lockdown periods, respectively. These findings indicate that the release of sewage without or with partial treatment is a chief contributor of water pollution in the groundwater fed River Gomti. Thereby, highlighting the possible risk of faecal-oral transmission of the corona virus, and creating a major concern for the residents across its stretch. The urban sprawl and riverfront development in Lucknow city also emerge as potential causes of water quality deterioration in River Gomti, considering that the water quality at five sites within the city was under the “unfit” category regardless of the lockdown situation. Thus, the urgent need of management of domestic sewage release into the river and further research on the potential risk of faecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 have been suggested in the study.","Khan, Ramsha; Saxena, Abhishek; Shukla, Saurabh; Sekar, Selvam; Goel, Pooja",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,108,1

Interdependence theory has been widely used to understand how relationship partners influence health behavior, including how sexual minority male (SMM) couples regulate HIV risk. Couples with better relationship functioning tend to be more successful at negotiating joint (shared) goals and subsequently accomplishing them. The study recruited 134 cis-male, SARS-CoV-2 negative adults in relationships with cis-male partners from phone-based social networking applications. Participants completed an online survey assessing relationship functioning (Perceived Relationship Components Questionnaire), COVID-19 prevention behaviors, and risk perceptions. Partners’ consensus around joint COVID-19 prevention effort was assessed using an adapted version of the Preferences for Sexual Health Outcomes scale. Path analyses indicated that consensus for joint prevention effort predicted social distancing (B = 0.23; p = .001) and the number of other COVID-19 prevention behaviors engaged in (B = 0.17; p = .003) above and beyond perceived risk and relationship functioning. Relationship satisfaction predicted higher levels of consensus for joint COVID-19 prevention effort (B = 0.40; p = .029). Findings suggest that the theoretical foundations of successful HIV prevention interventions that utilize joint goal formation may generalize to the prediction of COVID-19 prevention behavior and may be leveraged to mitigate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among SMM in relationships. Interventions that overlook the potential for dyadic regulation of health behavior may miss opportunities to capitalize on shared coping resources and fail to address relational barriers to prevention.","Starks, Tyrel J.; Bosco, Stephen C.; Doyle, Kendell M.; Revenson, Tracey A.",Arch Sex Behav,108,8

The severity of the disease depends on the patient’s overall medical condition but no appropriate markers are available to establish the prognosis of the patients. We performed a 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealing an altered composition of the nasal/oropharyngeal (NOP) microbiota in 21 patients affected by COVID-19, paucisymptomatic or in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), as compared to 10 controls negative for COVID-19 or eight affected by a different Human Coronavirus (HKU, NL63 and OC43). A significant decrease in Chao1 index was observed when patients affected by COVID-19 (in ICU) were compared to paucisymptomatic. Furthermore, patients who were in ICU, paucisymptomatic or affected by other Coronaviruses all displayed a decrease in the Chao1 index when compared to controls, while Shannon index significantly decreased only in patients under ICU as compared to controls and paucisymptomatic patients. At the phylum level, Deinococcus-Thermus was present only in controls as compared to SARS-CoV-2 patients admitted to ICU, paucisymptomatic or affected by other coronaviruses. Candidatus Saccharibacteria (formerly known as TM7) was strongly increased in negative controls and SARS-CoV-2 paucisymptomatic patients as compared to SARS-CoV-2 ICU patients. Other modifications were observed at a lower taxonomy level. Complete depletion of Bifidobacterium and Clostridium was exclusively observed in ICU SARS-CoV-2 patients, which was the only group characterized by the presence of Salmonella, Scardovia, Serratia and Pectobacteriaceae. In conclusion, our preliminary results showed that nasal/oropharyngeal microbiota profiles of patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 may provide valuable information in order to facilitate the stratification of patients and may open the way to new interventional strategies in order to ameliorate the outcome of the patients.","Rueca, Martina; Fontana, Andrea; Bartolini, Barbara; Piselli, Pierluca; Mazzarelli, Antonio; Copetti, Massimiliano; Binda, Elena; Perri, Francesco; Gruber, Cesare Ernesto Maria; Nicastri, Emanuele; Marchioni, Luisa; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Di Caro, Antonino; Pazienza, Valerio",Int J Environ Res Public Health,108,1

We found that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, spike becomes lipid modified, through the sequential action of the S-acyltransferases ZDHHC20 and 9. Particularly striking is the rapid acylation of spike on 10 cytosolic cysteines within the ER and Golgi. Using a combination of computational, lipidomics, and biochemical approaches, we show that this massive lipidation controls spike biogenesis and degradation, and drives the formation of localized ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid-rich lipid nanodomains in the early Golgi, where viral budding occurs. Finally, S-acylation of spike allows the formation of viruses with enhanced fusion capacity. Our study points toward S-acylating enzymes and lipid biosynthesis enzymes as novel therapeutic anti-viral targets.","Mesquita, Francisco S.; Abrami, Laurence; Sergeeva, Oksana; Turelli, Priscilla; Qing, Enya; Kunz, Béatrice; Raclot, Charlène; Paz Montoya, Jonathan; Abriata, Luciano A.; Gallagher, Tom; Dal Peraro, Matteo; Trono, Didier; D’Angelo, Giovanni; van der Goot, F.

OBJECTIVES: The ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry aims to estimate the true impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the treatment and outcome of patients with STEMI treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), with identification of “at-risk” patient cohorts for failure to present or delays to treatment. METHODS: This retrospective registry was performed in European high-volume PPCI centers and assessed patients with STEMI treated with PPPCI in March/April 2019 and 2020. Main outcomes are the incidences of PPCI, delayed treatment, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 6,609 patients underwent PPCI in 77 centers, located in 18 countries. In 2020, during the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in PPCI as compared with 2019 (incidence rate ratio: 0.811; 95% confidence interval: 0.78 to 0.84; p < 0.0001). The heterogeneity among centers was not related to the incidence of death due to COVID-19. A significant interaction was observed for patients with arterial hypertension, who were less frequently admitted in 2020 than in 2019. Furthermore, the pandemic was associated with a significant increase in door-to-balloon and total ischemia times, which may have contributed to the higher mortality during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a 19% reduction in PPCI procedures, especially among patients suffering from hypertension, and a longer delay to treatment, which may have contributed to the increased mortality during the pandemic.

The bronchial and lung epithelium comprises a large surface between host and environment and is attacked as a primary target during lung infection. Besides acting as a mechanical barrier, recent evidence suggests that the lung epithelium functions as an important sentinel system against pathogens. Equipped with transmembranous and cytosolic pathogen-sensing pattern recognition receptors the epithelium detects invading pathogens. A complex signalling results in epithelial cell activation, which essentially participates in initiation and orchestration of the subsequent innate and adaptive immune response. In this review we summarize recent progress in research focussing on molecular mechanisms of pathogen detection, host cell signal transduction, and subsequent activation of lung epithelial cells by pathogens and their virulence factors and point to open questions. The analysis of lung epithelial function in the host response in pneumonia may pave the way to the development of innovative highly needed therapeutics in pneumonia in addition to antibiotics.","Hippenstiel, Stefan; Opitz, Bastian; Schmeck, Bernd; Suttorp, Norbert",Respir Res,108,16

Humans are assumed to become infected due to contact with this animal or its excretions. Thus far, the available literature does not describe the sampling of feces as a means to detect LASV in M. natalensis populations. More evidence is needed to know if feces of naturally infected M. natalensis can be LASV-positive and an exposure risk to humans. This study sampled feces deposits in households from three villages in the LASV-endemic region of Faranah, Guinea.

Among the clinical manifestations of COVID-19, the disease that results from SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, a prominent feature is a pro-thrombotic derangement of the hemostatic system, possibly representing a peculiar clinicopathologic manifestation of viral sepsis. The severity of the derangement of coagulation parameters in COVID-19 patients has been associated with a poor prognosis, and the use of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) at doses registered for prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) has been endorsed by the World Health Organization and by Several Scientific societies.

However, COVID-19 diagnosis is currently performed almost exclusively by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Although this is efficient, automatable and acceptably cheap, reliance on one type of technology comes with serious caveats, as illustrated by recurring reagent and test shortages.

This aspect is of great concern for wildlife conservation and human health, because the list of highly susceptible animal groups that have contracted SARS-CoV-2 (bats, mustelids, and primates) is large and, once infected, these groups can act as vectors and reservoirs, becoming a substrate for viral mutations and recombinations and boosting the risk of new strains emerging, which can return to humans as new diseases. Little is known about the inducing factors facilitating coronavirus spillover from one species to another, but it can be argued that interface zones between wild fauna and humans, which are narrow edges between anthropic (cities, roads, parks, ecotourism sites, and agricultural frontiers) and sylvatic habitat, are zones of increased interaction between humans and wild animals, and thus have a higher probability of viral spillover events than other areas. In a similar context, the habitat compression by forest fragmentation also brings species and infected beings closer, reducing their home ranges and intensifying the risk of spillover among wild populations. Therefore, on the basis of the premise for zoonosis—the greater human–animal interaction, the greater risk of viral spillover—we aimed to identify the most and least susceptible areas to viral spillover in Brazil. Methods We developed an approach combining ecological modelling (Biomod2: modelling habitat suitability for 158 bat and 49 primate species) and geographical information systems (by using demographic indicators, roads, and related variables) to map the most and least susceptible areas to spillover in Brazil. This map indicates priority areas for serological surveillance of fauna for monitoring the spillover and circulation of SARS-CoV-2 strains and variants in Brazilian biodiversity. Findings Among our most relevant preliminary results, we found that forested areas surrounding the São Paulo Metropolitan Area are among the most susceptible areas for spillover. This resulted from the combination of high contaminated human density and high density of non-human primates interacting with humans in these transitional areas. Interpretation Because of the high resolution of the results, the map can be useful for action planning and decision making in conservation and health, since susceptible areas denote not only a greater risk of virus jumping from humans to animals, but also of coronaviruses returning from fauna to humans in new viral strains.

They rely on the use of magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) as detecting label, replacing conventional gold or latex beads. MNPs can be sensed and quantified by means of external devices, allowing the development of immunochromatographic tests with a quantitative capability. Moreover, they have an added advantage because they can be used for immunomagnetic separation (IMS), with improvements in selectivity and sensitivity. In this paper, we have reviewed the current knowledge on magnetic-lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA), coupled with both research and commercially available instruments. The work in the literature has been classified in two categories: optical and magnetic sensing. We have analysed the type of magnetic nanoparticles used in each case, their size, coating, crystal structure and the functional groups for their conjugation with biomolecules. We have also taken into account the analytical characteristics and the type of transduction. Magnetic LFIA have been used for the determination of biomarkers, pathogens, toxins, allergens and drugs. Nanocomposites have been developed as alternative to MNP with the purpose of sensitivity enhancement. Moreover, IMS in combination with other detection principles could also improve sensitivity and limit of detection. The critical analysis in this review could have an impact for the future development of magnetic LFIA in fields requiring both rapid separation and quantification.","Moyano, Amanda; Serrano-Pertierra, Esther; Salvador, María; Martínez-García, José Carlos; Rivas, Montserrat; Blanco-López, M.

OBJECTIVE: We filled this gap by assessing relevant data availability and quality across states, and in states with available data, investigating how racial-ethnic disparities in CFR changed after age adjustment. DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS/EXPOSURE: We conducted a landscape analysis as of July 1st, 2020 and developed a grading system to assess COVID-19 case and death data by age and race in 50 states and DC. In states where age- and race-specific data were available, we applied direct age standardization to compare CFR across race-ethnicities. We developed an online dashboard to automatically and continuously update our results. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Our main outcome was CFR (deaths per 100 confirmed cases). We examined CFR by age and race-ethnicities. RESULTS: We found substantial variations in disaggregating and reporting case and death data across states. Only three states, California, Illinois and Ohio, had sufficient age- and race-ethnicity-disaggregation to allow the investigation of racial-ethnic disparities in CFR while controlling for age. In total, we analyzed 391,991confirmed cases and 17,612 confirmed deaths. The crude CFRs varied from, e.g. 7.35% among Non-Hispanic (NH) White population to 1.39% among Hispanic population in Ohio. After age standardization, racial-ethnic differences in CFR narrowed, e.g. from 5.28% among NH White population to 3.79% among NH Asian population in Ohio, or an over one-fold difference. In addition, the ranking of race-ethnic-specific CFRs changed after age standardization. NH White population had the leading crude CFRs whereas NH Black and NH Asian population had the leading and second leading age-adjusted CFRs respectively in two of the three states. Hispanic population’s age-adjusted CFR were substantially higher than the crude. Sensitivity analysis did not change these results qualitatively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The availability and quality of age- and race-ethnic-specific COVID-19 case and death data varied greatly across states. Age distributions in confirmed cases obscured racial-ethnic disparities in COVID-19 CFR. Age standardization narrows racial-ethnic disparities and changes ranking. Public COVID-19 data availability, quality, and harmonization need improvement to address racial disparities in this pandemic.","Pathak, Ishaan; Choi, Yoonjoung; Jiao, Dazhi; Yeung, Diana; Liu, Li",medRxiv,108,1

Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement was consulted to report this systematic review. Relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP (Chinese) database. Results: A total of 21 studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses suggest that mask use provided a significant protective effect (OR = 0.35 and 95% CI = 0.24-0.51). Use of masks by healthcare workers (HCWs) and non-healthcare workers (Non-HCWs) can reduce the risk of respiratory virus infection by 80% (OR = 0.20, 95% CI = 0.11-0.37) and 47% (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.36-0.79). The protective effect of wearing masks in Asia (OR = 0.31) appeared to be higher than that of Western countries (OR = 0.45). Masks had a protective effect against influenza viruses (OR = 0.55), SARS (OR = 0.26), and SARS-CoV-2 (OR = 0.04). In the subgroups based on different study designs, protective effects of wearing mask were significant in cluster randomized trials, case-control studies and retrospective studies. Conclusions: This study adds additional evidence of the enhanced protective value of masks, we stress that the use masks serve as an adjunctive method regarding the COVID-19 outbreak.","Liang, Mingming; Gao, Liang; Cheng, Ce; Zhou, Qin; Uy, John Patrick; Heiner, Kurt; Sun, Chenyu",,108,17

Therefore, accurate diagnosis of PEDV infection is critical for the implementation of control measures for the virus. Many diagnostic tests have been recently developed and are currently available for the detection of PEDV, its proteins or nucleic acid, including virus isolation, immunofluorescence (IF) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and isothermal amplification assays. Additionally, several serological assays have been developed and are currently used for the detection of antibodies against PEDV. Molecular assays such as real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (rRT-PCR) became the methods of choice for the diagnosis of PEDV infection, providing sensitive, specific and rapid detection of the virus RNA in clinical samples. Whereas serological assays have been widely used to monitor prior exposure to the virus and to evaluate the efficacy of novel vaccine candidates or vaccination strategies. Here we discuss the properties of current PEDV diagnostic assays and prospects for improving diagnostic strategies in the future.","Diel, D.

Recognizing this, the Global Initiative for Asthma neither recommends SABA monotherapy nor regards this formulation as a preferred reliever. Many health systems and healthcare professionals (HCPs) experience practical issues in implementing guidelines. Clear quality standards can drive improvements in asthma care and encourage implementation of global and national medical guidelines. METHODS: A steering group of global asthma experts came together between May and September 2019 to develop quality statements codifying the minimum elements of good quality asthma care. These statements were either evidence based (when robust evidence was available) or reflected a consensus based on clinical expertise and experience of the group. RESULTS: The quality statements (and associated essential criteria) developed emphasize key elements concerning (1) objective diagnosis specific to individual symptoms, (2) treatment appropriate to the long-term management of asthma as an inflammatory disease, consistent with evidence-based recommendations, (3) controlled dispensing of SABA canisters and monitoring to prevent overuse, (4) regular review of patients after treatment initiation or change, and (5) follow-up of patients in primary care after treatment for an exacerbation in a hospital or an emergency department. CONCLUSIONS: The steering group proposes quality statements that national and local clinical groups can implement as quantitative quality standards that are appropriate to their local circumstances, including during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. By translating these statements into locally relevant quality standards, primary care physicians and HCPs can encourage optimal management and reduce preventable healthcare interactions. The evidence-based evolution of care encapsulated in these statements will further engender high-quality, patient-centered holistic management that addresses asthma as an inflammatory disease. In particular, the statements empower self-management by patients and encourage health-promoting behaviors, which are essential to reduce exacerbations, the primary goal of asthma management.

Consequent socio-economic burden is tremendous. Unprecedented decrease in age of maladaptive individuals has been reported. The absolute majority of expanding non-communicable disorders carry a chronic character, over a couple of years progressing from reversible suboptimal health conditions to irreversible severe pathologies and cascading collateral complications. The time-frame between onset of SHS and clinical manifestation of associated disorders is the operational area for an application of reliable risk assessment tools and predictive diagnostics followed by the cost-effective targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person. This article demonstrates advanced strategies in bio/medical sciences and healthcare focused on suboptimal health conditions in the frame-work of Predictive, Preventive and Personalised Medicine (3PM/PPPM). Potential benefits in healthcare systems and for society at large include but are not restricted to an improved life-quality of major populations and socio-economical groups, advanced professionalism of healthcare-givers and sustainable healthcare economy. Amongst others, following medical areas are proposed to strongly benefit from PPPM strategies applied to the identification and treatment of suboptimal health conditions: Stress overload associated pathologies. Male and female health. Planned pregnancies. Periodontal health. Eye disorders. Inflammatory disorders, wound healing and pain management with associated complications. Metabolic disorders and suboptimal body weight. Cardiovascular pathologies. Cancers. Stroke, particularly of unknown aetiology and in young individuals. Sleep medicine. Sports medicine.

COVID-19 can lead to death especially for patients having chronic diseases such as cancer, AIDS, etc. We construct a new within-host SARS-CoV-2/cancer model. The model describes the interactions between six compartments: nutrient, healthy epithelial cells, cancer cells, SARS-CoV-2 virus particles, cancer-specific CTLs, and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. We verify the nonnegativity and boundedness of its solutions. We outline all possible equilibrium points of the proposed model. We prove the global stability of equilibria by constructing proper Lyapunov functions. We do some numerical simulations to visualize the obtained results. According to our model, lymphopenia in COVID-19 cancer patients may worsen the outcomes of the infection and lead to death. Understanding dysfunctions in immune responses during COVID-19 infection in cancer patients could have implications for the development of treatments for this high-risk group.","Elaiw, A.M.; Al Agha, A.D.",Appl Math Comput,108,21

This phenomenon has underscored the dependence of microbial virulence on the immune status of the host. The limited efficacy of the available antimicrobial armamentarium in immunocompromised individuals, combined with increasing resistance to these agents, has led to an urgent need for new therapies for infectious diseases. Immunomodulation represents a novel approach to antimicrobial therapy that depends on bolstering host immunity, rather than direct antimicrobial activity. Immunomodulators can be divided into those that are specific to pathogens (pathogen-specific) and those that are not specific to pathogens (non-specific).

We present a means to optimize a forecasting model by functionalizing our previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model with SEIR-like parameters. Conversely, SEIR models can be adapted to better incorporate real-time data. Methods: Our previously reported asymmetric Gaussian model was shown to greatly improve on forecasting accuracy relative to use of symmetric functions, such as Gaussian and error functions for death rates and cumulative deaths, respectively. However, the reported asymmetric Gaussian implementation, which fitted well to the ascent and much of the recovery side of the real death rate data, was not agile enough to respond to changing social behavior that is resulting in persistence of infections and deaths in the later stage of recovery. We have introduced a time-dependent {sigma}(t) parameter to account for transmission rate variability due to the effects of behavioral changes such as social distancing and subsequent social easing. The {sigma}(t) parameter is analogous to the basic reproduction number R0 (infection factor) that is evidently not a constant during the progression of COVID-19 for a particular population. The popularly used SEIR model and its many variants are also incorporating a time dependent R0(t) to better describe the effects of social distancing and social easing to improve predictive capability when extrapolating from real-time data. Results: Comparisons are given for the previously reported Asymmetric Gaussian model and to the revised, what we call, SEIR Gaussian model. We also have developed an analogous model based on R0(t) that we call SEIR Statistical model to show the correspondence that can be attained. It is shown that these two models can replicate each other and therefore provide similar forecasts based on fitting to the same real-time data. We show the results for reported U.S. death rates up to June 12, 2020 at which time the cumulative death count was 113,820. The forecasted cumulative deaths for these two models and compared to the University of Washington (UW) IHME model are 140,440, 139,272, and 149,690 (for 8/4/20) and 147,819, 148, 912, and 201,129 (for 10/1/20), respectively. We also show how the SEIR asymmetric Gaussian model can also account for various scenarios of social distancing, social easing, and even rebound outbreaks where the death and case rates begin climbing again. Conclusions: Forecasting models, based on real-time data, are essential for guiding policy and human behavior to minimize the deadly impact of COVID-19 while balancing the need to socialize and energize the economy. It is becoming clear that changing social behavior from isolation to easing requires models that can adapt to the changing transmission rate in order to more accurately forecast death and case rates. We believe our asymmetric Gaussian approach has advantages over modified SEIR models in offering simpler governing equations that are dependent on fewer variables.","Syage, J. A.",,108,8
