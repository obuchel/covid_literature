Monoclonal antibodies to HARS were isolated by single-cell screening and sequencing from three Jo-1 positive ASS patients and shown to be of high affinity, covering diverse epitope space. The immune response was further characterized by repertoire sequencing from the most productive of the donor samples. In line with previous studies of autoimmune repertoires, these antibodies tended to have long complementarity-determining region H3 sequences with more positive-charged residues than average. Clones of interest were clustered into groups with related sequences, allowing us to observe different somatic mutations in related clones. We postulated that these had found alternate structural solutions for high affinity binding, but that mutations might be transferable between clones to further enhance binding affinity. Transfer of somatic mutations between antibodies within the same clonal group was able to enhance binding affinity in a number of cases, including beneficial transfer of a mutation from a lower affinity clone into one of higher affinity. Affinity enhancement was seen with mutation transfer both between related single-cell clones, and directly from related repertoire sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of somatic hypermutation transfer from repertoire sequences to further mature in vivo derived antibodies, and represents an additional tool to aid in affinity maturation for the development of antibodies.","Burman, Luke; Chong, Yeeting E.; Duncan, Sherie; Klaus, Anders; Rauch, Kaitlyn; Hamel, Kristina; Hervé, Karine; Pfaffen, Stephanie; Collins, David W.; Heyries, Kevin; Nangle, Leslie; Hansen, Carl; King, David J.",,649,20

The objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) has been an integral part of dental examinations for several decades. The COVID-19 pandemic stopped face to face examinations around the world. An Online Virtual OSCE (VOSCE) was developed and piloted for dental undergraduate assessment. AIM This initial report outlines the steps required to run an OSCE on-line. DISCUSSION With careful planning the VOSCE is a useful assessment method in difficult times. Feedback from staff and students was favourable. CONCLUSION Although significant organisation was required the examination process worked well for both students and examiners. Despite limitations in relation to technical dental procedures, the VOSCE could be a viable alternative to face to face clinical examination.","Donn, James; Alun Scott, James; Binnie, Vivian; Bell, Aileen",European journal of dental education : official journal of the Association for Dental Education in Europe,649,11

METHODS This was an observational study carried out in Turkey. An online semi-structured questionnaire was developed by using google forms and the link of the questionnaire was sent through emails, WhatsApp and other social media to the contacts of the investigators between 20th March 2020 and 25th March 2020. The questionare contained 21 questions and Beck anxiety scale. RESULTS 1070 people were included in the study. Approximately one fifth of the participants had no idea about treatment and immunization against COVID 19. According to the categorization of Beck Anxiety Inventory scores 8.6% showed severe anxiety symptoms. Anxiety levels of women, healthcare workers and those with psychiatric illness were higher (p <0.05). It was observed that women, healthcare professionals, those with chronic diseases, and those with moderate to severe anxiety used the medical facemask more frequently (p <0.05). 73% of the participants thought that they fully implemented the proposed measures; 25.2% of the them stated that population did not take any measures for the COVID 19. CONCLUSION According to the results of the study individuals usually had better awareness and positive attitudes towards COVID 19 pandemic, but there were also things that needed improvement. The most important measure to be taken in order to prevent anxiety from increasing is to ensure the correct access of information and to establish psychological support lines.","Ayhan Başer, Duygu; Çevik, Murat; Gümüştakim, Şule; Başara, Ekrem",International journal of clinical practice,649,11

This analysis explores moderators of stress coping to determine which subgroups of FCs benefited most from SMART-3RP. METHODS 102 FCs from Mass General Brigham hospitals engaged in the adapted SMART-3RP. Assessments were completed at group entry (Week 0) and completion (Week 4). The primary outcome was stress coping, and we examined 15 possible baseline moderators. We fit linear mixed effects regression models and assessed potential baseline moderators using a likelihood ratio test. We report model-based estimates and confidence intervals for each moderator-by-time interaction (i.e., differential effect), where positive/negative values indicate more/less improvement in average perceived stress coping. RESULTS Stress coping improved from Week 0 to Week 4 (mean improvement [95% CI] = 0.9 [0.6 to 1.2]). FCs with higher anxiety (differential effect [95% CI] = 0.3 [0.1 to 0.4]), depression (0.4 [0.2 to 0.6]), and loneliness (0.4 [0.1 to 0.6]), but lower levels of mindfulness (CAMS-Rfocus: 1.0 [0.4 to 1.6]; CAMS-Raccept: 1.3 [0.7 to 2.0]) and self-compassion (0.4, [0.1 to 0.8]) at baseline experienced greater benefits in perceived stress coping from the SMART-3RP. Baseline health uncertainty along with sociodemographic and work characteristics did not moderate stress coping.

We have developed a modified below-knee amputation (BKA) procedure that incorporates agonist-antagonist myoneural interfaces (AMIs), which surgically preserve and couple agonist-antagonist muscle pairs for the subtalar and ankle joints. AMIs are designed to restore physiological neuromuscular dynamics, enable bidirectional neural signaling, and offer greater neuroprosthetic controllability compared to traditional amputation techniques. In this prospective, nonrandomized, unmasked study design, 15 subjects with AMI below-knee amputation (AB) were matched with 7 subjects who underwent a traditional below-knee amputation (TB). AB subjects demonstrated significantly greater control of their residual limb musculature, production of more differentiable efferent control signals, and greater precision of movement compared to TB subjects (P < 0.008). This may be due to the presence of greater proprioceptive inputs facilitated by the significantly higher fascicle strains resulting from coordinated muscle excursion in AB subjects (P < 0.05). AB subjects reported significantly greater phantom range of motion postamputation (AB: 12.47 ± 2.41, TB: 10.14 ± 1.45 degrees) when compared to TB subjects (P < 0.05). Furthermore, AB subjects also reported less pain (12.25 ± 5.37) than TB subjects (17.29 ± 10.22) and a significant reduction when compared to their preoperative baseline (P < 0.05). Compared with traditional amputation, the construction of AMIs during amputation confers the benefits of enhanced physiological neuromuscular dynamics, proprioception, and phantom limb perception. Subjects' activation of the AMIs produces more differentiable electromyography (EMG) for myoelectric prosthesis control and demonstrates more positive clinical outcomes.","Srinivasan, Shriya S; Gutierrez-Arango, Samantha; Teng, Ashley Chia-En; Israel, Erica; Song, Hyungeun; Bailey, Zachary Keith; Carty, Matthew J; Freed, Lisa E; Herr, Hugh M",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,649,31

It usually occurs due to an infection of an anal gland. In the UK, the annual incidence is 40 per 100,000 of the adult population, and the standard treatment is admission to hospital for incision and drainage under general anaesthetic. Following drainage of the pus, an internal dressing (pack) is placed into the cavity to stop bleeding. Common practice is for community nursing teams to change the pack regularly until the cavity heals. Some practitioners in the USA and Australia make a small stab incision under local anaesthetic and place a catheter into the cavity which drains into an external dressing. It is removed when it stops draining. Elsewhere in the USA, simple drainage is performed in an outpatient setting under local anaesthetic. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of internal dressings in healing wound cavities resulting from drainage of perianal abscesses. SEARCH METHODS In May 2016 we searched: The Cochrane Wounds Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid MEDLINE (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid EMBASE and EBSCO CINAHL Plus. We also searched clinical trial registries to identify ongoing and unpublished studies, and searched reference lists of relevant reports to identify additional studies. We did not restrict studies with respect to language, date of publication, or study setting. SELECTION CRITERIA Published or unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any type of internal dressing (packing) used in the post-operative management of perianal abscess cavities with alternative treatments or different types of internal dressing. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently performed study selection, risk of bias assessment, and data extraction. MAIN RESULTS We included two studies, with a total of 64 randomised participants (50 and 14 participants) aged 18 years or over, with a perianal abscess. In both studies, participants were enrolled on the first post-operative day and randomised to continued packing by community district nursing teams or to no packing. Participants in the non-packing group managed their own wounds in the community and used absorbant dressings to cover the area. Fortnightly follow-up was undertaken until the cavity closed and the skin re-epithelialised, which constituted healing. For non-attenders, telephone follow-up was conducted.Both studies were at high risk of bias due to risk of attrition, performance and detection bias.It was not possible to pool the two studies for the outcome of time to healing. It is unclear whether continued post-operative packing of the cavity of perianal abscesses affects time to complete healing. One study reported a mean time to wound healing of 26.8 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 22.7 to 30.7) in the packing group and 19.5 days (95% CI 13.6 to 25.4) in the non-packing group (it was not clear if all participants healed). We re-analysed the data and found no clear difference in the time to healing (7.30 days longer in the packing group, 95% CI -2.24 to 16.84; 14 participants). This was assessed as very low quality evidence (downgraded three levels for very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias). The second study reported a median time to complete wound healing of 24.5 days (range 10 to 150 days) in the packing group and 21 days (range 8 to 90 days) in the non-packed group. There was insufficient information to be able to recreate the analysis and the original analysis was inappropriate (did not account for censoring). This second study also provided very low quality evidence (downgraded four levels for serious risk of bias, serious indirectness and very serious imprecision).There was very low quality evidence (downgraded for risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision) of no difference in wound pain scores at the initial dressing change. Both studies also reported patients' retrospective judgement of wound pain over the preceding two weeks (visual analogue scale, VAS) as lower for the non-packed group (2; both studies) compared with the packed group (0; both studies); (very low quality evidence) but we have been unable to reproduce these analyses as no variance data were published.There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of post-operative fistulae detected between the packed and non-packed groups (risk ratio (RR) 2.31, 95% CIs 0.56 to 9.45, I(2) = 0%) (very low quality evidence downgraded three levels for very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias).There was no clear evidence of a difference in the number of abscess recurrences between the packed and non-packed groups over the variable follow-up periods (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.22 to 2.37, I(2) = 0%) (very low quality evidence downgraded three levels for serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision).No study reported participant health-related quality of life/health status, incontinence rates, time to return to work or normal function, resource use in terms of number of dressing changes or visits to a nurse, or change in wound size. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS It is unclear whether using internal dressings (packing) for the healing of perianal abscess cavities influences time to healing, wound pain, development of fistulae, abscess recurrence or other outcomes. Despite this absence of evidence, the practice of packing abscess cavities is commonplace. Given the lack of high quality evidence, decisions to pack may be based on local practices or patient preferences. Further clinical research is needed to assess the effects and patient experience of packing.","Smith, Stella R; Newton, Katy; Smith, Jennifer A; Dumville, Jo C; Iheozor-Ejiofor, Zipporah; Pearce, Lyndsay E; Barrow, Paul J; Hancock, Laura; Hill, James",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,649,8

While globally the pandemic is at different stages and far from under control in some countries, now is the time for public health researchers and political scientists to start understanding how and why governments responded the way they have, explore how effective these responses appear to be, and what lessons we can draw about effective public health policymaking in preparation of the next wave of COVID-19 or the next infectious disease pandemic. We argue that there will be no way to understand the different responses to COVID-19 and their effects without understanding policy and politics. We propose four key focuses to understand the reasons for COVID-19 responses: social policies to crisis management as well as recovery, regime type (democracy or autocracy), formal political institutions (federalism, presidentialism), and state capacity (control over health care systems and public administration). A research agenda to address the COVID-19 pandemic that takes politics as a serious focus can enable the development of more realistic, sustainable interventions in policies and shape our broader understanding of the politics of public health.","Greer, Scott L; King, Elizabeth J; da Fonseca, Elize Massard; Peralta-Santos, Andre",Global public health,649,17

The best well-known vaccines have utilized either mRNA or an adenovirus vector to direct human cells to produce the spike protein against which the body produces mostly neutralizing antibodies. However, recent reports have raised some skepticism as to the biologic actions of the spike protein and the types of antibodies produced. One paper reported that certain antibodies in the blood of infected patients appear to change the shape of the spike protein so as to make it more likely to bind to cells, while other papers showed that the spike protein by itself (without being part of the corona virus) can damage endothelial cells and disrupt the blood-brain barrier. These findings may be even more relevant to the pathogenesis of long-COVID syndrome that may affect as many as 50% of those infected with SARS-CoV-2. In COVID-19, a response to oxidative stress is required by increasing anti-oxidant enzymes. In this regard, it is known that polyphenols are natural anti-oxidants with multiple health effects. Hence, there are even more reasons to intervene with the use of anti-oxidant compounds, such as luteolin, in addition to available vaccines and anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent the harmful actions of the spike protein.","Theoharides, T C; Conti, P",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,649,31

These subtypes are proposed to predict outcome after treatment. This hypothesis was tested using a database of patients who underwent laparoscopic Heller's cardiomyotomy with anterior fundoplication. METHODS All patients who underwent Heller's cardiomyotomy for achalasia between June 1993 and March 2015 were identified from an institutional database. Manometry tracings were retrieved and re-reported according the Chicago classification. Outcome was assessed by a postal questionnaire, and designated a success if the modified Eckardt score was 3 or less, and the patient had not undergone subsequent surgery or pneumatic dilatation. Difference in outcome after cardiomyotomy was analysed with a mixed-effects logistic regression model. RESULTS Sixty, 111 and 24 patients had type I, II and II achalasia respectively. Patients with type III achalasia were more likely to be older than those with type I or II (mean age 63 versus 50 and 49 years respectively; P = 0·001). Some 176 of 195 patients returned questionnaires after surgery. Type III achalasia was less likely to have a successful outcome than type II (odds ratio (OR) 0·38, 95 per cent c.i. 0·15 to 0·94; P = 0·035). There was no significant difference in outcome between types I and II achalasia (II versus I: OR 0·87, 0·47 to 1·60; P 0·663). The success rate at 3-year follow-up was 69 per cent (22 of 32) for type I, 66 per cent (33 of 50) for type II and 31 per cent (4 of 13) for type III. CONCLUSION Type III achalasia is a predictor of poor outcome after cardiomyotomy. There was no difference in outcome between types I and II achalasia.","Hamer, P W; Holloway, R H; Heddle, R; Devitt, P G; Kiroff, G; Burgstad, C; Thompson, S K",The British journal of surgery,649,17

This exploratory study aims at a proof of concept for an advanced device-modeling tool in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to evaluate flow modification effects by PED in actual, treated cases. METHODS The authors performed computational modeling of 3 PED-treated complex aneurysm cases. The patient in Case 1 had a fusiform vertebral aneurysm treated with a single PED. In Case 2 the patient had a giant internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm treated with 2 PEDs. Case 3 consisted of tandem ICA aneurysms (III-a and III-b) treated by a single PED. The authors' recently developed high-fidelity virtual stenting (HiFiVS) technique was used to recapitulate the clinical deployment process of PEDs in silico for these 3 cases. Pretreatment and posttreatment aneurysmal hemodynamics studies performed using CFD simulation were analyzed. Changes in aneurysmal flow velocity, inflow rate, wall shear stress (WSS), and turnover time were calculated and compared with the clinical outcome. RESULTS In Case 1 (occluded within the first 3 months), the aneurysm had the most drastic flow reduction after PED placement; the aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS were decreased by 76.3%, 82.5%, and 74.0%, respectively, whereas the turnover time was increased to 572.1% of its pretreatment value. In Case 2 (occluded at 6 months), aneurysmal average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS were decreased by 39.4%, 38.6%, and 59.1%, respectively, and turnover time increased to 163.0%. In Case 3, Aneurysm III-a (occluded at 6 months) had a decrease by 38.0%, 28.4%, and 50.9% in average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS, respectively, and turnover time increased to 139.6%, which was quite similar to Aneurysm II. Surprisingly, the adjacent Aneurysm III-b had more substantial flow reduction (a decrease by 77.7%, 53.0%, and 84.4% in average velocity, inflow rate, and average WSS, respectively, and an increase to 213.0% in turnover time) than Aneurysm III-a, which qualitatively agreed with angiographic observation at 3-month follow-up. However, Aneurysm III-b remained patent at both 6 months and 9 months. A closer examination of the vascular anatomy in Case 3 revealed blood draining to the ophthalmic artery off Aneurysm III-b, which may have prevented its complete thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that HiFiVS modeling of flow diverter deployment enables detailed characterization of hemodynamic alteration by PED placement. Posttreatment aneurysmal flow reduction may be correlated with aneurysm occlusion outcome. However, predicting aneurysm treatment outcome by flow diverters also requires consideration of other factors, including vascular anatomy.","Xiang, Jianping; Damiano, Robert J; Lin, Ning; Snyder, Kenneth V; Siddiqui, Adnan H; Levy, Elad I; Meng, Hui",Journal of neurosurgery,649,1

CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency accounts for 95% of cases. We aimed to share the first case of coexistence of simple virilizing-type congenital adrenal hyperplasia [I172N mutation in the CYP21A], triple translocation [t(9;11;12)], and ovarian granulose cell tumor. METHODS A 59-year-old female patient was presented to our clinic, complaining with abdominal pain and distension. Physical examination revealed palpable abdominal mass, virilism, ambiguous genitalia, clitoramegaly, and hyperpigmentation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography showed a giant mass originating from the right tubo-ovarian structure. RESULTS The patient was operated in the light of the clinico-radiological features mentioned above. A giant mass weighing 3500 g was detected on the right tubo-ovarian structure during laparotomy, and mass was excised with right tubo-ovarian structure. Immunohistochemical examination revealed ovarian granulosa cell tumor. The high serum concentration of 17-OH progesterone was measured at baseline and after 250-μg bolus of synthetic ACTH. In genetic analysis, we screened for six-point mutations, large deletions, and non-common mutations using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) methods, PCR, and sequencing of CYP21 gene respectively. The patient was detected to be homozygous for the I172N mutation. In addition, 50% of the metaphases examined had triple translocation [t(9;11;12)]. CONCLUSION The coexistence of congenital adrenal hyperplasia, triple chromosomal translocations, and ovarian granulosa cell tumor has not been described previously.

Subjects 10 years or younger who presented with ABHR-induced ocular injury were included. The same period from 2019 was studied and a comparison was performed between the 2 years. Outcome measures included the number of subjects with ocular injury due to ABHR, extent of ocular epithelial defects, length of hospitalization and time to resolution. RESULTS A total of 9 patients presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department after sustaining ocular chemical injuries from ABHR during this period. Treatment included immediate irrigation followed by topical antibiotics, steroids, and lubrication. Six children were discharged and followed as outpatients with no reported adverse ocular sequelae. Three patients exhibited epithelial defects involving 85% to 100% of the cornea, 30% to 75% of the conjunctiva and required inpatient treatment ranging from 4 to 11 days. All patients experienced a complete resolution of the ocular epithelial defects after 12 to 19 days. No long-term irreversible damage was observed and visual acuity returned to normal in all patients. CONCLUSIONS The utilization of ABHR during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic resulted in childhood ocular injury. Prompt treatment led to good visual outcomes. These products should be regarded as potentially toxic and stored out of the reach of young children.","Wasser, Lauren M; Koppel, Jordanna H; Zadok, David; Berkowitz, Liron; Abulafia, Adi; Heiman, Eyal; Aryan, Ahmad; Roditi, Eduardo; Weill, Yishay",Pediatric emergency care,649,1

The three liquids display a Newtonian plateau followed by a shear thinning regime at shear rates of the order of GHz. Even though the main features of the liquid structure remains under shear, systematic changes were noticed at the GHz rates, with coordination shells becoming more diffuse as noticed by the reduction in the difference between consecutive maxima and minima in the radial distribution function. Interestingly, these structural changes with the shear rate can be precisely fitted using the Carreau equation, which is a well-known expression for the shear rate dependence of the viscosity. The fitting parameters for different distributions can be used to explain qualitatively the shear thinning behavior of these liquids. In the GHz range, the cations and, in a minor extension, some anions, tend to assume preferentially a parallel orientation with the flux, which contributes to the shear thinning behavior and may have consequences for adhesion in applications as lubricants.","Bernardino, Kalil; Ribeiro, Mauro C C",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,649,6

However, to date, quantitative research that has investigated the strategies online groomers employ to gain their victim's trust is scarce. OBJECTIVE To this end, the main aim of this study was to distinguish and measure different strategies of the online grooming process by developing and examining the psychometric properties of the Multidimensional Online Grooming Questionnaire (MOGQ). We also analyzed the prevalence of different strategies of online grooming among a sample of minors and their associations with grooming outcomes (i.e., online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety). PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING The sample consisted of 1704 participants between 12 and 15 years of age (864 girls; Mage = 13.77, SD = 1.13). METHODS Examination of the structure of the MOGQ was accomplished using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). For this purpose, the sample was randomly divided into two subsamples. RESULTS EFA and CFA showed a structure composed of five factors, including Use of Deception, Gift giving, Study of victim's environment, Sexualization, and Aggression. Second, the analysis of the relationship of online grooming with grooming outcomes (online sexual solicitations and sexual interactions) and mental health (i.e., depression and anxiety) provided evidence for the concurrent validity of the instrument. Finally, the prevalence of grooming strategies within the sample ranged between 7% for aggression to 18% for interest in the victim's environment. Overall grooming strategies were more prevalent for girls than boys and increased with age. CONCLUSION Distinguishing between different strategies of online grooming is recommended in order to advance research and the prevention of this type of child abuse.","Gámez-Guadix, Manuel; De Santisteban, Patricia; Wachs, Sebastian; Wright, Michelle",Child abuse & neglect,649,16

The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate the relationship between work-related chronic stress as well as exhaustion and a cumulative measure of physiological wear-and-tear called allostastic load (AL). AL could be a possible biological pathway for how chronic work stress and exhaustion lead to health impairments in the long run. As the teaching profession has been proposed to be a potentially high stressful occupation, chronic work stress (effort-reward-imbalance) and exhaustion were assessed in 104 female school teachers. AL was first analyzed according to McEwen's classical model comprised of ten parameters including cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), waist/hip-ratio (WHR), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol/HDL-ratio, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Additionally it was extended to include tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, D-dimer, percent-body-fat, triglycerides, and glucose levels. A substantial proportion of our sample was highly exhausted whereas relatively few teachers showed high effort-reward-imbalance. AL scores were significantly higher in women high on effort-reward-imbalance or suffering from exhaustion. Although all teachers had been in a good health status, chronic work stress as well as exhaustion appears to be associated with changes in a multi-system summary indicator of physiological risk.","Bellingrath, Silja; Weigl, Tobias; Kudielka, Brigitte M",Stress,649,19

METHODS This was a retrospective study of pediatric patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis in a single pediatric institution that assumed care responsibility for most of the pediatric emergencies during the lockdown period in Madrid (Spain). A control group was made up of the same number of patients diagnosed the previous year. RESULTS One hundred fifty-one patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis were included (77 during self-quarantine and 74 during the previous year). The incidence of complicated appendicitis was 38.9% versus 28.3%, showing no significant differences. The 2 groups were homogeneous, with no differences in time elapsed between symptom onset and first emergency department visit, laboratory test results, median length of stay, intensive care admissions, or patients correctly diagnosed on their first visit. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) self-quarantine has not increased the incidence of complicated appendicitis, and children who developed complicated appendicitis did not have worse clinical outcomes. Parents did not delay presenting for medical attention, and emergency department pediatricians did not fail to diagnose this condition. Reorganization of hospital resources, fast-track treatment protocols for noncomplicated appendicitis, and extended use of home-stay hospitalization for complicated appendicitis could have contributed to these favorable outcomes.","Gaitero Tristán, Jara; Souto Romero, Henar; Escalada Pellitero, Silvia; Espiñera, Clara Rico; Andina Martín, David; Espinosa Góngora, Rocío; Martín Diaz, María José; Leónidas Espinoza, Manuel",Pediatric emergency care,649,16

Therefore, a method that can convert 3Q into a substrate with enhanced detectability by GC-MS would be an important tool in its analysis. METHODS 2,2,2-trichloroethoxycarbonyl chloride (TrocCl) was used in the derivatization of 3Q in three different soils of varying composition and total organic content (Virginia Type A soil, Nebraska EPA standard soil and Ottawa sand) when present at a 10 μg·g-1 concentration in each. A direct derivatization protocol and one involving the pre-extraction of the analyte were evaluated for their individual efficiencies and subsequent analysis by EI-GC-MS. RESULTS The practical derivatization of 3Q, when present at low levels (10 μg·g-1 ) in three different soil matrices was found to be rapid (1 hour) and to smoothly take place at ambient temperature (and as low as 4 o C). The method detection limit (MDL) was determined to be 30 ng·mL-1 for the Virginia type A soil, 49 ng·mL-1 for the Nebraska EPA standard soil and 72 ng·mL-1 for the Ottawa sand sample. CONCLUSIONS An expedient and practical derivatization method for 3Q, a chemical warfare degradation product difficult to detect by GC-MS, has been accomplished using trichloroethyl chloroformate. The reaction provides 3Q-Troc, a derivative with superior detectability than 3Q by EI-GC-MS such as peak sharpness and a unique mass spectrum for its unambiguous identification.","Valdez, Carlos A; Leif, Roald N; Vu, Alexander K; Salazar, Edmund P",Rapid communications in mass spectrometry : RCM,649,7

However, surgeons are subjected to hardworking conditions because of the poor ergonomic design of the instruments. In this article, a new ergonomic handle design is presented. This handle is designed using ergonomic principles, trying to provide both more intuitive manipulation of the instrument and a shape that reduces the high-pressure zones in the contact with the surgeon's hand. MATERIALS AND METHODS The ergonomic characteristics of the new handle were evaluated using objective and subjective studies. The experimental evaluation was performed using 28 volunteers by means of the comparison of the new handle with the ring-handle (RH) concept in an instrument available on the market. The volunteers' muscle activation and motions of the hand, wrist, and arm were studied while they performed different tasks. The data measured in the experiment include electromyography and goniometry values. RESULTS The results obtained from the subjective analysis reveal that most volunteers (64%) preferred the new prototype to the RH, reporting less pain and less difficulty to complete the tasks. The results from the objective study reveal that the hyperflexion of the wrist required for the manipulation of the instrument is strongly reduced. CONCLUSIONS The new ergonomic handle not only provides important ergonomic advantages but also improves the efficiency when completing the tasks. Compared with RH instruments, the new prototype reduced the high-pressure areas and the extreme motions of the wrist.","Sancibrian, Ramon; Gutierrez-Diez, María C; Torre-Ferrero, Carlos; Benito-Gonzalez, Maria A; Redondo-Figuero, Carlos; Manuel-Palazuelos, Jose C",The Journal of surgical research,649,1

PATIENTS We obtained data from the electronic medical record of all adult severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2-positive patients managed in the ICU of Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, MI, between March 13, 2020, and July 31, 2020. Included patients were divided into two groups: people of color (including Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, and Arab) and White. INTERVENTIONS None.

People of color were younger (62.8 vs 67.1; p = 0.007), with equal distribution of sex. People of color had less coronary artery disease (34 [14.4%] vs 35 [27.1%]; p =0.003) and less self-reported use of regular alcohol consumption (50 [21.2%] vs 12 [9.3%]; p = 0.004) than Whites, with no differences in diabetes (125 [53.0%] vs 66 [51.2%]; p = 0.742), hypertension (188 [79.7%] vs 99 [76.8%]; p = 0.516), congestive heart failure (41 [17.4%] vs 32 [24.8%]; p = 0.090), or chronic kidney disease (123 [54.1%] vs 55 [42.6%]; p = 0.083).There was no difference in ICU length of stay between people of color (18 d [CI, 7-47 d]) and Whites (18 d [CI, 6-48 d]; p = 0. 0.979). Neither frequency (72.5% vs 71.3%; p = ns) nor median time to mechanical ventilation between people of color (9 d [CI, 6-15 d]) and Whites (10 d [CI, 5-16 d]; p = 0.733) was different. Overall, 188 patients (51.5 %) died in the hospital. The 28-day mortality was lower in people of color (107/236; 45.3%) versus Whites (73/129; 56.6%) (adjusted odds ratio 0.60; p = 0.034), and there was an increased median survival time in people of color (20 d) versus Whites (13.5 d; hazard ratio 0.62; p = 0.002). The inhospital mortality was lower in people of color versus White, but the difference was not statistically significant (113 [47.9%] vs 75 [58.1%], respectively; p = 0.061). Finally, there was no significant difference in days of symptoms prior to admission, frequency of presenting symptoms, or frequency or severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS In critically ill patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019, people of color had a lower 28-day mortality than Whites with no difference in hospital mortality, ICU length of stay, or rates of intubation.

It has been estimated that approximately 1.5% of the world's population need a prosthesis or orthosis. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to systematically identify and review the evidence from randomized controlled trials assessing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of prosthetic and orthotic interventions. METHODS Literature searches, completed in September 2015, were carried out in fourteen databases between years 1995 and 2015. The search results were independently screened by two reviewers. For the purpose of this manuscript, only randomized controlled trials which examined interventions using orthotic or prosthetic devices were selected for data extraction and synthesis. RESULTS A total of 342 randomised controlled trials were identified (319 English language and 23 non-English language). Only 4 of these randomised controlled trials examined prosthetic interventions and the rest examined orthotic interventions. These orthotic interventions were categorised based on the medical conditions/injuries of the participants. From these studies, this review focused on the medical condition/injuries with the highest number of randomised controlled trials (osteoarthritis, fracture, stroke, carpal tunnel syndrome, plantar fasciitis, anterior cruciate ligament, diabetic foot, rheumatoid and juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankle sprain, cerebral palsy, lateral epicondylitis and low back pain). The included articles were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Details of the clinical population examined, the type of orthotic/prosthetic intervention, the comparator/s and the outcome measures were extracted. Effect sizes and odds ratios were calculated for all outcome measures, where possible. CONCLUSIONS At present, for prosthetic and orthotic interventions, the scientific literature does not provide sufficient high quality research to allow strong conclusions on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.","Healy, Aoife; Farmer, Sybil; Pandyan, Anand; Chockalingam, Nachiappan",PloS one,649,1

No prospective randomized trial has tested the addition of cisplatin to single-agent chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC and PS2. CAPPA-2 was a multicenter, randomized phase 3 study for first-line treatment of PS2 patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients, aged 18-70, were eligible if they had stage IV or IIIB with malignant pleural effusion or metastatic supraclavicular nodes (TNM VI edition) and adequate organ function. Patients in standard arm received gemcitabine 1200 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. Patients in experimental arm received cisplatin 60 mg/m(2) day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8. All treatments were repeated every 3 weeks, up to 4 cycles, unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). To have 80% power of detecting hazard ratio (HR) 0.71, corresponding to an increase in median OS from 4.8 to 6.8 months, 285 deaths were required. The study was stopped in June 2012 after the enrolment of 57 patients, due to the slow accrual and the report of positive results from a similar study. Median OS was 3.0 months with single-agent gemcitabine and 5.9 months with cisplatin plus gemcitabine (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.98, p = 0.039). Combination chemotherapy produced longer PFS (median 1.7 vs. 3.3 months, HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27-0.89, p = 0.017) and higher response rate (4% vs. 18%, p = 0.19), without substantial increase in toxicity.

However, one important safety consideration for TLV is a better understanding of the early events during the transition to TLV, especially regarding the fate of residual air in the non-dependent-lung regions. Our objective was to assess perflubron distribution during transition to TLV using electrical impedance tomography, complemented by fluoroscopy, in a neonatal lamb model of induced surfactant deficiency. Eight lambs were anesthetized and ventilated in supine position. Surfactant deficit was induced by saline lung lavage. After deflation, lungs were filled with 25 ml/kg perflubron over 18 s, and TLV was initiated. Electrical impedance tomography data was recorded from electrodes placed around the chest, during the first 10 and at 120 min of TLV. Lung perfusion was also assessed using hypertonic saline injection during apnea. In addition, fluoroscopic sequences were recorded during initial lung filling with perfluorocarbons, then at 10 and 60 min of TLV. Twelve lambs were used as controls for histological comparisons. Transition to TLV involved a short period of increased total lung volume (p = 0.01) secondary to recruitment of the dependent lung regions. Histological analysis shows that TLV was protective of these same regions when compared to gas-ventilated lambs (p = 0.03). The non-dependent lung regions filled with perflubron over at least 10 min, without showing signs of overdistention. Tidal volume distribution was more homogenous in TLV than during the preceding gas ventilation. Perflubron filling was associated with a non-significant increase in the anterior distribution of the blood perfusion signal, from 46 ± 17% to 53 ± 6% (p = 0.4). However, combined to the effects on ventilation, TLV had an instantaneous effect on ventilation-perfusion relationship (p = 0.03), suggesting better coupling. Conclusion: transition to TLV requires at least 10 min, and involves air evacuation or dissolution in perflubron, dependent lung recruitment and rapid ventilation-perfusion coupling modifications. During that time interval, the total lung volume transiently increases. Considering the potential deleterious effect of high lung volumes, one must manage this transition phase with care and, we suggest using a real-time monitoring system such as electrical impedance tomography.","Sage, Michaël; Stowe, Symon; Adler, Andy; Forand-Choinière, Claudia; Nadeau, Mathieu; Berger, Claire; Marouan, Sofia; Micheau, Philippe; Tissier, Renaud; Praud, Jean-Paul; Fortin-Pellerin, Étienne",Frontiers in physiology,649,8

METHODS We collected data of 757 patients with pulmonary metastasis from colorectal cancer who underwent curative metastasectomy between 2004 and 2008 from 46 Japanese institutions, from which we extracted data on patients who previously received curative hepatic metastasectomy. Disease-free survival, overall survival, and prognostic factors were analyzed. RESULTS The subjects of this study were 160 patients, of whom 44% had primary rectal tumor, 73% had a single pulmonary metastasis, 11% had a bilateral pulmonary metastasis, and 39% had high (>5 ng/mL) serum carcinoembryonic antigen. Patients' median age was 66 years, and 58% were male. The median follow-up was 64 months. Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival were 65.2% (95% confidence interval, 56.8-72.5) and 33.5% (95% confidence interval, 26.1-41.0), respectively. In multivariable analyses, high prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen level was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.16-3.47) and disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-3.12). Five-year overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with normal prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen level were 76.4% (95% confidence interval, 66.1-83.9) and 40.7% (95% confidence interval, 30.5-50.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS After pulmonary metastasectomy, approximately two thirds of patients with colorectal cancer with a history of curative hepatic metastasectomy survived for 5 years-half of them disease-free. Our results indicate that patients with colorectal cancer with pulmonary metastasis and a history of curative hepatic metastasectomy may benefit from sequential pulmonary metastasectomy, especially if prethoracotomy serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels are within normal range.","Shimizu, Kimihiro; Ohtaki, Yoichi; Okumura, Takehiro; Boku, Narikazu; Horio, Hirotoshi; Takenoyama, Mitsuhiro; Yamashita, Motohiro; Hyodo, Ichinosuke; Mori, Keita; Kondo, Haruhiko",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,649,27

The dimensionality of tasks ranges from small molecule physicochemical property assessment over protein-ligand interaction up to statistical analyses of biological data. This way, method development and usability both benefit from insights gained at both ends, when predictiveness and readiness of novel approaches are confirmed, but the pharmaceutical drug makers get early access to novel tools for the quality of drug products and benefit of patients. Quantum-mechanical and simulation methods particularly fall into this group of methods, as they require skills and expense in their development but also significant resources in their application, thus are comparatively slowly dripping into the realm of industrial use. Nevertheless, these physics-based methods are becoming more and more useful. Starting with a general overview of these and in particular quantum-mechanical methods for drug discovery we review a decade-long and ongoing collaboration between Sanofi and the Kast group focused on the application of the embedded cluster reference interaction site model (EC-RISM), a solvation model for quantum chemistry, to study small molecule chemistry in the context of joint participation in several SAMPL (Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands) blind prediction challenges. Starting with early application to tautomer equilibria in water (SAMPL2) the methodology was further developed to allow for challenge contributions related to predictions of distribution coefficients (SAMPL5) and acidity constants (SAMPL6) over the years. Particular emphasis is put on a frequently overlooked aspect of measuring the quality of models, namely the retrospective analysis of earlier datasets and predictions in light of more recent and advanced developments. We therefore demonstrate the performance of the current methodical state of the art as developed and optimized for the SAMPL6 pKa and octanol-water log P challenges when re-applied to the earlier SAMPL5 cyclohexane-water log D and SAMPL2 tautomer equilibria datasets. Systematic improvement is not consistently found throughout despite the similarity of the problem class, i.e. protonation reactions and phase distribution. Hence, it is possible to learn about hidden bias in model assessment, as results derived from more elaborate methods do not necessarily improve quantitative agreement. This indicates the role of chance or coincidence for model development on the one hand which allows for the identification of systematic error and opportunities toward improvement and reveals possible sources of experimental uncertainty on the other. These insights are particularly useful for further academia-industry collaborations, as both partners are then enabled to optimize both the computational and experimental settings for data generation.","Tielker, Nicolas; Eberlein, Lukas; Hessler, Gerhard; Schmidt, K Friedemann; Güssregen, Stefan; Kast, Stefan M",Journal of computer-aided molecular design,649,1

Its residue is a serious problem in crop rotations. In this study, Oryza sativa L. seedlings was used as a model plant to explore its biochemical response to abiotic stress caused by QNC and nZVI coexposure, as well as the interactions between QNC and nZVI treatments. Exposure to 5 and 10 mg/L QNC reduced the fresh biomass by 26.6% and 33.9%, respectively, compared to the control. The presence of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the QNC toxicity, but the nZVI toxicity was aggravated by the coexist of QNC. Root length was enhanced upon exposure to low or medium doses of both QNC and nZVI, whereas root length was inhibited under high-dose coexposure. Both nZVI and QNC, either alone or in combination, significantly inhibited the biosynthesis of chlorophyll, and the inhibition rate increased with elevated nZVI and QNC concentration. It was indicated that nZVI or QNC can affect the plant photosynthesis, and there was a significant interaction between the two treatments. Effects of QNC on the antioxidant response of Oryza sativa L. differed in the shoots and roots; generally, the introduction of 50 and 250 mg/L nZVI alleviated the oxidative stress (POD in shoots, SOD and MDA in roots) induced by QNC. However, 750 mg/kg nZVI seriously damaged Oryza sativa L. seedlings, which likely resulted from active iron deficiency. QNC could be removed from the culture solution by nZVI; as a result, nZVI suppressed QNC uptake by 20%-30%.","Zhang, Ruyang; Bai, Xiaohan; Shao, Jihai; Chen, Anwei; Wu, Haiyong; Luo, Si",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,649,24

Occlusal and panoramic radiography revealed an osteolytic lesion with scalloping margins, bicortical plate expansion, and agenesis of several teeth. Odontogenic keratocyst, central giant cell granuloma, odontogenic myxoma, and ameloblastic fibroma were given as radiological differential diagnoses. Histopathological examination revealed features of plexiform schwannoma which was given as the final diagnosis. The lesion was treated with surgical excision. Although odontogenic cysts/tumors are often thought of in differential diagnosis whenever well-defined radiolucencies in the jaw are encountered, it is prudent to include schwannoma.

We investigated an association between delay in radical prostatectomy (RP) and oncological outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a retrospective review of men with intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer (PC) in the National Cancer Database (NCDB) underdoing radical prostatectomy from 2010-2016. Immediate RP was defined as RP within 3-months of diagnosis, while delayed RP was analyzed in 3-month intervals up to 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression models were fit to test for associations between levels of delayed RP and outcomes of interest (adverse pathology, upgrading on RP, node positive disease, and post-RP secondary treatments) compared with men undergoing immediate RP. RESULTS We identified 128,062 men with intermediate- and high-risk PC treated with RP. After adjustment, we did not appreciate a significant difference in odds of adverse pathology, upgrading, node positive disease, or post-RP secondary treatments between men treated with immediate RP and any level of delay up to 12 months. Subgroup analysis of men with Grade group 4 and 5 PC did not demonstrate an association between delayed RP and worse oncological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In the NCDB, delayed RP was not associated with early adverse oncological outcomes at RP.

Methyl group dynamics of bR embedded in lipid nanodiscs were determined in the dark-adapted state, and were found to be mostly well-ordered at the cytosolic side. Methyl groups in the M145A mutant of bR, which displays only 10% residual proton pumping activity, are less well ordered suggesting a link between side chain dynamics on the cytosolic side of the bR cavity and proton pumping activity. In addition, slow conformational exchange, attributed to low frequency motions of aromatic rings, was indirectly observed for residues on the extracellular side of the bR cavity. This may be related to reorganization of the water network. These observations provide a detailed picture of previously undescribed equilibrium dynamics on different time scales for ground-state bR.","Kooijman, Laurens; Schuster, Matthias; Baumann, Christian; Jurt, Simon; Löhr, Frank; Fürtig, Boris; Güntert, Peter; Zerbe, Oliver",Angewandte Chemie,649,1

AIM This study aimed to investigate the safety and effectiveness of intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator for patients who had previous intracerebral hemorrhage on history or initial brain magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS Using a prospective multicenter stroke registry database, we identified acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator within 4.5 h of onset. Previous intracerebral hemorrhage was defined as having a clinical history or evidence of old intracerebral hemorrhage on initial brain magnetic resonance imaging. Associations of previous intracerebral hemorrhage with symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation during hospitalization and functional outcome and mortality at discharge and three months were analyzed. RESULTS Among 1495 patients who were treated with intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, 73 (4.9%) had previous intracerebral hemorrhage; 9 on history only, 61 on magnetic resonance imaging only and 3 on both. Of those 1495 patients, 71 (4.7%) experienced symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation; 6.8% in patients with previous intracerebral hemorrhage and 4.6% in those without previous intracerebral hemorrhage. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that previous intracerebral hemorrhage did not significantly increase the risk of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation (odds ratio 1.08, 95% confidence interval 0.39-2.96) mortality, and most of functional outcome measures CONCLUSIONS Previous intracerebral hemorrhage may neither increase the risk of symptomatic hemorrhagic transformation nor alter major clinical outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients receiving intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. This study suggests reconsideration of prior history of intracerebral hemorrhage as an exclusion criterion for intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator administration in acute ischemic stroke.","Lee, Sang-Hwa; Kim, Beom Joon; Han, Moon-Ku; Park, Tai Hwan; Lee, Kyung Bok; Lee, Byung-Chul; Yu, Kyung-Ho; Oh, Mi Sun; Cha, Jae Kwan; Kim, Dae-Hyun; Nah, Hyun-Wook; Lee, Jun; Lee, Soo Joo; Ko, Youngchai; Kim, Jae Guk; Park, Jong-Moo; Kang, Kyusik; Cho, Yong-Jin; Hong, Keun-Sik; Choi, Jay Chol; Kim, Joon-Tae; Choi, Kangho; Kim, Dong-Eog; Ryu, Wi-Sun; Kim, Wook-Joo; Shin, Dong-Ick; Yeo, Minju; Lee, Juneyoung; Lee, Ji Sung; Gorelick, Philip B; Bae, Hee-Joon",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,649,23

Design/methodology/approach The experimental method with pre- and post-test and control groups was used to test the improvement in the young learners' sharia financial knowledge. This study used AR for sharia financial socialization on elementary school students and focused on sharia's basic concepts, which include earning money, balanced spending, borrowing, saving, investment, payment methods, financial technology and the concept of protection. Findings This study finds empirical evidence that the treatment group, who received sharia financial socialization via the AR media, increased their sharia financial knowledge to a greater extent than the control group did. Research limitations/implications This study provides encouraging evidence about the potential of sharia financial education for elementary school students using the appropriate learning strategies and media. The weakness in this study is that it was only carried out in one elementary school, with the children of middle- to upper-income parents. Further research should be undertaken at several schools with the children of parents with different income levels. Practical implications A shift in learning styles from verbal or visual to virtual encourages the use of AR-based learning media. Financial concepts can be abstract ones, and AR-based learning media is able to present intangible virtual elements so they become more concrete and tangible. Social implications The global COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects. One of the most severe and likely to be multiyear ahead is the financial aspect. Therefore, this research is expected to be a preparation for the younger generation as early as possible to strengthen social benefits in order to improve sharia financial literacy. Originality/value Research into the financial literacy, especially sharia financial literacy aimed at elementary school students, is still very limited. The teaching of financial literacy will be more effective if educators use the appropriate strategies and media. This study used financial socialization strategies and AR learning media that are aligned with the learning styles of young learners.","Sari, R. C.; Fatimah, P. L. R.; Ilyana, S.; Hermawan, H.

The mismatch between the ability to generate large data sets and the computing skill to analyze them is arguably the most striking within the life sciences. The Digital Image and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) project describes a scaffolded series of interventions implemented over the span of a year to build the coding and computing skill of undergraduate students majoring primarily in the natural sciences. The program is designed as a community of practice, providing support within a network of learners. The program focus, images as data, provides a compelling ‘hook’ for participating scholars. Scholars begin the program with a one-credit spring semester seminar where they are exposed to image analysis. The program continues in the summer with a one-week, intensive Python and image processing workshop. From there, scholars tackle image analysis problems using a pair programming approach and finish the summer with independent research. Finally, scholars participate in a follow-up seminar the following spring and help onramp the next cohort of incoming scholars. We observed promising growth in participant self-efficacy in computing that was maintained throughout the project as well as significant growth in key computational skills. DIVAS program funding was able to support seventeen DIVAS over three years, with 76% of DIVAS scholars identifying as women and 14% of scholars being members of an underrepresented minority group. Most scholars (82%) entered the program as freshmen, with 89% of DIVAS scholars retained for the duration of the program and 100% of scholars remaining a STEM major one year after completing the program. The outcomes of the DIVAS project support the efficacy of building computational skill through repeated exposure of scholars to relevant applications over an extended period within a community of practice.","Brooks, Tessa Durham; Burks, Raychelle; Doyle, Erin; Meysenburg, Mark; Frey, Tim",bioRxiv,649,12

The last systematic review to examine the effect of questionnaire pre-notification on response is ten years old, and lacked a risk of bias assessment. Objectives: Update Edwards et al. (2009) to include 1) recently published studies, 2) an assessment of risk of bias. Methods: Data sources: Edwards et al. (2009); 13 data-bases; the references in, and citations of included studies. Eligibility criteria: Randomised control trials examining the impact of pre-notification on response. Data extraction: data extraction was done twice by a single unblinded reviewer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and funnel plots. Results: 103 trials were included. Over-all pre-notification increased response, OR = 1.38 (95%CI: 1.25-1.53). However, when studies at high or unclear risk of bias were excluded the effect was greatly reduced (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.01-1.21).

The method allowed significant squeezing of the proteome-wide analysis to a few minute time frame at the depth of quantitative proteome coverage of 1000 proteins at 1% FDR. In this work, to further increase the capabilities of the DirectMS1 method, we explored the opportunities presented by the recent progress in the machine learning area and applied the LightGBM tree-based learning algorithm into the scoring of peptide-feature matches when processing MS1 spectra. Further, we integrated the peptide feature identification algorithm of DirectMS1 with the recently introduced peptide retention time prediction utility, DeepLC.

The COVID--19 pandemic led many higher education institutions to close campuses during the 2020--21 academic year. As campuses prepared for a return to in--person education, many institutions were mandating vaccines for students and considering the same for faculty and staff. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of such a strategy based on evidence from a mid--sized midwestern university. Objective. To determine whether high vaccination coverage can mitigate the spread of SARS--CoV--2, even in the presence of highly--transmissible variants and congregate living. Setting: This study was conducted at a mid--sized midwestern university during the spring 2021 semester. Design: The university developed a saliva-based surveillance program capable of high--throughput SARS--CoV--2 polymerase chain reaction testing and genomic sequencing with the capacity to deliver results in less than 24 hours. On April 7, 2021, the university announced a vaccine requirement for all students for the fall 2021 semester and announced the same requirement for faculty and staff on May 20, 2021. The university hosted an onsite mass vaccination clinic using the two--dose Pfizer--BioNTech vaccine April 8--15 and April 29--May 6, 2021. Data from January 6--May 20, 2021 were analyzed. Participants: This study includes 14,894 individuals from the university population who tested on campus for COVID--19 during the spring 2021 semester. Main Outcomes and Measures. Positive SARS--CoV--2 diagnosis was confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription--polymerase chain reaction (qRT--PCR) of saliva specimens and variant identity was assessed by qRT--PCR and next--generation sequencing (NGS) of viral genomes. Results. Between January and May 2021, the university conducted 196,185 COVID--19 tests and identified 1,603 positives -- ~89% students -- with 687 identified via PCR of saliva specimens. The Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant constituted 44% of total positives sequenced. By May 20, 2021, 91% (10,068) of students, 92% (814) of faculty, and 72% (2,081) of staff were vaccinated. The 7--day rolling average of positive cases peaked at 37 cases on February 17 but declined to zero by May 14, 2021. The 7--day moving average of positive cases was inversely associated with the cumulative vaccination rate. Conclusions and Relevance. This study demonstrates the high effectiveness of robust vaccination programs even in the presence of highly--transmissible variants and congregate living.","Avendano, C.; Lilienfeld, A.; Rulli, L.; Stephens, M.; Alvarez Barrios, W.; Sarro, J.; Pfrender, M.; Miranda, M.

However, the anti-vaccination movement is currently on the rise, spreading online misinformation about vaccine safety and causing a worrying reduction in vaccination rates worldwide. In this historical time, it is imperative to understand the reasons of vaccine hesitancy, and to find effective strategies to dismantle the rhetoric of anti-vaccination supporters. For this reason, we analyzed the behavior of anti-vaccination supporters on the platform Twitter. Here we identify that anti-vaccination supporters, in comparison to pro-vaccination supporters, share conspiracy theories and make use of emotional language. We demonstrate that anti-vaccination supporters are more engaged in discussions on Twitter and share their content from a pull of strong influencers. We show that the movement's success relies on a strong sense of community, based on the contents produced by a small fraction of profiles, with the community at large serving as a sounding board for anti-vaccination discourse to circulate online. Surprisingly, our data demonstrate that Donald Trump, together with members of his entourage and his closest supporters, are the main drivers of vaccine misinformation on Twitter. Based on these results, we propose to strategically target the anti-vaccination community online through policies that aim at halting the circulation of false information about vaccines. Based on our data, we also propose solutions to improve the communication strategy of health organizations and build a community of engaged influencers that support the dissemination of scientific insights, including issues related to vaccines and their safety.","Germani, F.; Biller-Andorno, N.",,649,17

COVID-19 had a major impact on returns to real estate. However, the resilience of property returns to COVID-19 varied significantly by location, by sector, and even across individual assets of the same property type in the same city. Resilient investments are those able to withstand the effect of not only acute disruptions in the market but also chronic longer-term threats. For real estate, these threats include pandemics, climate change, changing demographics, changes in tenant preferences, changes in technology, and even factors that are unknown and unpredictable at the moment but that may become important in the future. As some of these threats may not be insurable and may not be diversifiable, much of the work of risk management in creating resilient real estate portfolios will need to be at the property level. A number of approaches can be implemented to increase resilience at a property, but flexibility in building design may be among the most important. Key Findings ▪ COVID-19 had a major impact on returns to real estate. However, the resilience of property returns to COVID-19 varied significantly by location, by sector, and even across individual assets of the same property type in the same city. ▪ Resilient assets are those able to withstand the effects of not only acute disruptions in the market but also chronic longer-term threats. ▪ Traditional risk management often relied on diversification and insurance to control risks, but some long-term threats may not be insurable and may be nondiversifiable. Much of the work to create resilient real estate portfolios must be at the asset level, creating properties that can withstand long-term changes through their design.","Clayton, Jim Fabozzi Frank J.; Giliberto, S.

Humans have long exploited bird migration through hunting and illegal trapping. On the island of Cyprus, trapping birds during their migratory peak is considered a local tradition, but has long been against the law. Illegal bird trapping is a lucrative business, however, with trappers using tape lures that broadcast species’ vocalizations because it is expected to increase numbers of target species. Yet, by how much the use of song playback increases capture rates remains underappreciated. In particular, it is not known whether song playback of target species affects bycatch rates. Here, we show with the use of playback experiments that song playback is highly effective in luring birds towards trapping sites. We found that playback increases six to eight times the number of individuals of target species captured, but also significantly increases bycatch. Our findings thus show that in contrast to popular belief that tape lures are a selective trapping method, they also lead to increased captures of non-target species, which can include species of conservation concern.","Sebastianelli, Matteo; Savva, Georgios; Moysi, Michaella; Kirschel, Alexander N.

The measures were introduced at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to prevent the spread of the disease. One of these measures was the use of two separate real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 referred to as the double screening procedure, which was adopted following the re-opening of the sea, air and land borders for passengers after the first lockdown. The rRT-PCR double screening procedure involved reporting a negative rRT-PCR test which was carried in 72 to 120 h before departure whilst presenting no known symptoms of the COVID-19 and performing a second rRT-PCR test at the point of arrival. This study compares the results of SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR tests performed on incoming flight passengers from the 1 July to 9 of September 2020 to Northern Cyprus. The rRT-PCR test results collected by the Near East University (NEU) DESAM COVID-19 laboratory were compared with the rRT-PCR test results collected by the Ministry of Health and/or private COVID-19 laboratories in Northern Cyprus. This comparative study was conducted using binomial distribution. In addition, by applying the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model to Northern Cyprus, overall basic reproduction number value of the COVID-19 was analysed for the same time period to act as a threshold for this comparison. In both the statistical and SEIR mathematical model, was calculated. It was assumed that, the more similar the results of NEU DESAM COVID-19 laboratory and other laboratories were with the overall value of Northern Cyprus, the more reliable the results would be. We calculated that the median values of the NEU DESAM COVID-19 laboratory and other laboratories performing the SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR on air passengers during the studied period to be 0.96 and 1.29, respectively, compared to Northern Cyprus median value which was 0.99. The rRT-PCR screening results from the NEU DESAM COVID-19 laboratory were closely aligned with the screening results of Northern Cyprus whereas the screening results reported by other laboratories were not in a fit with the regional pattern. This study also aimed to point out the importance of the rRT-PCR screening procedure since asymptomatic positive SARS-CoV-2 cases entery to Northern Cyprus was inhibited and this prevented the spread of the disease within the population.","Sultanoglu, Nazife Gokbulut Nezihal Sanlidag Tamer Hincal Evren Bilgen Kaymakamzade Sayan Murat",Computer Modeling in Engineering &amp; Sciences,649,17

It takes pathways embarked upon by students from Asian countries to “prestigious” anglophone universities as its focal point of analysis, considering how the residential, consecratory experience of attending elite institutions has been disrupted when universities go virtual or as students are prevented from travelling to their university’s country destination. Building theoretically on the sociology of conventions and testing, I analyse public institutional responses at the commencement of the outbreak from elite universities in the US and the UK, which have hosted large numbers of students from Asian countries in past decades. This paper focuses on how these universities responded to international students under conditions of uncertainty, examining how they justify their role, purpose and operations, while canvassing for continued support from this student segment. The findings highlight contesting orders of worth between states and institutions, as clashes between market, civic and domestic regimes exert significant pressures on organisational efforts to coordinate and cope during this critical moment, thereby raising questions about how prevailing logics of elite transnational education have been altered in the face of a pandemic.

There is little academic evidence to support anecdotal reports that women are at a greater disadvantage than men from ill-fitting PPE. This is especially relevant in healthcare settings where women make up at least 75% of frontline workers. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated problems associated with the fit of PPE that until now have been mainly anecdotal. This research presents results and analysis of a quantitative and qualitative survey concerning the fit of PPE worn by 248 healthcare workers, in a variety of healthcare roles and settings, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis of the survey results showed that women were less likely than men to feel safe carrying out their roles, with only 30.5% of women and 53.3% of men stating that they felt safe all of the time. A statistically significant link is made between women suffering more with poor fit than men with certain categories of PPE (gowns, masks, visors, goggles). Over four times as many women (54.8%) as men (13.3%) reported their surgical gowns being large to some degree and women were nearly twice as likely (53.5%) to experience oversized surgical masks than men (28.6%). However, it was recognized that PPE fit problems are not exclusive to women as many men also do not conform to the underlying shape and size of PPE designs. Survey results indicated that both sexes felt equally hampered due to the fit of their PPE and around a third of both women and men had modified their PPE to address fit issues. Oversized and modified PPE presents its own set of unintended consequences. Following strict processes for doffing and removing PPE is key to virus control but doffing modified PPE can fall outside of these processes, risking cross infection. In addition, wearers of critical items of PPE (such as respirators) currently undergo a “fit test”; however, fit does not reconcile with comfort and over-tightened PPE can cause headaches, discomfort and distraction when worn for long periods. Requirements and fit tests are also not setting-specific; qualitative responses from the survey give indication that this must be a future consideration.","Janson, D. J.; Clift, B.

However, key aspects of spatial and temporal dynamics of eDNA remain unknown. Particularly, it is unclear how long eDNA signals persist locally in dynamic marine environments, since degradation rates have predominantly been quantified through mesocosm studies. To determine in situ eDNA residence times, we introduced an eDNA signal from a non-native fish into a Southern California rocky reef ecosystem, and then measured changes in both introduced and background eDNA signals over 96 hours. Foreign eDNA signal could no longer be detected 7.5 hours after introduction, far exceeding disappearance rates quantified in laboratory studies. In addition, native vertebrate eDNA signals varied greatly over the 96 hours of observation, but time of day and tidal direction did not drive this variation in community structure. Species accumulation curves showed that standard sampling protocols using 3 replicate 1 L sea water samples were insufficient to capture full diversity of local marine vertebrates, capturing only 76% of all taxa. Despite this limitation, a single eDNA sample captured greater vertbrate diversity than 18 SCUBA based underwater visual transect surveys conducted at a nearby site. There was no significant difference in species richness between temporal replicates and spatial replicates, suggesting a space for time substitution may be effective for fully capturing the diversity of local marine vertebrate communities in nearshore rocky reef environments. This result is particularly important in designing eDNA metabarcoding sampling protocols to capture local marine species diversity.","Ely, Taylor; Barber, Paul H.; Gold, Zachary",bioRxiv,649,17

This membrane-bound enzyme is a useful model protein for studying posttranslational localization to its final destination. When expressed from cDNA in COS-1 cells, wild-type msALDH is localized exclusively in the well-developed ER. The removal of the hydrophobic domain results in the cytosolic localization of truncated proteins, thus suggesting that the portion is responsible for membrane anchoring. The last 35 amino acids of msALDH, including the hydrophobic domain, are sufficient for targeting of E. coli beta-galactosidase to the ER membrane.

To achieve a better distribution of lidocaine in the tracheobronchial tree, spray catheters have been developed, allowing nebulization of the local anesthetic solution. However, there are little data on the efficacy and safety of this approach, or on the consumption of sedative drugs and lidocaine during nebulized administration. OBJECTIVES To investigate the tolerability of nebulized lidocaine compared to conventional lidocaine administration via syringe through the working channel of the bronchoscope in patients undergoing bronchoscopy. Consumption of sedative drugs and lidocaine was also compared between the two lidocaine administration approaches. METHODS Patients requiring bronchoscopy with endobronchial or transbronchial biopsy were randomly assigned to receive topical lidocaine either via syringe or via nebulizer. Endpoints were consumption of lidocaine and sedative drugs, as well as patient tolerance and safety. RESULTS Thirty patients were included, 15 in each group. Patients in the nebulizer group required lower doses of endobronchial lidocaine (184.7 ± 67.98 vs. 250.7 ± 21.65 mg, p = 0.0045) and intravenous fentanyl (0.033 ± 0.041 vs. 0.067 ± 0.045 mg, p = 0.0236) than those in the syringe group; midazolam or propofol dosages did not differ between the two groups. In addition, there were no between-group differences in patient tolerance or safety (all p > 0.05).

By using this system, the duration of a primary transcription initiation activity which transcribes subgenomic-size RNAs from the genomic-size RNA template in MHV-infected cells was examined. Efficient DI genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis was observed when the DI RNA was transfected at 1, 3, 3.5, 5, and 6 h postinfection, indicating that all activities which are necessary for MHV RNA synthesis are present continuously during the first 6 h of infection. The effect of subgenomic DI RNA synthesis on DI genomic RNA replication was then examined. Replication efficiency of the DI genomic RNA which synthesized the subgenomic RNA was approximately 70% lower than that of DI genomic RNA which did not synthesize the subgenomic DI RNA in MHV-infected cells. Cotransfection of two different-size DI RNAs demonstrated that replication of the larger DI RNA was strongly inhibited by replication of the smaller genomic DI RNA. Cotransfection of two DI RNA species of the same length into MHV-infected cells demonstrated that reduced replication of the genomic DI RNA which synthesizes the subgenomic RNA did not affect the replication of cotransfected DI RNA, demonstrating that the reduction in DI genomic RNA replication works only in cis, not in trans. Therefore, the previously proposed hypothesis that coronavirus, subgenomic RNA synthesis may inhibit the replication of genomic RNA by competing for a limited amount of virus-derived factors seems unlikely. Possible mechanisms of coronavirus transcription are discussed.","Jeong, Y S; Makino, S",Journal of virology,649,33

One area of strong controversy is the role of interferon (IFN) responses in the natural history of SARS. The fact that the majority of SARS patients recover after relatively moderate illness suggests that the prevailing notion of deficient type I IFN-mediated immunity, with hypercytokinemia driving a poor clinical course, is oversimplified. We used proteomic and genomic technology to systematically analyze host innate and adaptive immune responses of 40 clinically well-described patients with SARS during discrete phases of illness from the onset of symptoms to discharge or a fatal outcome. A novel signature of high IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and IFN-stimulated chemokine levels, plus robust antiviral IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression, accompanied early SARS sequelae. As acute illness progressed, SARS patients entered a crisis phase linked to oxygen saturation profiles. The majority of SARS patients resolved IFN responses at crisis and expressed adaptive immune genes. In contrast, patients with poor outcomes showed deviated ISG and immunoglobulin gene expression levels, persistent chemokine levels, and deficient anti-SARS spike antibody production. We contend that unregulated IFN responses during acute-phase SARS may culminate in a malfunction of the switch from innate immunity to adaptive immunity. The potential for the use of the gene signatures we describe in this study to better assess the immunopathology and clinical management of severe viral infections, such as SARS and avian influenza (H5N1), is therefore worth careful examination.","Cameron, Mark J; Ran, Longsi; Xu, Luoling; Danesh, Ali; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F; Cameron, Cheryl M; Muller, Matthew P; Gold, Wayne L; Richardson, Susan E; Poutanen, Susan M; Willey, Barbara M; DeVries, Mark E; Fang, Yuan; Seneviratne, Charit; Bosinger, Steven E; Persad, Desmond; Wilkinson, Peter; Greller, Larry D; Somogyi, Roland; Humar, Atul; Keshavjee, Shaf; Louie, Marie; Loeb, Mark B; Brunton, James; McGeer, Allison J; Kelvin, David J",Journal of virology,649,1

This led O'Brien (1985) to propose that the cheetah suffered from an immunodeficiency and was highly susceptible to diseases. It was therefore decided to investigate cell-mediated and humoral immune responses and to apply the limited restriction fragment length analysis (using Pst 1 and Bam H1 enzymes) of the cheetah MHC I and MHC II genes. Antibody responses to antigens (feline viruses), as well as mitogen-induced lymphocyte blast transformation responses, were shown to be intact and comparable with that of the domestic cat, indicating a competent immune system in the cheetah.

To improve the current knowledge of the regulatory role of a major mammalian cysteine protease inhibitor, cystatin C, in such disease processes, a cystatin C deficient mouse was generated and characterized. METHODS The mouse cystatin C gene was inactivated by insertion of a bacterial neo gene through homologous recombination in 129/Sv embryonic stem cells. Embryonic stem cell clones were injected into C57BL/6J blastocysts followed by injection of the blastocysts into pseudopregnant female mice. F1 offspring with agouti coat colour after mating of chimaeric males with C57BL/6J females were examined by DNA analysis, and mice carrying the targeted mutation were intercrossed to obtain homozygous cystatin C deficient (CysC-/-) mice. To study the role of cysteine proteases and their inhibitors in metastasis, the spread of B16-F10 melanoma cells in CysC-/- and wild-type mice was compared. Analysis of the formation of remote metastases was carried out by intravenous injection of beta-galactosidase transfected B16-F10 cells and subsequent determination of cancer cell colonies in the lungs. RESULTS Cystatin C deficient mice were fertile and showed no gross pathological abnormality up to 6 months of age. Compared with wild-type mice, seven times fewer large metastatic colonies were counted by means of a dissecting microscope in CysC-/- mice two weeks after tail vein injection of B16-F10 cells. At all of eight time points from 15 minutes to two weeks after intravenous injection of tumour cells, the CysC-/- mice had significantly fewer lung metastases. The observed differences were smaller when beta-galactosidase transfected cells were used to allow counting of small colonies. Subcutaneous and intracerebral tumour growth was not different in the CysC-/- mice. CONCLUSIONS Cystatin C concentrations in vivo might influence metastasis in some tissues. The decreased metastatic spread of B16-F10 cells in CysC-/- mice is the result of both reduced seeding and reduced growth of tumour cells in their lungs.","Huh, C G; Håkansson, K; Nathanson, C M; Thorgeirsson, U P; Jonsson, N; Grubb, A; Abrahamson, M; Karlsson, S",Molecular pathology : MP,649,33

Commonly used methods for TGEV detection include viral isolation and detection of the viral antigen by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA), immunoperoxidase, and immunogold silver staining. Each of these techniques has some advantages and disadvantages. In general IFA and immunohistochemistry are preferred over viral isolation as TGEV isolation is not very reliable because not all field isolates replicate in cell cultures. The diagnosis of TGEV has become more complicated since the emergence of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV). PRCV is believed to be a TGEV mutant, and can not be easily differentiated from TGEV by immunological tests. Nucleic acid probes and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have successfully been used to detect and differentiate these viruses. These techniques can detect viral nucleic acids in the specimen but do not provide information on the cell types infected by these viruses. Recently we have developed isotopic and nonisotopic in situ hybridization techniques (ISH) for the detection of these viral nucleic acids in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Furthermore, this procedure can differentiate between TGEV- and PRCV-infected cells. By ISH, TGEV is detected in the mature absorptive enterocytes of tissues infected by TGEV and the crypt epithelial cells are also infected but to a lesser extent. For PRCV, the main infected cells are epithelial cells of the bronchioles, type II pneumocytes, and alveolar and septal macrophages. ISH is an excellent tool for studying molecular pathogenesis of these two viruses especially when used in combination with immunohistochemistry.","Sirinarumitr, T; Paul, P S; Halbur, P G; Kluge, J P",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,649,1

In the first step, all samples were submitted to RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and nested PCR. Next, only the positive nested-PCR samples were propagated in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs for virus isolation. Positive samples were then sequenced and analyzed using a molecular phylogeny approach. Tracheal swab samples were collected from 23 different domestic chickens distributed in three regions of Brazil, in the period between 2003 and 2009. Also analyzed were six swab samples (tracheal and cloacal) from asymptomatic pigeons (Columba livia), caught in an urbanized region in southeastern Brazil. The study revealed two major phylogenetic groups: one clustered with the Massachusetts vaccine serotype and another joined with the D207 strain. Interestingly, samples grouped with the Connecticut and Arkansas serotypes were also found. Pigeon isolates clustered with the Massachusetts serotype showed significant similarity (close to 100%) to those obtained from chickens. Only one pigeon isolate was seen to be grouped with the Connecticut serotype, and no correlation was observed between sample grouping and region origin. Understanding the diversity of genotypes and eco-epizootiology of the disease in different environments is expected to be helpful for vaccine production aimed at the main circulating variants. In this respect, one could also expect benefits in the management of other bird species that may act as avian coronavirus reservoirs.","Felippe, P A N; da Silva, L H A; Santos, M M A B; Spilki, F R; Arns, C W",Avian diseases,649,9

METHODS Between April 22 and May 1, 2003, 120 clinically compatible SARS patients were admitted to a special hospital for infectious diseases in Beijing. All patients' records were reviewed. The outcome variables of NPPV therapy were analyzed. RESULTS At 6 weeks of SARS onset, 25% (30/120) patients had respiratory failure with ALI/ARDS. 16 (53%) had hypercapnia (PaCO(2) > 45 mm Hg) during the course of SARS. 28 of them received NPPV therapy. One was intolerable to NPPV treatment. In the remaining 27 patients, NPPV was initiated 1.2 +/- 1.6 (0 - 10) days after onset of respiratory failure. One hour of NPPV therapy led to significant increases in PaO(2), SpO(2) and PaO(2)/FiO(2), and decrease in respiratory rate (all P < 0.01). 18 of the 27 patients were weaned successfully from NPPV. The mean duration of NPPV use was 10 +/- 6 (5 - 30) days. In addition to one patient who was intolerable to NPPV treatment, intubation was required in other 9 patients who initially had a favorable response to NPPV. Remarkable pulmonary barotrauma was noted in 7 of the 120 (5.8%) patients with SARS, among which 1 developed 2 days after intubation, and 6 occurred while the patients were on NPPV, the incidence being 22% (6/27) in patients using NPPV. The fatality rate at 13 weeks of SARS onset was 6.7% (8/120) in the patient cohort, and 26.7% (8/30) in the ALI/ARDS patients. No SARS occurred in medical staff taking care of NPPV patients. CONCLUSIONS Some of the SARS patients with ALI/ARDS could experience CO(2) retention, which might be related to the impairment of respiratory muscles. It is proved to be feasible and appropriate for NPPV treatment of respiratory failure in SARS patients who were at high risk of intubation related complications. As there was a high incidence of remarkable barotrauma, a careful lung protective strategy is necessary during the administration of NPPV as well as invasive mechanical ventilation.","Han, Fang; Jiang, Yu-Yong; Zheng, Jian-Hong; Hu, Zheng; Gao, Zhan-Cheng; He, Quan-Ying; Chen, Er-Zhang",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,649,5

In the present study, we report the in vitro antiviral activities of 29 essential oils, extracted from Chinese indigenous aromatic plants, against the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV). Of these essential oils, those oils from ginger, lemon, tea tree, tangerine peel, artemisia, and lemongrass effected a more than 50% inhibition of TMV at 100 μg/ml. In addition, the mode of antiviral action of the active essential oils was also determined. Essential oils isolated from artemisia and lemongrass possessed potent inactivation and curative effects in vivo and had a directly passivating effect on TMV infection in a dose-dependent manner. However, all other active essential oils exhibited a moderate protective effect in vivo. The chemical constitutions of the essential oils from ginger, lemon, tea tree, tangerine peel, artemisia, and lemongrass were identified by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The major components of these essential oils were α-zingiberene (35.21%), limonene (76.25%), terpinen-4-ol (41.20%), limonene (80.95%), 1,8-cineole (27.45%), and terpinolene (10.67%). The curative effects of 10 individual compounds from the active essential oils on TMV infection were also examined in vivo. The compounds from citronellal, limonene, 1,8-cineole, and α-zingiberene effected a more than 40% inhibition rate for TMV infection, and the other compounds demonstrated moderate activities at 320 μg/ml in vivo. There results indicate that the essential oils isolated from artemisia and lemongrass, and the individual compound citronellal, have the potential to be used as an effective alternative for the treatment of tobacco plants infected with TMV under greenhouse conditions.","Lu, Min; Han, Zhiqiang; Xu, Yun; Yao, Lei",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,649,12

In this study, we characterized White bream virus (WBV), a bacilliform plus-strand RNA virus isolated from fish. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence, organization, and expression of the 26.6-kb genome provided conclusive evidence for a phylogenetic relationship between WBV and nidoviruses. The polycistronic genome of WBV contains five open reading frames (ORFs), called ORF1a, -1b, -2, -3, and -4. In WBV-infected cells, three subgenomic RNAs expressing the structural proteins S, M, and N were identified. The subgenomic RNAs were revealed to share a 42-nucleotide, 5' leader sequence that is identical to the 5'-terminal genome sequence. The data suggest that a conserved nonanucleotide sequence, CA(G/A)CACUAC, located downstream of the leader and upstream of the structural protein genes acts as the core transcription-regulating sequence element in WBV. Like other nidoviruses with large genomes (>26 kb), WBV encodes in its ORF1b an extensive set of enzymes, including putative polymerase, helicase, ribose methyltransferase, exoribonuclease, and endoribonuclease activities. ORF1a encodes several membrane domains, a putative ADP-ribose 1""-phosphatase, and a chymotrypsin-like serine protease whose activity was established in this study. Comparative sequence analysis revealed that WBV represents a separate cluster of nidoviruses that significantly diverged from toroviruses and, even more, from coronaviruses, roniviruses, and arteriviruses. The study adds to the amazing diversity of nidoviruses and appeals for a more extensive characterization of nonmammalian nidoviruses to better understand the evolution of these largest known RNA viruses.","Schütze, Heike; Ulferts, Rachel; Schelle, Barbara; Bayer, Sonja; Granzow, Harald; Hoffmann, Bernd; Mettenleiter, Thomas C; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,649,20

Previous studies have shown that the TGEV external protein M plays a major role in IFN-alpha induction by a non-infectious virus, whereas protein S is not involved. The present study extended these results by showing that monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed at the external viral protein sM could not block IFN-alpha induction, which argues against a direct role for this protein. In the same type of blocking experiment, MAbs to the TGEV receptor aminopeptidase N did not inhibit IFN-alpha induction, which strongly indicates that viral replication or entry through the receptor is not needed for TGEV induction of IFN-alpha in leukocytes. In an attempt to isolate functional envelope proteins, TGEV virions were detergent-solubilized and reconstituted in virosomes. Although BIAcore antigenic analysis revealed that the three external viral proteins were present on the virosomes, these proteins were unable to induce IFN-alpha in porcine leukocytes, and seemed to compete with the native virus for IFN-alpha induction. These data indicated that IFN-alpha inducing interactions between TGEV external proteins and leukocytes required a complex native envelope protein structure which has been lost in the virosomes.","Riffault, S; Grosclaude, J; Vayssier, M; Laude, H; Charley, B",Veterinary research,649,28

Worldwide, approximately 2.5 billion people live in dengue-infested regions with about 100 million new cases each year, although many of these infections are believed to be silent. There are four antigenically distinct serotypes of dengue virus; thus, immunity from one serotype will not cross-protect from infection with the other three. The difficulties that hamper vaccine development include requirements of the natural conformation of the envelope glycoprotein to induce neutralizing immune responses and the necessity of presenting antigens of all four serotypes. Currently, the only way to meet these requirements is to use a mixture of four serotypes of live attenuated dengue viruses, but safety remains a major problem. In this study, we have developed the basis for a tetravalent dengue vaccine using a novel complex adenovirus platform that is capable of expressing multiple antigens de novo. This dengue vaccine is constructed as a pair of vectors that each expresses the premembrane and envelope genes of two different dengue virus serotypes. Upon vaccination, the vaccine expressed high levels of the dengue virus antigens in cells to mimic a natural infection and induced both humoral and cellular immune responses against multiple serotypes of dengue virus in an animal model. Further analyses show the humoral responses were indeed neutralizing against all four serotypes. Our studies demonstrate the concept of mimicking infections to induce immune responses by synthesizing dengue virus membrane antigens de novo and the feasibility of developing an effective tetravalent dengue vaccine by vector-mediated expression of glycoproteins of the four serotypes.","Holman, David H; Wang, Danher; Raviprakash, Kanakatte; Raja, Nicholas U; Luo, Min; Zhang, Jianghui; Porter, Kevin R; Dong, John Y",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,649,24

We investigated the patterns of demyelination and oligodendrocyte pathology in this model. In early stages of the disease infection of oligodendrocytes was associated with a downregulation of expression of mRNA for proteolipid protein in the absence of myelin destruction. When demyelinating lesions were formed infected oligodendrocytes were destroyed by necrosis, whereas oligodendrocytes that did not contain detectable virus antigen or RNA were in part dying by apoptosis. At this stage of the disease remyelination of the lesions was pronounced. At later stages after infection virus antigen was nearly completely cleared from the lesions. In spite of the lack of detectable virus, ongoing demyelination and unspecific tissue destruction occurred, and oligodendrocytes were mainly destroyed by apoptosis.

COVID-19 has drastically changed the medical landscape. Although predominantly impacting the respiratory system, COVID-19 has several non-respiratory symptoms associated with its presentation and course. Among these are gastrointestinal symptoms and thromboembolic events with stroke. Increasingly recognized, but often overlooked, are the coagulopathy phenomena occurring with COVID-19. The severe respiratory symptoms are the primary focus of clinical management. However, close inspection of patients demonstrates that patients often exhibit both thromboembolic and bleeding events, ranging from simple skin lesions to overt emergencies. CASE REPORT The author presents a case of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy resulting in compartment syndrome of the arm with volar forearm necrosis, requiring flap reconstruction and tendon transfer to salvage the upper extremity. CONCLUSIONS Massive rhabdomyolysis resulted in acute tubular necrosis with renal failure requiring hemodialysis. The timing of reconstruction of the sequelae of compartment syndrome in an acutely ill patient is challenging, but optimal timing can result in a successful outcome.","Bibbo, Christopher",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,649,17

Virus bound to isolated membranes from susceptible mice, but not to membranes from resistant mice. F1 progeny of SJL/J X BALB/c mice had an intermediate level of virus-binding activity on their enterocyte and hepatocyte membranes. This correlated well with previous studies showing that susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 is controlled by a single autosomal dominant gene (M. S. Smith, R. E. Click, and P. G. W. Plagemann, J. Immunol. 133:428-432). Because virus binding was not prevented by treating membranes with sodium dodecyl sulfate, the virus-binding molecule could be identified by a virus overlay protein blot assay. Virus bound to a single broad band of Mr 100,000 to 110,000 in membranes from hepatocytes or enterocytes of susceptible BALB/c and semisusceptible C3H mice, but no virus-binding band was detected in comparable preparations of resistant SJL/J mouse membranes. Therefore, SJL/J mice may be resistant to mouse hepatitis virus A59 infection because they lack a specific virus receptor which is present on the plasma membranes of target cells from genetically susceptible BALB/c and semisusceptible C3H mice.","Boyle, J F; Weismiller, D G; Holmes, K V",Journal of virology,649,1

Three isolates of novel, human coronavirus (SARS0CoV-2) (2019) that are responsible for the current pandemic and older SARS strains of human and animal coronaviruses were examined. The nucleocapsid and glycoprotein sequences are identical for the three novel 2019 human isolates and they are closely related to these sequences in six bat and human SARS coronaviruses. This strongly supports the bat origin of the pandemic, novel coronavirus. One surface glycoprotein fragment of 111 amino acids is the largest, conserved, common permutation in the examined bat SARS-like and human SARS viruses, including the Covid-19 virus. BLAST analysis confirmed that this fragment is conserved only in the human and bat SARS strains. This fragment likely is involved in infectivity and is of interest for vaccine development. Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein sequence homologies of 58.9% and 82.5%, respectively, between the novel SARS0CoV-2 strains and the human SARS (2018) virus suggest that existing anti-SARS vaccines may provide some protection against the novel coronavirus.","Basu, Babu V; Brown, Olen R",Frontiers in bioscience,649,1

This study also examined whether nurses experienced stress from being conscripted to work in higher-risk units. METHODS This study was conducted in Taiwan during the peak of the SARS outbreak in 2003. Participants were recruited from nursing staff in a community hospital. Participants were divided into three groups: those who originally worked in units with a high risk of SARS exposure (N=65), those who had been involuntarily conscripted into such units because of manpower demands (N=21), and those who worked in units with a low risk of SARS exposure (N=45). Participants were evaluated with two questionnaires: the Impact of Event Scale and the 90-item Symptom Checklist-Revised. RESULTS The results showed that 11 percent of the nurses surveyed had stress reaction syndrome. The symptoms of psychological stress reactions included anxiety, depression, hostility, and somatization. The highest rate of stress reaction syndrome was observed in the group that originally worked in a high-risk unit, and the conscripted group experienced the most severe distress on average. CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest that the psychological distress of nurses who worked during the SARS outbreak was moderate. The distress was more prominent among the two groups of nurses who were working with patients with SARS.","Chen, Cheng-Sheng; Wu, Hsiu-Yueh; Yang, Pinchen; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Psychiatric services,649,14

The role of RSV in stable COPD and the viral load in different respiratory diseases has not been investigated to date. The present authors established and evaluated a quantitative TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay specific for RSV subgroup A. Absolute quantification for the determination of viral load input was achieved using a control plasmid. The assay allowed for a quantification over a >6-log range and a detection limit of <10 RSV copies per reaction mixture. The assay was 30 times more sensitive than conventional nested polymerase chain reaction assays. Interassay SD was 1.3 and coefficient of variation 4.7% on average. Clinical specimens from infants with ARI (n=62) and elderly adults with COPD (n=125) were compared for viral loads. A total of 47% RSV-positive samples were found in the ARI study group and 28% in the COPD study group. The viral load of both study groups was found to differ significantly. In the ARI study group the viral load was increased almost 2000-fold, suggesting acute infection in this group and former or latent infection in the COPD group. Respiratory syncytial virus-A specific TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assay is a sensitive and rapid method for the determination of viral load in clinical samples. It enables differential statements concerning the involvement of respiratory syncytial virus in acute lower respiratory tract infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to be achieved.","Borg, I; Rohde, G; Löseke, S; Bittscheidt, J; Schultze-Werninghaus, G; Stephan, V; Bufe, A",The European respiratory journal,649,17

Visibility and flexibility, as well as occlusions of side branches and neointimal proliferation were also evaluated. METHODS Aneurysms were induced in 18 New Zealand white rabbits and treated with a braided, ""closed-loop-designed"" device of nitinol. Additional devices were implanted in the abdominal aorta to cover the origin of branch arteries. Angiographic follow-ups were performed immediately after placement of the device, after 3 months (n = 9) and 6 months (n = 9). The status of aneurysm occlusion (using a five-point scale) and the patency of branch arteries were assessed. RESULTS Aneurysm occlusion rates were noted as grade 0 in 2 (11 %), grade I in 1 (6 %), grade II in 1 (6 %), grade III in 9 (50 %), and grade IV in 5 (28 %) of 18 aneurysms, respectively, indicating a complete or near-complete occlusion of 78 % under double antiplatelet therapy. Aneurysm occlusion was significantly higher at 6 months follow-up (P = 0.025). Radiopaque markers provided excellent visibility. Limited device flexibility led to incomplete aneurysm neck coverage and grade 0 occlusion rates in two cases. Distal device occlusions were found in three cases, most likely due to an extremely undersized vessel diameter in the subclavian artery. No case of branch artery occlusion was seen. Intimal proliferation and diameter stenosis were moderate. CONCLUSION The tested flow diverter achieved near-complete and complete aneurysm occlusion under double antiplatelet therapy of elastase-induced aneurysms in 78 %, while preserving branch arteries.","Simgen, Andreas; Ley, Desiree; Roth, Christian; Yilmaz, Umut; Körner, Heiko; Mühl-Benninghaus, Ruben; Kim, Yoo-Jin; Scheller, Bruno; Reith, Wolfgang",Neuroradiology,649,16

IL-1 coordinates systemic host defense responses to pathogens and to injury and not surprisingly it has similar effects within the central nervous system (CNS). Numerous reports have correlated the presence of IL-1 in the injured or diseased brain, and its effects on neurons and nonneuronal cells in the CNS, but it is only recently that the importance of IL-1 signaling has been recognized. This article reviews studies that demonstrate that IL-1 is at or near the top of the hierarchical cytokine signaling cascade in the CNS that results in the activation of endogenous microglia and vascular endothelial cells to recruit peripheral leukocytes (i.e., neuroinflammation). The IL-1 system thus provides an attractive target for therapeutic intervention to ameliorate the destructive consequences of neuroinflammation.","Basu, Anirban; Krady, J Kyle; Levison, Steven W",Journal of neuroscience research,649,1

From this in vitro virus-host system, persistence is mediated at the level of cellular MHV receptor (MHVR) expression and increased virus virulence. MHV persistence selects for resistant host cell populations which abate virus replication. Reductions in MHVR expression were significantly associated with increased host resistance, and transfection of MHVR into resistant host cells completely restored the capacity of cells to support efficient replication of MHV strain A59. The emergence of resistant host cells coselected for variant viruses that had increased avidity for MHVR and also recognized different receptors for entry into resistant cells. These data illustrate that MHV persistence in vitro provides a model to identify critical sites of virus-host interaction at the cellular level which are altered during the evolution of host cell resistance to viral infection and the coevolution of virus virulence.","Chen, W; Baric, R S",Journal of virology,649,1

Quantitative RT-PCR showed that JHMV RNA decreased from approximately 2 ng/ug total brain RNA at day 6 post-inoculation (PI) to 0.1 pg/ug total brain RNA at 360 days PI. Double-stranded viral RNA could be detected up to day 20 PI.

Here we introduce a probabilistic model that describes the worldwide spread of infectious diseases and demonstrate that a forecast of the geographical spread of epidemics is indeed possible. This model combines a stochastic local infection dynamics among individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network, taking into account national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance. The performance of different control strategies is analyzed, and our simulations show that a quick and focused reaction is essential to inhibiting the global spread of epidemics.","Hufnagel, L; Brockmann, D; Geisel, T",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,649,28

We are interested in understanding the mechanisms controlling the impact of coronavirus infection on host cells. To this end, we compared a productive, noncytopathic infection of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 in the fibroblastlike cell line NIH 3T3 with cytopathic MHV infections. Infected NIH 3T3 cells could be cultured for up to 4 weeks without apparent CPE and yet produce virus at 10(7) to 10(8) PFU/ml. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that NIH 3T3 cells expressed as much MHV receptor CEACAM1 as other cell lines which die from MHV infection. In contrast, using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and metabolic labeling of RNA, we found that the rate of viral RNA amplification in NIH 3T3 cells was lower than the rate in cells in which MHV induces a CPE. The rate of cellular RNA synthesis in contact-inhibited confluent NIH 3T3 cells was also lower than in cells permissive to cytopathic MHV infection. However, the induction of cellular RNA synthesis in growing NIH 3T3 cells did not result in an increase of either viral RNA amplification or CPE. Our results suggest that a specific, receptor CEACAM1-independent mechanism restricting coronaviral RNA synthesis and CPE is present in NIH 3T3 and, possibly, other cells with preserved contact inhibition.","Slobodskaya, Olga; Laarman, Alexander; Spaan, Willy J M",Journal of virology,649,19

Like the other herpesvirus serine PRs, EBV PR could be a target for the inhibition of EBV replication. To date, no data have been reported on the inhibition of EBV PR messenger RNA (mRNA) by small interfering RNA (siRNA). METHODS In this study, siRNAs targeting EBV PR were delivered to the epithelial 293 cell line stably transfected with the complete B95-8 EBV episome. EBV DNA and PR mRNA were quantified by real-time PCR in cells and supernatant, protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting, and production of EBV infectious particles in the culture medium was measured by Raji cell superinfection. RESULTS The EBV PR mRNA within the cells was reduced by 73%, the PR protein by 35% and the amount of virus in the cell supernatant was drastically decreased by 86% or 95%, depending on the method. CONCLUSIONS The strong effect of the siRNA targeting EBV PR on EBV replication attests to the crucial role played by EBV PR in the production of infectious particles and suggests that targeting this enzyme can be a new strategy against EBV-associated diseases where virus replication occurs.","Larrat, Sylvie; Morand, Patrice; Bas, Ariane; Vigne, Solenne; Crance, Jean-Marc; Boyer, Véronique; Nicod, Sandrine; Grossi, Laurence; Buisson, Marlyse; Burmeister, Wim P; Seigneurin, Jean-Marie; Germi, Raphaële",Antiviral therapy,649,1

This study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and burnout and related risk factors in the healthcare workers and assistant personnel at a tertiary referral university hospital. METHOD Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a sociodemographic questionnaire were delivered on-line to all employees of our hospital. 683 individuals were to the study who completed and returned the forms between April 15-30, 2020. RESULTS Stress, depression and anxiety levels were significantly higher in nurses. Emotional burnout and depersonalization symptoms were higher and personal accomplishment scores were lower in resident physicians and nurses in comparison to the other groups. Being single, having a child and living away from home were factors underlying the burnout severity. Frontline work in the Covid-19 clinics did not affect the levels of anxiety, stress and depression. On the basis of the cut off points of the HADS scores; anxiety disorder (OR: 7.19) and depression (OR 3.43) were the most relevant risk factors for emotional exhaustion. Anxiety disorder was also the main risk factor for depersonalization. Depersonalization was 2.7-fold more among the nurses complaining of being overworked. Social support from the work environment and the family was protective against depersonalization. CONCLUSION Covid-19 pandemic has adversely affected the wellbeing of healthcare workers. The presence of depression and anxiety increased the risk of burnout. Social support can be expected to protect against burnout. It is, therefore, of great importance to implement urgently effective psychosocial and organizational interventions in order to protect the mental health of healthcare workers and to prevent burnout.","Önen Sertöz, Özen; Kuman Tunçel, Özlem; Sertöz, Nezih; Hepdurgun, Cenan; İşman Haznedaroğlu, Damla; Bor, Canan",Turk psikiyatri dergisi = Turkish journal of psychiatry,649,17

Cambodia has faced multiple disasters, from the Khmer Rouge killing fields to COVID-19. Drawing upon a case study of the 2010 Diamond Island stampede, which killed 347 people, this article focuses on the period leading up to the funeral ceremony, while a companion article discusses events that unfold in the months that follow. An ethnographic study was carried out in Phnom Penh and nine provinces with members of the families of those who were killed, villagers, and monks and Buddhist lay officiants. Buddhist ceremonies conducted at the cremation and at seven- and hundred-days, helped families accept the irreversibility of loss and allow the dead to be reborn. Complications comprised the misidentification of bodies, managing the dangerous ghosts of ‘bad death’, getting the souls safely from the mortuary to the cremation site and dealing with disruptions along the way, convincing the souls that they are really dead, and ambiguous losses in the case of ‘counterfeit funerals’ conducted without the corpse. The mourning hinges on the maintenance of continuing bonds as evidenced by the ‘dream work’ by the bereft families, enabled by the ‘emergency Buddhist disaster relief’ provided by the monks. It is proposed that understanding the cultural deathscapes can provide insights into developing culturally-responsive interventions after a disaster. © 2021 The Author(s)","Eisenbruch, M.",International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,649,33

Design/methodology/approach: The researcher adopted the descriptive approach, which is the appropriate scientific method for this type of research studies, grounded on an examination of the reality or phenomenon, depending on its quantitative analysis and its accurate description by means of collecting data, using the measurement tool of questionnaire to identify the role of social media in relation to citizenship during the COVID-19 global health crisis. Findings: Jordanian exchange students heavily rely on social media during the pandemic, choosing Facebook as their most favorable choice during the pandemic to connect with family and friends near and far, while choosing WhatsApp as the most favorable choice for promoting citizenship values during the pandemic, with an average willingness to actually discuss citizenship through social media. The findings affirm results and conclusions of previous studies about the crucial role of social media in international students’ cross-cultural experiences, especially during stressful events like the COVID-19 global health crisis.

Around 20% of the familial ALS cases arise from dominant mutations in the sod1 gene encoding superoxide dismutase1 (SOD1) enzyme. Aggregation of mutant SOD1 in familial cases and of wild-type SOD1 in at least some sporadic ALS cases is one of the known causes of the disease. Riluzole, approved in 1995 and edaravone in 2017 remain the only drugs with limited therapeutic benefits. METHODS: We have utilised the ebselen template to develop novel compounds that redeem stability of mutant SOD1 dimer and prevent aggregation. Binding modes of compounds have been visualised by crystallography. In vitro neuroprotection and toxicity of lead compounds have been performed in mouse neuronal cells and disease onset delay of ebselen has been demonstrated in transgenic ALS mice model. FINDING: We have developed a number of ebselen-based compounds with improvements in A4V SOD1 stabilisation and in vitro therapeutic effects with significantly better potency than edaravone. Structure-activity relationship of hits has been guided by high resolution structures of ligand-bound A4V SOD1. We also show clear disease onset delay of ebselen in transgenic ALS mice model holding encouraging promise for potential therapeutic compounds. INTERPRETATION: Our finding established the new generation of organo-selenium compounds with better in vitro neuroprotective activity than edaravone. The potential of this class of compounds may offer an alternative therapeutic agent for ALS treatment. The ability of these compounds to target cysteine 111 in SOD may have wider therapeutic applications targeting cysteines of enzymes involved in pathogenic and viral diseases including main protease of SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19).

Methods: Sixty rats, 30 SHR and 30 EPM-1 Wistar, 4-month-old, weighing around 350 g were utilized. Animals were distributed into two groups: experimental and control, according to the lineage, SHR and EPM-1 Wistar rats, respectively. Each group was divided into two subgroups, with 15 animals each, with pneumoperitoneum pressure established at 4 mmHg and 10 mmHg. The animals were anesthetized and positioned to start the left femoral artery catheterization procedure to measure median arterial pressure and to collect blood sample during the experiment. After antisepsis, a 5 mm length transversal incision in the central abdominal area was performed to introduce a Veress needle for CO2 insufflation until the pressure established for each group was obtained (4 mmHg or 10 mmHg). Pressure was maintained during one hour, followed by one hour of disinsufflation. At the end of this phase, all animals, still under anesthesia, were submitted to euthanasia by blood removal through the arterial catheter. The blood samples were collected in three phases: 1) post-catheterization; 2) after one hour of pneumoperitoneum, and 3) one hour after disinsufflation. The samples were sent to the laboratory for urea and creatinine measurements. Results: Increased creatinine in SHR rats after 1 h of pneumoperitoneum with 10 mmHg pressure, while Wistar rats remained at the normal basal level. Urea levels increased for both SHR and EPM-1 Wistar rats after 1 h of pneumoperitoneum with 10 mmHg pressure. During the pneumoperitoneum with 4 mmHg pressure, creatinine and urea remained at basal levels. Conclusion: The renal function of SHR rats may be transiently changed, as it happens with non-hypertensive rats submitted to a 10 mmHg pneumoperitoneum.","Bento Moreira, Márcia; Frasson S.

The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal domain to block the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosome to inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the SL1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique strategy of unleashing a virus own virulence mechanism against itself could force a critical trade off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.","Leger, Valerie; Fu, Tian-Min; Lieberman, Judy; Gehrke, Lee; Shi, Ming; Wang, Longfei; Wu, Hao",,649,10

The practice of mass quarantine made the negative consequences of exclusionary othering for public health particularly noticeable.

Patients who require prolonged isolation until recovery, such as those who suffer from COVID-19, present multiple therapeutic dilemmas to their caregivers. Therefore, utilizing remote care in the daily workflow would be a valuable tool for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic ocular conditions in this challenging clinical setting. Our aim is to review the latest technological and methodical advances in teleophthalmology and highlight their implementation in screening and managing various ocular conditions. We present them as well as potential diagnostic and treatment applications in view of the recent SARS-CoV-2 virus outbreak. METHODS: A computerized search from January 2017 up to March 2020 of the online electronic database PubMed was performed, using the following search strings: ""telemedicine,"" ""telehealth,"" and ""ophthalmology."" More generalized complementary contemporary research data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was also obtained from the PubMed database. RESULTS: A total of 312 records, including COVID-19-focused studies, were initially identified. After exclusion of non-relevant, non-English, and duplicate studies, a total of 138 records were found eligible. Ninety records were included in the final qualitative analysis. CONCLUSION: Teleophthalmology is an effective screening and management tool for a range of adult and pediatric acute and chronic ocular conditions. It is mostly utilized in screening of retinal conditions such as retinopathy of prematurity, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration; in diagnosing anterior segment condition; and in managing glaucoma. With improvements in image processing, and better integration of the patient's medical record, teleophthalmology should become a more accepted modality, all the more so in circumstances where social distancing is inflicted upon us.","Sommer, Adir C; Blumenthal, Eytan Z",Graefes Arch Clin Exp Ophthalmol,649,24

METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 416 older FDMNs aged 60 years and above living in camps of Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect information on participants' socio-demographic and lifestyle characteristics, pre-existing non-communicable chronic conditions, and COVID-19 related information. Level of fear was measured using the seven-item Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with the cumulative score ranged from 7 to 35. A multiple linear regression examined the factors associated with fear. RESULTS: Among 416 participants aged 60 years or above, the mean fear score was 14.8 (range 8-28) and 88.9% of the participants had low fear score. Participants who were concerned about COVID-19 (ß: 0.63, 95% CI: -0.26 to 1.53) and overwhelmed by COVID-19 (ß: 3.54, 95% CI: 2.54 to 4.55) were significantly more likely to be fearful of COVID-19. Other factors significantly associated with higher level of fear were lesser frequency of communication during COVID-19, difficulty in obtaining food during COVID-19, perception that older adults are at highest risk of COVID-19 and receiving COVID-19 related information from Radio/television and friends/family/neighbours. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted that currently there little fear of COVID-19 among the older Rohingya FDMNs. This is probably due to lack of awareness of the severity of the disease in.

This study investigated the release of nanovesicles called exosomes from urinary bladder tissue from tumour-proximal sites as well as tumour-distant sites in transurethrally resected (TUR-B) patients with or without preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to ensuing radical cystectomy—all without remaining visible tumour after TUR-B. We show that cancer-promoting exosomes were detected from both sites, suggesting that the previous tumour has altered the whole bladder tissue into a cancer-supporting milieu. The exosomes may originate from remaining pathologically undetectable cancer cells or transformed epithelial cells, and the study supports the notion of exosomes as mediators of metastatic spread and as potential biomarkers. It also supports early and radical removal of the bladder in urinary bladder cancer patients. ABSTRACT: Invasive urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) has high recurrence rates even after radical cystectomy (RC). Exosomes are membrane-bound nanovesicles, which have been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis and metastasis. We previously showed that urinary exosomes display a malignant profile in UBC patients despite the absence of detectable tumour. Here, we investigated exosomes from sampling sites close to or distant from the former tumour, aiming to understand the effect of the tumour on the local milieu. Ten patients scheduled for cystectomy after transurethral bladder resection (TUR-B), without remaining detectable tumour, were included. Exosomes were isolated from tissue explants of both the previous tumour site and distant bladder tissue. Proteins were quantified by mass spectrometry in seven patients. Exosomes from the previous tumour site were enriched in inflammatory but not cancer-related pathways compared to distant tissue. However, the 69 most abundant proteins in tissue-derived exosomes regardless of site, 20 of which were also found in urinary exosomes from our previous study, were enriched for cancer-related metabolic pathways and associated with poor prognosis in an external mRNA dataset. The enrichment of cancer-related pathways in the most abundant proteins, regardless of sampling site, confirms our hypothesis that despite the absence of detectable tumour, the entire bladder releases exosomes that contribute to metastasis and highlights the need for early RC.","Eldh, Maria; Mints, Michael; Hiltbrunner, Stefanie; Ladjevardi, Sam; Alamdari, Farhood; Johansson, Markus; Jakubczyk, Tomasz; Veerman, Rosanne E.; Winqvist, Ola; Sherif, Amir; Gabrielsson, Susanne",Cancers (Basel),649,16

Previous work to assess immune function has relied upon relatively crude measures of immunocompetence. However, with next-generation RNA-sequencing, it is now possible to create a profile of gene expression in response to an immune challenge. In this study, captive zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata; adult males) were challenged with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle to stimulate the innate immune system. 2 hours after injection, birds were euthanized and hypothalami, spleen, and red blood cells (RBCs) were collected. Taking advantage of the fully sequenced genome of zebra finch, total RNA was isolated, sequenced, and partially annotated in these tissue/cells. RESULTS: In hypothalamus, there were 707 significantly upregulated transcripts, as well as 564 and 144 in the spleen and RBCs, respectively, relative to controls. Also, 155 transcripts in the hypothalamus, 606 in the spleen, and 61 in the RBCs were significantly downregulated. More specifically, a number of immunity-related transcripts (e.g., IL-1β, RSAD2, SOCS3) were upregulated among tissues/cells. Additionally, transcripts involved in metabolic processes (APOD, LRAT, RBP4) were downregulated. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential trade-off in expression of genes that regulate immunity and metabolism in birds challenged with LPS. This finding is consistent with a hypothermic response to LPS treatment in small birds.

These COVID-19 cardiac complications were associated with respiratory symptoms. However, our case illustrates that COVID-19 myopericarditis with cardiac tamponade can present without respiratory symptoms. CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old Caucasian British woman was admitted with fever, diarrhoea and vomiting. She developed cardiogenic shock and Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) found a pericardial effusion with evidence of cardiac tamponade. A nasopharyngeal swab showed a COVID-19 positive result, despite no respiratory symptoms on presentation. A pericardial drain was inserted and vasopressor support required on intensive treatment unit (ITU). The drain was removed as she improved, an antibiotic course was given and she was discharged on day 12. CONCLUSIONS: Our case demonstrates that patients without respiratory symptoms could have COVID-19 and develop cardiac complications. These findings can aid timely diagnosis of potentially life-threatening COVID-19 myopericarditis with cardiac tamponade.","Cairns, Lauren; Abed El Khaleq, Yazeed; Storrar, Will; Scheuermann-Freestone, Michaela",J Med Case Rep,649,1

In March of 2020, NP state-specific supervisory requirements were temporarily waived to meet the demands of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the impact of temporarily waived state practice restrictions on NP perception of care delivery during the initial surge of the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts. RESEARCH DESIGN: Mixed methods descriptive analysis of a web-based survey of Massachusetts NPs (N=391), conducted in May and June 2020. RESULTS: The vast majority (75%) of NPs believed the temporary removal of practice restriction did not perceptibly improve clinical work. Psychiatric mental health NPs were significantly more likely than other NP specialties to believe the waiver improved clinical work (odds ratio=6.68, P=0.001). NPs that experienced an increase in working hours during the pandemic surge were also more likely to report a positive effect of the waiver (odds ratio=2.56, P=0.000). CONCLUSIONS: Temporary removal of state-level practice barriers alone is not sufficient to achieve immediate full scope of practice for NPs. The successful implementation of modernized scope of practice laws may require a collective effort to revise organizational and payer policies accordingly.","O’Reilly-Jacob, Monica; Perloff, Jennifer",Med Care,649,5

In combination with supportive therapy, the cytokine adsorber Cytosorb(®) (CS) is increasingly used for the treatment of cytokine storm. However, it is questionable whether its use is actually beneficial in these patients. METHODS: Patients with an interleukin-6 (IL-6) > 10,000 pg/ml were retrospectively included between October 2014 and May 2020 and were divided into two groups (group 1: CS therapy; group 2: no CS therapy). Inclusion criteria were a regularly measured IL-6 and, for patients allocated to group 1, CS therapy for at least 90 min. A propensity score (PS) matching analysis with significant baseline differences as predictors (Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, renal replacement therapy, IL-6, lactate and norepinephrine demand) was performed to compare both groups (adjustment tolerance: < 0.05; standardization tolerance: < 10%). U-test and Fisher’s-test were used for independent variables and the Wilcoxon test was used for dependent variables. RESULTS: In total, 143 patients were included in the initial evaluation (group 1: 38; group 2: 105). Nineteen comparable pairings could be formed (mean initial IL-6: 58,385 vs. 59,812 pg/ml; mean SAPS II: 77 vs. 75). There was a significant reduction in IL-6 in patients with (p < 0.001) and without CS treatment (p = 0.005). However, there was no significant difference (p = 0.708) in the median relative reduction in both groups (89% vs. 80%). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the relative change in C-reactive protein, lactate, or norepinephrine demand in either group and the in-hospital mortality was similar between groups (73.7%). CONCLUSION: Our study showed no difference in IL-6 reduction, hemodynamic stabilization, or mortality in patients with Cytosorb(®) treatment compared to a matched patient population.","Scharf, Christina; Schroeder, Ines; Paal, Michael; Winkels, Martin; Irlbeck, Michael; Zoller, Michael; Liebchen, Uwe",Ann Intensive Care,649,16

But in the middle of 2020, vaccine effectiveness, safety, and the timeline for when a vaccine would be approved and distributed to the public was uncertain. To support public health decision making, we solicited trained forecasters and experts in vaccinology and infectious disease to provide monthly probabilistic predictions from July to September of 2020 of the efficacy, safety, timing, and delivery of a COVID-19 vaccine. We found, that despite sparse historical data, a consensus--a combination of human judgment probabilistic predictions--can quantify the uncertainty in clinical significance and timing of a potential vaccine. The consensus underestimated how fast a therapy would show a survival benefit and the high efficacy of approved COVID-19 vaccines. However, the consensus did make an accurate prediction for when a vaccine would be approved by the FDA. Compared to individual forecasters, the consensus was consistently above the 50th percentile of the most accurate forecasts. A consensus is a fast and versatile method to build probabilistic predictions of a developing vaccine that is robust to poor individual predictions. Though experts and trained forecasters did underestimate the speed of development and the high efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, consensus predictions can improve situational awareness for public health officials and for the public make clearer the risks, rewards, and timing of a vaccine.","McAndrew, T.

One current focus is drug repurposing research, but those drugs have limited therapeutic efficacies and known adverse effects. The pathology of COVID-19 is essentially unknown. Without this understanding, it is challenging to discover a successful treatment to be approved for clinical use. This paper addresses several key biological processes of reactive oxygen, halogen and nitrogen species (ROS, RHS and RNS) that play crucial physiological roles in organisms from plants to humans. These include why superoxide dismutases, the enzymes to catalyze the formation of H(2)O(2), are required for protecting ROS-induced injury in cell metabolism, why the amount of ROS/RNS produced by ionizing radiation at clinically relevant doses is ~1000 fold lower than the endogenous ROS/RNS level routinely produced in the cell and why a low level of endogenous RHS plays a crucial role in phagocytosis for immune defense. Herein we propose a plausible amplification mechanism in immune defense: ozone-depleting-like halogen cyclic reactions enhancing RHS effects are responsible for all the mentioned physiological functions, which are activated by H(2)O(2) and deactivated by NO signaling molecule. Our results show that the reaction cycles can be repeated thousands of times and amplify the RHS pathogen-killing (defense) effects by 100,000 fold in phagocytosis, resembling the cyclic ozone-depleting reactions in the stratosphere. It is unraveled that H(2)O(2) is a required protective signaling molecule (angel) in the defense system for human health and its dysfunction can cause many diseases or conditions such as autoimmune disorders, aging and cancer. We also identify a class of potent drugs for effective treatment of invading pathogens such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), cancer and other diseases, and provide a molecular mechanism of action of the drugs or candidates.","Lu, Qing-Bin",Cells,649,1

However, these interventions have come at an enormous societal and economic cost. Here, we use an agent-based model, calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region, to investigate the feasibility of alternative control strategies, focusing on ""test-trace-quarantine"": a combination of (a) routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, (b) tracing and testing their known contacts, and (c) placing their contacts in quarantine. We assess the requirements for implementing this strategy, including its robustness to low compliance, delays, and other factors such as variability in overall transmission rates. We find that for the Seattle setting, if mask compliance remains high and schools remain closed, realistic levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control under a return to full workplace and community mobility.","Kerr, C.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS) is an emerging infectious disease in the Arabian Peninsula. There was a large outbreak of MERS in South Korea in 2015. We examined the incubation period distribution of MERS coronavirus infection for cases in South Korea and in Saudi Arabia. Using parametric and nonparametric methods, we estimated a mean incubation period of 6.9 days (95% credibility interval: 6.3–7.5) for cases in South Korea and 5.0 days (95% credibility interval: 4.0–6.6) among cases in Saudi Arabia. In a log-linear regression model, the mean incubation period was 1.42 times longer (95% credibility interval: 1.18–1.71) among cases in South Korea compared to Saudi Arabia. The variation that we identified in the incubation period distribution between locations could be associated with differences in ascertainment or reporting of exposure dates and illness onset dates, differences in the source or mode of infection, or environmental differences.","Virlogeux, Victor; Fang, Vicky J.; Park, Minah; Wu, Joseph T.; Cowling, Benjamin J.",Sci Rep,649,30

Live-attenuated measles vaccines are very efficient and safe. Since the availability of a reverse genetic system to manipulate MV genomes and to generate respective recombinant viruses, a considerable number of recombinant viruses has been generated that present antigens of foreign pathogens during MV replication. Thereby, robust humoral and cellular immune responses can be induced, which have shown protective capacity in a substantial number of experiments. For this purpose, the foreign antigen-encoding genes are cloned into additional transcription units of plasmid based full-length MV vaccine strain genomes, which in turn are used to rescue recombinant MV by providing both full-length viral RNA genomes respective anti-genomes together with all protein components of the viral ribonucleoprotein complex after transient transfection of the so-called rescue cells. Infectious centers form among these transfected cells, which allow clonal isolation of single recombinant viruses that are subsequently amplified, characterized in vitro, and then evaluated for their immunogenicity in appropriate preclinical animal models.","Mühlebach, Michael D.; Hutzler, Stefan",Recombinant Virus Vaccines,649,23
