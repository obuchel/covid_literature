3254,Accuracy of dengue clinical diagnosis with and without NS1 antigen rapid test: Comparison between human and Bayesian network model decision,2018-06-18,"Differentiating dengue patients from other acute febrile illness patients is a great challenge among physicians. Several dengue diagnosis methods are recommended by WHO. The application of specific laboratory tests is still limited due to high cost, lack of equipment, and uncertain validity. Therefore, clinical diagnosis remains a common practice especially in resource limited settings. Bayesian networks have been shown to be a useful tool for diagnostic decision support. This study aimed to construct Bayesian network models using basic demographic, clinical, and laboratory profiles of acute febrile illness patients to diagnose dengue. Data of 397 acute undifferentiated febrile illness patients who visited the fever clinic of the Bangkok Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Thailand, were used for model construction and validation. The two best final models were selected: one with and one without NS1 rapid test result. The diagnostic accuracy of the models was compared with that of physicians on the same set of patients. The Bayesian network models provided good diagnostic accuracy of dengue infection, with ROC AUC of 0.80 and 0.75 for models with and without NS1 rapid test result, respectively. The models had approximately 80% specificity and 70% sensitivity, similar to the diagnostic accuracy of the hospital’s fellows in infectious disease. Including information on NS1 rapid test improved the specificity, but reduced the sensitivity, both in model and physician diagnoses. The Bayesian network model developed in this study could be useful to assist physicians in diagnosing dengue, particularly in regions where experienced physicians and laboratory confirmation tests are limited.","Sa-ngamuang, Chaitawat; Haddawy, Peter; Luvira, Viravarn; Piyaphanee, Watcharapong; Iamsirithaworn, Sopon; Lawpoolsri, Saranath",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023245/,399

We analyze here the occurrences of CpG dinucleotides, which are putative pathogen-associated molecular patterns, along the viral sequence. Carrying out a comparative analysis with other ssRNA viruses and within the Coronaviridae family, we find the CpG content of SARS-CoV-2, while low compared to other betacoronaviruses, widely fluctuates along its primary sequence. While the CpG relative abundance and its associated CpG force parameter are low for the spike protein (S) and comparable to circulating seasonal coronaviruses such as HKU1, they are much greater and comparable to SARS and MERS for the 3'-end of the viral genome. In particular, the nucleocapsid protein (N), whose transcripts are relatively abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells and present in the 3'UTRs of all subgenomic RNA, has high CpG content. We speculate this dual nature of CpG content can confer to SARS-CoV-2 high ability to both enter the host and trigger pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in different contexts. We then investigate the evolution of synonymous mutations since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a new application of selective forces on dinucleotides to estimate context driven mutational processes, we find that synonymous mutations seem driven both by the viral codon bias and by the high value of the CpG force in the N protein, leading to a loss in CpG content. Sequence motifs preceding these CpG-loss-associated loci match recently identified binding patterns of the Zinc Finger anti-viral Protein (ZAP) protein.

We describe organ donation and transplant practice in the UK and assess whether kidney transplantation conferred a substantial risk of harm. Data from the UK transplant registry were used to describe kidney donation and transplant activity in the UK, and a detailed analysis of short-term, single-center, patient results in two periods: during the pre-pandemic era from 30th December 2019 to 8th March 2020 (""Pre-COVID era"") and the 9th March 2020 to 19th May 2020 (""COVID era""). Donor and recipient numbers fell by more than half in the COVID compared to the pre-COVID era in the UK, but there were more kidney transplants performed in our center (42 vs. 29 COVID vs. pre-COVID respectively). Overall outcomes, including re-operation, delayed graft function, primary non-function, acute rejection, length of stay and graft survival were similar between COVID and pre-COVID era. 6/71 patients became infected with SARS-CoV-2 but all were discharged without critical care requirement. Transplant outcomes have remained similar within the COVID period and no serious sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection were observed in the peri-transplant period.","Georgiades, Fanourios; Summers, Dominic M; Butler, Andrew J; Russell, Neil K I; Clatworthy, Menna R; Torpey, Nicholas",Clin Transplant,,399

METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of 524 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 admitted from 14th April 2020 to 31st July 2020. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 6.3% of the newborns of the mothers with COVID-19. No significant differences were observed between maturity at gestation, birth weight and sex of SARS-CoV-2 infected and noninfected newborns. The risk of sepsis was 4.09 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.28-13.00] fold higher in the neonates with SARS-CoV-2 as compared to the noninfected group (p = 0.031). Poor feeding was significantly more common among SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates (12.1%) as compared to the noninfected neonates (2.7%) (p = 0.017). There was a total of 13 neonatal deaths, of which 3 deaths occurred in SARS-CoV-2 infected neonates (9%) while 10 (2.04%) in the SAR-CoV-2 negative group. The risk of neonatal death was higher in SARS-CoV-2 infected newborns [odds ratio (OR) 4.8; 95% CI 1.25-18.36]. CONCLUSION: Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection is observed in almost 6% of neonates born to mothers with perinatal COVID-19. There is a higher risk of adverse outcomes such as neonatal sepsis and death in the SARS-CoV-2 infected as compared to the noninfected neonates.","Malik, Sushma; Surve, Suchitra; Wade, Poonam; Kondekar, Santosh; Sawant, Vishal; Shaikh, Murtuja; Kuppusamy, Periyasamy; Bharmal, Ramesh; Mahale, Smita D; Modi, Deepak N; Gajbhiye, Rahul K",J. trop. pedriatr,,399
410630,Sampling bias and incorrect rooting make phylogenetic network tracing of SARS-COV-2 infections unreliable,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of curfews during the COVID-19 pandemic, on the physical activity in patients of heart failure implanted withcardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs). METHODS: This was a retrospective single-center study of heart failure patients inserted with remote monitoring (RM)-capable CIED. We analyzed the transmitted data of physical activity and fluid volume status of all patients, before, and during the lockdown periods between February and April 2020. The clinical status of the patients was also evaluated. Results: Device data from 429 patients implanted with CIED capable of RM were initially evaluated. Patients with an implantable loop recorder, Brugada or Long QT syndromes, and patients with incomplete transmissions were excluded. Eighty-two patients with heart failure were included. The median age was 65 years (58-72), and 53 (64.6%) subjects were men. There was a 27.1% decline in physical activity, and the median physical activity of patients significantly declined from 2.4 to 1.8 hours/day (p=0.000010). Conclusion: Data obtained by remotely monitored CIED in heart failure patients suggests a significant decline in physical activity during the country lockdown due to the pandemic. Awareness of the future potential hazards in this group of patients is warranted.","Al Fagih, Ahmed; Al Onazi, Mariam; Al Basiri, Saleh; Al-Kaf, Fahmi; Dagriri, Khalid; Al Hebaishi, Yahya; Samargandy, Sondos; Al Shengeiti, Lamia",Saudi Med J,,399

Impact of group related variables (identification to family, religious group and nation) on QoL is also examined. Sample comprised 305 male and female Indian respondents, aged 18 to 78 years. Standardized measures have been utilised to assess the constructs. Results revealed that QoL was significantly influenced by individual variables (COVID-19 anxiety and personal identity) and group variables (identification with family and nation). The effect of COVID-19 anxiety and personal identity as individual variables is over and above that of demographic variables on QoL. Group variables (family and national identification) significantly impacted QoL over and above the individual variables. Findings would indeed, aid in the rehabilitation and assistance of people to live in COVID-19 crisis, and thereafter.","Kharshiing, Korsi Dorene; Kashyap, Drishti; Gupta, Kaveri; Khursheed, Masrat; Shahnawaz, Mohammad Ghazi; Khan, Neda Haseeb; Uniyal, Ritika; Rehman, Usama",Community ment. health j,,399
644036,Identification of existing pharmaceuticals and herbal medicines as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2021-02-02,"BACKGROUND: Students’ choice of medical specialties has evolved throughout year, with a growing interest in quality of life and in technological specialties. We investigated the repartition of such choices in the world and its influencing factors with a focus on the gender's influence, for helping policy-makers to deal with medical shortage and territorial to specialty disconnect. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE and Scopus from January 2010 to January 2020. Data extraction and analysis followed JBI and PRISMA recommendations. The selected articles had to focus on medical students, detail their choice of specialty, and look for factors influencing their choice. Articles were excluded if they only assessed the attractiveness of a specialty, or evaluated a public policy. This review was registered on PROSPERO, CRD 42020169227. FINDINGS: 751 studies were screened, and fifty-four were included. Surgery and internal medicine were the most wanted specialties, both in occidental and non-occidental countries. The main factors influencing the choice of specialty were lifestyle, work-life balance and discipline interest, with variation across different countries. Gender clearly affected this choice with 63.7% of men willing radiology and 14.7% of men in obstetrics and gynecology. INTERPRETATION: Influential factors vary with specialty and are affected by the country of residence. Gender has a great impact in students’ willingness to work in specific specialties. Policymakers should adapt their appealing strategies according to the country and the medical discipline concerned.

662822,Limited role for meteorological factors on the variability in COVID-19 incidence: A retrospective study of 102 Chinese cities,2021-02-24,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus and has a unique underlying pathogenesis. Hemodialysis (HD) patients experience high risk of contamination with COVID-19 and are considered to have higher mortality rates than the general population by most but not all clinical series. We aim to highlight the peculiarities in the immune state of HD patients, who seem to have both immune-activation and immune-depression affecting their outcome in COVID-19 infection. CASE SUMMARY: We report the opposite clinical outcomes (nearly asymptomatic course vs death) of two diabetic elderly patients infected simultaneously by COVID-19, one being on chronic HD and the other with normal renal function. They were both admitted in our hospital with COVID-19 symptoms and received the same treatment by protocol. The non-HD sibling deteriorated rapidly and was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit, where he died despite all supportive care. The HD sibling, although considered more “high-risk” for adverse outcome, followed a benign course and left the hospital alive and well. CONCLUSION: These cases may shed light on aspects of the immune responses to COVID-19 between HD and non-HD patients and stimulate further research in pathophysiology and treatment of this dreadful disease.","Bacharaki, Dimitra; Chrysanthopoulou, Evangelia; Grigoropoulou, Sotiria; Giannakopoulos, Panagiotis; Simitsis, Panagiotis; Frantzeskaki, Frantzeska; Flevari, Aikaterini; Karagiannis, Minas; Sardeli, Aggeliki; Kavatha, Dimitra; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Vlahakos, Demetrios",World J Nephrol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33816154/; https://doi.org/10.5527/wjn.v10.i2.21,399
