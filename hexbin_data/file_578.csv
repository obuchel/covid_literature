Here, we evaluated whether HBV RNA could act as an early monitor of pegylated interferon responses. METHODS: We analyzed a phase 3, multicenter, randomized cohort of 727 HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic patients receiving a 48-week treatment of PegIFNα-2a or PegIFNα-2b and a 24-week treatment-free follow-up. Serum levels of HBV RNA, HBV DNA, HBeAg, and HBsAg were measured at weeks 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72. RESULTS: HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss at week 72 were observed in 217 (29.8%) and 21 (2.9%) patients, respectively. During the 48-week treatment, HBV RNA decreased more rapidly than HBV DNA and HBsAg, but HBV RNA and HBeAg shared similar dynamics with positive correlations. Multivariate regression analyses consistently revealed the significance of HBV RNA at weeks 0, 12, 24, and 48 to monitor HBeAg seroconversion but not HBsAg loss. Although baseline HBV RNA only showed a modest AUC performance, HBV RNA with a significant increase of AUC at week 12 outperformed other HBV biomarkers to forecast HBeAg seroconversion (p value < 0.05). HBV RNA ≤ 1000 copies/mL was an optimized cutoff at week 12 that offered better prediction than other HBV biomarkers. This optimized cutoff plus patient age, HBV genotype B, and HBeAg offered a strong estimation of HBeAg seroconversion (accuracy 95.2%, true negative rate 99.8%). CONCLUSION: HBV RNA at week 12 is an effective monitor of HBeAg seroconversion in HBeAg-positive patients treated with pegylated interferons.

ABSTRACT: Transient recombinant protein expression in plants and recently also plant cell cultures are of increasing interest due to the speed, safety and scalability of the process. Currently, studies are focussing on the design of plant virus-derived vectors to achieve higher amounts of transiently expressed proteins in these systems. Here we designed and tested replicating single and multi-cassette vectors that combine elements for enhanced replication and hypertranslation, and assessed their ability to express and particularly co-express proteins by Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression in tobacco BY-2 plant cell packs. Substantial yields of green and red fluorescent proteins of up to ~ 700 ng/g fresh mass were detected in the plant cells along with position-dependent expression. This is the first evidence of the ability of replicating vectors to transiently express proteins in BY-2 plant cell packs.

It is crucial to understand pharmacy students’ attitudes and their perceived barriers towards PC provision, to evaluate the effectiveness of theoretical and practical curricula in creating positive attitudes toward PC. This study aims to assess attitudes of final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the barriers perceived by them to practice PC. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in February and March, 2020, involving colleges in UAE offering undergraduate pharmacy programs and having students in their final year. Participants filled a questionnaire covering attitudes’ items, based on the Pharmaceutical Care Attitudes Survey (PCAS), and several perceived barriers. A stratified sample of 193 students participated from six universities, 85% were females, 92.2% and 64.8% completed or engaged in community and hospital pharmacy training respectively, at the time of the study. Attitudes’ items receiving the highest agreement were PC will improve patient health (95.3%), all pharmacists should perform PC (93.3%) and PC would benefit pharmacists (92.7%). However, 44.6% agreed PC is not worth the additional workload. Females showed higher attitudes’ total scores, median (IQR): 55 (51–58) and 52 (49–55.5) for females and males respectively, P = 0.032. Having incomplete courses was also associated with lower scores, median (IQR): 55 (51–58) and 52 (48.5–55.5) for “No” and “Yes” respectively, P = 0.048. Poor image of the pharmacist’s role and lack of private counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the most perceived barriers, with around 78% agreement. In conclusion, final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the UAE have positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. The current curricula may be satisfactory in fostering positive attitudes among students. Poor image of the pharmacist’s role and lack of counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the main barriers identified, among other barriers.","Tawfiq, Ali M.; Alomar, Muaed Jamal; Hassan, Nageeb; Palaian, Subish",PLoS One,578,1

20200,20200,20200,Systematic and other reviews: Criteria and complexities,21.302105,9.2378,2021-06-26,"BACKGROUND: Computer game–based interventions are emerging in pediatric neurorehabilitation, as they can provide two key elements for motor learning—motivating environments that enable long-term compliance, which is particularly relevant for children, and augmented feedback for improving movement performance. OBJECTIVE: The overall aim of this study is to develop an interactive computer play for children with upper motor neuron lesions to train selective voluntary motor control and give particular attention to motivation and feedback. We also aim to determine features that make games engaging, investigate which sensory feedback modality is noticed the fastest during play, develop an interactive game, and evaluate its feasibility. METHODS: We identified engaging game features by interviewing 19 children and adolescents undergoing rehabilitation. By using a test version of the game, we determined the response times of 10 patients who had to react to visual, auditory, or combined feedback signals. On the basis of the results of these two subprojects, we developed and designed a game environment. Feasibility was studied in terms of the practicability and acceptability of the intervention among 5 children with upper motor neuron lesions. RESULTS: The game features deemed the most important by pediatric patients were strategic gameplay (13/29, 45% of answers) and choice (6/29, 21%). While playing the game, an acoustic alarm signal (reaction time: median 2.8 seconds) was detected significantly faster (P=.01) than conditions with other feedback modalities (avatar velocity reduction: median 7.8 seconds; color desaturation: median 5.7 seconds). Most children enjoyed playing the game, despite some technical issues. CONCLUSIONS: The careful identification of game features that increase motivation and feedback modalities that inform children quickly led to the development of an interactive computer play for training selective voluntary motor control in children and adolescents with upper motor neuron lesions.","Fahr, Annina; Kläy, Andrina; Keller, Jeffrey W; van Hedel, Hubertus J A",JMIR Serious Games,578,1

BACKGROUND: The number of women aged ≥ 50 years is predicted to increase in the next years in Germany. This coincides with the ageing of primary care specialists providing outpatient care. Whereas delegation of tasks to nurses as a form of interprofessional collaboration has been the target of recent studies, there is no data regarding collaboration amongst physicians in different specialisations working in primary care. We explored collaboration amongst GPs and Gyn regarding the healthcare provision to women aged ≥ 50 years. METHODS: A quantitative postal survey was administered to GPs and Gyns in three federal states in Germany, focusing on care provision to women aged ≥ 50 years. A total of 4545 physicians, comprising 3514 GPs (67% of the total GP population) randomly selected, and all 1031 Gyns practicing in these states received the postal survey in March 2018. A single reminder was sent in April 2018 with data collection ending in June 2018. Multiple logistic regressions were performed for collaboration, adjusted by age and sex, alongside descriptive methods. FINDINGS: The overall response rate was 31% (1389 respondents): 861 GPs (25%) and 528 Gyns (51%), with the mean respondent age being 54.4 years. Seventy-two per cent were female. Key competencies of collaboration are associated with working in rural federal states and with network participation. Physicians from rural states [odds ratio (OR) = 1.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2, 1.9] and physicians in networks (OR = 3.0, CI = 2.3, 3.9) were more satisfied with collaboration. Collaboration to deliver services for women aged ≥ 50 years is more systematic amongst GPs and Gyns who are members of a network; increased networking could improve collaboration, and ultimately, outcomes too.","Trusch, Barbara; Heintze, Christoph; Petelos, Elena; Dini, Lorena",Prim Health Care Res Dev,578,1

METHODS: Children (≤ 18 years) who were highest level activations at an ACS level 1 pediatric trauma center (PTC) from 2009–2019 were divided into groups:(1) patients with transport times < 4 h who received blood prePTC(preBlood) versus (2) age matched controls with transport times < 4 h who only received crystalloid prePTC (preCrystalloid). RESULTS: Of 1269 trauma activations, 38 met preBlood and 38 met preCrystalloid inclusion criteria. A similar volume of prePTC crystalloid infusion was observed between cohorts (p = 0.311). PreBlood patients evidenced greater hemodynamic instability as demonstrated by higher prePTC pediatric age-adjusted shock index (SIPA) scores. PreBlood patients showed improvement in lactate (p = 0.038) and hemoglobin (p = 0.041) levels upon PTC arrival. PreBlood patients received less crystalloid within 12 h of PTC admission (p = 0.017). No significant differences were found in blood transfusion volumes within six (p = 0.293) and twenty-four (p = 0.575) hours of admission, nor in mortality between cohorts (p = 0.091). CONCLUSIONS: The administration of blood to pediatric trauma patients prior to arrival at a PTC is safe, transiently improves markers of shock, and was not associated with worse outcomes.","Shirek, Gabrielle; Phillips, Ryan; Shahi, Niti; Pickett, Kaci; Meier, Maxene; Recicar, John; Moulton, Steven L.",Pediatr Surg Int,578,1

Therefore, we sought to characterize the peritherapeutic HRQOL of contemporary patients using the well-validated EQ-5D-5L questionnaire. METHODS All patients receiving radiotherapy for H&N cancers between July 2019 and November 2019 at the University of Freiburg Medical Center who completed the first two follow-ups were included. HRQOL was assessed by the validated EQ-5D-5L questionnaire before radiotherapy, after therapy completion, and three and six months following radiotherapy. The changes from baseline to six months for HI and EQ VAS scores were recorded. RESULTS All 49 patients completed the questionnaires at all time points of data collection, yielding 196 total questionnaires. Twenty-eight patients (57.1%) received definitive, 20 (40.8%) adjuvant, and one 2.1%) patient palliative radiotherapy. The mean EQ-5D-5L index score of the overall population before radiotherapy, after radiotherapy, and three and six months following radiotherapy was 0.837 (standard deviation, SD 0.17), 0.828 (SD 0.16), 0.855 (SD 0.15), and 0.856 (SD 0.14) respectively. The respective mean EQ VAS scores were 63.88 (SD 20.72), 63.67 (SD 21.81), 63.67 (SD 21.81), and 65.20 (SD 22.41) respectively. The respective changes of the HI and EQ VAS score over time for this cohort were not significant (Friedman test p=0.273, p=0.618). CONCLUSION Despite the known therapy-related toxicities, no significant permanent deterioration of HRQOL in this cohort was observed. Sub-populations at relatively higher risk of HRQOL deterioration may allow for increased clinical monitoring.","Sprave, Tanja; Zamboglou, Constantinos; Verma, Vivek; Nicolay, Nils H; Grosu, Anca-Ligia; Lindenmeier, Jörg; Tscheulin, Dieter K",Expert review of pharmacoeconomics & outcomes research,578,1

We have built the COVID-19 Knowledge Extractor (COKE), a web application to extract, curate, and annotate essential drug-target relationships from the research literature on COVID-19 to assist drug repurposing efforts. Materials and Methods: SciBiteAI ontological tagging of the COVID Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), a repository of COVID-19 scientific publications, was employed to identify drug-target relationships. Entity identifiers were resolved through lookup routines using UniProt and DrugBank. A custom algorithm was used to identify co-occurrences of protein and drug terms, and confidence scores were calculated for each entity pair. Results: COKE processing of the current CORD-19 database identified about 3,000 drug-protein pairs, including 29 unique proteins and 500 investigational, experimental, and approved drugs. Some of these drugs are presently undergoing clinical trials for COVID-19. Discussion: The rapidly evolving situation concerning the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a dramatic growth of publications on this subject in a short period. These circumstances call for methods that can condense the literature into the key concepts and relationships necessary for insights into SARS-CoV-2 drug repurposing. Conclusion: The COKE repository and web application deliver key drug - target protein relationships to researchers studying SARS-CoV-2.

Specifically, the psychosocial symptoms of menopause can include loss of confidence, issues with self-identity and body image, inattention and loss of memory, increased levels of stress, and a higher risk of developing anxiety and depression. In the workplace, such symptoms can impact the woman's capacity to perform to her optimal levels. Even so, many women do not seek help to manage their symptoms due to feelings of embarrassment, the possibility of experiencing adverse reactions from others, or the cultural taboos that are attached to the condition. Digital health technologies, including virtual consultations, therapeutic interventions, and participation in online communities of support, provide an important means by which women can obtain information about menopause. In the field of mental health, digital technologies have an increasing evidence base.

Within the family Bunyaviridae, the embryonated egg has been used as a host system for many viruses such as Rift Valley fever virus and Akabane virus. The current study was conducted to determine the cultivation of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in ECE. Four-day-old eggs were infected with CCHFV via the yolk sac route and harvested embryonic tissues and amino-allantoic fluid (AAF) that were used for virus passage and viral RNA (vRNA) detection. Quantification of vRNA copies was performed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Our study indicated that CCHFV caused the death of the embryonated egg in a dose-dependent manner and the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) was determined to be 6.47×10(5) copies/egg. CCHFV replicated and passaged well in the egg and high viral loads were detected both in embryonic tissue (10(9-10) copies/g) and AAF (10(7-9) copies/ml) of the embryonated egg. Thus, ECE could be used for viral cultivation and preservation, and as a potential host infection model for the study of the pathogenesis of CCHFV.","Xia, Han; Zhao, Jiuru; Li, Yongdong; Yin, Shiyu; Tang, Shuang; Zhang, Zhong; Yu, Jingfeng; Kou, Zheng; Fan, Zhaojun; Li, Tianxian",Virus research,578,0

However, for this to become a reality, both n-MOS and p-MOS should be realized, ideally with the same (standard) material. In the specific case of MoS2 field effect transistors (FETs), ambipolar transport is seldom reported, primarily due to the phenomenon of Fermi level pinning (FLP). In this study we identify the possible sources of FLP in MoS2 FETs and resolve them individually. A novel contact transfer technique is used to transfer contacts on top of MoS2 flake devices that results in a significant increase in the hole branch of the transfer characteristics as compared to conventionally fabricated contacts. We hypothesize that the pinning not only comes from the contact-MoS2 interface, but also from the MoS2-substrate interface. We confirm this by shifting to an hBN substrate which leads to a 10 fold increase in the hole current compared to the SiO2 substrate. Furthermore, we analyse MoS2 FETs of different channel thickness on three different substrates, SiO2, hBN and Al2O3, by correlating the p-branch I ON/I OFF to the position of oxide defect band in these substrates. FLP from the oxide is reduced in the case of Al2O3 which enables us to observe ambipolar transport in a bilayer MoS2 FET. These results highlight that MoS2 is indeed an ambipolar material, and the absence of ambipolar transport in MoS2 FETs is strongly correlated to its dielectric environment and processing conditions.","Mootheri, Vivek; Leonhardt, Alessandra; Verreck, Devin; Asselberghs, Inge; Huyghebaert, Cedric; de Gendt, Stefan; Radu, Iuliana; Lin, Dennis; Heyns, Marc",Nanotechnology,578,31

METHODS A retrospective review of elective laparoscopic and open segmental colectomies (2005-2010) was performed. Combined cases and procedures performed for inpatients were excluded to minimize cost variation. The hospital case-costing system was used to calculate the hourly cost of operating room time and the daily hospital ward stay. The cost of disposable equipment was calculated manually. A cost-minimization analysis was performed from the hospital perspective, which excludes physician payment. Cases were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS For this study, 470 right-side colectomies (322 open and 148 laparoscopic) and 266 left-side colectomies (181 open and 85 laparoscopic) were found to match the inclusion criteria. The operating room time was longer for the laparoscopic procedures than for the open procedures: 203.4 versus 173.4 min (P = 0.1) for right and extended right hemicolectomy (RC) and 287.4 versus 173.4 min (P = 0.009) for left and sigmoid colectomy (LC). This resulted in higher operating room costs: $4,094.10 versus $3312.11 for RC and $5,784.88 versus $4,582.55 for LC. The median hospital stay for an index admission was shorter for both sides: 5 days versus 8 days (P = 0.01) for RC and 4 days versus 6 days (P = 0.04). This resulted in lower ward costs: $4,556.07 versus $6,632.82 for RC and $3,297.24 versus $5,949.09 for LC. The cost of care per index admission after laparoscopic versus open resection was $10,097.93 versus $10,444.69 for RC and $11,067.72 versus. $11,146.56 for LC. The introduction of laparoscopic surgery has saved our institution $58,021.43 over 5 years. CONCLUSION The reasons for observed differences in operating room time and length of hospital stay were uncontrolled and may be multifactorial. However, the results demonstrate that adopting a laparoscopic approach for elective colon surgery resulted in progressive financial savings.","Alkhamesi, Nawar A; Martin, Janet; Schlachta, Christopher M",Surgical endoscopy,578,0

METHODS Ninety-five children (age 5-17 months old at first vaccination) from the RTS,S/AS01E phase 3 clinical trial who received 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01E or a comparator vaccine were selected for IgA quantification 1 month post primary immunization. Two sites with different malaria transmission intensities (MTI) and clinical malaria cases and controls, were included. Measurements of IgA against different constructs of the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) vaccine antigen and 16 vaccine-unrelated Plasmodium falciparum antigens were performed using a quantitative suspension array assay. RESULTS RTS,S vaccination induced a 1.2 to 2-fold increase in levels of serum/plasma IgA antibodies to all CSP constructs, which was not observed upon immunization with a comparator vaccine. The IgA response against 13 out of 16 vaccine-unrelated P. falciparum antigens also increased after vaccination, and levels were higher in recipients of RTS,S than in comparators. IgA levels to malaria antigens before vaccination were more elevated in the high MTI than the low MTI site. No statistically significant association of IgA with protection was found in exploratory analyses. CONCLUSIONS RTS,S/AS01E induces IgA responses in peripheral blood against CSP vaccine antigens and other P. falciparum vaccine-unrelated antigens, similar to what we previously showed for IgG responses. Collectively, data warrant further investigation of the potential contribution of vaccine-induced IgA responses to efficacy and any possible interplay, either synergistic or antagonistic, with protective IgG, as identifying mediators of protection by RTS,S/AS01E immunization is necessary for the design of improved second-generation vaccines.

Functional hemodynamic parameters based on pulse waveform analysis, which are relying on the effects of mechanical ventilation on stroke volume and its surrogates, have been shown to be reliable predictors of fluid responsiveness during anesthesia and intensive care unit treatment, as demonstrated by several clinical studies and meta-analyses. However, different limitations of these parameters have to be considered when they are used in clinical practice. Today, they can be continuously and automatically monitored by a variety of commercially available devices. These parameters have been introduced into the concept of perioperative fluid management and hemodynamic optimization - an approach that may positively impact postoperative patients' outcomes. In this article, technical aspects of the assessment of the functional hemodynamic parameters derived from pulse waveform analysis are summarized, emphasizing their advantages, limitations and potential applications, primarily in a perioperative setting in order to improve patient outcome.","Cannesson, Maxime; de Backer, Daniel; Hofer, Christoph K",Expert review of medical devices,578,1

Materials and methods PDA-XA-NPs were synthesized and characterized using transmission electron microscopy, zeta potential analysis and encapsulation efﬁciency analysis. Their in vitro release kinetics and inhibitory effects on gastric cancer were studied. The adhesion of PDA-XA-NPs was evaluated by in vivo imaging atlas. The pharmacokinetics of PDA-XA-NPs and XA was compared. Results PDA-XA-NPs had a spherical shape, a particle size of about 380 nm, an encapsulation efficiency of (82.1 ± 0.02) % and a drug loading capacity of (5.5 ± 0.1)%. The release of PDA-XA-NPs in PBS was stable and slow, without being affected by pH. The adhesion capacity of PDA-XA-NPs for mucin was significantly higher than that of bulk drug. The gastric mucosal retention of PDA-XA-NPs reached 89.1% which significantly exceeded that of XA. In vivo imaging showed that PDA-XA-NPs targeting the stomach were retained for a period of time. The pharmacokinetics study showed that PDA-XA-NPs had a longer retention time and a slower drug release than those of XA. In vitro experiments confirmed that PDA-XA-NPs exerted similar inhibitory effects on gastric cancer to those of XA, which lasted for a period of time. Conclusion High-adhesion NPs were constructed. Gastric cancer was targeted by orally administered PDA-XA-NPs, as a potentially feasible therapy. Eventually, the bioavailability of XA was increased.","Zhou, Yaqian; Zhu, Xingyu; Lin, Shangyang; Zhu, Chenqi; Wu, Li; Chen, Rui; Chen, Zhipeng; Li, Weidong",International journal of nanomedicine,578,24

The purpose of this study was to identify epidemics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) and to determine the relationship between hypokalemia and MPP. Methods This study was retrospectively conducted from 1 August 2016 to 31 July 2018 at Bishan People's Hospital in Chongqing, China. We analyzed the demographic characteristics (age, gender), extra-pulmonary manifestations, fever duration, length of hospital stay, whole blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Results The total number of children with pneumonia was 3,385, including 570 (16.84%) patients in the MP infection group. The male-to-female ratio was 1.34:1. The peak time of MPP incidence was in autumn. The MP infection group had a significantly higher ratio of fever, higher body temperature, and longer fever duration. The number of MP-infected patients with hypokalemia was highest in spring. The length of hospital stay in the mild hypokalemia group was longer than in the normokalemia group. Furthermore, severe hypokalemia cases were all in the severe MP infection group, and the severity of MP infection and hypokalemia were positively correlated. Conclusions In this study, we concluded that children infected with MP were more susceptible to fever, and had a longer duration of fever. The number of MP-infected patients with mild hypokalemia peaked in spring, and affected more boys than girls.

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of flow diverting stents (FDS) in the treatment of these aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed our prospectively maintained database to collect information for all patients with unruptured saccular bifurcation MCA aneurysms treated with FDS between January 2010 and January 2016. In addition to demographic data, we recorded the location, aneurysm characteristics, previous treatments, number and type of FDS, complications, and clinical and angiographic follow-up. RESULTS Our search identified 13 patients (7 males) with an average age of 61.7 years (47-74 years). All patients had a single bifurcation aneurysm of the MCA, and none of the aneurysms were acutely ruptured. The average fundus size of the saccular aneurysms was 3 mm (range 1.5-10 mm). Follow-up studies were available for 12 patients. Based on the most recent follow-up angiograms, six aneurysms (50%) were totally occluded; five aneurysms (41.7%) showed only a small remnant; and one aneurysm (8.3%) remained unchanged. One patient suffered from an ischemic stroke with resultant permanent hemiparesis (mRS 3). In another case, there was an in-stent thrombosis during the intervention, which resolved upon intra-arterial infusion of Eptifibatide (mRS 0). There were no intra-operative vessel or aneurysm ruptures and no mortalities. Angiography of the covered MCA branches showed no change in the caliber or flow of the vessel in six (50%), a reduction in caliber in five (41.7%), and a complete occlusion in one (8.3%). All caliber changes and occlusions of the vessels were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION In our series, 91.7% of treated MCA bifurcation aneurysms were either completely occluded or showed only a small remnant with a good safety profile. Flow diversion of MCA bifurcation aneurysms should be considered as an alternative treatment strategy when microsurgical clipping or alternative endovascular treatment options are not feasible.","Bhogal, Pervinder; AlMatter, Muhammad; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Ganslandt, Oliver; Henkes, Hans; Aguilar Pérez, Marta",Frontiers in neurology,578,20

IL-27 and its receptor mRNA are both upregulated in the CNS during acute encephalomyelitis induced by the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) and sustained during viral persistence. Contributions of IL-27 to viral pathogenesis were evaluated by infection of IL-27Rα-chain-deficient (IL-27Rα(-/-)) mice. The absence of IL-27 signaling accelerated virus control within the CNS associated with increased IFN-γ secreting virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Abrogation of IL-27 signaling did not affect virus-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated IL-10 production or cytolytic activity or Foxp3+ regulatory T cell populations. However, IL-10 production by virus-specific CD4+ T cells was reduced significantly. Despite increased T cell-mediated antiviral function in IL-27Rα(-/-) mice, the virus persisted in the CNS at similar levels as in wild-type mice. Nevertheless, IL-27Rα(-/-) mice exhibited decreased clinical disease during persistence, coincident with less severe demyelination, the hallmark tissue damage associated with JHMV infection. Overall, these data demonstrate that in contrast to viral infections at other sites, IL-27 does not play a proinflammatory role during JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis. Rather, it limits CNS inflammation and impairs control of CNS virus replication via induction of IL-10 in virus-specific CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to its protective role in limiting CNS autoimmunity and preventing immunopathology, these data define a detrimental role of IL-27 in promoting demyelination by delaying viral control.","de Aquino, Maria Teresa P; Kapil, Parul; Hinton, David R; Phares, Timothy W; Puntambekar, Shweta S; Savarin, Carine; Bergmann, Cornelia C; Stohlman, Stephen A",Journal of immunology,578,1

There is an urgent need for new strategies with clinically effective interventions to treat DFUs to reduce the burden of care in an efficient and cost-effective way. OBJECTIVE This randomized trial evaluated and compared the clinical effectiveness, tolerability, and costs of clostridial collagenase ointment (CCO) debridement to that of debridement using saline moistened gauze (SMG) and selective sharp debridement for the treatment of DFUs. METHODS Randomized, controlled, parallel group, multicenter, open-label, 12-week study of 48 patients with neuropathic DFUs randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with either CCO or SMG after baseline surgical debridement. The primary end point was the condition of the ulcer bed at the end of treatment as measured using a standardized wound assessment tool. Secondary end points were the percentage of reduction in wound area and therapeutic response rates. Adverse events were monitored for the tolerability analysis. In addition, a comparative cost-effectiveness analysis was performed from the perspective of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services as a payer. RESULTS Both the CCO and SMG groups had significantly improved wound assessment scores after 4 weeks of treatment (CCO, -2.5, P = 0.007; SMG, -3.4, P = 0.006). Only CCO treatment resulted in a statistically significant decrease from baseline in the mean wound area at the end of treatment (P = 0.0164) and at the end of follow-up (P = 0.012). In addition, the CCO group exhibited a significantly better response rate at the end of follow-up compared with the SMG group (0.92 vs 0.75, P < 0.05). Reported adverse events were similar between the 2 treatment groups. None of the reported adverse events were considered to be related to treatment. The economic analysis indicated that the direct mean costs per responder in the physician office setting of care were $832 versus $1042 for the CCO group versus the SMG group, whereas the direct mean costs per responder in the hospital outpatient department setting were $1607 versus $1980. CONCLUSIONS CCO treatment provides equivalent debridement of DFUs similar to SMG while fostering better progress toward healing as measured by decreasing wound area over time and improved response rates at the end of follow-up. In addition, CCO yields a more favorable cost-effectiveness ratio in both the physician office and hospital outpatient department settings of care.

Studies have investigated whether adjustment of antiplatelet therapies based on a single platelet function test is beneficial. OBJECTIVES The aim of the study was to test the stability of platelet reactivity measurements over time among patients treated with standard and double doses of clopidogrel. METHODS The ELEVATE-TIMI 56 (Escalating Clopidogrel by Involving a Genetic Strategy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 56) investigators genotyped 333 patients with coronary artery disease and randomized them to various clopidogrel regimens. Patients with at least 2 platelet function results on the same maintenance dose of clopidogrel (75 mg or 150 mg) were analyzed. Platelet aggregation was measured using P2Y12 reaction units (PRU). RESULTS In total, the mean platelet reactivity and the total number of nonresponders (PRU ≥230) with clopidogrel did not change between 2 periods for the 75-mg (22.4% vs. 21.9%; p = 0.86) and 150-mg doses of clopidogrel (11.5% vs. 11.5%; p = 1.00). In contrast, when evaluating each patient individually, 15.7% of patients taking clopidogrel 75 mg and 11.4% of patients taking 150 mg had a change in their responder status when tested at 2 different time points (p < 0.001). Despite being treated with the same dose of clopidogrel, >40% of patients had a change in PRU >40 on serial sampling, which approximates the average PRU difference caused by increasing the clopidogrel dose from 75 mg to 150 mg. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of platelet reactivity vary over time in a significant proportion of patients. Thus, treatment adjustment according to platelet function testing at a single time point might not be sufficient for guiding antiplatelet therapy in clinical or research settings.

However, diagnosis of renal dysfunction by serum creatinine could be confounded by loss of muscle mass and creatinine generation after critical illness. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS A retrospective, single center analysis of serum in patients surviving to hospital discharge with an intensive care unit admission of 5 or more days between 2009 and 2011 was performed. RESULTS In total, 700 cases were identified, with a 66% incidence of AKI. In 241 patients without AKI, creatinine was significantly lower (P<0.001) at hospital discharge than admission (median, 0.61 versus 0.88 mg/dl; median decrease, 33%). In 160 patients with known baseline, discharge creatinine was significantly lower than baseline in all patients except those patients with severe AKI (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes category 3), who had no significant difference. In a multivariable regression model, median duration of hospitalization was associated with a predicted 30% decrease (95% confidence interval, 8% to 45%) in creatinine from baseline in the absence of AKI; after allowing for this effect, AKI was associated with a 29% (95% confidence interval, 10% to 51%) increase in predicted hospital discharge creatinine. Using a similar model to exclude the confounding effect of prolonged major illness on creatinine, 148 of 700 patients (95% confidence interval, 143 to 161) would have eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) at hospital discharge compared with only 63 of 700 patients using eGFR based on unadjusted hospital creatinine (a 135% increase in potential CKD diagnoses; P<0.001). CONCLUSION Critical illness is associated with significant falls in serum creatinine that persist to hospital discharge, potentially causing inaccurate assessment of renal function at discharge, particularly in survivors of AKI. Prospective measurements of GFR and creatinine generation are required to confirm the significance of these findings.","Prowle, John R; Kolic, Ivana; Purdell-Lewis, Jeremy; Taylor, Rachelle; Pearse, Rupert M; Kirwan, Christopher J",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,578,14

Unfortunately, the state variables used (reaction enthalpy and Gibbs energy) do not take sufficient account of the conditions inside of cells, especially the crowding with macromolecules. METHODS For this reason, the influence of crowding agents and various other parameters such as salt concentrations, pH and temperature on equilibrium position and reaction enthalpy of the glycolytic example reaction 9 (2-Phospoglycerate - > Phosphoenolpyruvate + H2O) was investigated. The conditions were chosen to be as close as possible to the cytosolic conditions. Poly(ethylene glycol) MW = 20,000 g mol-1 (PEG 20,000) was used to analyze the influence of crowding with macromolecules. The equation of state electrolyte Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (ePC-SAFT) was applied to consider the influence of crowding agents on the reaction equilibria. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS For the reaction enthalpies and for the equilibria, it was found that the influence of salts and temperature is not pronounced while that of pH and PEG 20,000 concentration is considerable. Furthermore, it could be shown that under identical measurement conditions there are no differences between the van 't Hoff and the calorimetrically determined reaction enthalpy.

Whether BP influences the benefit or safety of intra-arterial treatment (IAT) is not known. We aimed to assess the relation of BP with functional outcome, occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and effect of IAT. METHODS This is a post hoc analysis of the MR CLEAN (Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial of Endovascular Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke in the Netherlands). BP was measured at baseline, before IAT or stroke unit admission. We estimated the association of baseline BP with the score on the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days and safety parameters with ordinal and logistic regression analysis. Effect of BP on the effect of IAT was tested with multiplicative interaction terms. RESULTS Systolic BP (SBP) had the best correlation with functional outcome. This correlation was U-shaped; both low and high baseline SBP were associated with poor functional outcome. Higher SBP was associated with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.25 for every 10 mm Hg higher SBP [95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.44]). Between SBP and IAT, there was no interaction for functional outcome, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, or other safety parameters; the absolute benefit of IAT was evident for the whole SBP range.

Using comprehensive administrative data from Germany, we analysed the nationwide development of intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and MT in Germany between 2010 and 2016. Methods We considered all documented cases (n = 1,515,634) with a main diagnosis of the ICD-10-GM code I63 (ischemic stroke) and identified specific stroke recanalization therapy by using the corresponding Operating and Procedure Key for systemic thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy out of the DRG statistics. Regional analyses are based on data from the 413 German administrative districts and cities and the obligatory quality reports of all hospitals. We distinguished between rates of MT related to place of residence of patients and place of treatment. Results Coded ischemic strokes increased by 10.2% from 2010 (n = 206.688) to 2016 (n = 227.687). The rate of IVT increased from 8.9% in 2010 to 14.9% in 2016 and the rate of MT increased from 0.8% in 2010 to 4.7% in 2016 with a strong increase in 2015 and 2016. There was a high regional variability of MT according to place of residence of patients between 0 and 11.2% in 2016 with significant lower treatment rates in rural compared to urban areas (3.8 vs 5.4%). Mean age of patients treated with MT increased from 67.8 years in 2010 to 73.3 years in 2016 and almost reached the mean age of IVT treated patients (74.4 years). The number of hospitals coding MT increased from 91 to 193 from 2010 to 2016, but 80% of all MT procedures were performed in neurointerventional centers with ≥50 procedures/year in 2016. Conclusions The rate of IVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke in Germany continues to rise and has reached 14.9% nationwide. The increase of MT is even more pronounced and was triggered by the evidence after publication of the MT randomized trials. There is still a high regional variability with significant lower MT rates in rural areas.","Weber, Ralph; Eyding, Jens; Kitzrow, Martin; Bartig, Dirk; Weimar, Christian; Hacke, Werner; Krogias, Christos",Neurological research and practice,578,7

This study prospectively characterized gastrointestinal function and symptoms on each day throughout the menstrual cycle. METHODS Healthy women aged 18-35 years (n = 78) who took OC participated in the 5-week observational study. Stool frequency, self-reported stress, stool form measured by the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), and gastrointestinal symptoms measured by a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) were assessed daily. GSRS scores were reported (1 = no discomfort at all, 7 = very severe discomfort) and were averaged for individual syndrome scores or summed for the total score. The validated, weekly version of the GSRS was completed at two time points to reflect menstruation and 1 week prior to menstruation (n = 72). Outcomes were analyzed in linear mixed models with the Dunnett's post hoc test against day 1 of menstrual bleeding or with nonparametric tests. RESULTS Daily stress (P = 0.0018), BSFS score (P = 0.0493), stool frequency (P = 0.0241), abdominal pain (P < 0.0001), diarrhea (P = 0.0022), constipation (P = 0.0446), reflux (P = 0.0193), and indigestion (P < 0.0001) all varied significantly by the day of the menstrual cycle. Dunnett's post hoc tests showed that scores (mean ± SEM) on the first day of bleeding (day 1) for daily abdominal pain (2.6 ± 0.2), diarrhea (1.7 ± 0.1), and indigestion (2.1 ± 0.2) symptoms were higher than scores on all other days of the menstrual cycle (P < 0.05) with scores not on day 1 falling under 1.5, or between no discomfort at all and slight discomfort. Reflux, stool frequency, BSFS, self-reported stress, and constipation were higher on day 1 (P < 0.05) than on 12, 8, 6, 4, and 2 other days of the menstrual cycle, respectively. The median (IQR) GSRS score was higher during the week of menstruation than the week prior to menstruation for diarrhea [1.50 (1.00-2.33) vs 1.33 (1.00-2.00), P = 0.002] and abdominal pain [2.00 (1.33-2.67) vs 1.67 (1.33-2.33), P = 0.011] syndrome scores. CONCLUSION Bowel habits appear to vary across the menstrual cycle and suggest more gastrointestinal discomfort on day 1 of menstrual bleeding in healthy women taking OC. Future interventional studies could identify ways to improve gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy women during menstruation.","Judkins, Taylor C; Dennis-Wall, Jennifer C; Sims, Shireen Madani; Colee, James; Langkamp-Henken, Bobbi",BMC women's health,578,17

Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline. We included articles evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of serological tests and the kinetics of antibody positivity. MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, medRxiv and bioRxiv were sources of articles. Methodological qualities of included articles were appraised using QUADAS-2 while Metandi performs bivariate meta-analysis of DTA using a generalized linear mixed-model approach. Stata 14 and Review Manager 5.3 were used for data analysis. The summary sensitivity/specificity of chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral flow immunoassay (LFIA) were 92% (95% CI: 86%-95%)/99% (CI: 97%-99%), 86% (CI: 82%-89%)/99% (CI: 98%-100%) and 78% (CI: 71%-83%)/98% (95% CI: 96%-99%), respectively. Moreover, CLIA-based assays produced nearly 100% sensitivity within 11-15 days post-symptom onset (DPSO). Based on antibody type, the sensitivity of ELISA-total antibody, CLIA-IgM/G and CLIA-IgG gauged at 94%, 92% and 92%, respectively. The sensitivity of CLIA-RBD assay reached 96%, while LFIA-S demonstrated the lowest sensitivity, 71% (95% CI: 58%-80%). CLIA assays targeting antibodies against RBD considered the best DTA. The antibody positivity rate increased corresponding with DPSO, but there was some decrement when moving from acute phase to convalescent phase of infection. As immunoglobulin isotope-related DTA was heterogeneous, our data have insufficient evidence to recommend CLIA/ELISA for clinical decision-making, but likely to have comparative advantage over RT-qPCR in certain circumstances and geographic regions.","Mekonnen, Daniel; Mengist, Hylemariam Mihiretie; Derbie, Awoke; Nibret, Endalkachew; Munshea, Abaineh; He, Hongliang; Li, Bofeng; Jin, Tengchuan",Reviews in medical virology,578,33

Here, we study the importance of the three mechanisms using a detailed geographical description of human mobility. We perform individual-based simulations of an SIR model using a gridded description of human settlements on top of which we implement human mobility according to the radiation model. Parallel computation permits detailed simulations of large areas. Focusing our research on the British Isles, we show that human mobility has an impact on the periodicity of measles outbreaks. Depending on the level of mobility, we observe at the global level multi-annual, annual or biennial cycles. The periodicity observed globally, however, differs from the local epidemic cycles: different locations show different mechanisms at work depending on both population size and mobility. As a result, the periodicities observed locally depend on the interplay between the local population size and human mobility.","Marguta, Ramona; Parisi, Andrea","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",578,31

In terms of teratogenicity evaluations, the murine-based embryonic stem cell test (EST) offers a promising solution to screen for multiple tissue endpoints. However, use of a mouse model in the EST can yield only a limited understanding of human development, anatomy, and physiology. Non-human primate or human in vitro models have been suggested to be a pharmacologically and pathophysiologically desirable alternative to murine in vitro models. Here, we comparatively evaluated the sensitivity of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) of a non-human primate to skeletal teratogens with mouse ESCs hypothesizing that inclusion of non-human primate cells in in vitro tests would increase the reliability of safety predictions for humans. First, osteogenic capacity was compared between ESCs from the mouse and a New World monkey, the common marmoset. Then, cells were treated with compounds that have been previously reported to induce bone teratogenicity. Calcification and MTT assays evaluated effects on osteogenesis and cell viability, respectively. Our data indicated that marmoset ESCs responded differently than mouse ESCs in such embryotoxicity screens with no obvious dependency on chemical or compound classes and thus suggest that embryotoxicity screening results could be affected by species-driven response variation. In addition, ESCs derived from rhesus monkey, an Old World monkey, and phylogenetically closer to humans than the marmoset, were observed to respond differently to test compounds than marmoset ESCs. Together these results indicate that there are significant differences in the responses of non-human primate and mouse ESC to embryotoxic agents.","Walker, Lauren; Baumgartner, Laura; Keller, Kevin C; Ast, Julia; Trettner, Susanne; Zur Nieden, Nicole I",Toxicology reports,578,31

Since the last decades, multimodality therapy showing potential for cure has become the mainstream for treatment of locally advanced NSCLCs, even some that were initially inoperable. Although salvage lung resection after dCRT has been reported with acceptable survivals, experiences in this respect are still limited. Other concerns remain debatable and inconclusive, such as dosage of radiation exposure, long interval between dCRT and surgery, and surgical comorbidity. CASE PRESENTATION A 73-year-old male former smoker with diagnosis of right lower lobe of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) with multiple mediastinal lymphadenopathy, cT4N2M0, stage IIIB, received salvage right lower lobe + right middle lobe bilobectomy through video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after dCRT and adjuvant CRT to a total of 9000 cGy dosage of radiation. The interval from the 1st and 2nd ends of radiation to the salvage surgery was 980 and 164 days, respectively. The pre-operative forced expiratory volume in the first second was 2.33 L (101% predicted) and the diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide was 56% predicted. The operating time was 6.5 h, and the total estimated blood loss was 50 ml. The patient was discharged on the 7th postoperative day without major complications or bronchopleural fistulas. The patient was still alive 42 months after the initial diagnosis of advanced N2 lung SqCC, and kept progression-free for 7 months after salvage lung resection. CONCLUSIONS Salvage lung resection performed long after high-dose radiation therapy of dCRT is technically feasible through VATS approach in a patient with initially inoperable cT4N2M0 stage IIIB NSCLC, and can be an alternative consolidative treatment for locally advanced NSCLC.","Yu, Hsuan-Hsuan; Chen, Yi-Wei; Yeh, Yi-Chen; Huang, Chien-Sheng; Chiu, Chao-Hua",Surgical case reports,578,7

We have investigated the accuracy of commonly used quantum chemical methods for the description of proton transfer reactions in different environments (gas phase, COSMO, QM/MM) using the proton transfer between the catalytic dyad residues cysteine 145 and histidine 41 of SARS coronavirus main protease as a case study. The test includes thermodynamic, kinetic, and structural properties. The study comprises computationally demanding ab initio approaches (HF, CC2, MP2, SCS-CC2, SCS-MP2, CCSD(T)), popular density functional theories (BLYP, B3LYP, M06-2X), and semiempirical methods (MNDO/d, AM1, RM1, PM3, PM6). The approximated coupled cluster approach LCCSD(T) is taken as a reference method. We find that the robustness of the tested methods with respect to the environment correlates well with the level of theory. As an example HF, CC2, MP2, and their SCS variants show similar errors for gas phase, COSMO, or QM/MM computations. In contrast for semiempirical methods, the errors strongly diversify if one goes from gas phase to COSMO or QM/MM. Particular problems are observed for the recent semiempirical methods PM6 and RM1, which show the best performance for gas phase calculations but possess larger errors in conjunction with COSMO. Finally, a combination of SCS-MP2 and B3LYP or M06-2X allows reliable estimates about remaining errors.","Paasche, Alexander; Schirmeister, Tanja; Engels, Bernd",Journal of chemical theory and computation,578,1

Given that inflammatory immune cells may induce severe lung injury, the involvement of immune factors in the pathogenesis of the disease cannot be overestimated. It has been demonstrated that coronaviruses (CoVs) have developed mechanisms of immune evasion, making them invisible to the immune system at an early stage of infection. The mechanism relies on inhibition of the anti-viral response of type I interferons (IFNs), which supports uncontrolled viral replication in epithelial cells. There is growing body of evidence that the fatal hyperinflammation ('cytokine storm') responsible for the severe course of COVID-19 is a consequence of massive SARS-CoV-2 replication rather than inappropriate hyperresponsiveness of the immune system. Therefore, a dampened innate anti-viral immune response seems to be the primary cause of the delayed critical cascade of uncontrolled immune events leading to fulminating systemic inflammation. The occurrence of virus transmission even in asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 clearly strengthens the evidence for a key role of sufficient immune control of viral replication in a subset of cases (e.g. in children, a population with highly effective innate immune responses). Although administration of immunomodulatory therapeutics is recommended under certain conditions in the guidelines of COVID-19 management, controversies regarding treatment protocols in immunocompromised patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 still exist. Extended knowledge of clinicians on the dysregulated immune response, which is a driver of the COVID-19 outcome, may improve both therapeutic protocols and the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.","Kosmaczewska, Agata; Frydecka, Irena",Polish archives of internal medicine,578,1

Effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in elite futsal players. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2021-Recent world events (i.e., COVID-19 pandemic) led to an unparalleled situation in sports. Players were forced to stay at home for a prolonged period and not allowed to use their team's training facilities or even exercise outdoors. The main aim of this study was to examine the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on neuromuscular performance and body composition in futsal players. Ten elite male players performed a 10-m sprint, horizontal and vertical jump, and body composition measurements before and after the quarantine (i.e., 70 days). Pre-post confinement differences in horizontal jump distance, countermovement jump variables, sprinting time, and body composition were analyzed by a paired sample t-test and effect sizes (ESs). A large and significant decline was observed in sprint ability (p = 0.004; ES = 1.31). Small and nonsignificant differences were found in horizontal jump performance (p = 0.243; ES = -0.39). Nonsignificant differences were observed in countermovement jump (CMJ) height (p = 0.076; ES = -0.63) but moderate-to-large significant declines were found in CMJ eccentric deceleration impulse, rate of force development, peak power, velocity, and landing peak force (p ≤ 0.05; ES = -0.52 - 1.23). Finally, trivial and nonsignificant differences were obtained on body composition parameters. In summary, sprint performance and specific CMJ kinetic variables were significantly affected by long-term reduced training, whereas vertical jump height and horizontal jump distance and body composition were not. Practitioners are advised to implement efficient sprint-oriented and eccentric-oriented training strategies to optimize return to competition after prolonged detraining periods.","Spyrou, Konstantinos; Alcaraz, Pedro E; Marín-Cascales, Elena; Herrero-Carrasco, Rubén; Cohen, Daniel D; Calleja-Gonzalez, Julio; Pereira, Lucas A; Loturco, Irineu; Freitas, Tomás T",Journal of strength and conditioning research,578,20

The disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus is known predominantly for its respiratory outcomes; a subset of critically ill patients demonstrates clinically remarkable hypercoagulability in which thrombotic events range from acute pulmonary embolism in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia to extremity ischemia. Our observational study aimed to describe the incidence and characteristics, as well as clinical outcomes, of patients presenting and treated for mesenteric ischemia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods. Between March 13 and May 13, 2020, 60 patients operated for emergency reasons were analyzed, and it was noticed that 5 of the 6 COVID-positive patients were operated due to mesenteric ischemia. Results. Five of sixty patients (83.3%) applied to our emergency clinic with COVID-19 positive and acute abdomen. Two of them (40%) did not have any comorbidities. All of them (%100) were male. There were no complications and only 1 death (20%). Mean leukocyte, neutrophil, and platelet levels were within the normal range, while the lymphocyte level was near the lower limit. C-Reactive Protein was above the limit in all patients. The mean levels of International Normalized Ratio, Platelet, and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time were above the limits. While D-dimer levels were close to the upper limit; fibrinogen levels were above the normal limit for each patient. Conclusion. The presence of hypercoagulation status in critical COVID-19 patients should be observed closely, and anticoagulation therapy can be considered in selected patients.

The aim of this study was to evaluate an established (Onyx) and a novel (precipitating hydrophobic injectable liquid [PHIL]) liquid embolic agent in an in vitro AVM model. MATERIALS AND METHODS An AVM model was integrated into a circuit system. The artificial nidus (subdivided into 28 honeycomb-like sections) was embolized with Onyx 18 (group Onyx; n = 8) or PHIL 25 (group PHIL; n = 8) with different pause times between the injections (30 and 60 seconds, n = 4 per study group) by using a 1.3F microcatheter. Procedure times, number of injections, embolization success (defined as the number of filled sections of the artificial nidus), volume of embolic agent, and frequency and extent of reflux and draining vein embolization were assessed. RESULTS Embolization success was comparable between Onyx and PHIL. Shorter pause times resulted in a significantly higher embolization success for PHIL (median embolization score, 28 versus 18; P = .011). Compared with Onyx, lower volumes of PHIL were required for the same extent of embolization (median volume per section of the artificial nidus, 15.5 versus 3.6 μL; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS While the embolization success was comparable for Onyx and PHIL, pause time had a considerable effect on the embolization success in an in vitro AVM model.

The GWAS approach has been successfully applied to primary glomerular disorders, providing numerous novel insights into the genetic architecture of IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephropathy appears to have a highly complex polygenic architecture, with nearly 20 genome-wide significant loci of small to moderate effects discovered to date. In contrast, the genetic susceptibility to membranous nephropathy and steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome appears to be driven by a small number of large-effect loci. The MHC locus on chromosome 6p21 is strongly associated with genetic susceptibility to all major types of immune-mediated glomerulopathies. However, a distinct set of classical HLA alleles is associated with each individual disease type, pinpointing to specific immune mechanisms underlying each of these conditions. Additional insights from the discovery of non-HLA risk loci reinforced the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the pathogenesis of these disorders, and highlighted important susceptibility overlaps between glomerular and other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite these initial successes, much larger GWAS and sequencing studies are still needed for each individual glomerular disease type. Increased power will be critical to comprehensively test for genetic effects across the full spectrum of allelic frequencies, to detect gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and to potentially improve the performance of polygenic risk predictors. Moreover, the existing studies are limited mostly to Europeans and East Asians, stressing the urgency to expand genetic discovery efforts to more diverse populations worldwide.","Sanchez-Rodriguez, Elena; Southard, Christopher T; Kiryluk, Krzysztof",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,578,10

However, it is unclear whether early detection translates into improved survival. The objective was to determine whether detection of ependymoma relapses on surveillance imaging translates into a survival benefit. PROCEDURE Patients with ependymoma aged <21 years at diagnosis treated in the Nemours' Children's Health System between January 2003 and October 2016 underwent chart review. Relapsed patients' charts were assessed for details of initial therapy, surveillance imaging regimen, details of relapse including detection and therapy, and outcome. Median follow up of the entire cohort was 6.5 years from diagnosis and 3.5 years from relapse. RESULTS Ninety of 198 (45%) patients experienced relapse with 61 (68%) detected by surveillance imaging and 29 (32%) detected based on symptoms. Five-year OS in the surveillance group was 67% (confidence interval [CI] 55-82%, SE 0.1) versus 51% (CI 35-73%, SE 0.19) in the symptoms group (P = .073). From relapse, the 3-year OS in the surveillance group was 62% (CI 50-78%, SE 0.11) versus 55% (CI 39-76%, SE 0.17) in the symptoms group (P = .063) and the 3-year SPFS was 45% (CI 33-61%, SE 0.16) in the surveillance group versus 32% (CI 19-55%, SE 0.27) in the symptoms group (P = .028). CONCLUSION Surveillance imaging may identify recurrences in patients when they are more amenable to salvage therapy, resulting in superior 3-year SPFS, but given limited salvage options for children with recurrent ependymoma, the survival advantage of frequent surveillance imaging in asymptomatic patients remains ambiguous.","Klawinski, Darren; Indelicato, Daniel J; Hossain, Jobayer; Sandler, Eric",Pediatric blood & cancer,578,16

Tcf1 deficiency results in partial arrests in T cell development, high apoptosis, and increased development of B and myeloid cells. Phenotypically, seemingly fully T cell-committed thymocytes with Tcf1 deficiency have promiscuous gene expression and an altered epigenetic profile and can dedifferentiate into more immature thymocytes and non-T cells. Restoring Bcl11b expression in Tcf1-deficient cells rescues T cell development but does not strongly suppress the development of non-T cells; in contrast, expressing Gata3 suppresses their development but does not rescue T cell development. Thus, T cell development is controlled by a minimal transcription factor network involving Notch signaling, Tcf1, and the subsequent division of labor between Bcl11b and Gata3, thereby ensuring a properly regulated T cell gene expression program.","Garcia-Perez, Laura; Famili, Farbod; Cordes, Martijn; Brugman, Martijn; van Eggermond, Marja; Wu, Haoyu; Chouaref, Jihed; Granado, David San León; Tiemessen, Machteld M; Pike-Overzet, Karin; Daxinger, Lucia; Staal, Frank J T",Science advances,578,1

However, an up-to-date overview and quantification of evidence are lacking. We aimed to systematically review the association of exposure to screen work with neck and upper extremity symptoms from prospective studies. METHODS An electronic database search (PubMed, Embase, Cinahl and Scopus) for prospective studies on the association of exposure to screen work and musculoskeletal symptoms was conducted. Studies were synthesised regarding extracted data and risk of bias, and meta-analyses were conducted. RESULTS After screening 3423 unique references, 19 articles from 12 studies (with 18 538 participants) were included for the current review, with the most recent exposure assessment reported in 2005. Studies described duration and input frequency of screen work (ie, computer, keyboard and mouse use, assessed using self-reports or software recordings) and musculoskeletal symptoms (ie, self-reported neck/shoulder and distal upper extremity symptoms and diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome [CTS]). Although there was overall an increased occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms with larger exposure to screen work (relative risk: 1.11 [1.03 1.19]), findings were rather inconsistent with weaker (and statistically non-significant) risks when screen work was assessed by software recording (1.05 [0.91 1.21]) compared to with self-report (1.14 [1.03 1.19]). CONCLUSIONS We found an increased risk of musculoskeletal symptoms with screen work. However, the evidence is heterogeneous, and it is striking that it lacks information from contemporary screen work using laptop, notebook or tablet computers.","Coenen, Pieter; van der Molen, Henk F; Burdorf, Alex; Huysmans, Maaike A; Straker, Leon; Frings-Dresen, Monique Hw; van der Beek, Allard J",Occupational and environmental medicine,578,28

METHODS Eighteen subjects (11 cisgender female, 7 cisgender male; M = 33.72 years, SD = 8.30) completed self-perceptual ratings and acoustic recordings before and after a typical workday. Chosen measures were specific to vocal effort, dysphonia, and laryngeal tension. Mixed effects models were calculated to determine the impact of session, mask type, sex, and their interactions on the set of perceptual and acoustic measures. RESULTS The subjects self-reported a significant increase in vocal effort following the workday. These perceptual changes coincided with an increase in vocal intensity and harmonics-to-noise ratio, but decrease in relative fundamental frequency offset 10. As expected, men and women differed in measures related to fundamental frequency and vocal tract length. CONCLUSION Healthcare professionals wearing masks reported greater vocal symptoms post-workday compared to pre-workday. These symptoms coincided with acoustic changes previously related to vocal effort; however, the degree of change was considered mild. Further research is needed to determine whether vocal hygiene strategies may reduce vocal symptoms in mask-wearing workers.","McKenna, Victoria S; Patel, Tulsi H; Kendall, Courtney L; Howell, Rebecca J; Gustin, Renee L",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,578,16

Aim: To determine how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the cases of surgical oncology, their frequency with reference to the pre-pandemic era and the challenges faced in general and in their management during the pandemic. Methodology: We conducted a descriptive longitudinal study, using consecutive non-probability sampling technique, estimating the number of cancer cases in our center, their management protocols keeping in view the local and international guidelines, resource availability and how the pandemic affected the dynamics of cancer surgery. Results: We received a total of 63 cancer cases from 1st march-31st august 2020, between age groups 29-70 years. 40 patients out of those 63 presented with complications and received early definitive surgery, where surgery could not be deferred due to the course of disease or complications. Rest of the 20 patients received either neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a palliative procedure or chemoradiotherapy, 2 patients tested COVID-19 positive, 1 non-cancer related mortality. We received 63 patients during our 6 months study time, compared with a total of 156 cancer cases received during the pre-pandemic 6 months period, showing significant decrease in frequency of cancer cases. Conclusion: Cancer cases with a chance of upgradation of disease stage due to delay or those complicated with obstruction or bleeding could not be deferred.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data and chest CT images of 9 children, aged 0 to 3 years, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 by nucleic acid detection between January 20 and February 10, 2020. RESULTS All 9 children had an epidemiological history, and family clustering was observed for all infected children. Among the 9 children with COVID-19, 5 had no symptoms, 4 had fever, 2 had cough, and 1 had rhinorrhea. There were only symptoms of the respiratory system. Laboratory examination showed no reductions in leukocyte or lymphocyte count. Among the 9 children, 6 had an increase in lymphocyte count and 2 had an increase in leukocyte count. CT examination showed that among the 9 children, 8 had pulmonary inflammation located below the pleura or near the interlobar fissure and 3 had lesions distributed along the bronchovascular bundles. As for the morphology of the lesions, 6 had nodular lesions and 7 had patchy lesions; ground glass opacity with consolidation was observed in 6 children, among whom 3 had halo sign, and there was no typical paving stone sign. CONCLUSIONS Infants and young children with COVID-19 tend to have mild clinical symptoms and imaging findings not as typical as those of adults, and therefore, the diagnosis of COVID-19 should be made based on imaging findings along with epidemiological history and nucleic acid detection. Chest CT has guiding significance for the early diagnosis of asymptomatic children.","Zhou, Yun; Yang, Gen-Dong; Feng, Kai; Huang, Hua; Yun, Yong-Xing; Mou, Xin-Yan; Wang, Li-Fei",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,578,1

Vif facilitates particle infectivity by blocking the inhibitory activity of APOBEC3G (CEM15), a virion-encapsidated cellular protein that deaminates minus-strand reverse transcript cytosines to uracils. We report that HIV-1 Vif forms a complex with human APOBEC3G that prevents its virion encapsidation. HIV-1 Vif did not efficiently form a complex with mouse APOBEC3G. Vif dramatically reduced the amount of human APOBEC3G encapsidated in HIV-1 virions but did not prevent encapsidation of mouse or AGM APOBEC3G. As a result, these enzymes are potent inhibitors of wild-type HIV-1 replication. The species-specificity of this interaction may play a role in restricting HIV-1 infection to humans. Together these findings suggest that therapeutic intervention that either induced APOBEC3G or blocked its interaction with Vif could be clinically beneficial.","Mariani, Roberto; Chen, Darlene; Schröfelbauer, Bärbel; Navarro, Francisco; König, Renate; Bollman, Brooke; Münk, Carsten; Nymark-McMahon, Henrietta; Landau, Nathaniel R",Cell,578,1

METHODS We used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional methods of cell culture and antigen detection to establish the viral etiology of acute respiratory tract infections in 75 hospitalized children. RESULTS One or more viral pathogens were detected in 65 (87%) children, with respiratory syncytial virus being the most commonly identified virus (36 children). Other viruses identified included influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenzavirus type 3, adenovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and human metapneumovirus. PCR increased the diagnostic yield significantly compared with antigen detection and culture, with 39 (21%) diagnoses identified by this method. Multiple infections were identified in 20 (27%) children. CONCLUSIONS PCR-based methodologies offer increased sensitivity for the detection of most respiratory viruses in young children. The inclusion of PCR into diagnostic testing strategies is needed to broaden our understanding of the natural ecology of respiratory viruses and the significance of multiple infections.","Jennings, Lance C; Anderson, Trevor P; Werno, Anja M; Beynon, Kirsten A; Murdoch, David R",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,578,28

Virtually all broiler and layer breeder flocks are routinely vaccinated against IBV. Two hatches of 1-day-old chicks from four lines were mistakenly vaccinated for infectious bronchitis using a moderately attenuated vaccine designed for chicks of an older age. The vaccination resulted in high mortality, and chicks from three of four lines died with signs typical of infectious bronchitis. The mortality that occurred using this less-attenuated vaccine was significantly influenced by the genetic line, and the MHC (B) haplotype in chickens of three B congenic lines. B congenic chickens possessing the B*15 haplotype were resistant in contrast to chickens possessing the B*13 or B*21 haplotypes. Chicks from two further hatches of the four lines were vaccinated appropriately with a more attenuated IBV vaccine, and only limited chick mortality was seen. These retrospective data from two repeated hatches confirm earlier data indicating chicken genes influence resistance to IBV, and indicate for the first time that genes tightly linked to the B haplotype are relevant in resistance to IBV. Due to extenuating circumstances it was not possible to verify results with chicks from F2 matings. Factors that may enhance definition of the role of the B haplotype in immune response to IBV, and the desirability for further analysis of a B haplotype-linked influence on immunity to IBV are discussed.","Bacon, L D; Hunter, D B; Zhang, H M; Brand, K; Etches, R",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,578,1

The gene encoding the membrane protein (M) was obtained by cloning a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragment obtained using bovine coronavirus (BCV)-specific primers. Furthermore, five TCV DNA fragments, obtained by PCR on RNA from clinical specimens and corresponding to either the N terminus of the M protein or the complete M protein were also cloned and sequenced. The sequence revealed a 3' non-coding region of 291 bases, an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the N protein with a predicted size of 448 amino acids, or an Mr of 49K, and an ORF encoding the M protein with a predicted size of 230 amino acids and an Mr of 26K. A third ORF, encoding a hypothetical protein of 207 amino acids with an Mr of 23K was found within the N gene sequence. The amino acid sequences of both the N and M proteins were more than 99% similar to those published for BCV. Extensive similarity was also observed between the amino acid sequences of the TCV N protein and those of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (70%) and human respiratory coronavirus strain OC43 (HCV-OC43) (98%) and between the amino acid sequences of the predicted M proteins of TCV and MHV (86%). Such striking identity suggests that BCV, TCV and HCV-OC43 must have diverged from each other only recently.

METHODS Clinical data of 1568 patients with positive SARS-Cov-2 nucleic acid test (SNAT) were collected retrospectively. The patients were assigned to an asymptomatic group and a symptomatic group according to the existence of clinical symptoms when they got positive result in nucleic acid test, and the clinical data of the two groups were analyzed and compared. In addition, the data of asymptomatic patients who showed clinical symptoms later and the results of two-week follow-up after cure were analyzed. RESULTS Among all enrolled patients, there were 1489 patients with positive symptoms and 79 asymptomatic patients, including 34 patients who developed symptoms during treatment. Logistic analysis revealed that age ≤45 years (OR=2.722, P<0.001), history of diabetes mellitus (OR=0.446, P=0.007), and history of cancer (OR=0.259, P=0.008) were independent factors for asymptomatic presentation in patients with positive SNAT, and age ≥46 years (OR=1.562, P=0.012) and history of hypertension (OR=2.077, P<0.001) were risk factors for the occurrence of clinical symptoms in asymptomatic patients with positive SNAT during hospitalization.

RECENT FINDINGS: Recent data suggest that not all patients with sleep apnea get their disease for the same reason. As such, no one variable is effective at defining which patients do or do not have sleep apnea. Identifying the mechanism(s) underlying OSA for an individual is helpful as it can help to determine whether personalized therapy could be developed based on an individual's characteristics. In addition, these underlying mechanisms may be helpful in predicting response to therapy and prognosticating regarding future complications. SUMMARY: OSA is a heterogeneous disease with highly varying underlying mechanisms. OSA has variable clinical manifestations with definable subsets having risk of particular complications. Future studies will be helpful to identify mechanisms underlying OSA using clinically accessible tools and then using these data to focus individualized treatment approaches.","Malhotra, Atul; Mesarwi, Omar; Pepin, Jean-Louis; Owens, Robert L",Curr. opin. pulm. med,578,10

Past coronavirus epidemics namely Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have also been severe on older people. These epidemics lasted for only a limited period, however, and have proven short lived in the memories of both the public and public health systems. No lessons were learnt to mitigate the impact of future epidemics of such nature, on older people. This complacency we feel has claimed the lives of many older people during the current COVID-19 global epidemic. The nature of risks associated with acquiring infections and associated mortality among older people in respiratory epidemic situations are varied and of serious concern. Our commentary identifies demographic, biological, behavioural, social and healthcare-related determinants, which increase the vulnerability of older people to respiratory epidemics. We acknowledge that these determinants will likely vary between older people in high- and low-middle income countries. Notwithstanding these variations, we call for urgent action to mitigate the impact of epidemics on older people and preserve their health and dignity. Intersectoral programmes that recognise the special needs of older people and in unique contexts such as care homes must be developed and implemented, with the full participation and agreement of older people.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational study including coronavirus disease 2019 patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection between February 15, 2020, and November 30, 2020, according to age and type of organ support therapies. SETTING: About 168 hospitals in 16 countries within the Society of Critical Care Medicine's Discovery Viral Infection and Respiratory Illness University Study coronavirus disease 2019 registry. PATIENTS: Adult hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 patients who did and did not require various types and combinations of organ support (mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, vasopressors, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were discharge home with or without assistance and hospital length of stay. Risk-adjusted variation in hospital mortality for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was assessed by using multilevel models with hospitals as a random effect, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities. Among 20,608 patients with coronavirus disease 2019, the mean (± sd) age was 60.5 (±17), 11,1887 (54.3%) were men, 8,745 (42.4%) were admitted to the ICU, and 3,906 (19%) died in the hospital. Hospital mortality was 8.2% for patients receiving no organ support (n = 15,001). The most common organ support therapy was invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 5,005; 24.3%), with a hospital mortality of 49.8%. Mortality ranged from 40.8% among patients receiving only invasive mechanical ventilation (n =1,749) to 71.6% for patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and new renal replacement therapy (n = 655). Mortality was 39% for patients receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n = 389). Rates of discharge home ranged from 73.5% for patients who did not require organ support therapies to 29.8% for patients who only received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 8.8% for invasive mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replacement; 10.8% of patients older than 74 years who received invasive mechanical ventilation were discharged home. Median hospital length of stay for patients on mechanical ventilation was 17.1 days (9.7-28 d). Adjusted interhospital variation in mortality among patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was large (median odds ratio 1.69). CONCLUSIONS: Coronavirus disease 2019 prognosis varies by age and level of organ support.

Background: People in need of care are particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to their age and previous illnesses. At the same time, a large number of daily contacts between nursing staff and those in need of care increase the risk of transmission of the disease. AIM: The study aims to illustrate (I) to what extent home care services and semi-residential care facilities are affected by COVID-19, (II) human and material resources, (III) the care situation of those in need of care and (IV) the organizational handling of the situation and outline support requests to politicians. METHODS: More than 12,000 home-care nursing services and semi-residential care facilities were invited to participate in an online survey with quantitative and qualitative elements, 701 nursing services (response rate 7,3 %) and 96 semi-residential facilities (response rate 3,5 %) took part. RESULTS: Almost a third (30,1 %, 189 / 627) of the nursing services surveyed are affected by confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19 among clients. About half of the services report a reduced use of SGB V (47,6 %, 288 / 605) or SGB XI services (59,7 %, 375 / 628). Two thirds of the semi-residential facilities (65,6 %, 63 / 96) say they are currently closed due to the pandemic. Likewise, half of the nursing services (45,8 %, 253 / 552) reported that care with reduced use of services was at risk / unstable or even not ensured. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that the situation of care-dependent people served by home-care services in the present pandemic - and also with a view to a possible second wave - should receive increased attention particularly with regard to unstable / risky care arrangements.","Wolf-Ostermann, Karin; Schmidt, Annika; Preuß, Benedikt; Heinze, Franziska; Seibert, Kathrin; Friedrich, Anna-Carina; Domhoff, Dominik; Stolle, Claudia; Rothgang, Heinz",Pflege,578,1

Quantifying the risk of congenital malformations associated with early pregnancy exposure to hydroxychloroquine is important in both the context of its ongoing use for rheumatological disorders and its potential future use for coronavirus disease 2019 prophylaxis, for which a number of clinical trials are ongoing despite initial trials for coronavirus disease 2019 treatment having been negative. OBJECTIVE: The study objective was to evaluate the risk of major congenital malformations associated with exposure to hydroxychloroquine during the first trimester of pregnancy, the period of organogenesis. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a population-based cohort study nested in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX, 2000-2014) and IBM MarketScan Research Database (MarketScan, 2003-2015). The source cohort included 2045 hydroxychloroquine-exposed pregnancies and 3,198,589 pregnancies not exposed to hydroxychloroquine continuously enrolled in their respective insurance program for 3 months before the last menstrual period through at least 1 month after delivery; infants were enrolled for at least 3 months after birth. We compared the risk of congenital malformations in women using hydroxychloroquine during the first trimester of pregnancy with that of those not using hydroxychloroquine, restricting the cohort to women with rheumatic disorders and using propensity score matching to control for indication, demographics, medical comorbidities, and concomitant medications (1867 hydroxychloroquine-exposed pregnancies and 19,080 pregnancies not exposed to hydroxychloroquine). The outcomes considered included major congenital malformations diagnosed during the first 90 days after delivery and specific malformation types for which there were at least 5 exposed events: oral cleft, cardiac, respiratory, gastrointestinal, genital, urinary, musculoskeletal, and limb defects. RESULTS: Overall, 54.8 per 1000 infants exposed to hydroxychloroquine were born with a major congenital malformation versus 35.3 per 1000 unexposed infants, corresponding to an unadjusted relative risk of 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.27-1.81). Patient characteristics were balanced in the restricted, propensity score-matched cohort. The adjusted relative risk was 1.26 (95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.54); it was 1.33 (95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.65) for a daily dose of &#8805;400 mg and 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.60-1.50) for a daily dose of <400 mg. Among the different malformation groups considered, more substantial increases in the risk of oral clefts, respiratory anomalies, and urinary defects were observed, although estimates were imprecise. No pattern of malformation was identified. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest a small increase in the risk of malformations associated with first-trimester hydroxychloroquine use. For most patients with autoimmune rheumatic disorders, the benefits of treatment during pregnancy will likely outweigh this risk. If hydroxychloroquine were shown to be effective for coronavirus disease 2019 prophylaxis in ongoing trials, the risk of malformations would need to be balanced against such benefits.","Huybrechts, Krista F; Bateman, Brian T; Zhu, Yanmin; Straub, Loreen; Mogun, Helen; Kim, Seoyoung C; Desai, Rishi J; Hernandez-Diaz, Sonia",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,578,22

In order to re-invigorate immunization service delivery, sufficient financing must be made available from all sources, and particularly from government resources. This study utilizes the most recent data available to provide an updated comparison of available data sources on government spending on immunization. METHODS: We examined data from WHO/UNICEF's Joint Reporting Form (JRF), country Comprehensive Multi-Year Plan (cMYP), country co-financing data for Gavi, and WHO National Health Accounts (NHA) on government spending on immunization for consistency by comparing routine and vaccine spending where both values were reported. We also examined spending trends across time, quantified underreporting and utilized concordance analyses to assess the magnitude of difference between the data sources. RESULTS: Routine immunization spending reported through the cMYP was nearly double that reported through the JRF (rho = 0.64, 95% 0.53 to 0.77) and almost four times higher than that reported through the NHA on average (rho = 3.71, 95% 1.00 to 13.87). Routine immunization spending from the JRF was comparable to spending reported in the NHA (rho = 1.30, 95% 0.97 to 1.75) and vaccine spending from the JRF was comparable to that from the cMYP data (rho = 0.97, 95% 0.84 to 1.12). Vaccine spending from both the JRF and cMYP was higher than Gavi co-financing by a at least two (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.45 to 2.89) and (rho = 2.66, 95% 2.15 to 3.30), respectively. IMPLICATIONS: Overall, our comparative analysis provides a degree of confidence in the validity of existing reporting mechanisms for immunization spending while highlighting areas for potential improvements. Users of these data sources should factor these into consideration when utilizing the data. Additionally, partners should work with governments to encourage more reliable, comprehensive, and accurate reporting of vaccine and immunization spending.","Ikilezi, Gloria; Bachmeier, Steven D; Cogswell, Ian E; Maddison, Emilie R; Stutzman, Hayley N; Tsakalos, Golsum; Brenzel, Logan; Dieleman, Joseph L; Micah, Angela E",Vaccine,578,30

254043,254043,254043,Error in Funding/Support,21.676367,9.238436,2020,"BACKGROUND: Global Health has increasingly gained international visibility and prominence. First and foremost, the spread of cross-border infectious disease arouses a great deal of media and public interest, just as it drives research priorities of faculty and academic programmes. At the same time, Global Health has become a major area of philanthropic action. Despite the importance it has acquired over the last two decades, the complex collective term ""Global Health"" still lacks a uniform use today. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to present the existing definitions of Global Health, and analyse their meaning and implications. The paper emphasises that the term ""Global Health"" goes beyond the territorial meaning of ""global"", connects local and global, and refers to an explicitly political concept. Global Health regards health as a rights-based, universal good; it takes into account social inequalities, power asymmetries, the uneven distribution of resources and governance challenges. Thus, it represents the necessary continuance of Public Health in the face of diverse and ubiquitous global challenges. A growing number of international players, however, focus on public-private partnerships and privatisation and tend to promote biomedical reductionism through predominantly technological solutions. Moreover, the predominant Global Health concept reflects the inherited hegemony of the Global North. It takes insufficient account of the global burden of disease, which is mainly characterised by non-communicable conditions, and the underlying social determinants of health. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond resilience and epidemiological preparedness for preventing cross-border disease threats, Global Health must focus on the social, economic and political determinants of health. Biomedical and technocratic reductionism might be justified in times of acute health crises but entails the risk of selective access to health care. Consistent health-in-all policies are required for ensuring Health for All and sustainably reducing health inequalities within and among countries. Global Health must first and foremost pursue the enforcement of the universal right to health and contribute to overcoming global hegemony.","Holst, Jens",Global Health,578,20

Limited studies showed that smokers were at higher risk of having severe complications and higher mortality. We aimed to analyze the possible correlation between adult tobacco smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality all over the world. METHODS: this correlation study involved a linear regression to analyse the correlation between smoking prevalence data in adults and COVID-19 Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) in countries with 1000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on May 3, 2020. RESULTS: seventy-five countries included with median CFR 3.66%. There was no relationship between adult male or female smoking prevalence and COVID-19 mortality in all over the countries. The multivariate analysis showed p-values of 0.823 and 0.910 for male and female smoking prevalence, respectively. However, in lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), there was a positive correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking with the mortality of COVID-19. Each increment of one percentage of adult male smoking prevalence was associated with increase in COVID-19 CFR by 0.08% (95% CI 0.00%-0.15%, p=0.041). CONCLUSION: there is correlation between the prevalence of adult male smoking and the CFR of COVID-19 in lower middle-income countries. Based on these findings, strengthening of tobacco control policies is essential to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic especially in LMIC.

Study endpoints included; quality of life (QoL; 5 RCTs and 1 PCS), disease free survival (DFS) (1 RCT), overall survival (OS) (1 RCT) and cost-effectiveness (1 RCT). The results showed reduction in follow-up frequency had no adverse effect on: QoL (6 studies, n = 920), DFS (1 trial, n = 472) or OS (1 trial, n = 472), but improved cost-effectiveness (1 trial, n = 472). Four RCTs specifically examined follow-up on-demand versus scheduled follow-up visits and found no statistically significant differences in QoL (n = 544). CONCLUSION: While no evidence-based guidelines suggest that follow-up of EBC patients improves DFS or OS, routinely scheduled in-person assessment is common. RCT data suggests that reduced frequency of follow-up has no adverse effects.","Surujballi, Julian; Shah, Hely; Hutton, Brian; Alzahrani, Mashari; Beltran-Bless, Ana-Alicia; Shorr, Risa; Larocque, Gail; McGee, Sharon; Cole, Katherine; Ibrahim, Mohammed F K; Fernandes, Ricardo; Arnaout, Angel; Stober, Carol; Liu, Michelle; Sienkiewicz, Marta; Saunders, Deanna; Vandermeer, Lisa; Clemons, Mark",Cancer Treat Rev,578,16

Pakistan is quite vulnerable to such conspiracy narratives and has experienced failures of polio vaccination programs because of such claims. Recently, two well-known political figures raised conspiracy theories against COVID-19 vaccines in Pakistan, stating that COVID-19 is a grand illusion and a conspiracy against Muslim countries. This theory is much discussed in the local community, supporting COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. We urge healthcare authorities in Pakistan to take necessary measures against such claims before they penetrate to the general community. Anti-vaccine movements could undermine efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that ethical and responsible behavior of mass media, a careful advisory from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority, stern measures from healthcare authorities, effective maneuvers to increase public awareness on COVID-19, vigorous analysis of information by data or communications scientists, and publication of counter opinions from health professionals against such theories will go a long way in neutralizing such misleading claims. Because Pakistan is experiencing a large burden of disease, with a sharp rise in confirmed cases, immediate action is of paramount importance to eradicate any potential barriers to a future COVID-19 vaccination program.","Khan, Yusra Habib; Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Alzarea, Abdulaziz Ibrahim; Alanazi, Abdullah Salah; Tanveer, Nida; Hashmi, Furqan Khurshid",Am J Trop Med Hyg,578,24

CT although sensitive in detecting changes suffers from poor specificity in discrimination from other causes of ground glass opacities (GGOs). We aimed to develop and validate a CT-based radiomics model to differentiate COVID-19 from other causes of pulmonary GGOs. Methods: We retrospectively included COVID-19 patients between 24/01/2020 and 31/03/2020 as case group and patients with pulmonary GGOs between 04/02/2012 and 31/03/2020 as a control group. Radiomics features were extracted from contoured GGOs by PyRadiomics. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method was used to establish the radiomics model. We assessed the performance using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: A total of 301 patients (age mean ± SD: 64 ± 15 years; male: 52.8 %) from three hospitals were enrolled, including 33 COVID-19 patients in the case group and 268 patients with malignancies or pneumonia in the control group. Thirteen radiomics features out of 474 were selected to build the model. This model achieved an AUC of 0.905, accuracy of 89.5 %, sensitivity of 83.3 %, specificity of 90.0 % in the testing set. Conclusion: We developed a noninvasive radiomics model based on CT imaging for the diagnosis of COVID-19 based on GGO lesions, which could be a promising supplementary tool for improving specificity for COVID-19 in a population confounded by ground glass opacity changes from other etiologies.","Xie, Chenyi; Ng, Ming-Yen; Ding, Jie; Leung, Siu Ting; Lo, Christine Shing Yen; Wong, Ho Yuen Frank; Vardhanabhuti, Varut",Eur.

The aim of this paper is to: (1) document this dissemination process; and (2) report on the feasibility of implementing the dissemination workshops, the acceptability of the workshops (and guidelines) for different end-user groups, and the extent to which CBO representatives disseminated the guidelines to end-users. Fifteen workshops were held in seven of SA's nine provinces with a total of 323 attendees. Quantitative and qualitative findings (n = 281) indicate that these workshops were feasible for community-based dissemination of the guidelines and that this method of dissemination was acceptable to CBOs and end-users. Findings from follow-up focus groups (6 groups, n = 28 participants) indicate that the guidelines were shared with end-users of CBOs who participated in the focus groups. An additional musical storytelling resource, the ""Woza, Mntwana"" song, was well-received by participants; sharing via WhatsApp was believed to be the most effective way to disseminate this song. These findings confirm the feasibility and acceptability of culturally appropriate and context-specific community-based dissemination of behavioural guidelines in low-income settings.","Draper, Catherine E; Silubonde, Takana M; Mukoma, Gudani; van Sluijs, Esther M F",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),578,26

This study aimed to investigate the connection between PBD and discrete dimensions of the Five Factor Model (FFM) of personality. METHODS: Youth diagnosed with PBD I, II, or NOS, at high risk for the disorder (BD-HR) and healthy controls were recruited from the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic at Stanford University School of Medicine. Researchers administered a personality inventory and evaluated current mood state. RESULTS: BD and BD-HR youth scored lower in Emotional Regulation than did HC youth (F (3, 70) = 10.75, p < .001). Within the BD and BD-HR groups, youth with high depression scores scored lower on Extraversion (F (3, 70) = 8.62, p < .001) and Conscientiousness (F (3, 70) = 4.53, p < .01). LIMITATIONS: A major limitation of this study is its cross-sectional design, precluding analysis of whether certain traits or clusters of traits predict PBD or other mood disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Low Emotional Regulation, Conscientiousness, and Agreeableness were associated with PBD; this personality profile clinically corresponds with youth diagnosed with PBD who present with difficulty regulating their emotions, vulnerability to stress, and emotional reactivity. Future research examining personality characteristics in PBD may elucidate further a specific profile to aid clinicians in developing psychosocial interventions for youth with and at high risk of developing PBD.","Kelman, Jake; Thacher, Abigail; Hossepian, Kristene; Pearlstein, Jennifer; Geraghty, Shauna; Cosgrove, Victoria E",J Affect Disord,578,1

In order to gain a better insight into the demands for psychiatric care in times of crisis, this study compared levels of psychological distress in individuals with preexisting psychiatric conditions with healthy controls and further examined associations of daily routines with psychological distress. Method: Out of 99 participants of an online survey, 44 individuals reported prior mental health-related inpatient treatment. Patients were asked about their levels of psychological distress and adaptation of lifestyle and activities of daily living. Results: Individuals with a psychiatric history were significantly more psychologically distressed (p < 0.001;d = 1.68) and displayed significantly less behavioral adaptation than healthy controls (p = 0.012;d = -0.52) in response to the changed circumstances. The difference in behavioral adaptation accounted for 21 % of the difference in psychological distress. Conclusions: In times of crisis, individuals with a psychiatric history require ongoing support from mental health services, in particular those supporting every-day lifestyle in order to better cope with the consequences of a drastically changed environment.

Methodik: In einer 15-minutigen Online-Befragung wurden 44 Menschen mit stationaren psychiatrischen Vorbehandlungen und 55 psychisch Gesunde hinsichtlich ihrer generellen psychischen Belastung und der Veranderungen ihres Alltagsverhaltens seit Beginn der Einschrankungen befragt. Ergebnisse: Menschen mit psychischen Vorerkrankungen waren insgesamt signifikant starker psychisch belastet als Gesunde (p < 0,001;d = 1,68) und berichteten auch uber signifikant geringere konstruktive Anpassungen ihres Alltagsverhaltens (p = 0,012;d = -0,52) an die veranderte Lebenssituation. 20,6 % der hoheren psychischen Belastung lies sich statistisch durch die geringere Anpassung des Alltagsverhaltens erklaren.

Elective services were stopped and trauma services focused on decreasing patient-clinician interactions and managing injuries nonoperatively wherever possible. The everyday life of the general public changed dramatically with the introduction of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This paper looks at the experience of a South West London trauma unit. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients reviewed in fracture clinic and by the orthopaedic on-call team between 23 March to 23 April 2020 were included. Data on the mechanism of injury and whether this was a usual activity, the injury sustained and its management were collected. RESULTS: A total of 167 trauma injuries were seen, compared with 735 new patients with injuries in the previous month. The number of trauma operations completed decreased by 38%; 55% of injuries occurred inside the home and 44% outside the home during daily exercise. Some 31% of injuries were secondary to a new activity taken up during lockdown. Three open fractures and two polytrauma cases were seen that would have normally been managed at the local major trauma centre. CONCLUSION: Overall, both the number of injuries seen and trauma operations completed during the enforced lockdown decreased. This is probably due to a change in the way the general public are living their lives, and the reconfigurations within the NHS in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an interesting time within trauma and orthopaedic departments, as they continue to adapt to the changing injuries and working environment.","Oliver-Welsh, L; Richardson, C; Ward, D A",Ann R Coll Surg Engl,578,1

A continuing need for diagnostic tools is a must to contain its spread. Till now, the gold standard method, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), is the precise procedure to detect the virus. However, SARS-CoV-2 may escape RT-PCR detection for several reasons. The development of well-designed, specific and sensitive serological test like enzyme immunoassay (EIA) is needed. This EIA can stand alone or work side by side with RT-PCR. In this study, we developed several EIAs including plates that are coated with either specially designed SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid or surface recombinant proteins. Each protein type can separately detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM or IgG antibodies. For each EIAs, the cut-off value, specificity and sensitivity were determined utilizing RT-PCR confirmed Covid-19 and pre-pandemic healthy and other viruses-infected sera. Also, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to define the specificities and sensitivities of the optimized assay. The in-house EIAs were validated by comparing against commercial EIA kits. All in-house EIAs showed high specificity (98-99%) and sensitivity (97.8-98.9%) for the detection of IgG/IgM against RBD and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2. From these results, the developed Anti-RBD and anti-N IgG and IgM antibodies EIAs can be used as a specific and sensitive tool to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, calculate the burden of disease and case fatality rates.","Ibrahim, Essam H; Ghramh, Hamed A; Kilany, Mona",J King Saud Univ Sci,578,19

Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been crucial to support evidence-based policy making during the early stages of the epidemic. This study assesses the potential impact of different control measures for mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the UK. METHODS: We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, tracking 66·4 million people aggregated to 186 county-level administrative units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The four base interventions modelled were school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number, R0. FINDINGS: We projected a median unmitigated burden of 23 million (95% prediction interval 13-30) clinical cases and 350â000 deaths (170â000-480â000) due to COVID-19 in the UK by December, 2021. We found that the four base interventions were each likely to decrease R0, but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined intervention was more effective at reducing R0, but only lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R0 near or below 1; the most stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120â000 cases (46â000-700â000) and 50â000 deaths (9300-160â000). Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care demand exceeding availability. INTERPRETATION: The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are probably required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.

However, questions remain regarding the sensitivity of WBE and its use in low prevalence settings. In this study, we estimated the total number of COVID-19 cases required for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater. To do this, we leveraged a unique situation where, over a 4-month period, all symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, in a population of approximately 120,000, were precisely known and mainly located in a single managed isolation and quarantine facility (MIQF) building. From 9 July to 6 November 2020, 24-hr composite wastewater samples (n = 113) were collected daily from the sewer outside the MIQF, and from the municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located 5 km downstream. New daily COVID-19 cases at the MIQF ranged from 0 to 17, and for most of the study period there were no cases outside the MIQF identified. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 54.0% (61/113) at the WWTP, compared to 95.6% (108/113) at the MIQF. We used logistic regression to estimate the shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA into wastewater based on four infectious shedding models. With a total of 5 and 10 COVID-19 infectious cases per 100,000 population (0.005 % and 0.01% prevalence) the predicated probability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection at the WWTP was estimated to be 28 and 41%, respectively. When a more realistic proportional shedding model was used, this increased to 58% and 87% for 5 and 10 cases, respectively. In other words, when 10 individuals were actively shedding SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a catchment of 100,000 individuals, there was a high likelihood of detecting viral RNA in wastewater. SARS-CoV-2 RNA detections at the WWTP were associated with increasing COVID-19 cases. Our results show that WBE provides a reliable and sensitive platform for detecting infections at the community scale, even when case prevalence is low, and can be of use as an early warning system for community outbreaks.

This study aimed to shed light on physicians' knowledge of potential DDIs related to COVID-19 treatment, to determine the effect of an information brief about these DDIs on their correct response rates, and to identify factors associated with higher levels of knowledge about these DDIs. METHODS: The knowledge of physicians regarding the clinical significance and intervention of 7 common potential DDIs during COVID-19 treatment was evaluated via an online survey. Using a pretest-posttest design, the physicians completed a multiple-choice questionnaire first using their existing knowledge, then received an information brief about the DDIs and completed the same questionnaire again. Pretest and posttest scores were evaluated and factors affecting correct response rates were determined using correlation, regression, and post-hoc analyzes. RESULTS: A total of 244 physicians participated in the survey, 147 (60.2%) of whom were involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. After the information brief, there were significant increases in the number of correct responses for both clinical significance and interventions (p < 0.0001). In comparisons of pretest knowledge, physicians involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients showed significantly higher correct response rate for interventions compared to physicians who had not treated COVID-19 patients (p = 0.003). Post-hoc analysis to compare pretest correct intervention responses among all medical specialties revealed significant differences between infectious diseases and family practice (mean difference: 1.059; p = 0.005) and between internal medicine and family practice (mean difference: 1.771; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Physicians involved in the treatment of COVID-19 patients had more knowledge regarding clinical significance and appropriate management of potential DDIs than those not involved. Therefore, it may be beneficial to organize trainings and issue guidelines about potential DDIs for physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sürmelioglu, Nursel; Yalçin, Nadir; Kusçu, Ferit; Candevir, Aslihan; Inal, Ayse Seza; Kömür, Süheyla; Kurtaran, Behice; Demirkan, Kutay; Tasova, Yesim",Postgrad Med,578,30

It is hypothesized that the overall number of orthopaedic trauma encounters (OTEs), the number of OTEs related to both high and low severity injuries, and the proportion of OTEs related to high severity versus low severity injuries decreased compared with previous years. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of OTEs between 2016 and 2020. High and low severity OTEs were classified according to an algorithm created by the researchers. Data were statistically analyzed and compared with external data for traffic counts, motor vehicle accidents, and Transportation Security Administration checkpoints. RESULTS: A 45.1% decrease (P = 0.0005) was seen in OTEs from March and April 2016-2019 compared with 2020. The decrease began approximately 12 days before the shelter-in-place order. There was a 58.8% decrease in high severity injuries with a fracture (P = 0.013) and a 42.9% decrease in low severities injuries (P = 0.0003). The proportion of high to low severity OTEs was unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: The quantity of OTEs was significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and Michigan shelter-in-place order. A decrease in both high and low severity OTEs was found; however, there was no statistically significant change in the ratio of high to low severity OTEs compared with previous years. Although it is difficult to determine what portion of the decrease in OTE is attributable to the shelter-in-place order versus the COVID-19 pandemic in general, data suggest both play a role.

Sympathetic overactivity, which might play an important role in hyperhidrosis, can contribute to metabolic diseases and the decreased quality of life (QoL). We compared the metabolic components and health-related QoL between patients with hyperhidrosis and the general population. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study and compared the characteristics of the patients (N = 196) with hyperhidrosis and propensity score-matched controls (N = 196) selected from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Metabolic components and EQ-5D-3L (EQ-5D) index were compared using a two-way mixed analysis of covariance after adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Patients with hyperhidrosis had significantly higher waist circumference (estimated mean values ± SD for patients and the control group, 85.5 ± 10.8 cm vs 81.3 ± 10.3 cm, p < 0.001), blood pressure (SBP, 121.1 ± 16.9 vs 111.7 ± 10.3, p < 0.001 AND DBP, 77.5 ± 12.8 vs 73.6 ± 8.6, p < 0.001, respectively), fasting glucose (97.1 ± 11.3 vs 91.5 ± 9.2, p < 0.001), and the number of components of metabolic syndrome (1.4 ± 1.3 vs 1.0 ± 1.2, p = 0.002), and significantly lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (144.3 ± 53.2 vs 158.3 ± 55.7, p = 0.002) and EQ-5D values (estimated mean values (standard error) for patients and the control group, 0.92 (0.01) vs 0.97 (0.01), p < 0.001) compared to the control group after adjustment. CONCLUSION: The patients with hyperhidrosis had more central obesity and unfavorable metabolic parameters and a lower EQ-5D index compared with the general population, emphasizing clinical importance of hyperhidrosis to be cured in aspect of metabolic components as well as patients' QOL.","Lee, Yea-Chan; You, Young Kyung; Lee, Jun Hyuk; Moon, Duk Hwan; Lee, Sungsoo; Jeon, Soyoung; Lee, Hye Sun; Lee, Ji-Won",Qual. life res,578,1

Farms are becoming larger and greenhouse growers need to make complex decisions to maximize production and minimize resource use while meeting market requirements. However, highly skilled labor is increasingly lacking in the greenhouse sector. Moreover, extreme events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can make farms temporarily less accessible. This highlights the need for more autonomous and remote-control strategies for greenhouse production. This paper describes and analyzes the results of the second ""Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge"". In this challenge, an experiment was conducted in six high-tech greenhouse compartments during a period of six months of cherry tomato growing. The primary goal of the greenhouse operation was to maximize net profit, by controlling the greenhouse climate and crop with AI techniques. Five international teams with backgrounds in AI and horticulture were challenged in a competition to operate their own compartment remotely. They developed intelligent algorithms and use sensor data to determine climate setpoints and crop management strategy. All AI supported teams outperformed a human-operated greenhouse that served as reference. From the results obtained by the teams and from the analysis of the different climate-crop strategies, it was possible to detect challenges and opportunities for the future implementation of remote-control systems in greenhouse production.","Hemming, Silke; de Zwart, Feije; Elings, Anne; Petropoulou, Anna; Righini, Isabella",Sensors (Basel),578,5

The problem is modelled by a system of six nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of susceptible, exposed, infected and removed individuals. The wellposedness of the suggested model is established in terms of existence, positivity and boundedness of solutions. Four equilibrium points are given, namely the disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 1, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 2, and the last endemic equilibrium with respect to both strains. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functional, the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved depending on the basic reproduction number R 0 . Furthermore, using other appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the global stability results of the endemic equilibria are established depending on the strain 1 reproduction number R 0 1 and the strain 2 reproduction number R 0 2 . Numerical simulations are performed in order to confirm the different theoretical results. It was observed that the model with a generalized incidence functions encompasses a large number of models with classical incidence functions and it gives a significant wide view about the equilibria stability. Numerical comparison between the model results and COVID-19 clinical data was conducted. Good fit of the model to the real clinical data was remarked. The impact of the quarantine strategy on controlling the infection spread is discussed. The generalization of the problem to a more complex compartmental model is illustrated at the end of this paper.","Khyar, Omar; Allali, Karam",Nonlinear Dyn,578,26

The combination of fragile health care systems, large social inequalities, and isolated clinical and research initiatives makes the coordination of efforts imperative. The Latin America and the Caribbean Consortium on Dementia (LAC-CD) is a regional organization overseeing and promoting clinical and research activities on dementia. Here, we first provide an overview of the consortium, highlighting the antecedents and current mission. Then, we present the consortium's regional research, including the multi-partner consortium to expand dementia research in Latin America (ReDLat), which aims to identify the unique genetic, social, and economic factors that drive Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia presentation in LAC relative to the US. We describe an extension of ReDLat which aims to develop affordable markers of disease subtype and severity using high density EEG. We introduce current initiatives promoting regional diagnosis, visibility, and capacity, including the forthcoming launch of the Latin American Brain Health Institute (BrainLat). We discuss LAC-CD-led advances in brain health diplomacy, including an assessment of responses to the impact of COVID-19 on people with dementia and examining the knowledge of public policies among experts in the region. Finally, we present the current knowledge-to-action framework, which paves the way for a future regional action plan.

The infection of cells activates proinflammatory substances, causing diffuse alveolar damage, which is the histopathological basis of ARDS. The exudative phase would manifest as ground-glass opacities and consolidation, and the proliferative phase would manifest as a tendency toward a more linear morphology. Both CT and PET/CT findings support the inflammatory character of the lung lesions in the initial phase of the disease and in patients with mild-moderate disease. Severe cases have pulmonary hypoperfusion that is likely due to abnormal alveolar ventilation and perfusion. On the other hand, a prothrombotic state increases the risk of thromboembolic disease through the activation of coagulation and platelet pathways with the production of fibrin degradation products (D-dimer) and consumption of platelets.","Fernández-Pérez, G C; Oñate Miranda, M; Fernández-Rodríguez, P; Velasco Casares, M; Corral de la Calle, M; Franco López, Á; Díez Blanco, M; Cuchat, J M Oñate",Radiologia,578,24

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We asked representative samples in 7 European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, the Netherlands and the UK) about their blood donation activity and motivation to donate using an online survey. We analysed donor turnout during the COVID-19 period descriptively and using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 7122 people that responded to the survey, 1205 (16·9%) blood donors were identified, with 33·8% donating during the first 4-5 months of the COVID-19 period. We observed that around half of donors donated less than normal. The vast majority of donors that did donate made a special effort to do so in response to COVID-19. The majority of donors were also not aware of their blood being tested for COVID-19 antibodies. Although the perceived risk of infection among all respondents whilst donating blood was relatively low, those who anticipated a high risk of infection were much less likely to donate (OR = 0·540; P-value = 0·006). Furthermore, those that were adherent to COVID guidelines were also less likely to donate (OR = 0·583; P-value = 0·000). DISCUSSION: We suggest that blood collection services consider specialist campaigns that focus on the altruistic motivation of donors during the crisis and that they continue to communicate the additional safety measures in place with the aim of reducing the fear of infection whilst donating blood.","Chandler, Torsten; Neumann-Böhme, Sebastian; Sabat, Iryna; Barros, Pedro Pita; Brouwer, Werner; van Exel, Job; Schreyögg, Jonas; Torbica, Aleksandra; Stargardt, Tom",Vox sang,578,15

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. Given a noiseless measurement of the recovered population, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 101 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. With low noise added to the recovered population, accurate state estimates require a lengthening of the temporal baseline of measurements. Estimates of all parameters are sensitive to the contamination, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. The aim of this paper is to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown parameters to a desired precision, in a model with the complexity required to capture important features of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Armstrong, Eve; Runge, Manuela; Gerardin, Jaline",,578,24

Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike-ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.","Conceicao, Carina; Thakur, Nazia; Human, Stacey; Kelly, James T; Logan, Leanne; Bialy, Dagmara; Bhat, Sushant; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Zagrajek, Adrian K; Hollinghurst, Philippa; Varga, Michal; Tsirigoti, Christina; Tully, Matthew; Chiu, Chris; Moffat, Katy; Silesian, Adrian Paul; Hammond, John A; Maier, Helena J; Bickerton, Erica; Shelton, Holly; Dietrich, Isabelle; Graham, Stephen C; Bailey, Dalan",PLoS Biol,578,30

Analysis of the resources for overcoming difficulties by students in connection with the new life experience in the first weeks of self-isolation and distance learning in the context of the COVID- 19 pandemic. Background. The study is focused on identifying the current psychological state, the characteristics of the perception of the world, as well as the strategies and resources of the individual to overcome negative aspects in connection with changes in everyday life. Study design. The study was built in the format of a socio-psychological survey to study the lifestyle and psychological state of students in self-isolation. Research was conducted in the middle of April 2020. Participants. 56 people, residents of Russia (8% of men, 92% of women) from 20-23 years old university students of the 2nd (77%) and 5th (23%) courses of psychological specialties (σaν=21.12, Me=21, SD=1.37). Measurements. The research is based on quantitative and qualitative methodology. We used the method of content analysis for written discourses about the lifestyle in connection with self-isolation and the SAN method, which allows one to draw conclusions about the degree of psycho-emotional state. Results. Lifestyle changes were recorded by 93% of respondents. The most transformed spheres are activity (educational) and social. The spatio-temporal characteristics of life are of great importance. Assessments of negative and positive changes show parity. Minor manifestations of anxiety and negative emotional states were revealed. The average and medium-high level of psychoemotional state was recorded. Conclusions. Resources for overcoming difficulties are represented by strategies: 1) ""I"": comprehension, self-organization, maintaining physical fitness, self-development;2) ""Others"": help, emotional support for loved ones and strangers;3) ""Living space"": working with the space of the house for arrangement under his ""I"", expanding its multifunctionality, maintaining cleanliness. © 2021 Moscow State University of Psychology and Education.

The growing volume of social media posts has led to an increased usage of modern machine learning methods in natural language processing. While the rapid dynamics of social media can capture underlying trends quickly, it also poses a technical problem: algorithms trained on annotated data in the past may underperform when applied to contemporary data. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, can be particularly problematic when rapid shifts occur either in the topic of interest itself, or in the way the topic is discussed. Here, we explore the effect of machine learning concept drift by focussing on vaccine sentiments expressed on Twitter, a topic of central importance especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. We show that while vaccine sentiment has declined considerably during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, algorithms trained on pre-pandemic data would have largely missed this decline due to concept drift. Our results suggest that social media analysis systems must address concept drift in a continuous fashion in order to avoid the risk of systematic misclassification of data, which is particularly likely during a crisis when the underlying data can change suddenly and rapidly.","Muller, Martin; Salath'e, Marcel",,578,16

In mid-March, medical schools suspended all clinical rotations for the remainder of the 2019-2020 academic year. As such, third-year medical students may not be able to complete sufficient clinical experiences to make important career choices before they have to submit their residency applications. While the decision to suspend clinical rotations was necessary to protect students, specialty organizations and residency programs must mitigate the deficits in students' clinical education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.In this Perspective, the authors identify potential challenges for third-year medical students and advocate for solutions to improve the residency application process for students and programs. First, they propose delaying the date that programs can access applicant data through the Electronic Residency Application Service, thereby affording students more time to complete clinical experiences, solidify their specialty decision, and strengthen their residency application. Second, the authors recommend a restriction on the number of visiting rotations that students are expected to complete to allow for a more equitable distribution of these important experiences. Third, they suggest that program directors from each specialty agree on a maximum number of applications per applicant (based on historical data) to curb an upsurge in applications that may stem from the unique circumstances created by COVID-19 without causing applicants undue stress. Lastly, the authors advocate that residency programs develop infrastructure to conduct video-based interviews and engage students through virtual networking events.Amidst the unique environment created by COVID-19, the authors urge governing bodies, specialty organizations, and residency programs to consider these recommendations to improve the efficiency and reduce the stress surrounding the 2021 Match.","Gabrielson, Andrew T; Kohn, Jaden R; Sparks, Hayley T; Clifton, Marisa M; Kohn, Taylor P",Acad Med,578,30

Increases in opioid use, emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid-related overdoses, and opioid overdose deaths have been reported. No study has examined changes in multiple naloxone administrations, an indicator of overdose severity, during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study examines changes in the occurrence of naloxone administrations and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, North Carolina (NC). METHODS: Using a period-over-period approach, we compared the occurrence of opioid-related EMS runs, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during the 29-week period before (September 1, 2019, to March 9, 2020) and after NC's COVID-19 state of emergency declaration (ie, the COVID-19 period of March 10 to September 30, 2020). Furthermore, historical data were used to generate a quasi-control distribution of period-over-period changes to compare the occurrence of each outcome during the COVID-19 period to each 29-week period back to January 1, 2014. RESULTS: All outcomes increased during the COVID-19 period. Compared to the previous 29 weeks, the COVID-19 period experienced increases in the weekly mean number of opioid-related EMS runs (25.6, SD 5.6 vs 18.6, SD 6.6; P<.001), naloxone administrations (22.3, SD 6.2 vs 14.1, SD 6.0; P<.001), and multiple naloxone administrations (5.0, SD 1.9 vs 2.7, SD 1.9; P<.001), corresponding to proportional increases of 37.4%, 57.8%, and 84.8%, respectively. Additionally, the increases during the COVID-19 period were greater than 91% of all historical 29-week periods analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of EMS runs for opioid-related overdoses, naloxone administrations, and multiple naloxone administrations during EMS runs increased during the COVID-19 pandemic in Guilford County, NC. For a host of reasons that need to be explored, the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have exacerbated the opioid crisis.","Khoury, Dalia; Preiss, Alexander; Geiger, Paul; Anwar, Mohd; Conway, Kevin Paul",JMIR Public Health Surveill,578,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We queried the COVID-19 Research Network, a multinational database using the TriNetX network, to identify patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. The main end point of the study was all-cause mortality. RESULTS: A total of 14,712 patients were included, of whom 6387 (43%) were men. Men were older (mean age, 55.0±17.7 years vs 51.1±17.9 years; P<.001) and had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, coronary disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, nicotine dependence, and heart failure but a lower prevalence of obesity.

Phosphorus-rich foods are prevalent in the American diet, and low-phosphorus foods, including fruits and vegetables, are often less available in areas with more poverty. The relative contributions of neighborhood food availability and socioeconomic status to phosphorus control in patients receiving dialysis are unknown. METHODS: Using longitudinal data from a national dialysis provider, we constructed hierarchical, linear mixed-effects models to evaluate the relationships between neighborhood food environment or socioeconomic status and serum phosphorus level among patients receiving incident dialysis. RESULTS: Our cohort included 258,510 patients receiving chronic hemodialysis in 2005-2013. Median age at dialysis initiation was 64 years, 45% were female, 32% were Black, and 15% were Hispanic. Within their residential zip code, patients had a median of 25 ""less-healthy"" food outlets (interquartile range, 11-40) available to them compared with a median of four ""healthy"" food outlets (interquartile range, 2-6). Living in a neighborhood with better availability of healthy food was not associated with a lower phosphorus level. Neighborhood income also was not associated with differences in phosphorus. Patient age, race, cause of ESKD, and mean monthly dialysis duration were most closely associated with phosphorus level. CONCLUSIONS: Neither neighborhood availability of healthy food options nor neighborhood income was associated with phosphorus levels in patients receiving chronic dialysis. Modifying factors, such as nutrition literacy, individual-level financial resources, and adherence to diet restrictions and medications, may be more powerful contributors than food environment to elevated phosphorus.","Potluri, Vishnu S; Sawinski, Deirdre; Tam, Vicky; Shults, Justine; Cohen, Jordana B; Wiebe, Douglas J; Shah, Siddharth P; Berns, Jeffrey S; Reese, Peter P",J.

We undertook this study to identify the factors associated with adverse outcomes in patients with CLD who acquire the novel coronavirus-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, observational cohort study across 21 institutions in the United States (US) of adult patients with CLD and laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and May 30, 2020. We performed survival analysis to identify independent predictors of all-cause mortality and COVID-19 related mortality, and multivariate logistic regression to determine the risk of severe COVID-19 in patients with CLD. RESULTS: Of the 978 patients in our cohort, 867 patients (mean age 56.9±14.5 years, 55% male) met inclusion criteria. The overall all-cause mortality was 14.0% (n = 121), and 61.7% (n = 535) had severe COVID-19. Patients presenting with diarrhea or nausea/vomiting were more likely to have severe COVID-19. The liver-specific factors associated with independent risk of higher overall mortality were alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-4.55), decompensated cirrhosis (HR 2.91 [1.70-5.00]) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (HR 3.31 [1.53-7.16]). Other factors were increasing age, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and current smoker. Hispanic ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 2.33 [1.47-3.70]) and decompensated cirrhosis (OR 2.50 [1.20-5.21]) were independently associated with risk for severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: The risk factors which predict higher overall mortality among patients with CLD and COVID-19 are ALD, decompensated cirrhosis and HCC. Hispanic ethnicity and decompensated cirrhosis are associated with severe COVID-19. Our results will enable risk stratification and personalization of the management of patients with CLD and COVID-19.

This study aims to assess how oncological disease impacts on the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1st March to 30th April 2020, 96 COVID-19 patients were classified according to clinical outcome as severe (n=67) and moderate (n=29). Demographic data, medical history, admission lymphocytes, procalcitonin (PCT), c-reactive-protein (CRP), D-dimer, and Interleukin-6 (IL-6) were collected. RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found between hypertension (p=0.007) and three or more comorbidities with severe outcomes (p=0.034). No statistical differences were found between the severe and moderate groups with regards to the rate of patients with past oncological history. However, no patient allocated in the moderate group had received oncological treatment within 12 months. Higher values of CRP, IL-6, D-Dimer and lower values of lymphocytes were reported in the severe group (p=0.0007, p=0.00386, p=0.041, and p=0.007, respectively). Using binary logistic regression, higher values of CRP (OR=8.861; p=0.012) and PCT were associated with a higher risk of severe outcome (OR=21.075; p=0.008). Within the oncological population, D-Dimer and IL-6 did not confirm their prognostic significance as in the general population (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Specific prognostic factors for oncological patients should be designed for COVID-19 clinical practice.","Vanni, Gianluca; Materazzo, Marco; Dauri, Mario; Farinaccio, Andrea; Buonomo, Chiara; Portarena, Ilaria; Pellicciaro, Marco; Legramante, Jacopo Maria; Rizza, Stefano; Chiaramonte, Carlo; Bellia, Alfonso; Grande, Michele; Potenza, Saverio; Sbordone, Francesco Paolo; Perrone, Marco Alfonso; Grimaldi, Francesco; Chiocchi, Marcello; Buonomo, Oreste Claudio",Anticancer Res,578,10

We consolidate and generalise a class of semi-metric distance measures, which we term MJ distances. Experiments on simulated data demonstrate that our proposed family of distances uncover similarity within collections of time series more effectively than measures such as the Hausdorff and Wasserstein metrics. Although our class of distances do not necessarily satisfy the triangle inequality requirement of a metric, we analyse the transitivity properties of respective distance matrices in various contextual scenarios. There, we demonstrate a trade-off between robust performance in the presence of outliers, and the triangle inequality property. We show in experiments using real data that the contrived scenarios that severely violate the transitivity property rarely exhibit themselves in real data; instead, our family of measures satisfies all the properties of a metric most of the time. We illustrate three ways of analysing the distance and similarity matrices, via eigenvalue analysis, hierarchical clustering, and spectral clustering. The results from our hierarchical and spectral clustering experiments on simulated data demonstrate that the Hausdorff and Wasserstein metrics may lead to erroneous inference as to which time series are most similar with respect to their structural breaks, while our semi-metrics provide an improvement.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Azizi, Lamiae; Chan, Jennifer",,578,24

However, the detection of one gene at high Cycle threshold (Ct) has to be interpreted with caution. In this study we address this specific issue and report our real-life experience. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1639 nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were analyzed with Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2. Positive samples showing high Ct values (Ct>35) were concentrated by centrifugation and re-tested with Cepheid or other methods (RealStar SARS-CoV2 RT-PCR, Altona Diagnostics; GeneFinder COVID-19 Plus RealAmp Kit, Elitech). RESULTS: 1599 (97.5%) negative samples, 36 (2.3%) positive samples and 4 (0.2%) presumptive positive samples were detected. In 17 out of 36 positive patients, very low viral RNA copies were suspected since positivity was detected at high Ct. We confirmed positivity for patients who showed both E and N genes detected and for patients with only N detected but with Ct <39. On the contrary, samples with only gene N detected with Ct values >39 were found negative. NPS taken 24 hours after the first collection confirmed the negativity of the 12 samples. Clinical data sustained these results since only 2 of these 12 patients showed COVID-19-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data support our consideration that detection of the N2 gene at high Ct needs to be interpreted with caution, suggesting that collaboration between virologists and clinicians is important for better understanding of results.","Falasca, Francesca; Sciandra, Ilaria; Di Carlo, Daniele; Gentile, Massimo; Deales, Alberto; Antonelli, Guido; Turriziani, Ombretta",J Clin Virol,578,16

We herein examined LUS patterns in relation to disease severity and disease stage among patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series analysis of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to the hospital because of pneumonia. We recorded history, clinical parameters and medications. LUS was performed and scored in a standardized fashion by experienced operators, with evaluation of up to 12 lung fields, reporting especially on B-lines and consolidations. RESULTS: We included 96 patients, 58.3% men, with a mean age of 65.9 years. Patients with a high-risk quick COVID-19 severity index (qCSI) were older and had worse outcomes, especially for the need for high-flow oxygen. B-lines and consolidations were located mainly in the lower posterior lung fields. LUS patterns for B-lines and consolidations were significantly worse in all lung fields among patients with high versus low qCSI. B-lines and consolidations were worse in the intermediate disease stage, from day 7 to 13 after onset of symptoms. While consolidations correlated more with inflammatory biomarkers, B-lines correlated more with end-organ damage, including extrapulmonary involvement. CONCLUSIONS: LUS patterns provide a comprehensive evaluation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia that correlated with severity and dynamically reflect disease stage. LUS patterns may reflect different pathophysiological processes related to inflammation or tissue damage; consolidations may represent a more specific sign of localized disease, whereas B-lines seem to be also dependent upon generalized illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Senter, Riccardo; Capone, Federico; Pasqualin, Stefano; Cerruti, Lorenzo; Molinari, Leonardo; Fonte Basso, Elisa; Zanforlin, Nicolò; Previato, Lorenzo; Toffolon, Alessandro; Sensi, Caterina; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Gorgi, Davide; Ippolito, Renato; Nessi, Enrico; Pettenella, Pietro; Cellini, Andrea; Fossa, Claudio; Vania, Eleonora; Gardin, Samuele; Sukthi, Andi; Luise, Dora; Giordani, Maria Teresa; Zanatta, Mirko; Savino, Sandro; Cianci, Vito; Sattin, Andrea; Maria, Anna; Vianello, Andrea; Pesavento, Raffaele; Giannini, Sandro; Avogaro, Angelo; Vettor, Roberto; Fadini, Gian Paolo; Saller, Alois",,578,16

Here, we combined various cutting-edge modelling tools with the recently resolved SARS-CoV-2 cryo-EM polymerase structures to fill this gap in knowledge. Our findings provide a detailed analysis of the hydrogen bond networks at various parts of the polymerase structure and suggest possible nucleotides' substitutions that can be tolerated by the polymerase complex. We also report here three 'druggable' allosteric sites within the NSP12 RdRp that can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors. Our correlated motion analysis shows that the dynamics within one of the newly identified sites are linked to the active site, indicating that targeting this site can significantly impact the catalytic activity of the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

The aim of this study is to establish a theoretical model for graft size calculations for deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty and evaluate its efficacy for preventing Descemet's membrane folds. METHODS: We calculated the arc diameter of the recipient bed by using the cosine formula and developed a table to aid surgeons in donor punch size selection. To test the usefulness of this formula, we evaluated the development of Descemet's membrane folds in keratoconus patients with very steep corneas (K >60 D). In group 1, deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty surgeries were performed using graft sizes that were determined based on our model (n=31). In group 2, graft sizes were determined based on the empirical judgment of the surgeon without any formal calculation (n=30). RESULTS: Our theoretical calculations demonstrated that the diameter of donor punch sizes needed to prevent Descemet's membrane fold increases when the cornea is steeper, or the trephine size is larger. We tested the efficacy of this model on the clinical outcome of deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty. The mean age (28.9 ± 10.1 years vs. 32.8 ± 8.3 years, p=0.11) and preoperative K1 (59.2 ± 9.3 D vs. 58.1 ± 9.4 D, p=0.67), K2 (66.2 ± 6.0 D vs. 65.7 ± 7.4 D, p=0.81), and Km values (62.1 ± 7.7 D vs. 61.8 ± 8.1 D, p=0.88) were similar between the two groups. Three patients developed Descemet's membrane folds in group 2, and none of the patients developed Descemet's membrane folds in group 1. These results supported our theo retical calculations. CONCLUSION: Adjustment of donor graft size based on the calculated arc diameter of the recipient bed reduced the development of Descemet's membrane folds after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty in steep corneas.","Genc, Selim; Esen, Fehim; Guler, Emre; Çakir, Hanefi",Arq Bras Oftalmol,578,20

The most common species causing pulmonary disease are members of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). MAC pulmonary disease (MAC-PD) can be chronic, debilitating, costly, and associated with a high mortality. However, MAC diagnoses are often delayed due to the nonspecific presentation of MAC-PD and radiological findings that overlap with other pulmonary diseases. Patients with risk factors and who meet the diagnostic criteria-which include clinical, radiological, and microbiologic criteria-should be considered for treatment. Diagnosis requires 2 or more positive sputum cultures or 1 bronchoscopic specimen culture. The recommendation for those who are treated is a 3-drug regimen including macrolide, rifamycin, and ethambutol that is continued for 12 months beyond sputum culture conversion to negative. MAC-PD is difficult to treat, with frequent drug-related side effects and suboptimal treatment outcomes. Refractory and recurrent disease is common, leading to lifelong follow-up of patients. There are limited treatment options for patients with macrolide-resistant or refractory disease. Amikacin liposome inhalation suspension is recommended for treatment-refractory patients whose cultures remain positive after 6 months of guideline-based therapy. Among the research priorities to improve patient outcomes and quality of life are developing new, more rapid diagnostic tests, investigating biomarkers associated with disease progression, and identifying new drugs and routes of administration as well as new, shorter, and better-tolerated regimens.","Daley, Charles L; Winthrop, Kevin L",J Infect Dis,578,4

Past research highlights that sustainability and luxury may be paradoxical, due to a lack of information on material adoption. Yet, sustainable luxury products are positively perceived by consumers, who see luxury and sustainability as compatible. Material innovations can enhance this perception further, which requires careful communication strategies. Sustainability communication enables companies to broadcast material innovations through a manifold channel. Luxury brands predominantly communicate these innovations through official websites, as it is often the first touchpoint between consumers and the brand. This article addresses a knowledge gap on how to communicate sustainable luxury in an effec-tive and efficient manner, by focusing on material innovations that are increasing in popularity in the sector. This article explores the role of corporate websites in communicating material innovations based on two luxury brands.

They provide individuals with alternative scenarios and a set of recommendations to achieve a sought-after machine learning model outcome. Recently, the literature has identified desiderata of counterfactual explanations, such as feasibility, actionability and sparsity that should support their applicability in real-world contexts. However, we show that the literature has neglected the problem of the time dependency of counterfactual explanations. We argue that, due to their time dependency and because of the provision of recommendations, even feasible, actionable and sparse counterfactual explanations may not be appropriate in real-world applications. This is due to the possible emergence of what we call""unfortunate counterfactual events.""These events may occur due to the retraining of machine learning models whose outcomes have to be explained via counterfactual explanation. Series of unfortunate counterfactual events frustrate the efforts of those individuals who successfully implemented the recommendations of counterfactual explanations. This negatively affects people's trust in the ability of institutions to provide machine learning-supported decisions consistently. We introduce an approach to address the problem of the emergence of unfortunate counterfactual events that makes use of histories of counterfactual explanations. In the final part of the paper we propose an ethical analysis of two distinct strategies to cope with the challenge of unfortunate counterfactual events. We show that they respond to an ethically responsible imperative to preserve the trustworthiness of credit lending organizations, the decision models they employ, and the social-economic function of credit lending.","Ferrario, Andrea; Loi, Michele",,578,1

OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to construct an effective model for the early identification of COVID-19 that would also distinguish it from CAP. METHODS: The clinical laboratory indicators (CLIs) of 61 COVID-19 patients and 60 CAP patients were analyzed retrospectively. Random combinations of various CLIs (ie, CLI combinations) were utilized to establish COVID-19 versus CAP classifiers with machine learning algorithms, including random forest classifier (RFC), logistic regression classifier, and gradient boosting classifier (GBC). The performance of the classifiers was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall rate in COVID-19 prediction using the test data set. RESULTS: The classifiers that were constructed with three algorithms from 43 CLI combinations showed high performance (recall rate >0.9 and AUROC >0.85) in COVID-19 prediction for the test data set. Among the high-performance classifiers, several CLIs showed a high usage rate; these included procalcitonin (PCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), uric acid, albumin, albumin to globulin ratio (AGR), neutrophil count, red blood cell (RBC) count, monocyte count, basophil count, and white blood cell (WBC) count. They also had high feature importance except for basophil count. The feature combination (FC) of PCT, AGR, uric acid, WBC count, neutrophil count, basophil count, RBC count, and MCHC was the representative one among the nine FCs used to construct the classifiers with an AUROC equal to 1.0 when using the RFC or GBC algorithms. Replacing any CLI in these FCs would lead to a significant reduction in the performance of the classifiers that were built with them. CONCLUSIONS: The classifiers constructed with only a few specific CLIs could efficiently distinguish COVID-19 from CAP, which could help clinicians perform early isolation and centralized management of COVID-19 patients.","Dai, Wanfa; Ke, Pei-Feng; Li, Zhen-Zhen; Zhuang, Qi-Zhen; Huang, Wei; Wang, Yi; Xiong, Yujuan; Huang, Xian-Zhang",J Med Internet Res,578,6

This suggests a disparity in the accessibility of appropriate healthcare for autistic individuals. To improve access, barriers the autism community experience in healthcare first need to be identified. This paper aimed to: 1) develop and evaluate a caregiver-report tool; 2) identify barriers to physical healthcare for autistic individuals; and 3) identify potential contributing factors. METHODS: A previously established taxonomy of barriers to healthcare for autistic individuals informed the development of the tool; this was then distributed to caregivers of autistic adults and children. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) assessed validity and reliability of the tool. Multiple Regressions were performed to identify predictors of barriers. RESULTS: In total, caregivers of 194 autistic children or adults participated in the study. The EFA produced four factors: 1) patient-level barriers; 2) healthcare provider-level (HCP) barriers; 3) healthcare system-level barriers; and 4) barriers related to managing healthcare. The greatest barriers included difficulties with identifying/reporting symptoms (endorsed by 62.4% of participants); difficulties handling the waiting area (60.3% of participants); and a lack of HCP knowledge regarding autism (52.1% of participants). Autism severity, general adjustment problems, anxiety, age and having unmet needs predicted the frequency and/or severity of barriers. CONCLUSIONS: A tool that allows assessment of patient-, HCP-, and system-level barriers to healthcare was developed and evaluated. Patient-level barriers appear to occur frequently and pose substantial challenges. This tool will help identify areas most in need of intervention and support intervention evaluation.","Walsh, C.; Lydon, S.; Hehir, A.; O’Connor, P.",Res Autism Spectr Disord,578,7

We report the case of a 33-year-old woman who was mistakenly diagnosed with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) during childhood. The patient was referred to our center with dyspnea, fatigue, fever, and jaundice with no clinical bleeding. Laboratory features were compatible with MAHA; ADAMTS-13 activity was at 0%, with negativity for ADAMTS-13 antibodies. We concluded the final diagnosis was cTTP. The triggering factor identified for MAHA was a double infection: central venous catheter bacterial infection and atypical pneumonia. After 7 days of treatment with antibiotics and ongoing total plasma exchange (TPE), the patient responded favorably. Our patient received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) infusion once every 2 weeks, and prophylactic voriconazole remained under control at the time of writing. As demonstrated in this case, effective treatment of the trigger cause helps reduce the need for continuous FFP exposure and controls the MAHA.","Lozano Jaramillo, Diego Alberto; Jimenez Ochoa, Marco Alejandro",J Med Cases,578,14

Lack of a vaccine or optimized intervention raised the importance of characterizing risk factors and symptoms for the early identification and successful treatment of patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate and analyze biomedical literature and public social media data to understand the association of risk factors and symptoms with the various outcomes observed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Through semantic analysis, we collected 45 retrospective cohort studies, which evaluated 303 clinical and demographic variables across 13 different outcomes of patients with COVID-19, and 84,140 Twitter posts from 1036 COVID-19–positive users. Machine learning tools to extract biomedical information were introduced to identify mentions of uncommon or novel symptoms in tweets. We then examined and compared two data sets to expand our landscape of risk factors and symptoms related to COVID-19. RESULTS: From the biomedical literature, approximately 90% of clinical and demographic variables showed inconsistent associations with COVID-19 outcomes. Consensus analysis identified 72 risk factors that were specifically associated with individual outcomes. From the social media data, 51 symptoms were characterized and analyzed. By comparing social media data with biomedical literature, we identified 25 novel symptoms that were specifically mentioned in tweets but have been not previously well characterized. Furthermore, there were certain combinations of symptoms that were frequently mentioned together in social media. CONCLUSIONS: Identified outcome-specific risk factors, symptoms, and combinations of symptoms may serve as surrogate indicators to identify patients with COVID-19 and predict their clinical outcomes in order to provide appropriate treatments.","Jeon, Jouhyun; Baruah, Gaurav; Sarabadani, Sarah; Palanica, Adam",J Med Internet Res,578,5

PURPOSE: To identify psychosocial determinants (attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control) of COVID-19 vaccination intentions for U.S. White, Black, and Hispanic adults, and how COVID-19 misperceptions, beliefs about the value of science, and perceived media bias relate to these determinants. METHODS: Longitudinal online survey using two national samples (18-49 years old/50 years and older), each stratified by racial/ethnic group (n = 3,190). Data were collected in October/November 2020 and were weighted by race group to be representative. RESULTS: Path analyses showed that more positive attitudes about getting vaccinated predict intention across age and racial/ethnic groups, but normative pressure is relevant among older adults only. Belief in the value of science was positively associated with most determinants across all groups, however the association of COVID-19 misperceptions and perceived media bias with the determinants varied by age group. CONCLUSIONS: Messages that emphasize attitudes toward vaccination can be targeted to all age and racial/ethnic groups, and positive attitudes are universally related to a belief in the value of science.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of chronic alcohol consumption on lung injury and clarify the signaling pathways involved in the inhibition of alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). In order to produce rodent models with chronic alcohol consumption, wild-type C57BL/6 mice were treated with alcohol. A2a adenosine receptor (AR) small interfering (si)RNA or A2bAR siRNA were transfected into the lung tissue of mice and primary rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells. The rate of AFC in lung tissue was measured during exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) expression was determined to investigate the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced regulation of AFC. In the present study, exposure to alcohol reduced AFC, exacerbated pulmonary edema and worsened LPS-induced lung injury. Alcohol caused a decrease in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels and inhibited α-ENaC, β-ENaC and γ-ENaC expression levels in the lung tissue of mice and ATII cells. Furthermore, alcohol decreased α-ENaC, β-ENaC and γ-ENaC expression levels via the A2aAR or A2bAR-cAMP signaling pathways in vitro. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that chronic alcohol consumption worsened lung injury by aggravating pulmonary edema and impairing AFC. An alcohol-induced decrease of α-ENaC, β-ENaC and γ-ENaC expression levels by the A2AR-mediated cAMP pathway may be responsible for the exacerbated effects of chronic alcohol consumption in lung injury.","Deng, Wang; He, Jing; Tang, Xu-Mao; Li, Chang-Yi; Tong, Jin; Qi, Di; Wang, Dao-Xin",Mol Med Rep,578,1

METHODS: Clinical specimens, including throat swabs, sputum or tracheal aspirates, etc., were obtained from patients exhibiting influenza-like illness (ILIs), especially from those having pneumonia and a history of occupational exposure to poultry and wild birds. RNA was extracted from these samples and a multiplex one-step real-time RT-PCR assay was developed to specifically detect the influenza A virus (FluA). PCR primers targeted the conserved M and Rnase P (RP) genes, as well as the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the H7N9 virus. RESULTS: The multiplex assay specifically detected the avian H7N9 virus, and no cross-reaction with other common respiratory pathogens was observed. The detection limit of the assay was approximately 0.05 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID(50)), or 100 copies per reaction. Positive detection of the H7N9 virus in sputum/tracheal aspirates was higher than in throat swabs during the surveillance of patients with ILIs. Additionally, detection of the matrix (M) and Rnase P genes aided in the determination of the novel avian H7N9 virus and ensured the quality of the clinical samples. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the multiplex assay detected the novel avian H7N9 virus with high specificity and sensitivity, which is essential for the early diagnosis and treatment of infected patients.

Although vaccines are available, PRRSV remains a major threat to the pig farms. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop antiviral drugs to compensate for vaccines. In this study, we report that Aloe extract (Ae) can strongly inhibit PRRSV in Marc-145 cells and porcine alveolar macrophages lines (iPAMs) in vitro. Furthermore, we identified a novel anti-PRRSV molecule, Emodin, from Ae by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Emodin exerted its inhibitory effect through targeting the whole stages of PRRSV infectious cycle. Moreover, we also found that Emodin can inactivate PRRSV particles directly. Notably, we confirmed that Emodin was able to significantly induce Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) (p < 0.01), IFN-α (p < 0.05) and IFN-β expression in iPAMs, indicating that induction of antiviral agents via TLR3 activation by Emodin might contribute to its anti-PRRSV effect. These findings imply that the Emodin from Aloe could hamper the proliferation of PRRSV in vitro and might constitute a new approach for treating PRRSV infection.","Xu, Zhichao; Huang, Meiyan; Xia, Yongbo; Peng, Peng; Zhang, Yun; Zheng, Shumei; Wang, Xiaowei; Xue, Chunyi; Cao, Yongchang",Viruses,578,28

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a substantial health concern as it is one of the leading causes of viral encephalitis in the United States today. WNV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS), where it directly infects neurons and induces neuronal cell death, in part, via activation of caspase 3-mediated apoptosis. WNV infection also induces neuroinflammation characterized by activation of innate immune cells, including microglia and astrocytes, production of inflammatory cytokines, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and infiltration of peripheral leukocytes. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and monitor the CNS for signs of injury or pathogens. Following infection with WNV, microglia exhibit a change in morphology consistent with activation and are associated with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Recent research has focused on deciphering the role of microglia during WNV encephalitis. Microglia play a protective role during infections by limiting viral growth and reducing mortality in mice. However, it also appears that activated microglia are triggered by T cells to mediate synaptic elimination at late times during infection, which may contribute to long-term neurological deficits following a neuroinvasive WNV infection. This review will discuss the important role of microglia in the pathogenesis of a neuroinvasive WNV infection. Knowledge of the precise role of microglia during a WNV infection may lead to a greater ability to treat and manage WNV encephalitis.","Stonedahl, Sarah; Clarke, Penny; Tyler, Kenneth L.",Vaccines (Basel),578,1

Mortalities can reach 100% and have resulted in an 80% decline in the number of hatcheries actively producing M. rosenbergii. To investigate a causative agent for the mortalities, a disease challenge was carried out using infected material from a hatchery experiencing mortalities. Moribund larvae from the challenge were prepared for metatranscriptomic sequencing. De novo virus assembly revealed a 29 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with similarities in key protein motif sequences to yellow head virus (YHV), an RNA virus that causes mass mortalities in marine shrimp aquaculture, and other viruses in the Nidovirales order. Primers were designed against the novel virus and used to screen cDNA from larvae sampled from hatcheries in the South of Bangladesh from two consecutive years. Larvae from all hatcheries screened from both years were positive by PCR for the novel virus, including larvae from a hatchery that at the point of sampling appeared healthy, but later experienced mortalities. These screens suggest that the virus is widespread in M. rosenbergii hatchery culture in southern Bangladesh, and that early detection of the virus can be achieved by PCR. The hypothesised protein motifs of Macrobrachium rosenbergii golda virus (MrGV) suggest that it is likely to be a new species within the Nidovirales order.

The predictor significance order of variants on FCQ score β values is as follows: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (β=0.774), before pandemic FCQ (β=0.601), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) (β=−0.268), before pandemic BMI(a) (β=−0.223), during pandemic BMI(b) (β=0.073), and age (β=−0.013). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic, making applications such as quarantine in pandemic processes has successful results in being able to combat its. However, undesirable conditions such as stress can have serious negative consequences on other health measurements. It was observed in the results of this study that excessive eating food desire developed in people with obesity.","Bayram Deger, Vasfiye",Diabetes Metab Syndr Obes,578,16

Contrary to most price-driven trade models in the literature, the relation-driven agent-based global trade model focuses on the role of relational factors such as trust, familiarity, trade history and conflicts in countries' trade behaviour. Moreover, the global trade model is linked to a comprehensive nutrition formula to investigate the impact of trade on food and nutrition security, including macro and micronutrients. Preliminary results show that global trade improves the food and nutrition security of countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Trade also promotes a healthier and more balanced diet, as countries have access to an increased variety of food. The effect of trade in enhancing nutrition security, with an adequate supply of macro and micronutrients, is universal across nutrients and countries. As researchers call for a holistic and multifactorial approach to food security and climate change (Hammond and Dubé 2012 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 109, 12 356–12 363. (doi:10.1073/pnas.0913003109)), the paper is one of the first to develop an integrated framework that consists of socio-economic, geopolitical, nutrition, environmental and agri-food systems to tackle these global challenges. Given the ongoing events of Brexit, the US–China trade war and the global COVID-19 pandemic, the paper will provide valuable insights on the role of trade in improving the food and nutrition security across countries.","Ge, Jiaqi; Polhill, J.

COVID-19 hits greatly the elder and more fragile fraction of the population boosting the evergreen issue of the vaccination of older people. The development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 tailored for the elderly population faces the challenge of the poor immune responsiveness of the older population due to immunosenescence, comorbidities, and pharmacological treatments. Moreover, it is likely that the inflammaging phenotype associated with age could both influence vaccination efficacy and exacerbate the risk of COVID-19-related “cytokine storm syndrome” with an overlap between the factors which impact vaccination effectiveness and those that boost virulence and worsen the prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The complex and still unclear immunopathological mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with the progressive age-related decline of immune responses, and the lack of clear correlates of protection, make the design of vaccination strategies for older people extremely challenging. In the ongoing effort in vaccine development, different SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates have been developed, tested in pre-clinical and clinical studies and are undergoing clinical testing, but only a small fraction of these are currently being tested in the older fraction of the population. Recent advances in systems biology integrating clinical, immunologic, and omics data can help to identify stable and robust markers of vaccine response and move towards a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine responses in the elderly.","Ciabattini, Annalisa; Garagnani, Paolo; Santoro, Francesco; Rappuoli, Rino; Franceschi, Claudio; Medaglini, Donata",Semin Immunopathol,578,5

One hundred eighty‐three lambs in the first 15–20 days of life, from eight Merino sheep farms located in the region of La Serena, south‐west Spain, were used in this experiment. Scouring and normal/control lambs were selected following a clinical examination, the scouring group was further divided into subgroups, specifically those that did or did not survive 72 h following treatment. At the time of the clinical examination, faecal and blood samples were taken. Faecal culture and commercial faecal antigen tests for detection of enteropathogens in faeces and serum endotoxin measurement using chromogenic lymulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) were carried out. Scouring lambs received 0.07 mg/kg liveweight halofuginone once a day for 3 days, a single oral dose of 0.20 mg/kg liveweight of spectinomycin and oral rehydration fluid. The pathogens isolated were Cryptosporidium spp. and Escherichia coli. The case fatality rate was 51% in the scouring lambs. Postmortem findings were consistent with enterotoxigenic E. coli infection. The concentration of endotoxin was 0.18 ± 0.12 ng/ml in the control group, 0.35 ± 0.17 ng/ml in the surviving lambs and 0.46 ± 0.14 ng/ml in the non‐surviving lambs. Significant differences between groups were found. Case fatality rate of the scouring lambs with endotoxaemia below 0.30 ng/ml was 0%, while it was 100% above 0.50 ng/ml. These results may be utilized as a prognostic indicator in lambs affected by E. coli and Cryptosporidium that will help aid in decision‐making as to whether to treat a lamb or not based on its chances of survival.","Jiménez, A.; Sánchez, J.; Andrés, S.; Alonso, J.

The aim of this study was to assess whether chronic lung disease or use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) affects the risk of contracting severe COVID-19. METHODS: In this population cohort study, records from 1205 general practices in England that contribute to the QResearch database were linked to Public Health England's database of SARS-CoV-2 testing and English hospital admissions, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths for COVID-19. All patients aged 20 years and older who were registered with one of the 1205 general practices on Jan 24, 2020, were included in this study. With Cox regression, we examined the risks of COVID-19-related hospitalisation, admission to ICU, and death in relation to respiratory disease and use of ICS, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic status and comorbidities associated with severe COVID-19. FINDINGS: Between Jan 24 and April 30, 2020, 8 256 161 people were included in the cohort and observed, of whom 14 479 (0·2%) were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 1542 (<0·1%) were admitted to ICU, and 5956 (0·1%) died. People with some respiratory diseases were at an increased risk of hospitalisation (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD] hazard ratio [HR] 1·54 [95% CI 1·45–1·63], asthma 1·18 [1·13–1·24], severe asthma 1·29 [1·22–1·37; people on three or more current asthma medications], bronchiectasis 1·34 [1·20–1·50], sarcoidosis 1·36 [1·10–1·68], extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·35 [0·82–2·21], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·59 [1·30–1·95], other interstitial lung disease 1·66 [1·30–2·12], and lung cancer 2·24 [1·89–2·65]) and death (COPD 1·54 [1·42–1·67], asthma 0·99 [0·91–1·07], severe asthma 1·08 [0·98–1·19], bronchiectasis 1·12 [0·94–1·33], sarcoidosis 1·41 [0·99–1·99), extrinsic allergic alveolitis 1·56 [0·78–3·13], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 1·47 [1·12–1·92], other interstitial lung disease 2·05 [1·49–2·81], and lung cancer 1·77 [1·37–2·29]) due to COVID-19 compared with those without these diseases. Admission to ICU was rare, but the HR for people with asthma was 1·08 (0·93–1·25) and severe asthma was 1·30 (1·08–1·58). In a post-hoc analysis, relative risks of severe COVID-19 in people with respiratory disease were similar before and after shielding was introduced on March 23, 2020. In another post-hoc analysis, people with two or more prescriptions for ICS in the 150 days before study start were at a slightly higher risk of severe COVID-19 compared with all other individuals (ie, no or one ICS prescription): HR 1·13 (1·03–1·23) for hospitalisation, 1·63 (1·18–2·24) for ICU admission, and 1·15 (1·01–1·31) for death. INTERPRETATION: The risk of severe COVID-19 in people with asthma is relatively small. People with COPD and interstitial lung disease appear to have a modestly increased risk of severe disease, but their risk of death from COVID-19 at the height of the epidemic was mostly far lower than the ordinary risk of death from any cause. Use of inhaled steroids might be associated with a modestly increased risk of severe COVID-19.

Years of life lost is therefore widely used as a more relevant metric, however, such calculations in the context of COVID-19 are all biased upwards: patients dying from COVID-19 are typically multimorbid, having far worse life expectation than the general population. These questions are quantitatively investigated using a unique Hungarian dataset that contains individual patient level data on comorbidities for all COVID-19 deaths in the country. To account for the comorbidities of the patients, a parametric survival model using 11 important long-term conditions was used to estimate a more realistic years of life lost. As of 12 May, 2021, Hungary reported a total of 27,837 deaths from COVID-19 in patients above 50 years of age. The usual calculation indicates 10.5 years of life lost for each death, which decreases to 9.2 years per death after adjusting for 11 comorbidities. The expected number of years lost implied by the pre-pandemic life table is 11.1 years. The years of life lost due to COVID-19 in Hungary is therefore 12% or 1.3 years per death lower when accounting for the comorbidities and is below its expected value, but how this should be interpreted is still a matter of debate. Further research is warranted on how to optimally integrate this information into epidemiologic risk assessments during a pandemic.","Ferenci, T.",,578,1

The live virus strains including wild and Sabin strains must be handled in level 3 biocontainment laboratories. To develop an alternative assay without the use of a live virus, we constructed Mahoney, MEF-1, and Saukett pseudovirions by inserting luciferase reporter genes into intact capsid proteins. Afterward, we developed a pseudovirus-based neutralization test (pNT) and evaluated for the specificity and reproducibility. We tested serum samples from a clinical trial on sIPV vaccines by pNT and compared the results with those obtained from conventional neutralization tests (cNT). A strong correlation was observed between two methods, with the correlation coefficients of all three types of IPV vaccines being greater than 0.82 (p < 0.0001). The Geometric Mean Titer (GMT) values obtained by pNT were approximately four times higher than that by cNT, revealing the better sensitivity of pNT. In conclusion, pNT is a safe, rapid and sensitive quantitative assay with the potential of being an alternative for the evaluation of the potency of polio vaccines.","Jiang, Zheng; Liu, Guixiu; Guo-yang, Liao; Sun, Mingbo; Xu, Kangwei; Ying, Zhifang; Wang, Jianfeng; Li, Xuguang; Li, Changgui",Hum Vaccin Immunother,578,16

Development of molecular technologies allowed a better understanding of bronchiolitis aetiology. Results from cohort studies evaluating the association between single, multiple viral infections and clinical outcomes are conflicting. Data on viral bronchiolitis in children were found to be limited in Qatar. This study aimed to determine frequency and seasonal trends of viral pathogens causing acute bronchiolitis, and to explore association between viral pathogens, disease severity and length of stay (LOS). METHODS: This is a retrospective descriptive study, including children admitted in 2010 and 2011 with acute bronchiolitis. Presenting history, physical examination and respiratory viral co-infections as detected by molecular assays were analysed. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 315/369 (85.4%) of included children with single and multiple viruses in 67 and 33% of cases respectively. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most detected virus, accounting for 51.2% followed by rhinovirus (RV) in 25.5% of cases. Fall and summer admissions were associated with longer LOS. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, retraction (OR 3.96; 95% CI 1.64,9.59) and age group 1–3 months (OR 3.09; 95% CI 1.06,9.05) were associated with longer LOS. Crepitation (OR 9.15; 95% CI 1.58,53.13), retraction (OR 4.10; 95% CI 1.05,16.12) and respiratory rate (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.28,1.66) were associated with moderate to severe bronchiolitis. Identifying the viral agent did not influence disease severity or LOS. CONCLUSION: Clinical presentation is of more relevance to LOS and disease severity than the detected viruses. Future studies should investigate the interplay between climate characteristics, population’s factors and the most detectable circulating viruses.

Further avenues for pushing the boundaries of philanthropy research in ways inclusive of the dynamism, diversity, multi-disciplinarity and controversy that characterize the field, while at the same time providing meaningful answers to societal concerns about the potential and shortcomings of new philanthropic practices, are drawn.","von Schnurbein, Georg; Rey-Garcia, Marta; Neumayr, Michaela",Voluntas,578,23

Unfortunately, the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy distance measurement method cannot accurately reflect the difference between membership and non-membership data, where it is easy to cause information confusion. Therefore, from the intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN), this paper constructs a decision-making model based on intuitionistic fuzzy cross-entropy and a comprehensive grey correlation analysis algorithm. For the MAEDM problems of completely unknown and partially known attribute weights, this method establishes a grey correlation analysis algorithm based on the objective evaluation value and subjective preference value of decision makers (DMs), which makes up for the shortcomings of traditional model information loss and greatly improves the accuracy of MAEDM. Finally, taking the Wenchuan Earthquake on May 12th 2008 as a case study, this paper constructs and solves the ranking problem of shelters. Through the sensitivity comparison analysis, when the grey resolution coefficient increases from 0.4 to 1.0, the ranking result of building shelters remains stable. Compared to the traditional intuitionistic fuzzy distance, this method is shown to be more reliable.","Li, Ping; Ji, Ying; Wu, Zhong; Qu, Shao-Jian",Entropy (Basel),578,9

Mortality rates specifically due to heart failure (HF) have increased since 2011, but estimates of heterogeneity at the county-level in HF-related mortality have not been produced. The objectives of this study were 1) to quantify nationwide trends by rural-urban designation and 2) examine county-level factors associated with rural-urban differences in HF-related mortality rates. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We queried CDC WONDER to identify HF deaths between 2011–2018 defined as CVD (I00-78) as the underlying cause of death and HF (I50) as a contributing cause of death. First, we calculated national age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMR) and examined trends stratified by rural-urban status (defined using 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme), age (35–64 and 65–84 years), and race-sex subgroups per year. Second, we combined all deaths from 2011–2018 and estimated incidence rate ratios (IRR) in HF-related mortality for rural versus urban counties using multivariable negative binomial regression models with adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, risk factor prevalence, and physician density. Between 2011–2018, 162,314 and 580,305 HF-related deaths occurred in rural and urban counties, respectively. AAMRs were consistently higher for residents in rural compared with urban counties (73.2 [95% CI: 72.2–74.2] vs. 57.2 [56.8–57.6] in 2018, respectively). The highest AAMR was observed in rural Black men (131.1 [123.3–138.9] in 2018) with greatest increases in HF-related mortality in those 35–64 years (+6.1%/year). The rural-urban IRR persisted among both younger (1.10 [1.04–1.16]) and older adults (1.04 [1.02–1.07]) after adjustment for county-level factors. Main limitations included lack of individual-level data and county dropout due to low event rates (<20). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in county-level factors may account for a significant amount of the observed variation in HF-related mortality between rural and urban counties. Efforts to reduce the rural-urban disparity in HF-related mortality rates will likely require diverse public health and clinical interventions targeting the underlying causes of this disparity.","Pierce, Jacob B.; Shah, Nilay S.; Petito, Lucia C.; Pool, Lindsay; Lloyd-Jones, Donald M.; Feinglass, Joe; Khan, Sadiya S.",PLoS One,578,30

Decision regret is one of the most prevalent outcomes reported by informal caregivers who have made such decisions. OBJECTIVE: To examine levels of decision regret and its predictors among informal caregivers who have made health-related decisions for a loved one. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to November 2018. Participants were informal caregivers, and the outcome was decision regret as measured using the Decision Regret Scale (DRS). REVIEW METHODS: Two reviewers independently selected eligible studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality of studies using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. We performed a narrative synthesis and presented predictors of decision regret using a conceptual framework, dividing the predictors into decision antecedents, decision-making process, and decision outcomes. RESULTS: We included 16 of 3003 studies identified. Most studies (n = 13) reported a mean DRS score ranging from 7.0 to 32.3 out of 100 (median = 14.3). The methodological quality of studies was acceptable. We organized predictors and their estimated effects (β) or odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) as follows: decision antecedents (e.g., caregivers’ desire to avoid the decision, OR 2.07, 95% CI [1.04–4.12], P = 0.04), decision-making process (e.g., caregivers’ perception of effective decision making, β = 0.49 [0.05, 0.93], P < 0.01), and decision outcomes (e.g., incontinence, OR = 4.4 [1.1, 18.1], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This review shows that informal caregivers’ level of decision regret is generally low but is high for some decisions. We also identified predictors of regret during different stages of the decision-making process. These findings may guide future research on improving caregivers’ experiences.","Elidor, Hélène; Adekpedjou, Rhéda; Zomahoun, Hervé Tchala Vignon; Ben Charif, Ali; Agbadjé, Titilayo Tatiana; Rheault, Nathalie; Légaré, France",Med Decis Making,578,16
