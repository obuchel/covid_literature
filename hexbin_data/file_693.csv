Whereas much has been elucidated about how oxygen regulates HIF, whether lipids affect HIF activity is un-known. Here, using cultured cells and two animal models, we demonstrate that lipoprotein-derived fatty acids are an independent regulator of HIF. Decreasing extracellular lipid supply inhibited HIF prolyl hydroxylation, leading to accumulation of the HIFα subunit of these heterodimeric transcription factors comparable with hypoxia with activation of downstream target genes. The addition of fatty acids to culture medium suppressed this signal, which required an intact mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mechanistically, fatty acids and oxygen are distinct signals integrated to control HIF activity. Finally, we observed lipid signaling to HIF and changes in target gene expression in developing zebrafish and adult mice, and this pathway operates in cancer cells from a range of tissues. This study identifies fatty acids as a physiological modulator of HIF, defining a mechanism for lipoprotein regulation that functions in parallel to oxygen.","Shao, Wei; Hwang, Jiwon; Liu, Chune; Mukhopadhyay, Debaditya; Zhao, Shan; Shen, Meng-Chieh; Selen, Ebru S.; Wolfgang, Michael J.; Farber, Steven A.; Espenshade, Peter J.",J Biol Chem,693,1

As auto-stop’s Western frontier dwindles, its Eastern extension also slows. Discourses on danger, individualism, marginality and cheap neoliberal alternatives predict the phenomenon’s imminent extinction. We face an emergent, complex entangling of road networks no longer designed for people. Private, self-driving, autonomous (or driverless) vehicles promise to create a system of freedom and liberation. For many critics, however, they hybridise assemblages of human-technological landscapes into banal infrastructural spaces of car parks, filling stations and repair garages to service the motor and petro-chemical industries. These produce and propagate unsustainable automobilities, reflecting deeper social anxieties of alienation, loneliness, melancholy and even rage. Fostering their own emotive spaces and socio-political reactions, auto-stoppers allegedly contest and subvert the apparent consensus of hyper-modern, friction-free transportation grids. The practice supports intense encounters with strangers whilst anomalously negotiating pseudo-public/private infrastructural spaces. Grounded in auto-stopping’s many dimensions (such as risk, fear and trust, gender, tourism mobility, counterculture, adventure seeking), this chapter outlines some of the activity’s sites, narratives, eccentricities and embodied affectivities. It challenges current thinking about the organisation of movement, alienation and (auto)mobile materialities, especially by playing with the idea of an accelerated, motorised flâneur.","Laviolette, Patrick",Hitchhiking,693,16

Social media platforms are also increasingly used by a variety of actors—from ordinary residents, to local and international organizations, governments, and traditional media outlets—to a different degree and to different effects. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and others are now among the primary means for information dissemination, mapping and sending instant reports, organizing volunteers and help groups, connecting with family members, and donation gathering. Nonetheless, some concerns over personal data privacy, “fake” news, scams, misinformation and difficulties in outreach to older populations have also been identified. This chapter will provide a brief overview of the available literature on the role of social media for disaster management, and the types, uses, benefits and potential threats and challenges. A review of relevant case studies is included to identify some good and bad practices and derive lessons learnt. Finally, the chapter will pinpoint some key takeaway messages for practitioners and policy-makers in an attempt to chart the way forward.","Mavrodieva, Aleksandrina V.; Shaw, Rajib",Media and Disaster Risk Reduction,693,1

We sought to understand whether there was a fit-for-purpose conceptualization of EAM as a corporate level strategy. Our research considered foundational Asset Management (AM) prescriptions finding that the available AM models have distinct gaps as to the roles of governance entities and of CEO’s in asset management where these are actively involved in the policy and practice of asset management. Using the Victorian Government Asset Management Accountability Framework as an example of active top-level involvement we identified a ‘bottom-up’ approach, incomplete integration with the whole organization and positioning of AM planning subsequent to strategic level planning as barriers to effective corporate level asset management strategy implementation. Responding to those findings we offer a program of future research aimed at developing fit-for-purpose strategic EAM tools to assist those BoM’s who seek to elevate EAM to a corporate level strategy.","Mills, David E.; Pudney, Steve",14th WCEAM Proceedings,693,1

However, the pathophysiology of lung diseases remains complex. Sex steroids are known to influence the development and the physiology of lungs across the life course. During puberty, there is a progressive increase in sex-steroid levels, which results in anatomical and physiological differences between the sexes, and the interactions are most likely causes of the observable sexual dimorphism in the incidence, prevalence, and severity of multiple lung pathologies. Notably, fluctuations during the menstrual cycle and pregnancy impact many lung pathologies, suggesting a link between female sex steroids and lung health. This chapter highlights the influence of sex steroids in lung diseases across the lifespan, adding to our understanding of their complex roles. Focusing on various time points, we aim to understand the following: (1) the inherent function of sex steroids in lung physiology, (2) their differential nature in lung diseases, (3) contribution of sex steroids in males versus females across the lifespan, (4) the implications of sex-steroid signaling, and (5) the probing questions on sex steroids and their interactions influencing the lungs. With the intention of appreciating the nuances of sex steroids in humans pertaining to epidemiological sex differences, we inform readers about the mechanisms involved in the sex–age interaction and sex steroids’ contributions in lung diseases across the lifespan.","Borkar, Niyati A.; Sathish, Venkatachalem",Sex-Based Differences in Lung Physiology,693,1

This legacy is still apparent in the Middle East where gender discriminatory legislation and attitudes remain the norm. What are the reasons for such misogynistic practices?

Others place their emphasis on more structuralist explanations such as economic considerations and ongoing insecurity in the MENA region. Despite the challenges confronting women, this chapter also maps the positive trends of a post-patriarchal order in the region. These include women taking up arms to defend themselves, political mobilization on the part of women as they challenge both authoritarianism and patriarchy and the rise of feminist Islamic scholarship. The momentum for a post-patriarchal order also exists because of changing inter-generational attitudes about the place of women in society.

Rather than critique the consensus view, which has emerged from a particular sociohistorical context and serves particular institutional purposes, I suggest that key nature of science questions like “what is science?” and “how does it work?”, need to be coupled with questions like ‘how is science fully entangled with social and ecological relationships?’ and ‘how is science and science education sites for creating just futures?’ Thinking about the latter set of questions means placing Modern Western Science in relation to different ways of knowing and disciplines. It also entails exploring how science, because of its pluralistic nature, can be an essential part of democratic struggles, or dissensus, in the name of equality.

In doing so, they overstate the importance of trade with North-East Asia but understate that of inward investment, which is of greater importance to the UK than to any comparable economy. The rise in this has gone in tandem with how modern manufacturing has responded to globalisation through global value chains. Bilateral and regional free trade agreements need increasingly complex rules of origin to cover these, reducing their attraction to businesses. Although the UK’s preference is to negotiate new bilateral trade agreements, nonetheless, Japan has suggested that it could join the new trans-Pacific CPTPP regional trade agreement and that the EU and CPTPP could together negotiate a further agreement. This would be the world’s largest free trade area, covering more than 30% of global GDP. For Japan, the proposal seems to be defined primarily by its rivalry with China and Korea, but it is still an opportunity for the EU to enhance trade relations with the Pacific Rim and to project its values.

METHODS An online survey was submitted to dental professionals. Data were collected through a validated questionnaire consisting of 23 closed-ended questions. The gathered data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS An overall 216 dentists completed the survey. A total of 200 (92.6%) dental professionals were afraid of becoming infected with COVID-19 while 196 (90.7%) became anxious to treat patients showing suspicious symptoms. The majority of the participants were aware of the mode of transmission of COVID-19 and a lot of them were updated with the current Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for cross-infection control.

In this study, we summarize the epidemiological characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak among HCWs in a tertiary care hospital and compare various parameters and preventive measures taken by infected and uninfected subjects. A retrospective questionnaire and record-based analysis was carried out to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical parameters of the participants. Preventive strategies such as masking, hand hygiene and use of prophylactic agents were compared for infected and uninfected subjects. Appropriate statistical tests were applied wherever required. The average age of participants in the COVID-19 positive group was 35.9 years and 52.1% of the positive HCWs were symptomatic. Three of these subjects needed hospitalization and one required admission to an intensive care unit. The study found a protective role of full course of prophylactic hydroxychloroquine in treated subjects versus untreated controls (p = 0.021) and benefit of N95 masks over others (p&lt;0.001). Our results did not show any added protection with the use of other strategies (prophylactic vitamin C, D, zinc, betadine gargles, or other home remedies). We observed outbreak control with increased awareness, near universal testing, PPE provision, sanitation drive and promoting social distancing among HCWs. This study highlights the role of hydroxychloroquine prophylaxis, use of N95 mask and effect of early interventions in outbreak mitigation.","Khurana, A.; Kaushal, G.

In order to enhance the portability of a phenotype definition across institutions, it is often defined abstractly, with implementers expected to realise the phenotype computationally before executing it against a dataset. However, un-clear definitions, with little information about how best to implement the definition in practice, hinder this process. To address this issue, we propose a new multi-layer, workflow-based model for defining phenotypes, and a novel authoring architecture, Phenoflow, that supports the development of these structured definitions and their realisation as computable phenotypes. To evaluate our model, we determine its impact on the portability of both code-based (COVID-19) and logic-based (diabetes) definitions, in the context of key datasets, including 26,406 patients at North-western University. Our approach is shown to ensure the portability of phenotype definitions and thus contributes to the transparency of resulting studies.","Chapman, Martin; Rasmussen, Luke V; Pacheco, Jennifer A; Curcin, Vasa",AMIA ...

PDB contains over 32,500 experimentally determined 3-D structures solved using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Intrinsically disordered regions fail to form a fixed 3-D structure under physiological conditions. In this study, we compare the amino-acid sequences of proteins whose structures are determined by X-ray crystallography with the corresponding sequences from the Swiss-Prot database. The analyzed dataset includes 16,370 structures, which represent 18,101 PDB chains and 5,434 different proteins from 910 different organisms (2,793 eukaryotic, 2,109 bacterial, 288 viral, and 244 archaeal). In this dataset, on average, each Swiss-Prot protein is represented by 7 PDB chains with 76% of the crystallized regions being represented by more than one structure. Intriguingly, the complete sequences of only approximately 7% of proteins are observed in the corresponding PDB structures, and only approximately 25% of the total dataset have >95% of their lengths observed in the corresponding PDB structures. This suggests that the vast majority of PDB proteins is shorter than their corresponding Swiss-Prot sequences and/or contain numerous residues, which are not observed in maps of electron density. To determine the prevalence of disordered regions in PDB, the residues in the Swiss-Prot sequences were grouped into four general categories, ""Observed"" (which correspond to structured regions), ""Not observed"" (regions with missing electron density, potentially disordered), ""Uncharacterized,"" and ""Ambiguous,"" depending on their appearance in the corresponding PDB entries. This non-redundant set of residues can be viewed as a 'fragment' or empirical domain database that contains a set of experimentally determined structured regions or domains and a set of experimentally verified disordered regions or domains. We studied the propensities and properties of residues in these four categories and analyzed their relations to the predictions of disorder using several algorithms. ""Non-observed,"" ""Ambiguous,"" and ""Uncharacterized"" regions were shown to possess the amino acid compositional biases typical of intrinsically disordered proteins. The application of four different disorder predictors (PONDR(R) VL-XT, VL3-BA, VSL1P, and IUPred) revealed that the vast majority of residues in the ""Observed"" dataset are ordered, and that the ""Not observed"" regions are mostly disordered. The ""Uncharacterized"" regions possess some tendency toward order, whereas the predictions for the short ""Ambiguous"" regions are really ambiguous. Long ""Ambiguous"" regions (>70 amino acid residues) are mostly predicted to be ordered, suggesting that they are likely to be ""wobbly"" domains. Overall, we showed that completely ordered proteins are not highly abundant in PDB and many PDB sequences have disordered regions. In fact, in the analyzed dataset approximately 10% of the PDB proteins contain regions of consecutive missing or ambiguous residues longer than 30 amino-acids and approximately 40% of the proteins possess short regions (> or =10 and < 30 amino-acid long) of missing and ambiguous residues.","Le Gall, Tanguy; Romero, Pedro R; Cortese, Marc S; Uversky, Vladimir N; Dunker, A Keith",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,693,16

METHODS: In the largest survey on mental health of HCW conducted during the first wave of COVID-19 in Europe (N = 8071 HCW), we investigated depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, PHQ-2), and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, GAD-2), working conditions, and psychosocial burden of 3678 HCW of three health care professions in hospitals: physicians (n = 1061), nurses (n = 1275), and medical technical assistants (MTA, n = 1342). RESULTS: The prevalence of clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 17.4% and 17.8% for physicians, 21.6% and 19.0% for nurses, and 23.0% and 20.1% for MTA, respectively. All three professions demonstrated significantly elevated PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores, when compared with general German population before the pandemic, but lower scores in relation to that during the pandemic. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with insufficient recovery during leisure time, increased alcohol consumption, and less trust in colleagues in difficult situations at work. In addition, elevated anxiety scores were related to increased fear of becoming infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: During the pandemic HCW demonstrated a lower burden of mental distress compared to the general population. Nevertheless, a high percentage of HCW demonstrates psychosocial distress, so that the establishment of regular mental health screening and prevention programmes for HCW is indicated.","Morawa, Eva; Schug, Caterina; Geiser, Franziska; Beschoner, Petra; Jerg-Bretzke, Lucia; Albus, Christian; Weidner, Kerstin; Hiebel, Nina; Borho, Andrea; Erim, Yesim",J Psychosom Res,693,24

Hence, the aim of this study was to compare the orofacial adverse effects of two recently authorised COVID-19 vaccines, namely BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. METHODS: Publicly available data on BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were accessed from the relevant regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada, European Union and United Kingdom. Both patient/recipient information and healthcare professional fact sheets for each of these drugs were manually searched to find their orofacial adverse effects. RESULTS: Adverse events affecting the orofacial region were reported for both vaccines. These were rare and included acute peripheral facial paralysis (Bell's palsy), facial swelling, and swelling of the lips, face or tongue associated with anaphylaxis. There was heterogeneity in the acknowledgement of vaccine-related adverse events in North America compared with Europe. CONCLUSION: Globally, there are inconsistencies in the description of adverse effects presenting in the orofacial region of the COVID-19 vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. We believe that awareness of these orofacial manifestations will improve recognition, management and reporting of vaccine-related adverse effects.","Cirillo, Nicola",J. oral pathol. med,693,11

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of COVID-19, COVID-19-associated hospitalization, and mortality among patients with psoriasis treated by IL-17I. METHODS: A population-based cohort study was performed to compare psoriasis patients treated by IL-17I (n = 680) with those treated by methotrexate (n = 2,153) and non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments (n = 138,750) regarding the incidence of COVID-19 and its complications. RESULTS: The use of IL-17I was not associated with an increased risk of COVID-19 infection [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 0.91 (95% CI, 0.48-1.72); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 0.92 (95% CI, 0.54-1.59)]. IL-17I was associated with comparable risk of COVID-19-associated hospitalization [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 0.42 (95% CI, 0.05-3.39); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 0.65 (95% CI, 0.09-4.59)] and COVID-19-associated mortality [adjusted HR for IL-17I vs. methotrexate: 7.57 (95% CI, 0.36-157.36); IL-17I vs. non-systemic/non-immunomodulatory treatments: 7.05 (95% CI, 0.96-51.98)]. In a sensitivity analysis, neither secukinumab nor ixekizumab imposed an elevated risk of any of the outcomes of interests. CONCLUSIONS: IL-17I treatment does not confer an increased risk of COVID-19 infection or its complications in patients with psoriasis.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to report the maternal characteristics and clinical outcomes of pregnant women with coronavirus disease 2019. STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective, single-center study includes all consecutive pregnant women with confirmed (laboratory-confirmed) or suspected (according to the Chinese management guideline [version 7.0]) coronavirus disease 2019, regardless of gestational age at diagnosis, admitted to the Strasbourg University Hospital (France) from March 1, 2020, to April 3, 2020. Maternal characteristics, laboratory and imaging findings, and maternal and neonatal outcomes were extracted from medical records. RESULTS: The study includes 54 pregnant women with confirmed (n=38) and suspected (n=16) coronavirus disease 2019. Of these, 32 had an ongoing pregnancy, 1 had a miscarriage, and 21 had live births: 12 vaginal and 9 cesarean deliveries. Among the women who gave birth, preterm deliveries were medically indicated for their coronavirus disease 2019-related condition for 5 of 21 women (23.8%): 3 (14.3%) before 32 weeks' gestation and 2 (9.5%) before 28 weeks' gestation. Oxygen support was required for 13 of 54 women (24.1%), including high-flow oxygen (n=2), noninvasive (n=1) and invasive (n=3) mechanical ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (n=1). Of these, 3, aged 35 years or older with positive test result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, had respiratory failure requiring indicated delivery before 29 weeks' gestation. All 3 women were overweight or obese, and 2 had an additional comorbidity. CONCLUSION: Coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy was associated with maternal morbidity and preterm birth. Its association with other well-known risk factors for severe maternal morbidity in pregnant women with no infection, including maternal age above 35 years, overweight, and obesity, suggests further studies are required to determine whether these risk factors are also associated with poorer maternal outcome in these women.","Sentilhes, Loïc; De Marcillac, Fanny; Jouffrieau, Charlotte; Kuhn, Pierre; Thuet, Vincent; Hansmann, Yves; Ruch, Yvon; Fafi-Kremer, Samira; Deruelle, Philippe",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,693,1

Questions/Purposes: Based on our initial experiences with telemedicine in an outpatient arthroplasty setting, we sought to determine early lessons learned that may be applicable to other providers adopting or expanding telemedicine services. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed by surveying all patients undergoing telemedicine visits with 8 arthroplasty surgeons at 1 orthopedic specialty hospital in New York City from April 8 to May 19, 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze demographic data, satisfaction with the telemedicine visit, and positive and negative takeaways. Results: In all, 164 patients completed the survey. The most common reasons for the telemedicine visit were short-term (less than 6 months), postoperative appointment (n = 88; 54%), and new patient consultation (n = 32; 20%). A total of 84 patients (51%) noted a reduction in expenses versus standard outpatient care. Several positive themes emerged from patient feedback, including less anxiety and stress related to traveling (n = 82; 50%), feeling more at ease in a familiar environment (n = 54; 33%), and the ability to assess postoperative home environment (n = 13; 8%). However, patients also expressed concerns about the difficulty addressing symptoms in the absence of an in-person examination (n = 28; 17%), a decreased sense of interpersonal connection with the physician (n = 20; 12%), and technical difficulties (n = 14; 9%). Conclusions: Patients were satisfied with their telemedicine experience during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we identified several areas amenable to improvement. Further study is warranted.","LeBrun, Drake G.; Malfer, Christina; Wilson, Mallory; Carroll, Kaitlin M.; Wang, MS, Victoria; Mayman, David J.; Cross, Michael B.; Alexiades, Michael M.; Jerabek, Seth A.; Cushner, Fred D.; Vigdorchik, Jonathan M.; Haas, Steven B.; Ast, Michael P.",HSS J,693,29

The fragmented data collected during the initial emergency limited the possibility of investigating the effect of highly correlated covariates and of modeling the interplay between risk factors and medication. The present study is based on comprehensive monitoring of 576 COVID-19 patients. Different statistical approaches were applied to gain a comprehensive insight in terms of both the identification of risk factors and the analysis of dependency structure among clinical and demographic characteristics. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus enters host cells by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but whether or not renin−angiotensin−aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) would be beneficial to COVID-19 cases remains controversial. The survival tree approach was applied to define a multilayer risk stratification and better profile patient survival with respect to drug regimens, showing a significant protective effect of RAASi with a reduced risk of in-hospital death. Bayesian networks were estimated, to uncover complex interrelationships and confounding effects. The results confirmed the role of RAASi in reducing the risk of death in COVID-19 patients. De novo treatment with RAASi in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should be prospectively investigated in a randomized controlled trial to ascertain the extent of risk reduction for in-hospital death in COVID-19.","Cippà, Pietro E.; Cugnata, Federica; Ferrari, Paolo; Brombin, Chiara; Ruinelli, Lorenzo; Bianchi, Giorgia; Beria, Nicola; Schulz, Lukas; Bernasconi, Enos; Merlani, Paolo; Ceschi, Alessandro; Di Serio, Clelia",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,693,22

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective single-centre analysis of medical records included 247 eyes from 247 patients who underwent primary RRD repair with (phaco) vitrectomy between January 1, 2019, and May 31, 2021. RESULTS: The percentage of referrals due to primary RRD during the first year of pandemic (March 2020–February 2021) was 16.5% (p=0.179) lower than a year earlier. The percentage of referrals during the first, second and third wave of the pandemic was 48.4%, 18.5% and 26.1% (p=0.029, 0.475, 0.343) lower than in the corresponding months of 2019. A rebound effect was observed only after the first wave. The numbers of referrals in April and May 2021 were similar as in the corresponding months of 2019. No significant differences were observed in the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, other than a tendency towards a higher representation of women, younger persons, longer duration of symptoms but better visual acuity in the latter group. Silicone oil tamponade was used more frequently during the pandemic than before. CONCLUSION: In this study, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number and timing of referrals due to RRD and the clinical but not demographic characteristics of the patients. The effect lessened with the duration of the pandemic. Previously raised concerns regarding the delay in RRD referrals may no longer be valid during a potential fourth wave of the pandemic. The impact of the pandemic’s waves should be analysed separately, as such an approach provides a better insight into the fluctuations in the number of referrals due to RRD than a year-to-year comparison.","Dmuchowska, Diana; Cwalina, Izabela; Krasnicki, Pawel; Konopinska, Joanna; Saeed, Emil; Mariak, Zofia; Obuchowska, Iwona",Clin Ophthalmol,693,20

Rapid and early detection of the virus is the master key to cease the rapid spread and break the human transmission chain. There are very few studies in search of an alternate and convenient diagnostic tool which can substitute nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) specimen for detection of SARS-CoV-2. We aimed to analyse the comparison and agreement between the feasibility of using the saliva in comparison to NPS for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2. Methods A total number of 74 patients were enrolled for this study. We analysed and compared the NPS and saliva specimen collected within 48 h after the symptom onset. We used real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), gene sequencing for the detection and determination SARS-CoV-2 specific genes. Phylogenetic tree was constructed to establish the isolation of viral RNA from saliva. We use Bland-Altman model to identify the agreement between two sampling methods. Findings This study shows a lower CT mean value for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ORF1 gene (27.07; 95% CI, 25.62 to 28.52) in saliva methods than that of NPS (28.24; 95% CI, 26.62 to 29.85) sampling method. Bland-Altman analysis produces relatively smaller bias and high agreement between these specimen tools. Phylogenetic analysis with the RdRp and Spike gene confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva samples. Interpretation: In conclusion, our study highlights that saliva represents a promising tool in COVID-19 diagnosis and would reduce the exposure risk of frontline health workers which is one of biggest concern in primary healthcare settings.","Bhattacharya, D.
