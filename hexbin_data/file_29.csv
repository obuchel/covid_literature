35,35,35,A universal BMV-based RNA recombination system—how to search for general rules in RNA recombination,9.604037,6.201107,2005-07-07,"At present, there is no doubt that RNA recombination is one of the major factors responsible for the generation of new RNA viruses and retroviruses. Numerous experimental systems have been created to investigate this complex phenomenon. Consequently, specific RNA structural motifs mediating recombination have been identified in several viruses. Unfortunately, up till now a unified model of genetic RNA recombination has not been formulated, mainly due to difficulties with the direct comparison of data obtained for different RNA-based viruses. To solve this problem, we have attempted to construct a universal system in which the recombination activity of various RNA sequences could be tested. To this end, we have used brome mosaic virus, a model (+)RNA virus of plants, for which the structural requirements of RNA recombination are well defined. The effectiveness of the new homomolecular system has been proven in an experiment involving two RNA sequences derived from the hepatitis C virus genome. In addition, comparison of the data obtained with the homomolecular system with those generated earlier using the heteromolecular one has provided new evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different and depend on the virus' mode of replication.","Alejska, Magdalena; Figlerowicz, Magdalena; Malinowska, Nelli; Urbanowicz, Anna; Figlerowicz, Marek",Nucleic Acids Res,29,1
113,113,113,Cell-penetrating peptides as transporters for morpholino oligomers: effects of amino acid composition on intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity,9.779679,5.895952,2007-08-01,"Arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising transporters for intracellular delivery of antisense morpholino oligomers (PMO). Here, we determined the effect of L-arginine, D-arginine and non-α amino acids on cellular uptake, splice-correction activity, cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 CPP−PMOs. Insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) or β-alanine (B) residues into oligoarginine R(8) decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice-correction activity of the resulting compound, with a greater increase for the sequences containing more X residues. Cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10 μM. Up to 60 μM, only the conjugates with ⩾ 5 Xs exhibited time- and concentration-dependent toxicity. Substitution of L-arginine with D-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. High concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing X or B. In summary, incorporation of X/B into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of CPP−PMO. Toxicity of X/B-containing conjugates was affected by the number of Xs, treatment time and concentration. More active, stable and less toxic CPPs can be designed by optimizing the position and number of R, D-R, X and B residues.","Wu, Rebecca P.; Youngblood, Derek S.; Hassinger, Jed N.; Lovejoy, Candace E.; Nelson, Michelle H.; Iversen, Patrick L.; Moulton, Hong M.",Nucleic Acids Res,29,8
385,385,385,Proper Distance Metrics for Phylogenetic Analysis Using Complete Genomes without Sequence Alignment,9.611183,5.9882054,2010-03-18,A shortcoming of most correlation distance methods based on the composition vectors without alignment developed for phylogenetic analysis using complete genomes is that the “distances” are not proper distance metrics in the strict mathematical sense. In this paper we propose two new correlation-related distance metrics to replace the old one in our dynamical language approach. Four genome datasets are employed to evaluate the effects of this replacement from a biological point of view. We find that the two proper distance metrics yield trees with the same or similar topologies as/to those using the old “distance” and agree with the tree of life based on 16S rRNA in a majority of the basic branches. Hence the two proper correlation-related distance metrics proposed here improve our dynamical language approach for phylogenetic analysis.,"Yu, Zu-Guo; Zhan, Xiao-Wen; Han, Guo-Sheng; Wang, Roger W.; Anh, Vo; Chu, Ka Hou",Int J Mol Sci,29,1
996,996,996,Mannose-binding lectin deficiency and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,9.839479,5.773187,2012-11-23,"BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin is a collectin involved in host defense against infection. Whether mannose-binding lectin deficiency is associated with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is debated. METHODS: Participants in a study designed to determine if azithromycin taken daily for one year decreased acute exacerbations had serum mannose-binding lectin concentrations measured at the time of enrollment. RESULTS: Samples were obtained from 1037 subjects (91%) in the trial. The prevalence of mannose-binding lectin deficiency ranged from 0.5% to 52.2%, depending on how deficiency was defined. No differences in the prevalence of deficiency were observed with respect to any demographic variable assessed, and no differences were observed in time to first exacerbation, rate of exacerbations, or percentage of subjects requiring hospitalization for exacerbations in those with deficiency versus those without, regardless of how deficiency was defined. CONCLUSION: In a large sample of subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease selected for having an increased risk of experiencing an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, only 1.9% had mannose-binding lectin concentrations below the normal range and we found no association between mannose-binding lectin concentrations and time to first acute exacerbation or frequency of acute exacerbations during one year of prospective follow-up.","Albert, Richard K; Connett, John; Curtis, Jeffrey L; Martinez, Fernando J; Han, MeiLan K; Lazarus, Stephen C; Woodruff, Prescott G",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,29,17
1232,1232,1232,Co-expression of RNA–protein complexes in Escherichia coli and applications to RNA biology,9.5107765,6.043328,2013-06-25,"RNA has emerged as a major player in many cellular processes. Understanding these processes at the molecular level requires homogeneous RNA samples for structural, biochemical and pharmacological studies. We previously devised a generic approach that allows efficient in vivo expression of recombinant RNA in Escherichia coli. In this work, we have extended this method to RNA/protein co-expression. We have engineered several plasmids that allow overexpression of RNA–protein complexes in E. coli. We have investigated the potential of these tools in many applications, including the production of nuclease-sensitive RNAs encapsulated in viral protein pseudo-particles, the co-production of non-coding RNAs with chaperone proteins, the incorporation of a post-transcriptional RNA modification by co-production with the appropriate modifying enzyme and finally the production and purification of an RNA–His-tagged protein complex by nickel affinity chromatography. We show that this last application easily provides pure material for crystallographic studies. The new tools we report will pave the way to large-scale structural and molecular investigations of RNA function and interactions with proteins.","Ponchon, Luc; Catala, Marjorie; Seijo, Bili; El Khouri, Marguerite; Dardel, Frédéric; Nonin-Lecomte, Sylvie; Tisné, Carine",Nucleic Acids Res,29,1
1516,1516,1516,Analysis of tetra- and hepta-nucleotides motifs promoting -1 ribosomal frameshifting in Escherichia coli,9.46282,5.884425,2014-07-01,"Programmed ribosomal -1 frameshifting is a non-standard decoding process occurring when ribosomes encounter a signal embedded in the mRNA of certain eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. This signal has a mandatory component, the frameshift motif: it is either a Z_ZZN tetramer or a X_XXZ_ZZN heptamer (where ZZZ and XXX are three identical nucleotides) allowing cognate or near-cognate repairing to the -1 frame of the A site or A and P sites tRNAs. Depending on the signal, the frameshifting frequency can vary over a wide range, from less than 1% to more than 50%. The present study combines experimental and bioinformatics approaches to carry out (i) a systematic analysis of the frameshift propensity of all possible motifs (16 Z_ZZN tetramers and 64 X_XXZ_ZZN heptamers) in Escherichia coli and (ii) the identification of genes potentially using this mode of expression amongst 36 Enterobacteriaceae genomes. While motif efficiency varies widely, a major distinctive rule of bacterial -1 frameshifting is that the most efficient motifs are those allowing cognate re-pairing of the A site tRNA from ZZN to ZZZ. The outcome of the genomic search is a set of 69 gene clusters, 59 of which constitute new candidates for functional utilization of -1 frameshifting.","Sharma, Virag; Prère, Marie-Françoise; Canal, Isabelle; Firth, Andrew E.; Atkins, John F.; Baranov, Pavel V.; Fayet, Olivier",Nucleic Acids Res,29,1

2581,2581,2581,Reverse Genetics Approaches for the Development of Influenza Vaccines,9.961613,6.1242127,2016-12-22,"Influenza viruses cause annual seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics of human respiratory disease. Influenza virus infections represent a serious public health and economic problem, which are most effectively prevented through vaccination. However, influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic variation, which requires either the annual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines or the rapid generation of vaccines against potential pandemic virus strains. The segmented nature of influenza virus allows for the reassortment between two or more viruses within a co-infected cell, and this characteristic has also been harnessed in the laboratory to generate reassortant viruses for their use as either inactivated or live-attenuated influenza vaccines. With the implementation of plasmid-based reverse genetics techniques, it is now possible to engineer recombinant influenza viruses entirely from full-length complementary DNA copies of the viral genome by transfection of susceptible cells. These reverse genetics systems have provided investigators with novel and powerful approaches to answer important questions about the biology of influenza viruses, including the function of viral proteins, their interaction with cellular host factors and the mechanisms of influenza virus transmission and pathogenesis. In addition, reverse genetics techniques have allowed the generation of recombinant influenza viruses, providing a powerful technology to develop both inactivated and live-attenuated influenza vaccines. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of state-of-the-art, plasmid-based, influenza reverse genetics approaches and their implementation to provide rapid, convenient, safe and more effective influenza inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines.","Nogales, Aitor; Martínez-Sobrido, Luis",Int J Mol Sci,29,1
2912,2912,2912,Biomarkers for Chronic Kidney Disease Associated with High Salt Intake,9.755995,6.057085,2017-09-30,"High salt intake has been related to the development to chronic kidney disease (CKD) as well as hypertension. In its early stages, symptoms of CKD are usually not apparent, especially those that are induced in a “silent” manner in normotensive individuals, thereby providing a need for some kind of urinary biomarker to detect injury at an early stage. Because traditional renal biomarkers such as serum creatinine are insensitive, it is difficult to detect kidney injury induced by a high-salt diet, especially in normotensive individuals. Recently, several new biomarkers for damage of renal tubular epithelia such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1) have been identified. Previously, we found a novel renal biomarker, urinary vanin-1, in several animal models with renal tubular injury. However, there are few studies about early biomarkers of the progression to CKD associated with a high-salt diet. This review presents some new insights about these novel biomarkers for CKD in normotensives and hypertensives under a high salt intake. Interestingly, our recent reports using spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) fed a high-salt diet revealed that urinary vanin-1 and NGAL are earlier biomarkers of renal tubular damage in SHR and WKY, whereas urinary Kim-1 is only useful as a biomarker of salt-induced renal injury in SHR. Clinical studies will be needed to clarify these findings.","Hosohata, Keiko",Int J Mol Sci,29,17
2934,2934,2934,Quantification and phenotypic characterisation of peripheral IFN-γ producing leucocytes in chickens vaccinated against Newcastle disease,9.915951,6.114233,2017-12-11,"The aim of this study was to optimise and evaluate an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay for assessment of T cell IFN-γ responses in chickens vaccinated against Newcastle disease (ND). We aimed to validate currently available antibodies to chicken IFN-γ using transfected CHO cells. Moreover, this ICS assay was evaluated for use to detect mitogen and antigen induced IFN-γ production in chicken peripheral blood leucocytes. Chickens from an inbred white leghorn line containing two MHC haplotypes, B19 and B21, were divided into three experimental groups; one group was kept as naive controls, one group was vaccinated intramuscularly twice with a commercial inactivated ND virus (NDV) vaccine, and the last group was vaccinated orally twice with a commercial live attenuated NDV vaccine. PBMC were ex vivo stimulated with ConA or with NDV antigen. The ICS assay was used to determine the phenotype and frequency of IFN-γ positive cells. ConA stimulation induced extensive IFN-γ production in both CD3(+)TCRγδ(+) (γδ T cells) cells and CD3(+)TCRγδ(−) cells (αβ T cells), but no significant differences were observed between the experimental groups. Furthermore, a large proportion of the IFN-γ producing cells were CD3(−) indicating that other cells than classic T cells, secreted this cytokine. NDV antigen stimulation induced IFN-γ production but to a lower extent than ConA and with a large variation between individuals. The CD3(+)TCR1γδ(−)CD8α(+) (CTL) population produced the highest NDV specific IFN-γ responses, with significantly elevated levels of IFN-γ producing cells in the B19 chickens vaccinated orally with live attenuated NDV vaccine. This was not the case in the B21 animals, indicating a haplotype restricted variation. In contrast, the CD3(+)TCR1γδ(−)CD4(+) (Th) population did not show a significant increase in IFN-γ production in NDV stimulated samples which was in part due to a high number of IFN-γ producing cells after incubation with medium alone. In conclusion, an ICS assay for phenotyping of IFN-γ producing chicken leukocytes was set up that proved useful in identifying cytokine producing cells upon either mitogen or antigen-specific stimulation.","Andersen, S.H.; Vervelde, L.; Sutton, K.; Norup, L.R.; Wattrang, E.; Juul-Madsen, H.R.; Dalgaard, T.S.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,29,17

Due to the good biocompatibility of plasmid DNA, their cost-efficient production and long shelf life, many researchers aimed to develop DNA vaccine-based immunotherapeutic strategies for treatment of infections and cancer, but also autoimmune diseases and allergies. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge on the course of action of DNA vaccines, and which factors are responsible for the poor immunogenicity in human so far. Important optimization steps that improve DNA transfection efficiency comprise the introduction of DNA-complexing nano-carriers aimed to prevent extracellular DNA degradation, enabling APC targeting, and enhanced endo/lysosomal escape of DNA. Attachment of virus-derived nuclear localization sequences facilitates nuclear entry of DNA. Improvements in DNA vaccine design include the use of APC-specific promotors for transcriptional targeting, the arrangement of multiple antigen sequences, the co-delivery of molecular adjuvants to prevent tolerance induction, and strategies to circumvent potential inhibitory effects of the vector backbone. Successful clinical use of DNA vaccines may require combined employment of all of these parameters, and combination treatment with additional drugs.","Hobernik, Dominika; Bros, Matthias",Int J Mol Sci,29,1

The constant Gag to Gag-Pol ratio is essential for the virion structure and infectivity. Here we show that the frameshifting efficiency is modulated by Leu-tRNA(Leu) that reads the UUA codon at the mRNA slippery site. This tRNA(Leu) isoacceptor is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. When UUA decoding is delayed, the frameshifting follows an alternative route, which maintains the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio constant. A second potential slippery site downstream of the first one is normally inefficient but can also support –1-frameshifting when altered by a compensatory resistance mutation in response to current antiviral drug therapy. Together these different regimes allow the virus to maintain a constant –1-frameshifting efficiency to ensure successful virus propagation.","Korniy, Natalia; Goyal, Akanksha; Hoffmann, Markus; Samatova, Ekaterina; Peske, Frank; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Rodnina, Marina V",Nucleic Acids Res,29,1
3903,3903,3903,HBV Immune-Therapy: From Molecular Mechanisms to Clinical Applications,9.917829,5.848831,2019-06-05,"Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection represents a worldwide public health concern with approximately 250 million people chronically infected and at risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUC) are the most widely used therapies for HBV infection, but they often require long-lasting administration to avoid the risk of HBV reactivation at withdrawal. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel treatments to shorten the duration of NUC therapy by accelerating virus control, and to complement the effect of available anti-viral therapies. In chronic HBV infection, virus-specific T cells are functionally defective, and this exhaustion state is a key determinant of virus persistence. Reconstitution of an efficient anti-viral T cell response may thus represent a rational strategy to treat chronic HBV patients. In this perspective, the enhancement of adaptive immune responses by a checkpoint inhibitor blockade, specific T cell vaccines, lymphocyte metabolism targeting, and autologous T cell engineering, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and TCR-redirected T cells, constitutes a promising immune modulatory approach for a therapeutic restoration of protective immunity. The advances of the emerging immune-based therapies in the setting of the HBV research field will be outlined.","Boni, Carolina; Barili, Valeria; Acerbi, Greta; Rossi, Marzia; Vecchi, Andrea; Laccabue, Diletta; Penna, Amalia; Missale, Gabriele; Ferrari, Carlo; Fisicaro, Paola",Int J Mol Sci,29,1

METHODS AND RESULTS: Citrate‐treated porcine plasma of pH 7·5, 9·8 and 10·2 (8·5% dry‐matter) was spiked with PEDV, PSV1, PCV2 and AdV and incubated at 3°C for maximum 24 h, and at 44 or 48°C for maximum 10 min (Experiment 1). Spiked citrate‐treated concentrated plasma of pH 7·5 and 9·8 (24% dry‐matter) was spray dried in a laboratory scale apparatus (Experiment 2). Aliquots of SDPP were stored over a period of 0–10 weeks at 11 and 20°C (Experiment 3). Reverse transcription(RT)‐quantitative PCR detected no notable reduction in viral genomes in treated plasma and SDPP samples. No infectious PSV1 was re‐isolated from plasma and SDPP samples in cell culture. At pH 10·2 and 3°C, infectivity of PEDV in plasma was reduced with a reduction factor of 4·2 log 10 (LRF) at 10 h contact time, whereas heating to 44°C for at least 1 min at alkali pH was needed to achieve a LRF of 4·2 for AdV. Spray drying at an outlet temperature of 80°C reduced AdV infectivity effectively (LRF = 5·2) and PEDV infectivity for 95% (LRF = 1·4). After storage at 20°C for 2 weeks no infectious PEDV was re‐isolated from SDPP anymore (LRF ≥4·0). Due to growth of antibiotic‐resistant bacteria from plasma in cell cultures used for PCV2 isolation, no data regarding inactivation of PCV2 were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Five percent of PEDV stayed infectious after our spray drying conditions. Spray drying in combination with storage for ≥2 weeks at 20°C eliminated infectivity of PEDV effectively. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The conditions for inactivation of virus in plasma and SDPP determined are important for producers to inactivate PEDV during production of SDPP.","Hulst, M.M.; Heres, L.; Hakze‐van der Honing, R.W.; Pelser, M.; Fox, M.; van der Poel, W.H.M.",J Appl Microbiol,29,28

The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of these retroviruses in domestic cats in Hungary and to characterise the phylogenetic relationships of FIV strains. METHODS: A total of 335 anticoagulated whole-blood samples obtained from both a healthy and ill cat population were examined for the presence of FIV and FeLV with two methods: ELISA and PCR. Statistical analysis was carried out to analyse the data obtained. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of partial polymerase (pol) gene sequences was performed to describe circulating FIV subtypes. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed 11.8% and 9.9% true prevalence of FeLV and FIV, respectively, with ELISA. The apparent prevalence calculated from the PCR results were 17.3% for FeLV and 13.1% for FIV. Phylogenetic analysis of partial pol gene sequences obtained from 22 FIV strains showed that all observed Hungarian strains belonged to FIV subtype B. The strains were grouped into several monophyletic subgroups reflecting the geographic locations of the origin of the samples.

The PCR products subjected to amplification with each primer pair were found to possess sites of digestion by a restriction enzyme, as hypothesized. They did not react with feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-infected or feline syncytium-forming virus (FeSFV)-infected cell-derived DNA, and specifically amplified FIV-infected cell-derived DNA.

When intestinal segments were inoculated simultaneously with either 3200 units of natural porcine interferon-α or up to 100000 units of recombinant human interferon-α(2a), and TGEV, there were no reductions in virus yield, although the same cytokines exerted an antiviral effect in ST cells treated in a similar way. However, virus yields were significantly reduced in intestinal segments in piglets treated parenterally with teh synthetic interferon inducer polyinosinic: polycytidylic acid 6 hours before challenge of the segments with TGEV. There was also a trend for the antiviral effects of interferon induction before challenge to be augmented by the inclusion of interferon with the virus inoculum.

Three-day-old cultures of porcine adherent blood mononuclear cells were treated by doses of rPoIFNγ for 3 or 6 days before lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induction. While rPoIFNγ alone had no effect, a combined treatment by rPoIFNγ and LPS enhanced the IL-1 secretory potential of adherent mononuclear cells and, to a lesser extent, the level of cell-associated IL-1. The IL-1 activity was neutralized by anti porcine IL-1 α and β antisera. These results demonstrate that rPoIFNγ has immunomodulatory effects in vitro on porcine monokine production.","Charley, B.; Laverne, Sophie; Lavenant, Laurence",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,29,1

We amplified the entire coding region of the HEF gene of a laboratory strain of virus called C/Johannesburg/1/66, widely used for binding and esterase activity studies as well as that of a strain isolated in 1991 (C/Paris/145/91) from a patient suffering from severe flu syndrome. The sequences we amplified were about 2 kilobases long. In this work, we show that the forward ‘universal primer’ Unil, which has been used for influenza A and B viruses cDNA syntheses can also be used for influenza C virus. The PCR primers were designed to contain restriction sites to make the PCR products ready to be used for further purposes. A restriction analysis of the PCR products combined with analyses of all the human influenza C virus HEF gene sequences published so far permitted the design of sets of oligonucleotides which can prime PCR on cDNA of unknown influenza C virus for cloning.","Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; Hannoun, Claude; Nicolson, Carolyn; Robertson, James S.",J Virol Methods,29,28

Cats were divided into two groups (A and B). The clinical and clinicopathological features were studied in Group A. In Group B, at 1, 2, 4, 9 and 12 months post infection two cats were necropsied. Clinically all cats developed generalised lymphadenopathy, six cats were neutropenic and five cats lymphopenic. Three cats became febrile with conjunctivitis and anterior uveitis and one of these cats ultimately developed jaundice. Postmortem examinations confirmed a generalised lymphadenopathy involving peripheral and visceral lymph nodes with concurrent stimulation of splenic white matter and mucosal lymphoid tissue of the digestive tract and conjunctiva. Within the lymph nodes there was a reactive follicular hyperplasia accompanied by a paracortical hyperplasia with an increased paracortical vascularity. Unusual features were the presence of lymphoid follicles in the bone marrow, thymus and parathyroid tissue. In addition, aggregates of lymphoid cells were found within salivary glands, kidneys, sclera and choroid of the eye. One cat developed a lymphosarcoma affecting the liver and kidneys at 36 weeks post infection.

Since IL-4 exhibits a variety of functions on the cells of monocyte-macrophage lineage, we examined the effects of IL-4on the functions of microglia. Recombinant IL-4 induced the proliferation of microglia in a dose- and time-dependent manner as determined by MTT colorimetric assay, [(3)H]thymidine uptake and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. IL-4 also synergistically enhanced the proliferation of microglia with such colony-stimulating factors as IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). It also increased acid phosphatase activity and superoxide anion formation by these cells. Despite these positive effects on proliferation and activation, IL-4 suppressed the IFN γ-induced class II MHC antigen expression in these cells. Since these effects of recombinant IL-4 inhibited by the addition of monoclonal antibody against IL-4 receptors, the effects of IL-4 on microglia appear to be a specific function via IL-4 receptors. Although microglia and astrocytes produce a variety of immunoregulatory cytokines, neither cell produced IL-4 as determined by bioassay or detection of IL-4 mRNA by RT-PCR method. Thus, the exogenous IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of microglia in or around inflammatory lesions in the central nervous system, and may be involved in the regulatory mechanisms of microglia.","Suzumura, Akio; Sawada, Makoto; Itoh, Yasuhiro; Marunouchi, Tohru",J Neuroimmunol,29,1

Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) enhances IFN-γ-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-γ and TNF-α on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class II MHC mRNA expression in IFN-γ-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-γ. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of IFN-γ and TNF-α to the astrocytes, while TNF-α alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-α does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-γ-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFN-γ or IFN-γ/TNF-α. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-γ and/or IFN-γ/TNF-α. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.","Vidovic, Maria; Sparacio, Shaun M.; Elovitz, Michal; Benveniste, Etty N.",J Neuroimmunol,29,1

Although the serological relationships among ruminant pestiviruses require further clarification, there is growing evidence for two antigenic groups, one of which predominates in cattle and one in sheep. The success of pestiviruses stems from the ability of the non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype of the virus to cross the placenta and establish a persistent infection (PI) in the developing foetus. This biotype should be regarded as the ‘normal’ biotype with the cytopathic (CP) biotype being an abnormal virus that is usually isolated only from PI animals dying from mucosal disease. Recent molecular evidence points to CP viruses arising from their NCP counterparts by recombination events that include the insertion of host RNA and/or the duplication of viral RNA sequences. However, the biological mechanism through which CP viruses kill cells remains unknown. Virtually all CP and NCP viruses cause only mild, transient clinical symptoms in healthy adult animals and stimulate a protective immune response. Despite the urgent requirement for a safe, effective vaccine, there is still no commercial vaccine that has been shown to immunize dams so that foetal infection is prevented. In the absence of an effective vaccine, reliable diagnostic techniques are essential to implement effective control measures. There is now a range of monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for identifying PI or convalescent animals. These tests are specific, rapid, sensitive and reliable but may themselves become redundant as they are superceded by ever-increasing molecular biology-based techniques.","Nettleton, P.F.; Entrican, G.",Br Vet J,29,1

From 1983 to 1990, we have necropsied 45 well preserved carcasses out of a total of 120 beluga whales reported dead over this period. Of these 45 animals, nine were affected by 10 malignant neoplasms. Fifteen animals (33%) were affected by pneumonia. Milk production was compromised in eight of 17 mature females (41%), by inflammatory changes (seven animals) and cancer (one animal) which affected the mammary glands. Opportunistic bacteria were found in pure culture, and/or in significant amounts in at least two organs in 20 belugas (44%). The concentrations of both total PCBs and highly chlorinated PCB congeners were much higher in St. Lawrence animals than in Arctic beluga whales. OC-induced immunosuppression has been repeatedly demonstrated in a wide variety of animal species. Therefore, it is probable that the immune functions of St. Lawrence beluga whales are impaired. Benzo[α]pyrene adducts were detected in 10 of the 11 St. Lawrence beluga whales of which tissues (six livers, 10/11 brains) were analyzed by a method based on HPLC. No such adducts were found in four Arctic animals. Since benzo[α]pyrene is one of the most potent chemical carcinogens known to man, these compounds might be responsible for some of the cancers observed in that population. Overall, our findings contrast vividly with those of others who found that cancers are exceedingly rare in free-ranging odontocete populations and that the major causes for mortalities in these populations are bacteria, parasites, and trauma.","Martineau, D.; De Guise, S.; Fournier, M.; Shugart, L.; Girard, C.; Lagacé, A.; Béland, P.",Sci Total Environ,29,28

Major mucosal effector immune mechanisms include secretory antibodies, largely of immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype, cytotoxic T cells, as well as cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. Immunologic unresponsiveness (tolerance) is a key feature of the mucosal immune system, and deliberate vaccination or natural immunization by a mucosal route can effectively induce immune suppression. The diverse compartments located in the aerodigestive and genitourinary tracts and exocrine glands communicate via preferential homing of lymphocytes and antigen‐presenting cells. Mucosal administration of antigens may result in the concomitant expression of secretory immunoglobulin A (S‐IgA) antibody responses in various mucosal tissues and secretions, and under certain conditions, in the suppression of immune responses. Thus, developing formulations based on efficient delivery of selected anti‐gens/tolerogens, cytokines and adjuvants may impact on the design of future vaccines and of specific immunotherapeutic approaches against diseases associated with untoward immune responses, such as autoimmune disorders, allergic reactions, and tissue‐damaging inflammatory reactions triggered by persistent microorganisms.","Czerkinsky, Cecil; Anjueie, Fabienne; McGhee, Jerry R.; Geoige‐Chundy, Annie; Holmgren, Jon; Kieny, Marie‐Paule; Fujiyashi, Kohlaro; Mestecky, Jiri F.; Pierrefite‐Carle, Valérie; Rusk, Carok; Sun, Jia‐Bin",Immunol Rev,29,28

Driven principally by human and mouse studies, comparative MHC projects among other mammalian species offer certain advantages in connecting MHC genome characters to natural situations. We have studied the MHC in the domestic cat and in several wild species of Felidae. Our observations affirm class I and class II homology with other mammalian orders, derivative gene duplications during the Felidae radiation, abundant persistent trans‐species allele polymorphism, recombination‐derived amino acid motifs, and inverted ratios of non‐synonymous to silent substitutions in the MHC peptide‐binding regions, consistent with overdominant selection in class I and II genes. MHC diversity as quantified in population studies is a powerful barometer of historic demographic reduction for several endangered species including cheetahs, Asiatic lions, Florida panthers and tigers. In two cases (Florida panther and cheetah), reduced MHC variation may be contributing to uniform population sensitivity to emerging infectious pathogens. The Felidae species, nearly all endangered and monitored for conservation concerns, have allowed a glimpse of species adaptation, mediated by MHC divergence, using comparative inferences drawn from human and mouse models.","O'Brien, Stephen J.; Yuhki, Naoya",Immunol Rev,29,28

For both instances dedicated certification processes are installed. Up to summer 2020, 290 CPUs and 335 SUs have been successfully certified. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to compare the structures and the current certification situation of CPUs and SUs. Also, the younger CPU certification process is compared to the long established SU certification standard. MATERIAL UND METHODS: The comparison includes the historical background, the certification process, quality benchmarking, possible additive structures, the current status of certification in Germany, the transfer of the concept to the European level as well as reimbursement issues. RESULTS: Both certification concepts show clear analogies. Evidence for SUs is supported by a positive Cochrane analysis and for CPUs there are many studies from the German CPU registry. The main differences include a uniform CPU system versus a multistep SU system of certification. Furthermore, SU have obligatory elements of quality documentation but only facultative quality indicator assessment for CPUs. From an economic viewpoint operation and procedural key (OPS) numbers guarantee a better reflection of the use of resources in the complex treatment of stroke, which could not yet be established for CPUs. CONCLUSION: The well-established CPU concept could additionally benefit from a superordinate quality control. Adequate quality benchmarking appears to be fundamental for gap analyses and for the establishment of a separate remuneration structure. In this respect the German Society for Cardiology as the certifying institution is required to establish an appropriate mechanism within the framework of regular updates of criteria.","Breuckmann, Frank; Nabavi, Darius G.; Post, Felix; Grau, Armin J.; Giannitsis, Evangelos; Hochadel, Matthias; Senges, Jochen; Busse, Otto; Münzel, Thomas",Herz,29,1

Many estimates of human lung cancer risk from inhaled DE have been developed from rat bioassay data or from the comparative mutagenic potencies of DE soot extract and known human chemical carcinogens. To explore the importance of the DE soot-associated organic compounds in the lung tumor response of rats, male and female F344 rats were exposed chroni cally to diluted whole DE or aerosolized carbon black (CB) 16 hr/day, 5 days/week at target particle concentrations of 2.5 mg/m(3) (LDE, LCB) or 6.5 mg/m(3) (HDE, HCB) or to filtered air. The CB served as a surrogate for the elemental carbon matrix of DE soot. Considering both the mass fraction of solvent-extractable matter and its mutagenicity in the Ames Salmonella assay, the mutagenicity in revertants per unit particle mass of the CB was three orders of magnitude less than that of the DE soot. Both DE soot and CB particles accumulated progressively in the lungs of exposed rats, but the rate of accumulation was higher for DE soot. In general, DE and CB caused similar, dose-related, nonneoplastic lesions. CB and DE caused significant, exposure concentration-related increases, of similar magnitudes, in the incidences and prevalences of the same types of malignant and benign lung neoplasms in female rats. The incidences of neoplasms were much lower in males than females, and the mci dences were slightly higher among DE- than CB-exposed males. Survival was shortened in the CB-exposed males, and the short ened survival may have suppressed the expression of carcinoge nicity as measured by crude incidence.

Codon degeneration decreases the phylogenetic noise and bias by aiming to achieve two objectives: (1) alleviate the bias associated with nucleotide composition, which may lead to homoplasy and long-branch attraction, and (2) reduce differences in the phylogenetic results between nucleotide-based and amino acid (AA)-based analyses. The discrepancy between nucleotide-based analysis and AA-based analysis is partially caused by some synonymous codons that differ more from each other at the nucleotide level than from some nonsynonymous codons, e.g., Leu codon TTR in the standard genetic code is more similar to Phe codon TTY than to synonymous CTN codons. Thus, nucleotide similarity conflicts with AA similarity. There are many such examples involving other codon families in various mitochondrial genetic codes. Proper codon degeneration will make synonymous codons more similar to each other at the nucleotide level than they are to nonsynonymous codons. Here, I illustrate a “principled” codon degeneration method that achieves these objectives. The method was applied to resolving the mammalian basal lineage and phylogenetic position of rheas among ratites. The codon degeneration method was implemented in the user-friendly and freely available DAMBE software for all known genetic codes (genetic codes 1 to 33).","Xia, Xuhua",Life (Basel),29,19

This study aimed at determining the perceptions of Canaanland, an emerging urban community in Ogun State, Nigeria, on treated wastewater reuse for several purposes. Data were collected through questionnaires administered to the city residents (n = 244). Findings revealed that the city was aware of the economic and environmental benefits of wastewater reuse but would prefer reuse schemes that involved less human contact such as flushing toilets, electricity generation, building construction, and car wash. The least preferred option was for potable purposes. The community also revealed that they would be willing to accept wastewater reuse as long as it is endorsed by medical doctors, university professors, and experts. However, 45.5% of the respondents were from the Covenant University academic environment. Also, an assessment was carried out to ascertain the implications and opportunities for wastewater reuse in the city. Findings indicated that wastewater reuse involves several complexities and interlinkages, which revolve around political and decisional factors, economic and social factors, environmental factors, and technological factors. From the study, policy and decisional suggestions and a wastewater process flow were developed for more efficient wastewater management within developing cities. A study was carried out on eight cities from developing nations that have created a framework for wastewater management using several approaches. Also, a summary of findings reveals that if adequately researched, cheap and alternative means of wastewater treatment and reuse could be developed for electricity generation, carwash, and firefighting for developing nations. The result of this research can be used to address public anxieties regarding wastewater-reuse practices. Additionally, this study hopes to aid successful wastewater management schemes in the foreseeable future.","Akpan, Victor E.; Omole, David O.; Bassey, Daniel E.",Heliyon,29,17

DNA damage-driven senescence is perhaps one of the most underappreciated delayed consequences of persistent Gram-negative bacterial infection and inflammation. Although the host immune response rapidly protects against bacterial invasion, oxidative stress generated during inflammation can indirectly deteriorate periodontal tissues through the damage to vital cell macromolecules, including DNA. What happens to those healthy cells that reside in this harmful environment? Emerging evidence indicates that cells that survive irreparable genomic damage undergo cellular senescence, a crucial intermediate mechanism connecting DNA damage and the immune response. In this review, we hypothesize that sustained Gram-negative bacterial challenge, chronic inflammation itself, and the constant renewal of damaged tissues create a permissive environment for the abnormal accumulation of senescent cells. Based on emerging data we propose a model in which the dysfunctional presence of senescent cells may aggravate the initial immune reaction against pathogens. Further understanding of the role of senescent cells in periodontal disease pathogenesis may have clinical implications by providing more sophisticated therapeutic strategies to combat tissue destruction.","Aquino-Martinez, Ruben; Khosla, Sundeep; Farr, Joshua N.; Monroe, David G.",Int J Mol Sci,29,1

The development of T2D increases the risk of AD disease, while AD patients can show glucose imbalance due to an increased insulin resistance. T2D and AD share similar pathological features and underlying mechanisms, including the deposition of amyloidogenic peptides in pancreatic islets (i.e., islet amyloid polypeptide; IAPP) and brain (β-Amyloid; Aβ). Both IAPP and Aβ can undergo misfolding and aggregation and accumulate in the extracellular space of their respective tissues of origin. As a main response to protein misfolding, there is evidence of the role of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in moderating T2D and AD. HSPs play a pivotal role in cell homeostasis by providing cytoprotection during acute and chronic metabolic stresses. In T2D and AD, intracellular HSP (iHSP) levels are reduced, potentially due to the ability of the cell to export HSPs to the extracellular space (eHSP). The increase in eHSPs can contribute to oxidative damage and is associated with various pro-inflammatory pathways in T2D and AD. Here, we review the role of HSP in moderating T2D and AD, as well as propose that these chaperone proteins are an important link in the relationship between T2D and AD.","Rowles, Joanne Elizabeth; Keane, Kevin Noel; Gomes Heck, Thiago; Cruzat, Vinicius; Verdile, Giuseppe; Newsholme, Philip",Int J Mol Sci,29,1

However, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotics, neutropenic fever (NF) and hospital readmissions continue to pose as the most important limitations in the outpatient setting. It is possible that the febrile episodes may have a non-infectious etiology, and engraftment syndrome could play a more significant role. The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of both G-CSF withdrawal and the addition of primary prophylaxis with corticosteroids after ASCT. METHODS: Between January 2002 and August 2018, 111 MM patients conditioned with melphalan were managed at-home beginning +1 day after ASCT. Three groups were established: Group A (n = 33) received standard G-CSF post-ASCT; group B (n = 32) avoided G-CSF post-ASCT; group C (n = 46) avoided G-CSF yet added corticosteroid prophylaxis post-ASCT. RESULTS: The incidence of NF among the groups was reduced (64%, 44%, and 24%; P<0.001), with a non-significant decrease in hospital readmissions as well (12%, 6%, and 2%; P = 0.07). The most important variables identified for NF were: HCT-CI >2 (OR 6.1; P = 0.002) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.1; P<0.001); and for hospital readmission: age ≥60 years (OR 14.6; P = 0.04) and G-CSF avoidance plus corticosteroids (OR 0.07; P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF avoidance and corticosteroid prophylaxis post ASCT minimize the incidence of NF in MM patients undergoing at-home ASCT. This approach should be explored in a prospective randomized clinical trial.","Rodríguez-Lobato, Luis-Gerardo; Martínez-Roca, Alexandra; Castaño-Díez, Sandra; Palomino-Mosquera, Alicia; Gutiérrez-García, Gonzalo; Pedraza, Alexandra; Suárez-Lledó, María; Rovira, Montserrat; Martínez, Carmen; Fernández de Larrea, Carlos; Cibeira, María-Teresa; Rosiñol, Laura; Lozano, Ester; Marín, Pedro; Cid, Joan; Lozano, Miquel; Moreno-Castaño, Ana Belén; Palomo, Marta; Díaz-Ricart, Maribel; Gallego, Cristina; Hernando, Adelina; Segura, Susana; Carreras, Enric; Urbano-Ispizua, Álvaro; Bladé, Joan; Fernández-Avilés, Francesc",PLoS One,29,1

This toxin can be lethal for humans as a cause of botulism; however, in small doses, the same toxin is used to treat different conditions. Even if the therapeutic doses are effective and safe, the adverse reactions could be local and could unmask a subclinical impairment of neuromuscular transmissions. There are not many cases of adverse events in the literature; however, it is possible that sometimes they do not occur as they are transient and, if they do occur, there is no possibility of a cure other than to wait for the pharmacological effect to end. Inhibition of botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT/A) effects is a strategy for treating botulism as it can provide an effective post-exposure remedy.

The current study involved the qualitative and quantitative phytochemical analysis and in vitro evaluation of the antioxidative and methylglyoxal (MGO) trapping properties of galega herb. Ultra high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with both the electrospray ionization mass spectrometer and diode-array detector (UHPLC-ESI-MS and UHPLC-DAD) were used to investigate the composition and evaluate the anti-MGO capability of extracts and their components. Hot water and aqueous methanol extracts, as well as individual compounds representing phytochemical groups, were also assessed for antioxidant activity using DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazyl) and ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenz-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assays. Quercetin and metformin were used as a positive control. We confirmed the presence of tricyclic quinazoline alkaloids, guanidines, flavonoids, and hydroxycinnamic acids (HCAs) in galega extracts. The polyphenolic fraction was dominated by mono-, di-, and triglycosylated flavonols, as well as monocaffeoylhexaric acids. The in vitro tests indicated which G. officinalis components exhibit beneficial antioxidative and MGO trapping effects. For galega extracts, flavonols, and HCAs, a potent antiradical activity was observed. The ability to trap MGO was noted for guanidines and flavonoids, whereas HCA esters and quinazoline alkaloids were ineffective.

Among patients with abnormal troponins, it is imperative to quickly and accurately distinguish type 1 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) from other etiologies of myocardial injury. Although high-sensitivity troponin assays introduced a high negative predictive value for AMI, they have exposed the need for diagnostic modalities that can determine the etiology of acute myocardial injury. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is an effective tool to risk stratifying chest pain among patients in the ED. CMR is non-invasive and has a lower cost of care and shorter length of stay compared to those of invasive coronary angiography. It also provides detailed information on cardiac morphology, function, tissue edema, and location and pattern of tissue damage that can help to differentiate many etiologies of cardiac injury. CMR is particularly useful to distinguish chest pain due to type 1 AMI versus supply-demand mismatch due to acute cardiac noncoronary artery disease. A detailed review of the literature has shown that CMR with stress testing is safe to use in patients presenting to the ED with chest pain, with or without abnormal troponins.

The cutting-edge on big data-enabled social media analytics for transportation-related studies is limited. This paper brings a range of technologies together to detect road traffic-related events using big data and distributed machine learning. The most specific contribution of this research is an automatic labelling method for machine learning-based traffic-related event detection from Twitter data in the Arabic language. The proposed method has been implemented in a software tool called Iktishaf+ (an Arabic word meaning discovery) that is able to detect traffic events automatically from tweets in the Arabic language using distributed machine learning over Apache Spark. The tool is built using nine components and a range of technologies including Apache Spark, Parquet, and MongoDB. Iktishaf+ uses a light stemmer for the Arabic language developed by us. We also use in this work a location extractor developed by us that allows us to extract and visualize spatio-temporal information about the detected events. The specific data used in this work comprises 33.5 million tweets collected from Saudi Arabia using the Twitter API. Using support vector machines, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression-based classifiers, we are able to detect and validate several real events in Saudi Arabia without prior knowledge, including a fire in Jeddah, rains in Makkah, and an accident in Riyadh.

To avoid immediate implantation of an ICD, wearable cardioverter defibrillator vests (WCD) can be used to protect patients against malignant rhythm disorders, while at the same time drug-based heart failure therapy has to be initiated. This drug therapy can improve left ventricular ejection fraction and primary prophylactic cardioverter defibrillator implantation may not be necessary. However, the recent Vest Prevention of Early Sudden Death Trial (VEST) questioned the regular use of the WCD in this setting. CASE PRESENTATION: A 47-year-old Caucasian man with severely impaired left ventricular function early after myocardial infarction was prescribed a WCD as primary prophylaxis to prevent sudden cardiac death. Seven days after the patient was supplied with a WCD, the patient suffered from an electrical storm with recurrent ventricular tachycardia (VT), which was successfully terminated 17 times by the WCD. On coronary angiography, the formerly infarct-related right coronary artery had TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Ischemia Trial) III flow, and a remaining stenosis in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was stented, which did not stop recurrent VT. In the electrophysiology (EP) study, a focus was mapped in the left inferior ventricle, which was ablated. This stopped the VT. A second radio-frequency (RF) ablation in the same area was necessary after 14 days. Finally, a permanent cardioverter defibrillator was implanted. CONCLUSION: We report the case of a patient who survived recurrent episodes of VT early after myocardial infarction by effective defibrillation with a WCD. The WCD is a useful device to bridge time until a final decision for implantation of a defibrillator.","Andresen, Henrike; Sasko, B.; Patschan, D.; Pagonas, N.; Ritter, O.",J Med Case Rep,29,1

Considering the conservation of resources theory, we argue that workplace anxiety mediates the relationship between proactive behavior and work-family conflict. Furthermore, we suggest that immediate supervisor perspective taking and employee emotional intelligence moderate this proposed indirect effect. Two-wave, multisource lagged data were collected from 450 employees of seven domestic Chinese firms to examine the hypothesized moderated mediation model. Our findings support the hypothesis that proactive behavior is positively related to work-family conflict and that workplace anxiety partially mediates this relationship. Immediate supervisor perspective taking moderates the positive association of proactive behavior with workplace anxiety and the indirect relationship between proactive behavior and work-family conflict through workplace anxiety. Emotional intelligence moderates the positive association of proactive behavior with workplace anxiety and the indirect relationship between proactive behavior and work-family conflict through workplace anxiety.

The current study also contributes to the literature by identifying workplace anxiety as a mediating mechanism explaining the relationship between proactivity and work-family conflict.

Their location is restricted to organelles of endosymbiotic origin, the chloroplasts, and mitochondria. In the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana, there are 17 membrane-bound FtsH proteases containing an AAA(+) (ATPase associated with various cellular activities) and a Zn(2+) metalloprotease domain. However, in five of those, the zinc-binding motif HEXXH is either mutated (FtsHi1, 2, 4, 5) or completely missing (FtsHi3), rendering these enzymes presumably inactive in proteolysis. Still, homozygous null mutants of the pseudo-proteases FtsHi1, 2, 4, 5 are embryo-lethal. Homozygous ftshi3 or a weak point mutant in FTSHi1 are affected in overall plant growth and development. This review will focus on the findings concerning the FtsHi pseudo-proteases and their involvement in protein import, leading to consequences in embryogenesis, seed growth, chloroplast, and leaf development and oxidative stress management.","Mishra, Laxmi S.; Funk, Christiane",Int J Mol Sci,29,1

Here, we synthesized a copolymer PAsp(-N=C-PEG)-PCys-PAsp(DETA) consisting of a poly(aspartate) block grafted with comb-like PEG side chains via a pH-sensitive imine bond (PAsp(-N=C-PEG) block), a poly(l-cysteine) block with a thiol group (PCys block), and a cationic poly(aspartate) block grafted with diethylenetriamine (PAsp(DETA) block). The cationic polymers efficiently complexed siRNA into polyplexes, showing a sandwich-like structure with a PAsp(-N=C-PEG) out-layer, a crosslinked PCys interlayer, and a complexing core of siRNA and PAsp(DETA). Low pH-triggered breakage of pH-sensitive imine bonds caused PEG shedding. The disulfide bond-crosslinking and pH-triggered PEG shedding synergistically decreased the polyplexes’ size from 75 nm to 26 nm. To neutralize excessive positive charges and introduce the targeting ligand, the polyplexes without a PEG layer were coated with an anionic copolymer modified with the targeting ligand lauric acid. The resulting polyplexes exhibited high transfection efficiency and lysosomal escape capacity. This study provides a promising strategy to engineer the size and surface of polyplexes, allowing long blood circulation and targeted delivery of siRNA.","Liu, Shuang; Deng, Shaohui; Li, Xiaoxia; Cheng, Du",Molecules,29,17

ABSTRACT: Postoperative complications can impose a significant burden, increasing morbidity, mortality, and the in-hospital length of stay. Today, the number of studies available on the prognostication of postsurgical complications in cancer patients is growing and has already created a considerable set of dispersed contributions. This work provides a comprehensive survey on postoperative risk analysis, integrating principles from classic risk scores and machine-learning approaches within a coherent frame. A qualitative comparison is offered, taking into consideration the available cohort data and the targeted postsurgical outcomes of morbidity (such as the occurrence, nature or severity of postsurgical complications and hospitalization needs) and mortality. This work further establishes a taxonomy to assess the adequacy of cohort studies and guide the development and assessment of new learning approaches for the study and prediction of postoperative complications.","Gonçalves, Daniel M.; Henriques, Rui; Costa, Rafael S.",Cancers (Basel),29,1

Selected ATM machines on campus were used as case study to characterize, identify and determine the degree of bacterial contamination of microorganisms and their potential as reservoir of microbes. Swabs were collected from each ATM screen, buttons, floor, user’s hand, and exposure of plates. After collection of the samples, they were plated in nutrient agar. The results showed the presence of increased bacterial count subsequently, most pathogens on characterization revealed the genus of the particular organisms E. coli, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella, Micrococcus, Salmonella and Serratia.

When the pathogen (Xoo) vigorously attacks rice that has suffered yield losses, it can cause damage in up to 20% of the plant. Furthermore, Xoo is a seed-borne pathogen that can survive in rice seeds for an extended period. In this study, when rice seeds were soaked and sprayed with BIG(®), there was a significant increase in shoot and root length, as well as plant biomass. Furthermore, BIG(®)-treated rice plants showed a significant reduction in BLB severity of more than 33%. Synchrotron radiation-based Fourier transform infrared (SR-FTIR) analysis was used to characterize BIG(®)’s mechanism in the chemical structure of rice leaves. The SR-FTIR results at 1650, 1735, and 1114 cm(−1) indicated changes in biochemical components such as pectins, lignins, proteins, and celluloses. These findings demonstrated that commercial BIG(®) not only increased rice growth but also induced resistance to BLB. The drug’s target enzyme, Xoo 1075 from Xanthomonas oryzae (PDB ID: 5CY8), was analyzed for its interactions with polymer ingredients, specifically chitooligosaccharides, to gain molecular insights down to the atomic level. The results are intriguing, with a strong binding of the chitooligosaccharide polymer with the drug target, revealing 10 hydrogen bonds between the protein and polymer. Overall, the computational analysis supported the experimentally demonstrated strong binding of chitooligosaccharides to the drug target.","Siriwong, Supatcharee; Thepbandit, Wannaporn; Hoang, Nguyen Huy; Papathoti, Narendra Kumar; Teeranitayatarn, Karsidete; Saardngen, Tippawun; Thumanu, Kanjana; Bhavaniramya, Sundaresan; Baskaralingam, Vaseeharan; Le Thanh, Toan; Phansak, Piyaporn; Buensanteai, Natthiya",Int J Mol Sci,29,1

However, this inhibition does not fully explain the symptomatology reported and other targets could be relevant to the toxicity. Previous studies have indicated a feasible involvement of the nervous system. We performed a set of in vivo approaches to elucidate whether neuropeptide Y (NPY), Peptide YY (PYY) or serotonin (5-HT) was implicated in the early OA-induced diarrhoea.

We observe that national parochialism is a ubiquitous phenomenon: it is present to a similar degree across the nations studied here, is independent of cultural distance, and occurs both when decisions are private or public.

Clinically, it is difficult to diagnose GIM owing to its nonspecific clinical symptoms and poor suspicion. The estimated incidence of GIM is inaccurate, and most cases are diagnosed accidentally during surgery or upon postmortem examination. GIM usually occurs in patients with immune deficiencies or diabetes. Here, we report two cases of immunocompetent young patients with GIM who had good prognosis after treatment. Compared to other case reports on GIM, our cases had unusual infection sites and no obvious predisposing factors, which make it important to highlight these cases. CASE PRESENTATION: The first case was that of a 16-year-old immunocompetent boy who was admitted with gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation due to a gastric ulcer. Strategies used to arrest bleeding during emergency gastroscopy were unsuccessful. An adhesive mass was then discovered through laparoscopy. The patient underwent type II gastric resection. Pathological examination of the mass revealed bacterial infection and GIM. The second case was of a 33-year-old immunocompetent woman with a recent history of a lower leg sprain. The patient subsequently became critically ill and required ventilatory support. After hemodynamic stabilization and extubation, she presented with hematemesis due to exfoliation and necrosis of the stomach wall. The patient underwent total gastrectomy plus jejunostomy. The pathology results revealed severe bacterial infection and fungal infection that was confirmed as GIM. The patient fully recovered after receiving anti-infective and antifungal treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Neither patient was immunosuppressed, and both patients presented with gastrointestinal bleeding. GIM was confirmed via pathological examination. GIM is not limited to immunocompromised patients, and its diagnosis mainly relies on pathological examination. Early diagnosis, timely surgical treatment, and early administration of systemic drug treatment are fundamental to improving its prognosis.

These are achieved through immunomodulation and include anti-inflammatory actions, regulation of keratinocytes proliferation, and differentiation programs to build the epidermal barrier necessary for maintaining skin homeostasis. In addition, they induce antioxidative responses, inhibit DNA damage and induce DNA repair mechanisms to attenuate premature skin aging and cancerogenesis. The mechanism of action would involve interaction with multiple nuclear receptors including VDR, AhR, LXR, reverse agonism on RORα and -γ, and nongenomic actions through 1,25D(3)-MARRS receptor and interaction with the nongenomic binding site of the VDR. Therefore, active forms of vitamin D(3) including its canonical (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) and noncanonical (CYP11A1-intitated) D(3) derivatives as well as L(3) derivatives are promising agents for the prevention, attenuation, or treatment of premature skin aging. They could be administrated orally and/or topically. Other forms of parenteral application of vitamin D(3) precursor should be considered to avoid its predominant metabolism to 25(OH)D(3) that is not recognized by CYP11A1 enzyme.

This, in turn, induces collateral host injury at the tissue and organ level, leading to adverse outcomes. Tocilizumab has become widely used as an immunomodulator in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Here, we evaluated the use of tocilizumab to curb post-infective inflammatory flare in the setting of an in-vivo mouse model for invasive candidiasis. Following Candida infection, the tocilizumab-treated mice showed improved short-term survival compared with the saline-treated control mice. There was a reduced inflammatory response mounted by the host, coupled with reduced IL-6 but increased IL-10 levels. TNF-α and IFN-γ responses were not affected. Tocilizumab facilitated immune tolerance by selectively inducing IL-10, producing CD8α+ conventional dendritic cells (DCs) and peripheral T-regulatory cells, over CD11b+ conventional DCs and plasmacytoid DCs.

We propose honeybees (Apis mellifera) as a public engagement tool due to widespread awareness of colony collapse and the bees’ importance in food production. Moreover, their cognitive abilities make for engaging experiments. Their relative ease of cultivation means that studies can be performed cost-effectively, especially when partnering with local apiarists. Using a proxy for honeybee learning, a group of non-specialist high-school-aged participants obtained data suggesting that caffeine, but not dopamine, improved learning. This hands-on experience facilitated student understanding of the scientific method, factors that shape learning and the importance of learning for colony health. ABSTRACT: Apis mellifera (honeybees) are a well-established model for the study of learning and cognition. A robust conditioning protocol, the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response (PER), provides a powerful but straightforward method to examine the impact of varying stimuli on learning performance. Herein, we provide a protocol that leverages PER for classroom-based community or student engagement. Specifically, we detail how a class of high school students, as part of the Ryukyu Girls Outreach Program, examined the effects of caffeine and dopamine on learning performance in honeybees. Using a modified version of the PER conditioning protocol, they demonstrated that caffeine, but not dopamine, significantly reduced the number of trials required for a successful conditioning response. In addition to providing an engaging and educational scientific activity, it could be employed, with careful oversight, to garner considerable reliable data examining the effects of varying stimuli on honeybee learning.","Denton, Jai A.; Koludarov, Ivan; Thompson, Michele; Bryk, Jarosław; Velasque, Mariana",Insects,29,8

We aimed to investigate the involvement of emotional dysregulation and temperament in suicide risk in a sample of accurately selected young patients with mood disorders and a matched sample of healthy controls (HC). Methods: We assessed 50 young patients (aged 14–25 years) with DSM-5 bipolar or depressive disorders for clinical and psychopathological characteristics and 82 age and sex, educational level, and smoking habits-matched HC. Emotional dysregulation and temperament were assessed using the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A-39), respectively. We tested their associations with suicidal ideation, using standard univariate/bivariate methods, preceded by overall multivariate analysis. Results: In the group of patients, 24 (48%) reported lifetime suicide ideation (LSI). Patients with LSI scored higher on emotional dysregulation (p < 0.001) and cyclothymic (p < 0.001), irritable (p = 0.01), and hyperthymic temperaments (p = 0.003) than HC. Patients with LSI specifically presented with more emotional dysregulation (p < 0.001) and cyclothymic temperament (p = 0.001), than patients without LSI (N = 26).

Decisions about the initiation and timing of invasive ventilation can be difficult and early discussion with critical care colleagues is essential. Appropriateness of invasive ventilatory support may also be an issue requiring advanced discussion with patients and their families. In the past 10–15 years, the role of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) has expanded, not least in an attempt to minimize the complications inherent with invasive ventilation. As such, NIV is now considered first-line therapy in some conditions (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary oedema, mild-to-moderate hypoxaemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients), and a ‘trial of NIV’ is often considered in respiratory failure resulting from an increasingly wide range of causes. When using NIV, the importance of the environment (setting, monitoring and experience of staff) and forward planning cannot be overemphasized. When used for other than the standard indications, NIV should be employed in a high-dependency/intensive care setting only in patients for whom invasive ventilation would be considered.","Popat, Bhavesh; Jones, Andrew T.",Medicine (Abingdon),29,1

During the SARS crisis, China and the World Health Organization (WHO) entered a norm conflict over the precedence of sovereignty or global health security. Both resorted to behavioural, not discursive contestation: while the WHO practically but not rhetorically challenged the sovereignty norm by acting according to the norm of global health security, China—without openly acknowledging it—contravened the basic principles of global health security by acting according to the overlapping sovereignty norm. Why and with what consequences do actors choose to contest norms through actions rather than words? The article accounts for the resort to behavioural contestation by pointing to the strategic advantages it offers for furthering a contentious norm understanding without facing the social costs of making it explicit. It furthermore highlights that behavioural contestation may feed back into and change the odds of discursive contestation as its practical effects provide rhetorical resources to (de-)legitimate one or the other position. The propositions are illustrated in the interactions of China and the WHO during the SARS crisis and the subsequent norm development.

The small size and stability of the virus makes it suitable for mapping of the full breath and the kinetics of the cellular immune responses following acute viral infection. Methods: Five patients with acute primary B19 infection were included in the study and followed consecutively for up to 200 weeks. Cellular immune responses were mapped by IFNγ enzyme‐linked immunospot to overlapping peptides spanning the whole B19 genome. Results: In all five acutely infected patients, we were able to monitor the kinetics of a strong specific cellular immune reaction. Responses peaked at levels of 850–1850 SFC/million PBMCs, roughly corresponding to 0.3–0.6% B19‐specific CD8(+) cells circulating in peripheral blood at 10–80 weeks post‐infection. The responses in individual patients were directed to three or four different peptide pools, and the specificity was confined to the same CD8 epitopes present in the pools throughout the follow‐up period. The majority of responses were directed to the virus nonstructural protein, only two patients showed any response to the capsid proteins, elicited by the same epitope in both cases. Conclusion: The cellular immune responses to acute B19 infection are surprisingly narrow in distribution and remain at high levels for up to 80 weeks post‐infection. The initial epitope specificity is maintained, and the majority of responses target the virus nonstructural protein, which is not included in vaccine preparations, evaluated against the infection.","Isa, A.; Norbeck, O.; Pöhlmann, C.; Tolfvenstam, T.",Scand J Immunol,29,1

In many of its applications the so called “LWE secret” is not sampled uniformly, but comes from a distribution with some min-entropy. This variant, known as “Entropic LWE”, has been studied in a number of works, starting with Goldwasser et al. (ICS 2010). However, so far it was only known how to prove the hardness of Entropic LWE for secret distributions supported inside a ball of small radius. In this work we resolve the hardness of Entropic LWE with arbitrary long secrets, in the following sense. We show an entropy bound that guarantees the security of arbitrary Entropic LWE. This bound is higher than what is required in the ball-bounded setting, but we show that this is essentially tight. Tightness is shown unconditionally for highly-composite moduli, and using black-box impossibility for arbitrary moduli. Technically, we show that the entropic hardness of LWE relies on a simple to describe lossiness property of the distribution of secrets itself. This is simply the probability of recovering a random sample from this distribution s, given [Formula: see text] , where e is Gaussian noise (i.e. the quality of the distribution of secrets as an error correcting code for Gaussian noise). We hope that this characterization will make it easier to derive entropic LWE results more easily in the future. We also use our techniques to show new results for the ball-bounded setting, essentially showing that under a strong enough assumption even polylogarithmic entropy suffices.","Brakerski, Zvika; Döttling, Nico",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,29,1

These conditions are among the top risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to assess the of diet-related diseases among a multi-racial/ethnic uninsured group in South Florida. METHODS: Electronic heath records of adult patients (N = 272) from a free clinic in South Florida, a 4-week pre COVID-19 pandemic de-identified dataset was analyzed. Presence of diet-related conditions for each patient was quantified. Numerical and categorical data were compared using independent t-test and Chi-Squared test, respectively. Spearman`s correlation, multi-linear regression, and binary regression models were used to assess the relationship between the variables. RESULTS: The sample included females (65%) and males (35%). The mean age was 49.08 ± 14.56 years. There were 26.5% Whites, 33.8% Blacks, 35.6% Asians/Asian-Indians, and 1.1% American Indians. About 24% were Hispanic/Latino. The mean BMI was 29.45 ± 6.76 kg/m² (n = 250). Overall, 87% of patients had at least one diet-related condition with overweight/obesity being the most observed (75.2%), followed by hypertension (39%), dyslipidemia (27.2%), and diabetes (23.9%). The inter-racial analysis revealed that BMI is a significant predictor of prevalence of hypertension among Whites (P = 0.008) and Blacks (P = 0.002), but not Asians/Asian-Indians (P = 0.536). BMI was a significant predictor of prevalence of dyslipidemia (P = 0.027) and type 2 diabetes (P = 0.006) among Hispanics/Latinos. Bivariate analysis showed a 70.8% co-incidence of hypertension and a 64.4% co-incidence of dyslipidemia among adults with type 2 diabetes. Co-incidence of hypertension among adults with dyslipidemia was at 73%. CONCLUSIONS: High rate of diet-related chronic diseases was found among the multi-ethnic group of uninsured adults in this study. This supports the need for increased patient-education regarding nutrition in free clinic settings. Nutrition programs tailored for low economic resources and culturally appropriate dietary recommendations could assist uninsured patients with management of their diet-related chronic diseases.

METHODS: This study uses a single-blind, counterbalanced, randomized cross-over design with each participant completing two visits ∼7 days apart. The researchers are unaware of the beverage consumed by the participant, however, distinct differences in taste and texture between the Bulletproof Coffee (10 oz freshly brewed coffee, 15 ml MCT oil, 15 ml grass-fed ghee, ∼250 kcal) and black coffee (10 oz freshly brewed coffee, ∼1 kcal) prevented participant blinding. At the time of COVID-19 in-person research curtailment on our campus, six young, healthy participants (n = 5 females, age = 25 ± 8) who are regular coffee consumers had completed both trials and we are presenting the preliminary data here. During each trial participants complete baseline fasted measurements of cognitive performance (Digit Substitution Task [DSST], Stroop Task and Speed Task, all performed on a tablet computer), hunger/fullness, cognitive arousal, and gastrointestinal distress and then consume one of the two test beverages. The same measures are obtained again at 60- and 170-minutes post-consumption. RESULTS: Preliminary results suggest that there is no difference in cognitive function between the two conditions measured by number correct on the DSST (P = 0.44). Results suggest that there is a significant condition by time interaction resulting in greater measurements of fullness (P = 0.04) over the visit and a lower perceived prospective food consumption (P = 0.02) in the Bulletproof Coffee condition when compared to black coffee. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effects of Bulletproof coffee on cognitive performance. Preliminary data suggests that there may be no benefit of Bulletproof coffee over black coffee for improving cognitive performance. However, consuming one Bulletproof coffee containing 250 kcal, as compared to black coffee, does appear to increase feelings of fullness and result in a reduction in perceived prospective food consumption after 3 hours.

This article addresses the implications of consumer behavioural economics in the design of offers and the way airlines will have to rethink the way they price in a New Distribution Capability (NDC) world, as defined by IATA. In a pandemic impacted era, this investment will show its fruits not only after, but also during the recovery phase, where travel behaviour is exceptionally different, capacity fluctuates and the competitive landscape is equally difficult to predict. We will discuss what challenges a pricing department is facing in this new world of offers, as well as how to overcome them in order to provide relevant and personalised offers to each consumer and price them according to the value that these offers bring. In the COVID-19 context as well as post-pandemic, airlines will need to not only respond quicker with capacity adjustments, but also to better understand human behaviour relative to a purchase decision and address each consumer with an optimised offer in real-time, as they request it. Some of the questions for which new artificial intelligence experimentation techniques and behavioural economics models will require significant development are: What drives a person to choose or not to choose a certain offer? How many choices should they see? What trip purpose segment do they belong to? What is their willingness to pay? What attributes of an offer are people considering and what value do they associate to these offers?","Oancea, Octavian",J Revenue Pricing Manag,29,1

Hence, the presence of EVs has been described in multiple biological fluids and in most cases their molecular cargo, which includes non-coding RNAs (ncRNA), messenger RNAs (mRNA), and proteins, has been reported to modulate distinct biological processes. EVs release and their molecular cargo have been demonstrated to be altered in multiple diseases, including autoimmune diseases. Notably, numerous evidence showed a relevant crosstalk between immune system and interacting cells through specific EVs release. The crosstalk between insulin-producing pancreatic β cells and immune system through EVs bidirectional trafficking has yet started to be deciphered, thus uncovering an intricate communication network underlying type 1 diabetes (T1D) pathogenesis. EVs can also be found in blood plasma or serum. Indeed, the assessment of circulating EVs cargo has been shown as a promising advance in the detection of reliable biomarkers of disease progression. Of note, multiple studies showed several specific cargo alterations of EVs collected from plasma/serum of subjects affected by autoimmune diseases, including T1D subjects. In this review, we discuss the recent literature reporting evidence of EVs role in autoimmune diseases, specifically focusing on the bidirectional crosstalk between pancreatic β cells and immune system in T1D and highlight the relevant promising role of circulating EVs as disease biomarkers.","Grieco, Giuseppina Emanuela; Fignani, Daniela; Formichi, Caterina; Nigi, Laura; Licata, Giada; Maccora, Carla; Brusco, Noemi; Sebastiani, Guido; Dotta, Francesco",Front Immunol,29,1

During the last decade, awareness has increased that multiple genetic and environmental factors act in concert to modulate MS risk. Likewise, the landscape of cells of the adaptive immune system that are believed to play a role in MS immunopathogenesis has expanded by including not only CD4 T helper cells but also cytotoxic CD8 T cells and B cells. Once the key cellular players are identified, the main challenge is to define precisely how they act and interact to induce neuroinflammation and the neurodegenerative cascade in MS. CD8 T cells have been implicated in MS pathogenesis since the 80’s when it was shown that CD8 T cells predominate in MS brain lesions. Interest in the role of CD8 T cells in MS was revived in 2000 and the years thereafter by studies showing that CNS-recruited CD8 T cells are clonally expanded and have a memory effector phenotype indicating in situ antigen-driven reactivation. The association of certain MHC class I alleles with MS genetic risk implicates CD8 T cells in disease pathogenesis. Moreover, experimental studies have highlighted the detrimental effects of CD8 T cell activation on neural cells. While the antigens responsible for T cell recruitment and activation in the CNS remain elusive, the high efficacy of B-cell depleting drugs in MS and a growing number of studies implicate B cells and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a B-lymphotropic herpesvirus that is strongly associated with MS, in the activation of pathogenic T cells. This article reviews the results of human studies that have contributed to elucidate the role of CD8 T cells in MS immunopathogenesis, and discusses them in light of current understanding of autoreactivity, B-cell and EBV involvement in MS, and mechanism of action of different MS treatments. Based on the available evidences, an immunopathological model of MS is proposed that entails a persistent EBV infection of CNS-infiltrating B cells as the target of a dysregulated cytotoxic CD8 T cell response causing CNS tissue damage.","Veroni, Caterina; Aloisi, Francesca",Front Immunol,29,1

We aimed to compare the characteristics of stroke patients who were hospitalized with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) based on the timing of stroke diagnosis. Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of adult patients in a health system registry of COVID-19 who were hospitalized and had imaging-confirmed acute stroke during hospitalization. Baseline characteristics and hospital outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results Out of 882 COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized between March 9 to May 17, 2020, 14 patients (2% of all COVID-19 patients and 21% of those who underwent imaging) presented with stroke or developed stroke during hospitalization. Eleven had acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and 3 had acute hemorrhagic stroke. Six patients (43%) presented to the hospital with acute stroke symptoms and were found to have SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients who presented with AIS, more patients with AIS during hospitalization were male, of older age, had pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, were severely ill, and had high inflammatory and thrombotic markers (including C reactive protein, D dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen). Among all patients, hospital mortality was high (50%) and the majority of patients who were discharged had poor neurological outcome. Conclusions A distinction should be made between patients who present with acute stroke with concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infection and those who develop stroke as a complication of severe COVID-19. It is likely that a subset of stroke patients will incidentally test positive for the virus given the widespread pandemic.","Migdady, Ibrahim; Shoskes, Aaron; Hasan, Leen Z; Hassett, Catherine; George, Pravin; Newey, Christopher; Cho, Sung-Min; Rae-Grant, Alexander; Uchino, Ken",The Neurohospitalist,29,16

Optimal operation conditions are normally determined experimentally, repeating the extractions at different conditions and determining the efficiencies by an analytical technique. To shorten and simplify the optimization protocol, millifluidic platforms have been electrically characterized by impedance spectroscopy. The magnitude of the resistance of the electromembrane has been found very predictive of the migration capacity and extraction efficiency of three different parabens on real time. The optimal conditions (4 V of applied potential) (Electromembrane extraction low voltage) have been successfully applied in the extraction of parabens from urine samples, that not only improves the extraction efficiency (100% for all compounds) but also provides a very low current intensity (7 µA), which is very important in electromembrane to minimize electrolysis phenomena. The possibility to optimize one of the most critical and important parameters such as the voltage with a simple electrical model may accelerate the production of application-specific millifluidic electromembrane platforms in a short development time.

The Ultra-High Risk for psychosis (UHR) paradigm provides an opportunity to explore the stage at which such factors influence the development of psychosis. In this systematic review, we collate and appraise the literature on the association between ethnicity and migrant status and the rate of identification of individuals at UHR, as well as their rate of transition to psychosis. METHODS We conducted a systematic review in the Ovid Medline, PsychINFO, Pubmed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases according to PRISMA guidelines. We included studies written in English that included an UHR cohort, provided a measure of ethnicity or migrant status, and examined the incidence, rate, or risk of UHR identification or transition to psychosis. RESULTS Of 2182 unique articles identified, seven fulfilled the criteria. One study found overrepresentation of UHR individuals from black ethnic groups, while another found underrepresentation. Two studies found increased rates of transition among certain ethnic groups and a further two found no association. Regarding migrant status, one study found that first-generation migrants were underrepresented in an UHR sample. Lastly, a lower transition rate in migrant populations was identified in one study, while two found no association. CONCLUSION Rates of UHR identification and transition according to ethnic and migrant status were inconsistent and insufficient to conclusively explain higher incidences of psychotic disorders among these groups.

The concept of mini-fellowships has also emerged with the elimination of the oral American Board of Radiology examinations that had been administered in the final year of residency training prior to 2014. This paper seeks to assess the opinions of fellowship program directors, residency program directors, and chief residents regarding these recent changes. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a cross-sectional study using a web-based survey posed to fellowship program directors, residency program directors, and chief residents in 2020. Questions sought to explore current attitudes toward the following topics: (1) a common fellowship application timeline; (2) a common fellowship match; and (3) the status of mini-fellowships in diagnostic radiology. In addition, the number of fellowship positions for each subspecialty was estimated using subspecialty society directories, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) data, and individual program websites. RESULTS Deidentified responses were collected electronically and aggregated. The three respondent groups preferred a common fellowship application timeline at rates of 67% among fellowship program directors, 80% residency program directors, and 74% residents. A common match system across all subspecialties was preferred at rates of 50% fellowship program directors, 74% residency program directors, and 26% chief residents. There was widespread reported compliance with the SCARD fellowship timeline policy. Subspecialty programs using the match system reported interviewing greater numbers of applicants per position. Fellowship directors and chief residents reported that the most common duration of mini-fellowship experiences was 2 to 3 months. CONCLUSION There is a division between chief residents and program directors regarding the preference for a common radiology match. Adopting a radiology-wide fellowship match would increase the number of interviews required. The SCARD fellowship timeline policy has been successful, and there is support across stakeholders regarding the common timeline. Mini-fellowships are highly variable in length and structure.","Pfeifer, Cory M; Reddy, Nisha; Burton, Kirsteen R; Griffith, Brent; Bazylewicz, Michael P; Pakkal, Mini V; Milburn, James M",Academic radiology,29,1

However, few investigations have been conducted to understand the high co-occurrence of antisocial (ASPD), borderline (BPD), narcissistic (NPD), and histrionic (HPD) personality disorder traits and psychopathy. The triarchic model of psychopathy is a framework that focuses on dispositional constructs (meanness, boldness, and disinhibition) with neurobiological and developmental correlates that may be particularly useful in elucidating the overlap between Cluster B personality traits and psychopathy. This study investigated how the triarchic model relates to Cluster B personality traits. Two independent samples completed self-report measures of personality disorder traits. Sample 1 consists of 508 adults, and Sample 2 consists of 529 undergraduate students. Disinhibition positively predicted all Cluster B PDs. Meanness positively predicted ASPD, NPD, and BPD, and negatively predicted HPD. Boldness positively predicted ASPD, NPD, and HPD and negatively predicted BPD.

Many jurisdictions have moved to relax measures, while others have intensified efforts to reduce transmission.AimWe aimed to determine the time frame between a population-level change in COVID-19 measures and its impact on the number of cases.MethodsWe examined how long it takes for there to be a substantial difference between the number of cases that occur following a change in COVID-19 physical distancing measures and those that would have occurred at baseline. We then examined how long it takes to observe this difference, given delays and noise in reported cases. We used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR)-type model and publicly available data from British Columbia, Canada, collected between March and July 2020.ResultsIt takes 10 days or more before we expect a substantial difference in the number of cases following a change in COVID-19 control measures, but 20-26 days to detect the impact of the change in reported data. The time frames are longer for smaller changes in control measures and are impacted by testing and reporting processes, with delays reaching ≥ 30 days.ConclusionThe time until a change in control measures has an observed impact is longer than the mean incubation period of COVID-19 and the commonly used 14-day time period. Policymakers and practitioners should consider this when assessing the impact of policy changes. Rapid, consistent and real-time COVID-19 surveillance is important to minimise these time frames.","Stockdale, Jessica E; Doig, Renny; Min, Joosung; Mulberry, Nicola; Wang, Liangliang; Elliott, Lloyd T; Colijn, Caroline",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,29,5

In addition to its clinical importance, influenza in healthy children can have substantial socioeconomic consequences for children, whose everyday activities are disrupted and who lose a significant number of school days, and their household contacts, who are frequently affected by similar illnesses. An overall evaluation of these data show that influenza in infants and children is a significant clinical and socioeconomic problem and that healthy children appear to be candidates for yearly vaccinations. Global evaluation of the impact of influenza in pediatric patients indicates that influenza vaccination should be more widely used than is usually recommended. All of the data regarding influenza vaccines indicate that the immunogenicity of the available preparations is good, and that they are safe, well-tolerated, and significantly effective in preventing influenza illness and its complications in both high-risk and otherwise healthy children. Moreover, the economic data indicate that universal childhood influenza vaccination is a low-cost preventive intervention that provides health benefits during epidemic and pandemic periods, supporting an extensive use of vaccination in childhood.","Esposito, Susanna; Marchisio, Paola; Principi, Nicola",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,29,1

Primary care physicians treating patients with chronic noncancer pain are concerned about adverse events and risk of abuse and dependence associated with opioids, yet many prescribers do not follow established guidelines for the use of these agents, either through unawareness or in the mistaken belief that urine toxicology testing is all that is needed to monitor compliance and thwart abuse. Although there is no foolproof way to identify an abuser and prevent abuse, the best way to minimize the risk of abuse is to follow established guidelines for the use of opioids. These guidelines entail a careful assessment of the patient, the painful condition to be treated, and the estimated level of risk of abuse based on several factors: history of abuse and current or past psychiatric disorders; design of a therapeutic regimen that includes both pharmacotherapeutic and nonpharmacologic modalities; a formal written agreement with the patient that defines treatment expectations and responsibilities; selection of an appropriate agent, including consideration of formulations designed to deter tampering and abuse; initiation of treatment at a low dosage with titration in gradual increments as needed to achieve effective analgesia; regular reassessment to watch for signs of abuse, to perform drug monitoring, and to adjust medication as needed; and established protocols for actions to be taken in case of suspected abuse. By following these guidelines, physicians can prescribe opioids to provide effective analgesia while reducing the likelihood of abuse.","Cone, Edward J; DePriest, Anne Z; Gordon, Allan; Passik, Steven D",Postgraduate medicine,29,16

This study aimed to verify the effects of M. charantia saponins on insulin secretion and explore the potential underlying mechanisms in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells. We injured INS-1 cells with 33.3mM glucose and then treated them with saponins. Saponins improved cell morphology and viability as demonstrated by inverted microscopy and CCK8 detection and significantly increased insulin secretion in a concentration-dependent manner as shown by ELISA. Thus, we obtained the optimal concentration for the subsequent experiments. Potential mechanisms were explored by immunofluorescence, western blotting, and RT-qPCR techniques. First, saponins increased the mRNA and protein levels of IRS-2 but decreased the serine 731 phosphorylation level of IRS-2. Moreover, saponins increased the phosphorylation of Akt protein and decreased the protein level of FoxO1, which were both reversed by the PI3K inhibitor ly294002. Furthermore, saponins increased the protein level of the downstream molecule and insulin initiating factor PDX-1, which was also reversed by ly294002. Saponins also increased Akt and PDX-1 mRNA and decreased FoxO1 mRNA, which were both reversed by ly294002. Saponins increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and intracellular insulin content, which were reversed by ly294002, as determined by ELISA. The immunofluorescence results also confirmed this tendency. In conclusion, our findings improve our understanding of the function of saponins in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells and suggest that saponins may increase insulin secretion via the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway.","Liu, Yufan; Mu, Shumin; Chen, Wenbin; Liu, Shiyin; Cong, Yuxuan; Liu, Jiajia; Jia, Ning","Endocrinologia, diabetes y nutricion",29,24

Recent advances in invasive vagal nerve stimulation in humans, despite previous findings in animal models, used low frequency stimulation and found no effect on the olfactory functioning. The present article aimed to test potential effects of non-invasive, high and low frequency vagal nerve stimulation in humans, with supplementary exploration of the orbitofrontal cortex using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Healthy, male adult participants (n = 18) performed two olfactory tests [odor threshold test (OTT) and supra-threshold test (STT)] before and after receiving high-, low frequency vagal nerve stimulation and placebo (no stimulation). Participant's olfactory functioning was monitored using NIRS, and assessed with two behavioral olfactory tests. NIRS data of separate stimulation parameters were statistically analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA across different stages. Data from olfactory tests were analyzed using paired parametric and non-parametric statistical tests. Only high frequency, non-invasive vagal nerve stimulation was able to positively modulate the performance of the healthy participants in the STT (p = 0.021, Wilcoxon sign-ranked test), with significant differences in NIRS (p = 0.014, post-hoc with Bonferroni correction) recordings of the right hemispheric, orbitofrontal cortex. The results from the current article implore further exploration of the neurocircuitry involved under vagal nerve stimulation and the effects of non-invasive, high frequency, vagal nerve stimulation toward olfactory dysfunction which showcase in Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Diseases. Despite the sufficient effect size (moderate effect, correlation coefficient (r): 0.39 for the STT) of the current study, future research should replicate the current findings with a larger cohort.","Maharjan, Ashim; Wang, Eunice; Peng, Mei; Cakmak, Yusuf O",Frontiers in neuroscience,29,1

Two different uptake rates were specified: (1) surge uptake (VS ) after starvation and (2) maintenance uptake with filled nutrient pools (VM ). VS for DIP of 1.57±0.29 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 and DIN of 15.6±4.3 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 , as well as VM for DIP of 0.57±0.22 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 and DIN of 5.6±2.1 µmol · cm-2 · d-1 were calculated. In addition, an absolute size of the internal storage capacity (ISC) for DIP of 22 µmol · cm2 and DIN of 222 µmol · cm2 was determined. A DIP to DIN uptake ratio of 1:10 under VM showed a weekly rhythmic uptake pattern, highlighted by a high correlation between DIP and DIN uptake (R=0.943). VS for DIN did not occur under DIP depletion, but uptake rates increased with increasing DIP availability. Hence, DIP availability limited access to DIN, which was also reflected by total dissolvable protein concentrations in sporophytes, which ranged from 10.2±2.5% to 24.6±8.0% dry weight depending on DIP availability. Similarly, total dissolvable carbohydrate concentration ranged from 22.1±3.6% to 54.3±12.3% dry weight. The data presented in this study opens further insight into ecological and physiological aspects of nutrient availability in P. palmata and allows for an optimization in cultivation.","Lubsch, Alexander; Timmermans, Klaas R",Journal of phycology,29,30

The SMART™ CONTROL stent (Cordis Corp, Miami Lakes, Florida, United States) has a peak-to-valley bridge and inline interconnection, whereas the COMPLETE™-SE stent (Medtronic Vascular, Santa Rosa, California, United States) crowns have been configured to minimize crown-to-crown interaction, increasing the stent's flexibility without compromising radial strength. Further, the 2011 ESC (European society of cardiology) guidelines recommend that dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine such as clopidogrel should be administered for at least one month after infrainguinal bare metal stent implantation. Cilostazol has been reported to reduce intimal hyperplasia and subsequent repeat revascularization. To date, there has been no randomized study comparing the safety and efficacy of two different antiplatelet regimens, clopidogrel and cilostazol, following successful femoropopliteal stenting. METHODS/DESIGN The primary purpose of our study is to examine the incidence of stent fracture and primary patency between two different major representative self-expanding nitinol stents (SMART™ CONTROL versus COMPLETE™-SE) in stenotic or occlusive femoropopliteal arterial lesion. The secondary purpose is to examine whether there is any difference in efficacy and safety between aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin plus cilostazol for one month following stent implantation in femoropopliteal lesions. This is a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial to assess the efficacy of the COMPLETE™-SE versus SMART™ CONTROL stent for provisional stenting after balloon angioplasty in femoropopliteal arterial lesions. The study design is a 2x2 randomization design and a total of 346 patients will be enrolled. The primary endpoint of this study is the rate of binary restenosis in the treated segment at 12 months after intervention as determined by catheter angiography or duplex ultrasound. DISCUSSION This trial will provide powerful insight into whether the design of the COMPLETE™-SE stent is more fracture-resistant or effective in preventing restenosis compared with the SMART™ CONTROL stent. Also, it will determine the efficacy and safety of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin plus cilostazol in patients undergoing stent implantation in femoropopliteal lesions.

We assessed the effect of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) in patients with carotid stenosis using data from the Efficacy of Nitric Oxide in Stroke (ENOS) Trial. Methods ENOS randomised 4011 patients with acute stroke and raised systolic BP (140-220 mm Hg) to transdermal GTN or no GTN within 48 hours of onset. Those on prestroke antihypertensives were also randomised to stop or continue their medication for 7 days. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at day 90. Ipsilateral carotid stenosis was split: <30%; 30-<50%; 50-<70%; ≥70%. Data are ORs with 95% CIs adjusted for baseline prognostic factors. Results 2023 (60.5%) ischaemic stroke participants had carotid imaging. As compared with <30%, ≥70% ipsilateral stenosis was associated with an unfavourable shift in mRS (worse outcome) at 90 days (OR 1.88, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.44, p<0.001). Those with ≥70% stenosis who received GTN versus no GTN had a favourable shift in mRS (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.93, p=0.024). In those with 50-<70% stenosis, continuing versus stopping prestroke antihypertensives was associated with worse disability, mood, quality of life and cognition at 90 days. Clinical outcomes did not differ across bilateral stenosis groups. Conclusions Following ischaemic stroke, severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis is associated with worse functional outcome at 90 days. GTN appears safe in ipsilateral or bilateral carotid stenosis, and might improve outcome in severe ipsilateral carotid stenosis.","Appleton, Jason P; Woodhouse, Lisa J; Belcher, Andrew; Bereczki, Daniel; Berge, Eivind; Caso, Valeria; Chang, Hui Meng; Christensen, Hanne K; Collins, Ronan; Gommans, John; Laska, Ann C; Ntaios, George; Ozturk, Serefnur; Sare, Gillian M; Szatmari, Szabolcs; Wang, Yongjun; Wardlaw, Joanna M; Sprigg, Nikola; Bath, Philip M",Stroke and vascular neurology,29,31

Studies suggest that there are many differences between men and women in the immune response to CoV-19 infection and inflammatory diseases. Women, compared to men, are less susceptible to viral infections based on a different innate immunity, steroid hormones and factors related to sex chromosomes. The presence of two X chromosomes in women emphasize the immune system even if one is inactive. The immune regulatory genes encoded by X chromosome in female gender causes lower viral load levels, and less inflammation than in man, while CD4+ T cells are higher with better immune response. In addition, women generally produce higher levels of antibodies which remain in the circulation longer. The levels of activation of the immune cells are higher in women than in men, and it is correlated with the trigger of TLR7 and the production of IFN. TLR7 is higher in women than in men and its biallelic expression leads to higher immune responses and increases the resistance to viral infections. TLR7 is expressed in innate immune cells which recognizes single strand RNA virus by promoting the production of antibodies against the virus and the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-1 family members. Moreover, in women the production of inflammatory IL-6 after viral infection is lower than in males and is often correlated with a better longevity. In addition, on the X chromosome there are loci that code for the genes involved in the regulation of immune cells such as FOXP3, and transcription factor for Treg involved in virus pathogenesis. The X chromosome influences the immune system by acting on many other proteins, including TLR8, CD40L and CXCR3 which can be over-expressed in women, and influence the response to viral infections and vaccinations. However, the biallelic expression of the X-linked genes can promote harmful autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Cardiovascular diseases are more frequent in males and subjects without cardiovascular dysfunctions infected by CoV-19 have a better prognosis. ACE2 is a receptor for CoV-19 and protects lung damage. CoV-19 infection and the virus's Spike protein inhibit the expression of ACE2, abolishing its protective function. Inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACEI) are used to stem the devastating effects of CoV-19, to increase the number of CD3 and CD8 T cells and to reduce the viral load and IL-6 levels that control CoV-19 replication via NF-B, but these effects are still under study. It is hoped that certain drugs, such as CoV-19 receptor blockers, anti-inflammatories (against rheumatic diseases), monoclonal antibodies, anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6, the remdesevir drug (analogue adenosine, effective against ebola), hydroxychloroquine (for the treatment of malaria) and vaccines, will open up new strategies and new therapeutic ways to combat this terrible virus.","Conti, P; Younes, A",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,29,1

In SILC, procedural difficulties may increase when the port-to-target distance is long. We aimed to assess the correlation between port-to-target distance and procedural difficulty. METHODS Thirty-six consecutive patients who underwent SILC at our hospital were included in this study. The umbilicus-to-Calot's triangle distance (UCD) was measured intraoperatively. The correlations between the UCD and operative time were analyzed, and for comparison, CLC cases during the same period (n = 28) were similarly analyzed. Moreover, UCD was estimated from preoperative CT (UCD-CT), and the usefulness of UCD-CT was assessed during SILC and CLC. RESULTS Thirty-four patients successfully underwent SILC. There were positive correlations between the UCD and pneumoperitoneum time. Multivariate linear regression analysis, including BMI and height, which were previously reported to have a correlation with longer operative time in SILC, showed that UCD is an independent predictive factor for prolonged operative duration. However, BMI and height were not independent predictive factors. UCD and UCD-CT had a very strong positive correlation; therefore, UCD was estimated from CT. UCD-CT had a strong positive correlation with operative time in SILC, but not in CLC. CONCLUSIONS A longer UCD is an important predictive factor for difficult cases of SILC, but this finding is not applicable in CLC. The usefulness of UCD is specific to SILC.","Ohira, Masafumi; Shibuya, Kazuaki; Uemura, Kazuhito; Takahashi, Hiroaki; Ito, Yoshio",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,29,1

Seventeen of 21 systematic reviews reported impairments to body function, including cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), muscle function, balance/coordination, gait biomechanics, pain and injury. Six reviews reported activity restrictions in motor skills, running speed/agility and functional mobility, and two found inverse associations between adiposity and physical health-related quality of life (p-HRQOL). Some causal relationships indicated that adiposity inversely predicted p-HRQOL/CRF and CRF/muscle function inversely predicted adiposity. Assessments of physical function were heterogeneous and impacts on participation in life situations meaningful to the individual were largely unknown. Substantial evidence associates childhood overweight/obesity with reduced physical function. Associations were mainly cross-sectional, with causative evidence for some outcomes. Comprehensive physical function assessments by qualified health professionals are needed, along with targeted interventions to address deficits. Research should further examine causality of relationships, underlying mechanisms and participation challenges in real-life contexts.","Tsiros, Margarita D; Tian, Esther J; Shultz, Sarah P; Olds, Timothy; Hills, Andrew P; Duff, Jed; Kumar, Saravana",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,29,0

Several underlying diseases have been described to provoke collateral veins in the abdominal wall. However, the treatment strategy should be uniform. We herein report a case of a successful laparoscopic umbilical hernia repair in a patient with collateral veins in the abdominal wall and umbilicus. A 63-year-old man was referred to the surgical outpatient clinic with a large symptomatic umbilical hernia and collateral veins in the abdominal wall, secondary to an occlusion of both common iliac veins. Because of collateral veins in the umbilicus and the size of the hernial defect, he was offered laparoscopic hernia repair without compromising these veins. Because of the extensive abdominal wall collaterals, duplex sonography vein mapping was performed preoperatively to mark a safe collateral-free area for trocar introduction. The defect was repaired by mesh prosthesis.","Lases, Seilenna S; Eker, Hasan H; Pierik, Engelbertus G J M; Klitsie, Pieter J; de Goede, Barry; Peeters, Mark P F M Vrancken; Kazemier, Geert; Lange, Johan F","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",29,1

Today, DMSO is used mostly for cryopreservation of stem cells, treatment of interstitial cystitis, and as a penetrating vehicle for various drugs. Many adverse reactions have been described in relation to the use of DMSO, but to our knowledge, no overview of the existing literature has been made. Our aim was to conduct a systematic review describing the adverse reactions observed in humans in relation to the use of DMSO. Methods: This systematic review was reported according to the PRISMA-harms (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. The primary outcome was any adverse reactions occurring in humans in relation to the use of DMSO. We included all original studies that reported adverse events due to the administration of DMSO, and that had a population of five or more. Results: We included a total of 109 studies. Gastrointestinal and skin reactions were the commonest reported adverse reactions to DMSO. Most reactions were transient without need for intervention. A relationship between the dose of DMSO given and the occurrence of adverse reactions was seen. Conclusions: DMSO may cause a variety of adverse reactions that are mostly transient and mild. The dose of DMSO plays an important role in the occurrence of adverse reactions. DMSO seems to be safe to use in small doses.

Dexamethasone use might attenuate lung injury in these patients. Objective To determine whether intravenous dexamethasone increases the number of ventilator-free days among patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS. Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter, randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in 41 intensive care units (ICUs) in Brazil. Patients with COVID-19 and moderate to severe ARDS, according to the Berlin definition, were enrolled from April 17 to June 23, 2020. Final follow-up was completed on July 21, 2020. The trial was stopped early following publication of a related study before reaching the planned sample size of 350 patients. Interventions Twenty mg of dexamethasone intravenously daily for 5 days, 10 mg of dexamethasone daily for 5 days or until ICU discharge, plus standard care (n =151) or standard care alone (n = 148). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was ventilator-free days during the first 28 days, defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality at 28 days, clinical status of patients at day 15 using a 6-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1, not hospitalized to 6, death), ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores (range, 0-24, with higher scores indicating greater organ dysfunction) at 48 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days. Results A total of 299 patients (mean [SD] age, 61 [14] years; 37% women) were enrolled and all completed follow-up. Patients randomized to the dexamethasone group had a mean 6.6 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 5.0-8.2) during the first 28 days vs 4.0 ventilator-free days (95% CI, 2.9-5.4) in the standard care group (difference, 2.26; 95% CI, 0.2-4.38; P = .04). At 7 days, patients in the dexamethasone group had a mean SOFA score of 6.1 (95% CI, 5.5-6.7) vs 7.5 (95% CI, 6.9-8.1) in the standard care group (difference, -1.16; 95% CI, -1.94 to -0.38; P = .004). There was no significant difference in the prespecified secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality at 28 days, ICU-free days during the first 28 days, mechanical ventilation duration at 28 days, or the 6-point ordinal scale at 15 days. Thirty-three patients (21.9%) in the dexamethasone group vs 43 (29.1%) in the standard care group experienced secondary infections, 47 (31.1%) vs 42 (28.3%) needed insulin for glucose control, and 5 (3.3%) vs 9 (6.1%) experienced other serious adverse events. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with COVID-19 and moderate or severe ARDS, use of intravenous dexamethasone plus standard care compared with standard care alone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of ventilator-free days (days alive and free of mechanical ventilation) over 28 days.

The purpose of this study is to compare these types of training based on training outcome and time efficiency. METHODS During four training sessions within 1 week (one session per day) 34 medical interns (no laparoscopic experience) practiced on two basic tasks on the Simbionix LAP Mentor virtual-reality (VR) simulator: 'clipping and grasping' and 'cutting'. Group C (criterion-based) (N = 17) trained to reach predefined criteria and stopped training in each session when these criteria were met, with a maximum training time of 1 h. Group T (time-based) (N = 17) trained for a fixed time of 1 h each session. Retention of skills was assessed 1 week after training. In addition, transferability of skills was established using the Haptica ProMIS augmented-reality simulator. RESULTS Both groups improved their performance significantly over the course of the training sessions (Wilcoxon signed ranks, P < 0.05). Both groups showed skill transferability and skill retention. When comparing the performance parameters of group C and group T, their performances in the first, the last and the retention training sessions did not differ significantly (Mann-Whitney U test, P > 0.05). The average number of repetitions needed to meet the criteria also did not differ between the groups. Overall, group C spent less time training on the simulator than did group T (74:48 and 120:10 min, respectively; P < 0.001). Group C performed significantly fewer repetitions of each task, overall and in session 2, 3 and 4. CONCLUSIONS Criterion-based training of basic laparoscopic skills can reduce the overall training time with no impact on training outcome, transferability or retention of skills. Criterion-based should be the training of choice in laparoscopic skills curricula.","Brinkman, Willem M; Buzink, Sonja N; Alevizos, Leonidas; de Hingh, Ignace H J T; Jakimowicz, Jack J",Surgical endoscopy,29,1

METHODS For 28 patients, (18)F-FDG PET was performed before treatment, at the end of the second week of treatment, and at 2 wk and 3 mo after the completion of treatment. Standardized uptake value (SUV), maximum SUV, metabolic tumor volume (MTV), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) were obtained. Early metabolic changes were defined as fractional change (ΔTLG) when (18)F-FDG PET at the end of the second week was compared with pretreatment (18)F-FDG PET. In-treatment metabolic changes, as measured by serial (18)F-FDG PET, were correlated with standard criteria of response evaluation of solid tumors by means of CT imaging (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1). Parameters were analyzed for stratification in progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS When compared with early metabolic nonresponders, a ΔTLG decrease of 38% or more was associated with a significantly longer PFS (1-y PFS 80% vs. 36%, P = 0.02). Pretreatment TLG was found to be a prognostic factor for PFS. CONCLUSION The degree of change in TLG was predictive for response to concomitant chemoradiotherapy as early as the end of the second week into treatment for patients with locally advanced NSCLC. Pretreatment TLG was prognostic for PFS.","Usmanij, Edwin A; de Geus-Oei, Lioe-Fee; Troost, Esther G C; Peters-Bax, Liesbeth; van der Heijden, Erik H F M; Kaanders, Johannes H A M; Oyen, Wim J G; Schuurbiers, Olga C J; Bussink, Johan","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",29,5

Women make up 80% of those receiving weight loss surgery and they experience improvements in fertility. Unfortunately, bariatric surgery in the context of pregnancy is associated with complications, including growth restriction and small-for-gestational age offspring (SGA). SGA offspring have a greater risk for obesity in adulthood, although the mechanism for this SGA-induced obesity is unknown. In a rat model of vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), we previously identified reductions during pregnancy in ghrelin, a stomach-derived hormone that increases appetite and induces growth hormone secretion. Here, we hypothesise that VSG offspring will have altered ghrelin signalling compared to offspring of Sham dams as a result of reduced in utero ghrelin. At postnatal day (PND)21, male and female offspring of dams that have previously received VSG have an increase in mRNA expression for the ghrelin receptor in the hypothalamus compared to Sham offspring, and the expression of GOAT is lower in females compared to males. Liver expression of endogenous ghrelin antagonist, LEAP2, is elevated at PND60 in VSG offspring. Expression of other genes in the growth hormone system (growth hormone-releasing hormone and growth hormone) were not altered. Plasma levels of total ghrelin at PND21 are also not different between VSG and Sham pups. In adult pups, 1-hour chow intake of male but not female VSG offspring given is less than Sham offspring when given 50 µg kg-1 of exogenous ghrelin by i.p. injection. These results indicate that maternal VSG surgery has an impact on ghrelin signalling in offspring and that, as adults, male VSG offspring may be functionally less responsive to ghrelin than controls.","Spann, Redin A; Welch, Bradley A; Grayson, Bernadette E",Journal of neuroendocrinology,29,16

Studies have shown this training increases bystanders' confidence and willingness to provide aid. One high-risk group might be better solicited to take the course: individuals who have been a victim of previous trauma, as high rates of recidivism after trauma are well-established. Given this group's risk for recurrent injury, we evaluated their attitudes toward STB concepts. METHODS We surveyed trauma patients admitted to 3 urban trauma centers in Baltimore from January 8, 2020 to March 14, 2020. The survey was terminated prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Trauma patients hospitalized on any inpatient unit were invited to complete the survey via an electronic tablet. The survey asked about demographics, prior exposure to life-threatening hemorrhage and first aid training, and willingness to help a person with major bleeding. The Johns Hopkins IRB approved waiver of consent for this study. RESULTS Fifty-six patients completed the survey. The majority of respondents had been hospitalized before (92.9%) and had witnessed severe bleeding (60.7%). The majority had never taken a first aid course (60.7%) nor heard of STB (83.9%). Most respondents would be willing to help someone with severe bleeding form a car crash (98.2%) or gunshot wound (94.6%). CONCLUSIONS Most patients admitted for trauma had not heard about Stop the Bleed, but stated willingness to respond to someone injured with major bleeding. Focusing STB education on individuals at high-risk for trauma recidivism may be particularly effective in spreading the message and skills of STB.","Van Winkle, Bonnylin; DiBrito, Sandra R; Amini, Neda; Levy, Matthew J; Haut, Elliott R",The Journal of surgical research,29,1

Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was first identified in Mexico in April 2009 and spread worldwide over a short period of time. Well-validated diagnostic tools that are rapid, sensitive, and specific for the detection and tracking of this virus are needed. Three real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assays for the amplification and detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus were developed, and their performance characteristics were compared with those of other published diagnostic assays. Thirty-nine samples confirmed to be positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus from Alberta, Canada, and six additional samples that were positive for influenza A virus but that were not typeable by using published seasonal influenza H1/H3 virus assays were available for this validation. Amplification and direct sequencing of the products was considered the ""gold standard"" for case identification. The new assays were sensitive and able to reproducibly detect virus in a 10(-6) dilution of 4 x 10(6) 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml when 5 microl was used as the template. They showed 100% specificity and did not cross-react with other respiratory viruses or seasonal influenza A virus subtypes.

The assays had a wide dynamic range for the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus and utilized testing platforms appropriate for high diagnostic throughput with rapid turnaround times. We developed and validated these real-time PCR procedures with the goal that they will be useful for diagnosis and surveillance of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. These findings will contribute to the informed management of this novel virus.","Pabbaraju, Kanti; Wong, Sallene; Wong, Anita A; Appleyard, Greg D; Chui, Linda; Pang, Xiao-Li; Yanow, Stephanie K; Fonseca, Kevin; Lee, Bonita E; Fox, Julie D; Preiksaitis, Jutta K",Journal of clinical microbiology,29,27

The potential benefits, clinical, and oncologic outcomes are still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and oncologic outcomes of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for right colon cancer using propensity score matching analysis. METHODS From December 2013 to June 2017, 174 patients underwent laparoscopic radical right hemicolectomy through a single-incision (n = 32) or a conventional (n = 142) approach. The data were prospectively collected and the patients were matched at a radio of 1:1 according to age, sex, body mass index (BMI), previous abdominal surgeries, comorbidities, ASA score (≤ 2/> 2), and pathologic stage. RESULTS No significant differences were observed in estimated blood loss, time to diet, postoperative pain score, length of hospital stay between the SILS and CLS groups. However, the SILS group showed longer operation time (175 (40) vs 145 (52.5), p = 0.011) and shorter incision length (4 (1.4) vs 7 (1.9), p < 0.001). There were 2 (6.3%) postoperative complications in the SILS group and 5 (15.6%) in the CLS group (p = 0.426). The pathologic outcomes were similar between two groups. The median follow-up period was 26.5 months in the SILS group and 34.9 months in the CLS group (p = 0.002). There were 3 recurrences (9.4%) in the SILS group and 3 (9.4%) in the CLS group. The 3-year disease-free survival rates were 92.4 and 93.8% (p = 0.984), and overall survival rates were 92.3 and 93.0% (p = 0.884) in the SILS and the CLS groups, respectively. No incisional hernia was observed during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS Though single-incision laparoscopic surgery for right colon cancer showed longer operation time in this study, it appears to be a safe and feasible option with comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes to conventional laparoscopic surgery.","Song, Zijia; Li, You; Liu, Kun; Jiang, Yimei; Shi, Yiqing; Ji, Xiaopin; Zhang, Tao; Wu, Haoxuan; Shi, Yi; Zhao, Ren",Surgical endoscopy,29,6

The relationship between the center of mass and base of support is often quantified using the margin of stability. Although people post-stroke increase the margin of stability following perturbations, control deficits may lead to asymmetries in regulation of margins of stability, which may also cause maladaptive coupling between the sagittal and frontal planes during balance-correcting responses. METHODS We assessed how paretic and non-paretic margins of stability are controlled during recovery from forward perturbations and determined how stroke-related impairments influence the coupling between the anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability. Twenty-one participants with post-stroke hemiparesis walked on a treadmill while receiving slip-like perturbations on both limbs at foot-strike. We assessed anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability before perturbations and during perturbation recovery. FINDINGS Participants walked with smaller anteroposterior and larger mediolateral margins of stability on the paretic versus non-paretic sides. When responding to perturbations, participants increased the anteroposterior margin of stability bilaterally by extending the base of support and reducing the excursion of the extrapolated center of mass. The anteroposterior and mediolateral margins of stability in the paretic limb negatively covaried during reactive steps such that increases in anteroposterior were associated with reductions in mediolateral margins of stability. INTERPRETATION Balance training interventions to reduce fall risk post-stroke may benefit from incorporating strategies to reduce maladaptive coupling of frontal and sagittal plane stability.","Buurke, Tom J W; Liu, Chang; Park, Sungwoo; den Otter, Rob; Finley, James M",Clinical biomechanics,29,1

Patient-reported outcome questionnaires are increasingly being considered as the keystones of pelvic floor disorder assessment. An innovative English language multidisciplinary electronic Personal Assessment Questionnaire (ePAQ-PF) was psychometrically validated in 2006. A certified Italian version (I.ePAQ-PF) has been recently made available by the Italian Society of Urodynamics. In this study, we aimed to test the psychometric properties to validate the urinary dimension of the I.ePAQ-PF. METHODS Women complaining of lower urinary tract symptoms were enrolled. After providing informed consent, women filled in the I.ePAQ-PF via a dedicated touch-screen display (T0), together with concurrent questionnaires: International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short form, Urgency Severity Scale, Urogenital Distress Inventory, and Patient Global Impression of Improvement. Cronbach's α and Spearman's correlation coefficients were adopted (validity). A test-retest was performed in 47 cases (reliability), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was analyzed. I.ePAQ-PF was also administered after treatment (T1) and compared with baseline data via a Wilcoxon's test and Cohen's effect-size tests (responsiveness). RESULTS Ninety-three women were included. Internal consistency was confirmed (Cronbach's α >.7). A Spearman's correlation test showed a good correlation (>0.6) between I.ePAQ-PF and conceptually similar questionnaires. I.ePAQ-PF seems to be highly reproducible in all domains (ICC >0.86). The questionnaire scored significantly differently (Wilcoxon test P < .003) in all domains after the treatment. Responsiveness was further confirmed by Cohen's effect size of more than 30%. CONCLUSIONS The Italian ePAQ-PF (urinary domain) fully satisfies the psychometric properties of validity, reliability, and responsiveness and is ready for clinical application in Italian clinical settings.","Marco, Soligo; Nelva Stellio, Leonardo; De Ponti, Elena; Turri, Alice; Del Popolo, Giulio; Finazzi Agrò, Enrico; On Behalf Of The Publication Committee Of The Italian Urodynamic Society Siud,",Neurourology and urodynamics,29,1

In addition to the five canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins (N, P, M, G, and L), the large and complex BEFV genome contains several open reading frames (ORFs) between the G and L genes (α1, α2/α3, β, and γ) encoding proteins of unknown function. We show that the 10.5-kDa BEFV α1 protein is expressed in infected cells and, consistent with previous predictions based on its structure, has the properties of a viroporin. Expression of a BEFV α1-maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein in Escherichia coli was observed to inhibit cell growth and increase membrane permeability to hygromycin B. Increased membrane permeability was also observed in BEFV-infected mammalian cells (but not cells infected with an α1-deficient BEFV strain) and in cells expressing a BEFV α1-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein, which was shown by confocal microscopy to localize to the Golgi complex. Furthermore, the predicted C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of α1, which contains a strong nuclear localization signal (NLS), was translocated to the nucleus when expressed independently, and in an affinity chromatography assay employing a GFP trap, the full-length α1 was observed to interact specifically with importin β1 and importin 7 but not with importin α3. These data suggest that, in addition to its function as a viroporin, BEFV α1 may modulate components of nuclear trafficking pathways, but the specific role thereof remains unclear. Although rhabdovirus accessory genes occur commonly among arthropod-borne rhabdoviruses, little is known of their functions. Here, we demonstrate that the BEFV α1 ORF encodes a protein which has the structural and functional characteristics of a viroporin. We show that α1 localizes in the Golgi complex and increases cellular permeability.

It is critical to understand the mental and physical health of adolescent athletes during this time. OBJECTIVE Describe the health of athletes during COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations. DESIGN Cross sectional. SETTING A national sample recruited via social media. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS 13,002 US adolescent athletes (age=16.3+1.2 yrs., female=53.1%) completed an anonymous online survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) Demographic information included: sex, grade, sports played and zip code. Assessments included the: General Anxiety Disorder-7 Item (GAD-7) for anxiety, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9) for depression, the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (PFABS) for physical activity, and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 (PedsQL) for quality of life. Mental health, physical activity and quality of life variables were compared between sex, grade, sports played and poverty level using means and 95%CI from the survey weighted ANOVA. RESULTS Females reported a higher prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety symptoms (females=43.7% vs. males=28.2%). The PFABS score (mean [95%CI] was highest (best) for grade 9 (14.5 [14.0,15.0]) and lowest for grade 11 (10.9 [10.5,11.3]. The prevalence of depression symptoms was highest in team sport (74.1%) and lowest for individual sport participants (64.9%). The total PedsQL score was lowest (worst) for athletes from counties with the highest poverty levels (high=74.5[73.7,75.3], middle=78.9[78.0,79.8], low=78.3 [77.4,79.1]). CONCLUSIONS The health of US adolescents during the COVID-19 related school closures and sport cancellations varied to differing degrees depending on sex, grade level, type of sport participation and level of poverty. Health policy experts should consider these findings when creating and implementing policies to improve the health of adolescents in the US in the future.","McGuine, Timothy A; Biese, Kevin M; Petrovska, Labina; Hetzel, Scott J; Reardon, Claudia; Kliethermes, Stephanie; Bell, David Robert; Brooks, Alison; Watson, Andrew M",Journal of athletic training,29,16

Few studies, however, have examined whether macroeconomic crises get under the skin to affect educational disparities in health-related biological processes. PURPOSE This study aimed to examine the effect of the economic recession of 2008 (i.e., Great Recession) on educational disparities in cardiometabolic risk and self-reported psychological distress. METHODS Data were drawn from two subsamples of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study: the second wave of the MIDUS sample (pre-recession cohort, N = 985) and the refresher sample (post-recession cohort, N = 863). Educational attainment was categorized into high school education or less, some college, and bachelor's degree or higher. Outcomes included metabolic syndrome, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6, as well as self-reported perceived stress, depressive symptoms, and financial distress. RESULTS Results showed that having a bachelor's degree or higher (compared to having a high school education or less) was more strongly associated with decreased metabolic syndrome symptoms in the post-recession cohort than the pre-recession cohort, above and beyond demographic, health, and behavioral covariates. These findings did not extend to systemic inflammation or psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that chronic macroeconomic stressors may widen the educational gap in physical health, particularly cardiometabolic health, by modifying biological and anthropometric risk factors implicated in metabolic syndrome.","Jiang, Yanping; Boylan, Jennifer Morozink; Zilioli, Samuele",Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,29,31

OBJECTIVES To investigate whether low androgen status inhibits erectile function of rats by inducing pyroptosis in the corpus cavernosum (CC). MATERIALS AND METHODS Thirty-six eight-weeks-old healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were equally divided into six groups: sham-operated group (4w sham, 8w sham), castration group (4w cast, 8w cast) and castration + testosterone (T) group (4w cast + T, 8w cast + T). The rats in castration + T groups were injected with testosterone propionate subcutaneously every other day. After 4 and 8 weeks, the ratio of maximum intracavernous pressure (ICPmax)/mean arterial pressure (MAP), the level of serum T, the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the expression of NOD-like receptor pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC), Caspase-1 p20, gasdermin D-N (GSDMD-N), transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), collagen-I and collagen-III, the ratio of smooth muscle/collagen (SM/C) and the proportion of pyroptotic cells in the CC were analyzed. RESULTS The ratio of ICPmax/MAP (3V/5 V) and SM/C, the level of NO and serum T were significantly decreased in castration groups when compared to other groups (P <0.01). NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1 and GSDMD were mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) in the CC. The expression of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1p20, GSDMD-N, IL-1β, TGF-β1, collagen-I and collagen-III was significantly increased in castration groups when compared with other groups (P <0.01).

In order to ensure nursing students' preparedness for entry into anaesthesia nursing practice, it is necessary to measure whether nursing students have achieved the required competence to practice as anaesthesia care providers. OBJECTIVES To assess the anaesthesia nursing competence of nursing students and to describe factors related to their anaesthesia nursing competence. This study will provide new knowledge to support the curricula of nursing education and new nurses' practice in anaesthesia care. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey design. METHODS Data from a sample of Finnish nursing students (n = 205) were collected by using an on-line/paper and pencil survey (the Anaesthesia Nursing Competence Scale, 7 categories) in 2017. The assessment was based on self-assessment and used a Visual Analogue Scale (0-100). Descriptive statistics, a Pearson correlation coefficient, independent sample t-tests and a multivariable regression were used to analyse the data. RESULTS The self-assessed overall competence of graduating nursing students was 59 (range 43-73). Approximately half of the students reached an acceptable level (60≤) and half did not. The highest self-assessed category was collaboration within patient care, and the lowest was knowledge of anaesthesia patient care. The number of credits, anaesthesia courses, and experience of clinical practice in anaesthesia nursing were significantly related to anaesthesia nursing competence. CONCLUSIONS Competence development in the knowledge of anaesthesia patient care should be considered in general nursing education. Student nurses' competence could be developed by providing more opportunities for theoretical studies and clinical practice in anaesthesia nursing. A specialised post-registration education in anaesthesia nursing might be one solution to overcome the limitations in the competence that general nursing education is not fully able to cover for anaesthesia nursing.","Jeon, Yunsuk; Ritmala-Castrén, Marita; Meretoja, Riitta; Vahlberg, Tero; Leino-Kilpi, Helena",Nurse education today,29,24

It affects every cellular process including differentiation, metabolism and cell cycle. Eukaryotic protein kinases (ePK) catalyse the transfer of a phosphate from ATP onto proteins, which regulates fast changes in protein activity, structure or subcellular localisation. The systematic identification of substrates is thus crucial to characterise the functions of kinases and determine the pathways they regulate, and even more so when studying the impact of pathogens-excreted kinases on the host cell signal transduction. Several strategies and approaches have been used to identify substrates, but all show important limitations thus calling for the development of new efficient and more convenient approaches for kinase substrate identification. Herein, we present SILAkin, a novel and easy method to identify substrates that is applicable to most kinases. It combines phosphatase treatment, pulse heating, in vitro kinase assay (IVKA) and SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture)-based quantitative mass spectrometry (MS). We developed SILAkin using the Leishmania casein kinase 1 (L-CK1.2) as experimental model. Leishmania, an intracellular parasite causing Leishmaniasis, releases L-CK1.2 in its host cell. Applying this novel assay allowed us to gain unprecedented insight into host-pathogen interactions through the identification of host substrates phosphorylated by pathogen-excreted kinases. We identified 225 substrates, including 85% previously unknown that represent novel mammalian CK1 targets, and defined a novel CK1 phosphorylation motif. The substratome was validated experimentally by L-CK1.2 and human CK1δ, demonstrating the efficiency of SILAkin to identify new substrates and revealing novel regulatory pathways. Finally, SILAkin was instrumental in highlighting host pathways potentially regulated by L-CK1.2 in Leishmania-infected host cells, described by the GO terms ‘viral & symbiotic interaction’, ‘apoptosis’, ‘actin cytoskeleton organisation’, and ‘RNA processing and splicing’. SILAkin thus can generate important mechanistic insights into the signalling of host subversion by these parasites and other microbial pathogen adapted for intracellular survival.","Smirlis, Despina; Dingli, Florent; Sabatet, Valentin; Roth, Aileen; Knippchild, Uwe; Loew, Damarys; Späth, Gerald F.; Rachidi, Najma",bioRxiv,29,24

The increase in the number of students in higher education has placed extreme pressure on assessment practices, often leading to a teacher having hundreds of assignments to correct, not only giving feedback too late, but also low quality feedback, as it is humanly impossible to correct all these assessments by giving quality feedback in such a short time. Due to the social confinement caused by the pandemic of COVID-19, there was the need to change the evaluation method initially associated with a thin exam, to a continuous evaluation method based on multiple weekly assignments.

Among the most important applications of these molecules is their use as an enabling excipient in pharmaceutical formulations to provide the necessary solubility, stability and bioavailability for a drug to be effectively used. The most typical interaction mechanism of small molecular groups with CDs is the formation of host-guest inclusion complexes. The thermodynamic affinity constant between CDs and drugs should not be too strong, since then the biological activity could be negated by the formation of the complex. In the opposite scenario, if the affinity constant is too weak, the complex is barely formed and the amount of CD required in the formulation may become too great. Thus, a balance between the affinity of the CD and the drug is necessary for an optimal formulation. Additionally in the case of modified CDs and specific drug complexes there are further questions concerning the effect that the locations and number of substitutions plays in complexation. In the present work, this question is explored by using sulphobutylether-β-cyclodextrin and remdesivir, the only antiviral medication currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treating COVID-19, as a case study. This paper presents results from an orthogonal study using isothermal titration calorimetry measurements and biased molecular dynamics simulations that provide complementary information. Isothermal titration calorimetry delves into the global impact of the species distribution while molecular dynamics simulations deals with specific chemical structures. The goal is to provide useful information to optimize pharmaceutical formulations based on modified CDs, specifically in the case of remdesivir, used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the main conclusions could be extended to the interaction of other drugs with modified cyclodextrins.","Piñeiro, Ángel Pipkin James Antle Vince Garcia-Fandino Rebeca",Journal of Molecular Liquids,29,19

Preliminary reports suggest a high incidence of infection and mortality with SARS-CoV-2 in patients receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT). The aims of this study are to report characteristics, rates and outcomes of all patients affected by infection with SARS-CoV-2 undergoing RRT in Scotland. Methods Study design was an observational cohort study. Data were linked between the Scottish Renal Registry, Health Protection Scotland and the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group national data sets using a unique patient identifier (Community Health Index (CHI)) for each individual by the Public Health and Intelligence unit of Public Health, Scotland. Descriptive statistics and survival analyses were performed. Results During the period 1st March 2020 to 31st May 2020, 110 patients receiving RRT tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 amounting to 2% of the prevalent RRT population. Of those affected, 87 were receiving haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis and 24 had a renal transplant. Patients who tested positive were older and more likely to reside in more deprived postcodes. Mortality was high at 26.7% in the dialysis patients and 29.2% in the transplant patients. There was consistency between Scottish renal units of the measures implemented to prevent or reduce transmission but timing varied. Conclusion The rate of detected SARS-CoV-2 in people receiving RRT in Scotland was relatively low but with a high mortality for those demonstrating infection. Although impossible to confirm, it appears that the measures taken within dialysis units coupled with the national shielding policy, have been effective in protecting this population from infection.","Bell, S.; Campbell, J.; McDonald, J.; O'Neill, M.; Watters, C.; Buck, K.; Cousland, Z.; Findlay, M.; Lone, N.; Metcalfe, W.; Methven, S.; Peel, R.; Almond, A.; Sanu, V.; Spalding, E.; Thomson, P.; Mark, P.; Traynor, J.",,29,32

The public’s fears of COVID-19 cases have led to a negative stigma. As part of health workers in disaster management’s main pillars in health services, nurses are most vulnerable to infection and not free from the stigma. Objective: This study aimed to describe the social stigma against nurses taking care of patients with COVID-19 and experiencing suspected or probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases in Indonesia. Methods: This study was a mixed-method study using a sequential explanatory design-participant selection model. The selection of respondents used the convenience sampling technique. The number of respondents in the quantitative stage was 118 respondents. For qualitative data, selected participants were respondents with a stigma score of more than 21 nurses and willing to continue the interview process. There were 11 participants in the qualitative stage. This study used the modified Stigma Scale of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalog for quantitative data and four semi-structured questions to obtain qualitative data. Quantitative data were processed in descriptive statistics, and a thematic analysis was performed to analyze the qualitative data. Results: The highest stigma score of 118 respondents was 37, and the lowest score was zero. The stigma score had a mean of 12.28 (SD ± 7.9). The higher the score obtained leads to a higher level of stigma received. From a total of 11 participants interviewed, four main themes emerged: rejection, feeling down and afraid, sources of support, and professional vigilance. Conclusion: The social stigma experienced by nurses comes from colleagues and society and impacts psychological distress. Support from families and colleagues strengthens nurses in facing social stigma. Nevertheless, nurses uphold the values to remain grateful and carry out professional responsibilities in taking care of patients. Nurses should be provided with psychological support and be prepared for disasters to provide excellent health services and reduce adverse mental health.

Meanwhile, we find that well-being drops the most in regions with high-level risk of COVID-19, and happiness in regions with higher or lower income levels are more vulnerable to the effects of the epidemic, in comparison to the intermediate-level income regions. Females? sentiment exhibits more sensitivity to the epidemic situation than does males? sentiment. Furthermore, the timing of major public events also plays a sizable role in determining self-reported happiness, and our results suggest that pandemic alerts announced by the WHO significantly increased the loss of well-being, while announcements of city-unlocking had the opposite impact. The interaction between the outbreak and real-time expressed happiness provides an important opportunity for reflection on the future governance policies of epidemic containment.

Public health authorities attempt to fight against the virus while maintaining economic activity. In the face of the uncertainty derived from the virus, all the countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions for limiting the mobility and maintaining social distancing. In order to support these interventions, some health authorities and governments have opted for sharing very fine-grained data related with the impact of the virus in their territories. Geographical science is playing a major role in terms of understanding how the virus spreads across regions. Location of cases allows identifying the spatial patterns traced by the virus. Understanding these patterns makes controlling the virus spread feasible, minimizes its impact in vulnerable regions, anticipates potential outbreaks, or elaborates predictive risk maps. The application of geospatial analysis to fine-grained data must be urgently adopted for optimal decision making in real and near-real time. However, some aspects related to process and map sensitive health data in emergency cases have not yet been sufficiently explored. Among them include concerns about how these datasets with sensitive information must be shown depending on aspects related to data aggregation, scaling, privacy issues, or the need to know in advance the particularities of the study area. In this paper, we introduce our experience in mapping fine-grained data related to the incidence of the COVID-19 during the first wave in the region of Galicia (NW Spain), and after that we discuss the mentioned aspects.","Carballada, Angel Miramontes Balsa-Barreiro Jose",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,29,28

The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 transmembrane spike (S) glycoprotein with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (hACE2) is the primary method of virus entry to the cell. ACE2 is a transmembrane enzyme involved in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This enzyme plays pivotal roles in blood pressure regulations and also electrolyte homeostasis. The expression of ACE2 in various skin cells has been demonstrated in previous studies. Keratinocytes in the epidermis show an exceptionally high expression of ACE2. In addition to human skin, ACE2 is also found in animals' tissues and were exceptionally high in cats and dogs' skin and eyes. This finding suggests their obscure role in COVID-19 transmission. Cutaneous symptoms of COVID-19 in humans exist as the consequence of ACE2 presence in the skin. The possible mechanisms of COVID-19 clinical manifestations in the skin are upregulated innate immune human response, hypercoagulable state, and non-structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2. These processes are presented as different dermatologic manifestations, which are maculopapular rash, papulovesicular rash, and livedo reticularis. This review aims to link the theoretical framework and published findings to establish the connection between ACE2 expression in skin and cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19.","Denita, Meiliani",Bioscientia Medicina,29,7

Preceding research illustrated that one of the main routes for the spread of COVID-19 is respiratory aerosol transmission, where the generation of the droplets is created by coughing, sneezing, breathing, and speaking. Therefore, innovative control methods are necessity needed to manage the epidemic. Microwave has been extensively applied to inactivate microorganisms like viruses in many different media. The previous techniques were applied in the laboratory just to virus samples. In this proposal, we use the microwave radiation to inactivate the airborne viruses in the ambient air inside the rooms of hospitals and clinics. The main contribution of this paper is to design a compact antenna array using smart antenna techniques to cover the room with uniform microwave power.

The evident importance of e-learning in higher education has resulted in a prenominal increase in the number of e-learning systems delivering various forms of services, especially when traditional education (face-to-face) was suddenly forced to move online due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, assessing e-learning systems is pivotal in the interest of effective use and successful implementation. By relying on the related literature review, an extensive model is developed by integrating the information system success model (ISSM) and the technology acceptance model (TAM) to illustrate key factors that influence the success of e-learning systems. Based on the proposed model, theory-based hypotheses are tested through structural equation modeling employing empirical data gathered through a survey questionnaire of 537 students from three private universities in Jordan. The findings demonstrate that quality factors, including instructor, technical system, support service, educational systems, and course content quality, have a direct positive influence on students' satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and system use. Moreover, self-regulated learning negatively affects students' satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and system use. Students' satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and system use are key predictors of their academic performance. These findings provide e-learning stakeholders with important implications that guarantee the effective, successful use of e-learning that positively affects students' learning.","Al-Adwan, A.

In an effort to refine the black hole mass for this (currently) rare class of object, we have explored multiple black hole mass scaling relations, such as those involving the (not previously used) velocity dispersion, logarithmic spiral-arm pitch angle, total galaxy stellar mass, nuclear star cluster mass, rotational velocity, and colour of NGC 3319, to obtain ten mass estimates, of differing accuracy. We have calculated a mass of $3.14_{-2.20}^{+7.02}\times10^4\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, with a confidence of 84% that it is $\leq$$10^5\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$, based on the combined probability density function from seven of these individual estimates. Our conservative approach excluded two black hole mass estimates (via the nuclear star cluster mass, and the fundamental plane of black hole activity $\unicode{x2014}$ which only applies to black holes with low accretion rates) that were upper limits of $\sim$$10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, and it did not use the $M_\bullet\unicode{x2013}L_{\rm 2-10\,keV}$ relation's prediction of $\sim$$10^5\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$.

We aimed to demonstrate the effect of anti-COVID-19 agent remdesivir on renal fibrosis. Methods Remdesivir and its active nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 were used to treat TGF-β stimulated renal fibroblasts (NRK-49F) and human renal epithelial cells (HK2). Cell viability was determined by CCK8 assay, and fibrotic markers were measured by Western blotting. Vehicle or remdesivir were given by intraperitoneal injection or renal injection through the left ureter in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mice. Serum and kidneys were harvested. The concentrations of remdesivir and GS-441524 were measured using LC-MS/MS. Renal and liver function were assessed. Renal fibrosis was evaluated by Masson’s trichrome staining and Western blotting. Results Remdesivir and GS-441524 inhibited cell proliferation and the expression of fibrotic markers (fibronectin, pSmad3, and aSMA) in NRK-49F and HK2 cells. Intraperitoneal injection or renal injection of remdesivir attenuated renal fibrosis of UUO kidneys. Renal and liver function were not changed in remdesivir treated UUO mice. Remdesivir can not be detected, but two remdesivir metabolites were detected after injection.

Identification of viral targets that are indispensable for the virus can be targeted to inhibit mutation-based new escape variant development. The 5’-polyU tract of the antigenome offers such a target. Host cells do not harbor 5’-polyU tracts on any of their transcripts, making the tract an attractive, virus-specific target. Inhibiting the 5’-polyU can limit the use of the tract as template to generate 3’ polyA tails of +RNAs of coronaviruses. Here, a modified DNA oligo with 3’ polyAs is used to target the 5-polyU tract in mouse coronavirus (MHV-A59). The oligo treatment in mouse 17CL-1 cells infected with MHV-A59 significantly prevented virus-induced cell deaths. This proof-of-concept result shows a unique mode of action against mouse coronavirus without affecting host cells, and can be used for the development of novel classes of drugs that inhibit coronavirus infection in host cells, specifically by the COVID-19-causing virus SARS-CoV-2. In addition, as the 5’-polyU tract is immediately generated upon infection, the tag can also be targeted for reliable early detection of viral infection. End of Abstract The global havoc brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic is becoming more exacerbated by the rapidly spreading etiological SARS-CoV-2 virus variants [1]. Though vaccination against the virus has paced up, apprehensions surrounding so-called immune-escape-variants raise concern for a worsening of the pandemic. Lack of enough vaccines have caused many countries to extend the gap between the two doses of vaccinations, which may lead to long durations of intermediate levels of immunity that could accelerate the emergence of new variants [2]. The potential consequences of emerging variants are increased transmissibility, increased pathogenicity and the ability to escape natural- or vaccine-induced immunity [3]. Drugs with high efficacy against the virus have not been developed yet. Concerns also surround whether drug-escape-variants, like immune-escape-variants, can evolve against any drug developed targeting the virus. Targeting coding regions directly can potentially lead to the evolution of escape variants.","Ullah, Hemayet; Averick, Saadyah; Tang, Qiyi",bioRxiv,29,1

We did this to start patients on their medications efficiently and safely and to manage the increase in workload. However, with the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, we had to stop these clinics immediately, but, we did not have capacity to start everyone on their medications in a timely manner by telephone. Telephoning each individual took > 9 hours per week, whereas previously it took 3-4 haours. Objectives: We wanted to start patients on their all rheumatology medications safely and efficiently (within 10 days). Methods: By April 2202, we had organised the filming of 10 short healthcare videos to give patients all the information they required to start a range of DMARDs and biologics. We developed a new protocol (fig 1);patients are asked to view the relevant video, contact our department to confirm they understand the safety monitoring, risks, potential side effects, dose increases etc. As soon as they confirm by email they are happy to start treatment, a prescription is generated and emailed to the hospital outpatient pharmacy, where it is dispensed and delivered to the patient's home. We send a follow up reminder letter about blood test monitoring etc (copy to GP) and a 'shared care agreement' to GP. They are given the option to have a telephone clinic appointment with a specialist nurse if required. Results: Of those requiring DMARDs, 62% reviewed the video, completed the checklist and confirmed by email they were happy to start treatment, within 24-hours. 88% had completed within 7 days. Over half the patients (56%) were starting DMARDs for the first time, of those 8% requested a telephone consultation to discuss treatment further with the Rheumatology nurses. Of the 44% of patients already taking a DMARD and due to start a second medication 24% required a telephone clinic appointment. As this is a new service, we asked for feedback, receiving replies from 34%, all scoring between 9/10 and 10/10. We have released > 7 hours of specialist nurse time for telephone/helpline clinics. Conclusion: The development of digital / remote medication clinics has been a success and we will continue with this approach. We have limited face-to-face appointments, started patients on rheumatology medications more quickly and efficiently than previously (but maintained safety), allowed the nursing staff time to spend more time working in our telephone clinics and have had excellent patient feedback. Although, we are aware, this is at a cost of no peer-to-peer interaction, which has been of value in the past.","Penford, R.; Wren, E.; Mackay, K.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,29,17

This study is aimed to examine the effects of gender, age, and internet competency on internet usage among academicians during the MCO. A total of 223 respondents participated in this study through a purposive sampling method which was conducted among academicians using an online questionnaire. Chi-square analysis was performed to examine the association among genders, age groups, and internet competency with internet usage. The results of the study revealed that there is a significant relationship between the respondents' genders and internet competency on internet usage among academicians during the MCO (χ2 = 0.002, p<0.05). However, it was found that there is no significant relationship between the respondents' age and their internet usage (χ2 = 0.665, p>0.05). In a situation where the country is facing the COVID-19 pandemic and the MCO, the use of the internet has become very important. This study also found that there are differences in internet usage among respondents of different genders and levels of efficiency. But when the online learning method was implemented, all academicians were no exception. Therefore, the age difference of academicians was found not to affect the use of the internet.

Methods: We analyzed data based on the preliminary results of the patients registry from the ongoing project “Patient's Opinion on COVID-19 in Rheumatic Diseases (POPCORD)”. The registry contains data collected directly from Russian-speaking patients with different RD who completed a special questionnaire, located on the website https://revmo-covid.ru/. The questionnaire includes information on whether the patient had COVID-19 and related information, as well as information on rheumatic disease and its treatment. Results: 1050 patients (92% from Russian Federation, 8% from other locations) completed the survey -93% females, mean age 40,28±11,26 (M±SD, median 38 [32;48]), BMI 24,52±5,38 (median 23,42 [21;27]), disease duration 7,91±8,46 (median 5,00 [2;11]). Diagnoses reported: rheumatoid arthritis (49%), ankylosing spondylitis (14%), systemic lupus erythematosus (13%), psoriatic arthritis (6%), Sjogren's disease (5%), systemic sclerosis (3%), other (10%). 51% of respondents indicated concomitant conditions: arterial hypertension (19%), obesity (15%), kidney disease (11%), cardiovascular disease (7%), liver disease (6%), IBD (5%), other lung diseases, including ILD (5%). 96% of patients reported constant intake of antirheumatic drugs: steroids (37%), NSAIDs (46%), hydroxychloroquine (22%), csDMARDs (66%), bDMARDs (17%), tsDMARDs (2%). 344 (31,8%) patients reported COVID-19 or suspected SASR-CoV2 viral pneumonia, 282 (84,4%) were treated as outpatients, 52 (15,6%) were hospitalized.

Similar samples were collected from cows in three other dairy herds experiencing non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea during the survey period. Coronavirus was the only enteric pathogen identified by immune electron microscopy (IEM) in all six outbreaks, occurring in 26 of 29 (90 per cent) of the affected cows and in one of 11 normal cows from the same herds. Nineteen of 26 affected cows (73 per cent) developed greater than four-fold increases in neutralising antibody titres to the Mebus strain of bovine coronavirus, compared with two of eight normal cows in the same herds. No cows showed greater than four-fold increases in antibody titres to bovine virus diarrhoea virus. None of the cows from the three herds with non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea shed coronavirus in faeces detectable by IEM or developed greater than two-fold rises in coronavirus antibody titres in paired sera. No enteric pathogens were identified in two of the herds. However, two cows in the third herd shed a group B rotavirus detected by IEM. These findings provide additional evidence for a possible role for bovine coronavirus in the aetiology of winter dysentery. Furthermore, this is the first report of a group B rotavirus associated with diarrhoea in adult cattle.","Saif, L J; Brock, K V; Redman, D R; Kohler, E M",The Veterinary record,29,6

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: 114 respondents were included in an open non-randomized controlled study. 66 сcomorbid patients (71% - men; median age - 61(43; 80) years) with verified Ischemic Heart Disease: functional class II-III angina pectoris were included in the Main Group. 78 functionally healthy young people (23% - men; median age - 23(20; 30) years) who did not play sports regularly were a Control Group. EPEA was made on a digital software hardware device Bio-Well 2.0 (Bio-Well 2.0, Russia-USA). RESULTS Results: Significant differences in AEFE indicators in functionally healthy individuals and patients with NCDs were established. Qualitative indicators of AEFE (indicators of area, intensity, energy of emission) were significantly higher in functionally healthy individuals compared to patients with NCDs. Geometric indicators of AEFE (indicators of length of contours and radii of luminescence) were significantly higher in patients with NCDs than in healthy individuals, which confirmed the visually uneven and more complex contour of luminescence of the fingers in them. CONCLUSION Conclusions: AEFE parameters have significant differences in functionally healthy individuals and patients with NCDs. AEFE is a fundamentally new promising approach to assessing the level of activity of metabolic processes at the tissue level in living biological systems, including in the normal human body and in patients with NCDs.","Nevoit, Ganna V; Mintser, Ozar P; Potiazhenko, Maksim М; Babintseva, Larisa Yu",Wiadomosci lekarskie,29,19

On virions, the 180-kDa S glycoprotein of the MHV-A59 strain can be cleaved by trypsin to form the 90-kDa N-terminal receptor-binding subunit (S1) and the 90-kDa membrane-anchored fusion subunit (S2). Incubation of virions with purified, soluble CEACAM1a receptor proteins at 37 degrees C and pH 6.5 neutralizes virus infectivity (B. D. Zelus, D. R. Wessner, R. K. Williams, M. N. Pensiero, F. T. Phibbs, M. deSouza, G. S. Dveksler, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 72:7237-7244, 1998). We used liposome flotation and protease sensitivity assays to investigate the mechanism of receptor-induced, temperature-dependent virus neutralization. After incubation with soluble receptor at 37 degrees C and pH 6.5, virions became hydrophobic and bound to liposomes. Receptor binding induced a profound, apparently irreversible conformational change in S on the viral envelope that allowed S2, but not S1, to be degraded by trypsin at 4 degrees C. Various murine CEACAM proteins triggered conformational changes in S on recombinant MHV strains expressing S glycoproteins of MHV-A59 or MHV-4 (MHV-JHM) with the same specificities as seen for virus neutralization and virus-receptor activities. Increased hydrophobicity of virions and conformational change in S2 of MHV-A59 could also be induced by incubating virions at pH 8 and 37 degrees C, without soluble receptor. Surprisingly, the S protein of recombinant MHV-A59 virions with a mutation, H716D, that precluded cleavage between S1 and S2 could also be triggered to undergo a conformational change at 37 degrees C by soluble receptor at neutral pH or by pH 8 alone. A novel 120-kDa subunit was formed following incubation of the receptor-triggered S(A59)H716D virions with trypsin at 4 degrees C. The data show that unlike class 1 fusion glycoproteins of other enveloped viruses, the murine coronavirus S protein can be triggered to a membrane-binding conformation at 37 degrees C either by soluble receptor at neutral pH or by alkaline pH alone, without requiring previous activation by cleavage between S1 and S2.","Zelus, Bruce D; Schickli, Jeanne H; Blau, Dianna M; Weiss, Susan R; Holmes, Kathryn V",Journal of virology,29,24

As compared with the conventional procedure for the detection of the K99 antigen, ELISA seemed to be a least as sensitive and had the advantage that samples could be stored at --20 degrees C before testing. In addition many samples could be handled at the same time and the results became available quickly.

All the isolates were initially identified as Campylobacter-like organisms based on biochemical and phenotypic characteristics. DNA extractions from 51 of these isolates were subjected to PCR using primers specific for Helicobacter spp. and Campylobacter spp. Of the isolates, 92% (47 of 51 isolates) were positive for Campylobacter spp., 41% (21 of 51 isolates) were positive for Helicobacter spp., 33% (17 of 51 isolates) were positive for both genera, 59% (30 of 51 isolates) were positive only for Campylobacter spp., and 8% (4 of 51) were positive only for Helicobacter spp. Sixteen of the 47 Campylobacter-positive cultures were positive for more than one Campylobacter spp. Based on a species-specific PCR assay, 83% of the isolates were identified as Campylobacter helveticus, 47% of the isolates were identified as Campylobacter upsaliensis, and 6% of the isolates were classified as Campylobacter jejuni. The 1.2-kb PCR products of the 16S rRNA genes of 19 Helicobacter species isolates were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Of the five different RFLP patterns obtained, two clustered with Helicobacter (""Flexispira"") taxon 8, one clustered with Helicobacter bilis, one clustered with Helicobacter canis, and the remaining pattern was closely related to a novel Helicobacter sp. strain isolated from a woodchuck. The sequence data for the 16S rRNA genes of 10 Helicobacter spp. validated the RFLP-based identification of these isolates. This study demonstrated that biochemical and phenotypic characteristics of microaerobic organisms in cat feces were insufficient to characterize mixed Helicobacter and Campylobacter infections. Molecular structure-based diagnostics using genus- and species-specific PCR, RFLP analysis, and 16S rRNA sequence analysis enabled the identification of multiple microaerobic species in individual animals. The clinical relevance of enteric Helicobacter and Campylobacter coinfection in cats will require further studies.","Shen, Z; Feng, Y; Dewhirst, F E; Fox, J G",Journal of clinical microbiology,29,1

The subclinical course of the infection in BN rats was characterized by an early rise of neutralizing antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 7 days post-infection. At this time in LE rats, neutralizing antibodies were not detectable in the CSF and the animals developed neurological signs of infection. Subsequently, LE rats recovered from disease. This process was accompanied by increasing titres of virus-neutralizing antibodies. Within the CNS parenchyma of both rat strains, equivalent numbers of IgM-secreting cells were detected. However, in BN rats, virus-specific IgG secreting cells appeared earlier and in higher numbers. Moreover, based on the size of zones of antibody secreted by single cells in the Spot-ELISA assay, it appeared that cells from BN rats secreted IgG antibody of higher affinity. These data suggest that early maturation of antiviral antibody responses in the resistant BN rat probably restricts the spread of viral infection to small foci within the CNS, resulting in a subclinical level of primary demyelination. In contrast, the absence of neutralizing antibodies in the susceptible LE rats favours spread of the virus throughout the CNS, resulting finally in severe neurological disease.","Schwender, S; Imrich, H; Dörries, R",Immunology,29,17

The disease pattern includes lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the central, peripheral and autonomic nervous system. Seven avian bornavirus genotypes have been identified during the last years. So far only monoinfections with a single genotype of ABV have been attributed to PDD cases. However, after a recent survey discovered a case of a double infection with two different ABV genotypes, this seemed to indicate the need for a more systematic search for mixed infections. Brain specimens from 21 psittacine birds affected with PDD were examined. Aim of the investigation was to generate partial ABV sequences of a part of the matrix protein (M) gene and to evaluate whether sequences of more than one ABV genotype were present. RNA was extracted, and subjected to reverse transcriptase PCR with primer pairs generating a partial sequence of the matrix protein (M) gene, followed by a cloning procedure. Ten clones per case were sequenced in order to elucidate whether sequences characteristic for one or more than one genotype were present. In 19 of 21 cases clear M gene sequences could be generated; in two cases nucleic acid amplification failed. Seven birds were infected with ABV 2 and nine with ABV 4, representing the predominant genotypes in Europe. Two cases showed a mixed infection with ABV 2 and ABV 4, and one case a mixed infection with ABV 2 and ABV 6. These results suggest that the molecular cloning method is a useful tool for distinguishing between single and multiple infection events by different ABV genotypes.","Nedorost, N; Maderner, C A; Kolodziejek, J; Lussy, H; Nowotny, N; Weissenböck, H",Avian diseases,29,1

The changes in the cellular IL-6 promoter activities were detected by dual-luciferase assay, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expressions in the cells were determined using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS Influenza virus replicative intermediate dsRNA obviously up-regulated IL-6 expression in the cells. HDAC inhibitor TSA significantly enhanced the activity of IL-6 promoter and increased IL-6 mRNA expression in A549 cells, and HDAC3 may play an important role in this process. HDAC inhibitor TSA and DNMT inhibitor DAC showed no synergic effect in regulating IL-6 expression.

METHODS The clinical files of women having influenza A (H1N1) attending the Monica Pretelini maternal-perinatal hospital's (HMPMP) intensive care unit in Toluca, Mexico, were reviewed. According to international recommendations, clinical detection of possible new cases of this disease was kept an open as a second step. RESULTS Five women suffering influenza A (H1N1) was attended at HMPMP's intensive care unit during 2009; only one survived. No differences in body mass index were found when comparing the anthropometric characteristics to another group of women affected by acute respiratory diseases; in fact, this parameter was below the limits for being overweight in both cases.

The relationship between cough and the severity of asthma is ill defined. A study was undertaken to test the hypotheses that, in children with asthma who cough as a major part of their asthma symptoms, cough receptor sensitivity (CRS) is heightened during an acute severe exacerbation of asthma but not in the non-acute phase and airway calibre or its change correlates with CRS. METHODS Spirometric measurements and the capsaicin CRS test were performed on children admitted to hospital for an acute severe exacerbation of asthma. Nasal secretions were tested for viruses. The children were grouped into those who usually cough with asthma episodes and those who do not. The tests were repeated 7-10 days and 4-6 weeks later. The CRS outcome measure used was the concentration of capsaicin required to stimulate two (Cth) and five coughs (C5). RESULTS The CRS of the group who coughed (n = 15) was significantly higher than those who did not cough (n = 16) (mean difference log Cth 0.77 mumol (95% CI 0.35 to 1.18), C5 0.72 mumol (95% CI 0.26 to 1.18)) during acute asthma but not after the exacerbation. CRS was not significantly different between groups based on the presence of a viral infection. Neither forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) nor its change correlated with CRS nor its change. CONCLUSIONS In children with asthma CRS is heightened in acute severe asthma in the subgroup of children who have cough as a significant symptom with their asthma episodes.

For these applications, it is critical to understand the in vivo interactions of CPMV within the mammalian system. Although the bioavailability of CPMV in the mouse has been demonstrated, the specific interactions between CPMV and mammalian cells need to be characterized further. Here we demonstrate that although the host range for replication of CPMV is confined to plants, mammalian cells nevertheless bind and internalize CPMV in significant amounts. This binding is mediated by a conserved 54-kDa protein found on the plasma membranes of both human and murine cell lines. Studies using a deficient cell line, deglycosidases, and glycosylation inhibitors showed that the CPMV binding protein (CPMV-BP) is not glycosylated. A possible 47-kDa isoform of the CPMV-BP was also detected in the organelle and nuclear subcellular fraction prepared from murine fibroblasts. Further characterization of CPMV-BP is important to understand how CPMV is trafficked through the mammalian system and may shed light on how picornaviruses may have evolved between plant and animal hosts.","Koudelka, Kristopher J; Rae, Chris S; Gonzalez, Maria J; Manchester, Marianne",Journal of virology,29,33

But because many laparoscopic fundoplications have been undertaken, surgeons frequently encounter patients in need of ""redo"" operations. This study was undertaken to evaluate the robotic approach versus laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) approach for redo fundoplications. With an Institutional Review Board approval, 64 patients undergoing LESS (n = 32) or robotic (n = 32) redo antireflux operations were prospectively followed up. Data are presented as median (mean + SD). For LESS versus robotic redo operations, the operative duration was 145 (143 ± 33.5) versus 196 (208 ± 76.7) minutes (P < 0.01), estimated blood loss was 50 (80 ± 92.1) versus 20 (43 ± 57.1) mL (P = 0.07), and length of stay was 1 (3 ± 5.4) versus 1 (2 ± 1.9) day (P = 0.57); 1 LESS operation was converted to ""open.""

In each case, the cloned DNA represents approximately 10% of the genome. The cloned sequence for each virus encompasses the 3' noncoding region, the nucleocapsid protein gene, and a large portion of the matrix protein gene. 32P-labeled cDNA probes prepared from these clones detected as little as 25 pg of RNA from the parental virus but did not detect RNA from the nonparental virus even when amounts of up to 10 ng per dot were used. This specificity reflects the antigenic diversity between these two coronaviruses. The hybridization assay could also detect coronaviruses antigenically closely related to the parental virus but not coronaviruses belonging to an antigenically unrelated subgroup. Dot blot hybridization for transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus diagnosis was compared with the routine procedures of virus isolation and electron microscopy as a diagnostic test.","Shockley, L J; Kapke, P A; Lapps, W; Brian, D A; Potgieter, L N; Woods, R",Journal of clinical microbiology,29,33

Despite rigorous meta-analyses looking into these techniques, there is no summary and additionally no algorithm to help guide diagnostic testing. Our objective is to perform a systematic review of the literature and to provide evidence-based algorithms for diagnosing or ruling out COVID-19. METHODS Data were gathered using PubMed and Ovid research databases using a predefined medical subject heading (MeSH) based search, and sources that were included in the study had their references reviewed to screen for more sources for this study. Sources were collected up to 23 August 2020. Two researchers searched through the databases for articles and data/articles meeting inclusion criteria were extracted.

A novel 1.2-kb gene, located between the genes for the membrane and nucleocapsid proteins, was identified. This gene, the 3'-most 0.5 kb of which is also present in the genome of the equine torovirus isolate Berne virus (BEV), codes for a class I membrane protein displaying 30% sequence identity with the hemagglutinin-esterases (HEs) of coronaviruses and influenza C viruses. Heterologous expression of the BoTV HE gene yielded a 65,000-molecular weight N-glycosylated protein displaying acetylesterase activity. Serologic evidence indicates that the HE homolog is expressed during the natural infection and represents a prominent antigen. By using an antiserum raised against residues 13 to 130 of HE, the HE protein was detected in radioiodinated, sucrose gradient-purified BoTV preparations. Formal evidence that HE is a structural protein was provided by immunoelectron microscopy. In addition to the large, 17- to 20-nm spikes, BoTV virions possess shorter surface projections (6 nm on average). We postulate that these surface projections, which are absent from the BEV virion, are composed of the BoTV HE homolog.

The results were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively collected database. Operative steps and instrumentation for the procedure were standardized. A standard perioperative care plan was used. RESULTS The following procedures were performed: low anterior resection (n = 26), low anterior resection with loop-ileostomy (n = 39), Hartmann's operation (n = 14), and abdominoperineal resection (n = 21). The median length of hospital stay was 7 days; 9 patients were readmitted There were 9 cases of conversion to open surgery. The overall complication rate was 35%, including 6 cases (90/%) of anastomotic leakages requiring reoperation. The 30-day mortality was 5%. The median number of harvested lymph nodes was 15 (range, 2 to 48). There were 6 cases of positive circumferential resection margins. The median follow-up was 9 (range, 1 to 27) months.

One of the principal factors that directs the outcome of infection is the localized innate immune response, which is proceeded by the adaptive immune response against the invading viral pathogen. The role of the immune system is to contain and control the spread of virus within the CNS, and paradoxically, this response may also be pathological. Studies with a neurotropic murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have provided important insights into how the immune system combats neuroinvasive viruses, and have identified molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to chronic disease in persistently infected mice.","Schaumburg, Chris S; Held, Katherine S; Lane, Thomas E",Frontiers in bioscience : a journal and virtual library,29,19

Translation proceeds through ORF 1a into ORF 1b via a translational frame-shift. ORF 1a potentially encodes three protease activities, two papain-like activities and one poliovirus 3C-like activity. Of the three predicted activities, only the more amino terminal papain-like domain has been demonstrated to have protease activity. ORF 1a polypeptides have been detected in infected cells by the use of antibodies. The order of polypeptides encoded from the 5' end of the ORF is p28, p65, p290. p290 is processed into p240 and p50. Processing of ORF1a polypeptides differs during cell free translation of genome RNA and in infected cells, suggesting that different proteases may be active under different conditions. Two RNA negative mutants of MHV-A59 express greatly reduced amounts of p28 and p65 at the non-permissive temperature. These mutants may have defects in one or more viral protease activities. ORF 1b, highly conserved between MHV and IBV, potentially contains polymerase, helicase and zinc finger domains. None of these activities have yet been demonstrated. ORF 1b polypeptides have yet been detected in infected cells.","Weiss, S R; Hughes, S A; Bonilla, P J; Turner, J D; Leibowitz, J L; Denison, M R",Archives of virology. Supplementum,29,7

We aimed to investigate antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) prevalence and clinical relationships in a large cohort of COVID-19 patients. METHODS We analysed the prevalence and titres of serum aPL in 122 patients with COVID-19 and 157 with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and 91 with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases (oARD) for comparison. IgG/IgM anticardiolipin (aCL) and IgG/IgM anti-beta2glycoprotein I (β2GPI) were assayed using homemade ELISA, IgA aCL and anti-β2GPI by commercial ELISA kits and lupus anticoagulant (LAC) by multiple coagulation tests following updated international guidelines. RESULTS Prevalence of IgG and IgM aCL and of IgG and IgM anti-β2GPI across COVID-19 patients were 13.4%, 2.7%, 6.3% and 7.1%, being significantly lower than in PAPS (p<0.0001 for all). Frequency of IgG aCL and IgM anti-β2GPI was comparable to oARD (13.4% vs. 13.2% and 7.1% vs. 11%, respectively), while IgG anti-β2GPI and IgM aCL were lower (p<0.01). IgA aCL and IgA anti-β2GPI were retrieved in 1.7% and 3.3% of COVID-19 patients, respectively. Positive LAC was observed in 22.2% COVID-19 vs. 54.1% of PAPS (p<0.0001) and 14.6% of oARD (p=0.21). Venous or arterial thromboses occurred in 18/46 (39.1%) COVID-19 patients and were not associated with positive aPL (p=0.09). CONCLUSIONS Thrombosis is a frequent manifestation during COVID-19 infection. However, prevalence and titres of aPL antibodies or LAC were neither consistently increased nor associated with thrombosis when measured at a single timepoint, therefore not representing a suitable screening tool in the acute stage of disease.","Gatto, Mariele; Perricone, Carlo; Tonello, Marta; Bistoni, Onelia; Cattelan, Anna Maria; Bursi, Roberto; Cafaro, Giacomo; De Robertis, Edoardo; Mencacci, Antonella; Bozza, Silvia; Vianello, Andrea; Iaccarino, Luca; Gerli, Roberto; Doria, Andrea; Bartoloni, Elena",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,29,1

CDC has the regulatory responsibility for preventing the introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable diseases into the United States as well as for developing the guidelines, known as technical instructions, for the overseas medical examinations. Other conditions that are not infectious might preclude an immigrant or refugee from entering the United States and also are reported as part of the medical examination. After arrival in the United States, all refugees are recommended to obtain a medical assessment by a health-care provider or a health department within 30 days. In addition, immigrants with certain medical conditions such as noninfectious tuberculosis at the time of the original medical examination are recommended to be evaluated after arrival to ensure that appropriate prevention or treatment measures are instituted. Health departments need timely and accurate notifications of newly arriving immigrants, refugees, and persons with other visa types to facilitate these evaluations. Notifications for all newly arriving refugees (with or without medical conditions) and immigrants with medical conditions are provided by CDC's Electronic Disease Notification (EDN) system. This is the first report describing EDN. REPORTING PERIOD This report summarizes notifications by the EDN system during January-December 2009. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM The EDN system is a centralized electronic reporting system that collects health information on newly arriving refugees and immigrants with Class A and Class B medical conditions. Class A conditions render applicants inadmissible and require a waiver for entry; Class B conditions are admissible but might require treatment or follow-up. Information in the EDN system is used to notify state health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia about the arrival of these persons in the United States. RESULTS In 2009, the EDN system notified U.S. state and local health departments of 104,954 newly arriving refugees and immigrants, of whom 78,899 (75.2%) were refugees (with or without medical conditions), 19,358 (18.4%) were immigrants with medical conditions, and 6,697 (6.4%) were persons with other visa types. Of the 78,899 refugees, 21,319 (27%) had a medical condition. The majority (93.4%) of immigrants with medical conditions had tuberculosis classifications (i.e., either had evidence of latent tuberculosis infection or chest radiograph findings interpreted by the overseas panel physician as consistent with tuberculosis). Of the 41,415 refugees and immigrants with Class A or Class B medical conditions, 405 (1%) had Class A conditions, and 40,994 (99%) had Class B conditions. The majority of refugees and immigrants with suspected Class B tuberculosis were born in the Philippines (41.3%), Mexico (12.1%), Burma (8.7%), Vietnam (7.8%), and the Dominican Republic (5.8%). The majority of refugee notifications were for persons born in Iraq (23.9%), Burma (18.9%), and Bhutan (15.1%). Approximately one third of the tuberculosis notifications were sent to health departments in California (20.5%), Texas (9.8%), and New York (6.3%), and the national reporting rate for tuberculosis follow-up was 75.4% within 30 days of arrival. INTERPRETATION The findings in this report suggest that 1) overseas medical screening results in a low frequency (0.4%) of inadmissible medical conditions in the United States, 2) the EDN system provides more direct notifications to health departments than the previous paper-based system about newly arriving immigrants and refugees who need medical follow-up, and 3) approximately 75% of follow-up occurs among persons with suspected tuberculosis who are reported to EDN by states receiving newly arriving refugees and immigrants. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS The data in this report can be used to help state and local health departments provide prompt and effective follow-up, evaluation, and treatment to newly arriving immigrants and refugees. Timely follow-up might prevent additional spread of tuberculosis or other communicable diseases of public health significance into their communities. In addition, information from the EDN system allows health departments to use their resources as effectively as possible by providing clinical information that identifies the refugees and immigrants who should be prioritized for evaluation and treatment.","Lee, Deborah; Philen, Rossanne; Wang, Zanju; McSpadden, Pamela; Posey, Drew L; Ortega, Luis S; Weinberg, Michelle S; Brown, Clive; Zhou, Weigong; Painter, John A",Morbidity and mortality weekly report.

Investigation into the prevalence of FCoV in exotic Felidae has relied primarily on serology. The usefulness of genetic detection of FCoV using reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction (RT/nPCR) for viral screening was investigated. Seventy-five biologic samples, primarily feces, from captive felids from 11 institutions were tested using PCR. Serum samples collected from all but 12 of these animals were tested for antibodies to type I and type II FCoV by indirect immunofluorescence. Twenty-four animals were positive using RT/nPCR for virus. Twenty-nine animals were seropositive to type I and/or type II FCoV. From serologic data, infection with a virus antigenically related to FCoV type I occurred most commonly. Serology did not correlate with virus shedding because 13 animals were seronegative to FCoV type I and II but positive using RT/nPCR for virus. Conversely, 20 animals were seropositive but negative using RT/nPCR for FCoV. Some of the populations in which virus was detected had experienced health problems, including feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), necrotizing colitis, and mild enteritis. In addition to its role in FIP, this virus may play a role in gastrointestinal diseases of infected animals. This study demonstrates that FCoV is a significant infectious agent of captive felids because over half of the animals tested were positive by viral genetic detection, serology, or both. Dependence upon one method for detection of infection is unreliable.","Kennedy, Melissa; Citino, Scott; McNabb, Amanda Hillis; Moffatt, Amy Serino; Gertz, Karen; Kania, Stephen","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",29,24

In this study, we analyzed the effects of point mutations within the GNRA motifs of the CVB3 IRES. We characterized in vitro virus production and translation efficiency and we tested in vivo virulence of two CVB3 mutants produced by site-directed mutagenesis. The GNAA1 and GNAA2 RNAs displayed decreased translation initiation efficiency when translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. This translation defect was correlated with reduced yields of infectious virus particles in HeLa cells in comparison with the wild type. When inoculated orally into Swiss mice, both mutant viruses were avirulent and caused neither inflammation nor necrosis in hearts.

METHODS A case-control study from ten hospitals in Guangdong, with 180 non-infected and 77 infected staff members that accessed the isolation unit every day, and participated in direct first aid for severe SARS patients. All participants were surveyed about how they were using personal protective equipment (PPE), protective drugs and hygiene habits when caring for patients with SARS. Statistical analysis was done with either chi(2) or Fisher's exact test for univariate analysis, whereas we used forward stepwise selection (Waldesian) for logistic regression. RESULTS Univariate analysis showed that mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, ""hand-washing and disinfecting"", gargle, ""membrane protection"", ""taking shower and changing clothing after work"", ""avoid from eating and drinking in ward"", oseltamivir phospha tall had protective effects (P < 0.05), but stepwise logistic regression showed significant differences for mask (OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.60 - 0.99), goggles (OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10 - 0.41) and footwear (OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39 - 0.86). Analysis for linear trend in proportions showed that dose response relationship existed in mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, gargle, ""membrane protection"" and ""taking shower and changing dree after work"" (P < 0.01). The attack rate of HCWs who were rescuing severe SARS patients without any PPE was 61.5% (16/26). It seemed that the more the protective measures were used, the higher the protective effect was (P < 0.001), and could reach 100% if mask, gown, gloves, goggles, footwear, ""hand-washing and disinfecting"" were all used at the same time.

They therefore are probably free molecules in solution or components of easily dissociable complexes. By contrast, the majority of minus-strand RNAs (genome length and subgenomic mRNA length) were found to be resistant to micrococcal nuclease (69%) or to remain suspended in association with membrane-protected complexes following isopycnic sedimentation in a cesium chloride gradient (85%). Furthermore, 35% of the suspended minus strands were in a dense complex (1.20 to 1.24 g/ml) that contained an RNA plus-to-minus-strand molar ratio of approximately 8:1 and viral structural proteins S, M, and N, and 65% were in a light complex (1.15 to 1.17 g/ml) that contained nearly equimolar amounts of plus- and minus-strand RNAs and only trace amounts of proteins M and N. In no instance during fractionation were genome-length minus strands found segregated from sub-genome-length minus strands. These results indicate that all minus-strand species are components of similarly structured membrane-associated replication complexes and support the concept that all are active in the synthesis of plus-strand RNAs.","Sethna, P B; Brian, D A",Journal of virology,29,1

Several weaning tests have been described but no physiological study has evaluated the weaning test that would best reflect the post-extubation inspiratory effort. METHODS This was a physiological randomized crossover study in a medical and surgical single-center Intensive Care Unit, in patients with body mass index (BMI) >35 kg/m2 who were mechanically ventilated for more than 24 h and underwent a weaning test. After randomization, 17 patients were explored using five settings : pressure support ventilation (PSV) 7 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) 7 cmH2O; PSV 0 and PEEP 7cmH2O; PSV 7 and PEEP 0 cmH2O; PSV 0 and PEEP 0 cmH2O; and a T piece, and after extubation. To further minimize interaction between each setting, a period of baseline ventilation was performed between each step of the study. We hypothesized that the post-extubation work of breathing (WOB) would be similar to the T-tube WOB. RESULTS Respiratory variables and esophageal and gastric pressure were recorded. Inspiratory muscle effort was calculated as the esophageal and trans-diaphragmatic pressure time products and WOB. Sixteen obese patients (BMI 44 kg/m2 ± 8) were included and successfully extubated. Post-extubation inspiratory effort, calculated by WOB, was 1.56 J/L ± 0.50, not statistically different from the T piece (1.57 J/L ± 0.56) or PSV 0 and PEEP 0 cmH2O (1.58 J/L ± 0.57), whatever the index of inspiratory effort. The three tests that maintained pressure support statistically underestimated post-extubation inspiratory effort (WOB 0.69 J/L ± 0.31, 1.15 J/L ± 0.39 and 1.09 J/L ± 0.49, respectively, p < 0.001). Respiratory mechanics and arterial blood gases did not differ between the five tests and the post-extubation condition. CONCLUSIONS In obese patients, inspiratory effort measured during weaning tests with either a T-piece or a PSV 0 and PEEP 0 was not different to post-extubation inspiratory effort. In contrast, weaning tests with positive pressure overestimated post-extubation inspiratory effort.

METHODS Emergency funding allocation criteria and funding amounts by general practice were obtained from the MOH. Practices were stratified according to their proportion of high-needs enrolled patients (Māori, Pacific or living in an area with the highest quintile of socioeconomic deprivation). Funding per practice was calculated for separate and total payments according to practice stratum of high-needs enrolled patients. RESULTS The median combined March and April funding for general practices with 80% high-needs patients was 28% higher per practice ($36,674 vs $28,686) and 48% higher per patient ($10.50 vs $7.11) compared with the funding received by general practices with fewer than 20% high-needs patients. Although the March allocation did increase funding for high-needs patients, the April allocation did not. CONCLUSIONS Emergency support funding for general practices was organised by the MOH at short notice and in exceptional circumstances. In the future, the MOH should apply pro-equity resource allocation in all emergencies, as with other circumstances.","Selak, Vanessa; Crengle, Sue; Harwood, Matire; Murton, Samantha; Crampton, Peter",The New Zealand medical journal,29,1

METHODS Adopting two case reports 1 and 2, designed by the Tianjin Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop a unified case-tracing table including the map of the distribution of close contacts to SARS patients. With those methods, investigation on patients and their close contacts at hospital wards, families, communities and institutions of the patients were carried out. RESULTS From April 13 through May 8, 2003, there were 175 SARS cases including imported ones, were identified with an incidence rate of 1.9 cases per 100,000. Among them, 14 died with a fatality of 8.0%. The whole process of epidemic in Tianjin was less than one month with the following features: (1) 93.7% of the total SARS cases in Tianjin were directly or indirectly transmitted by a super-spreader. (2) 68.6% of the total SARS patients were concentrated in 3 hospitals A, B and C which was menifastated in 'clustering'. Through study on the rest of the SARS patients, results showed that 16.8% of them were transmitted through family close contact and 2.3% due to contact to colleagues. However, 12.6% of the patients were not able to show evidence that they had any contact to a diagnosed SARS patient. At the early stage of the epidemic, a number of medical practitioners were infected, taking up 38.2% of the total SARS cases. Among the total number of 1 975 medical workers who participated in the SARS medical cares and treatments, 3.4% of them got infected. During the outbreak, all index cases and chains of transmission seemed to be clear, with only 3 patients not able to be traced for the source of infection, taking up 2% of the total SARS patients in Tianjin. Among the 10 index cases, only the super spreader and another one index case transmitted the virus to their contacts but the rest of index cases did not cause any secondary infection. CONCLUSION Though SARS is clinically severe and can be spreaded quickly, the epidemic can be under control within a short period of time if chains of SARS transmission are broken down and effective measures as isolation and quarantine against patients as well as underscoring awareness among the publics in a scientific way, being carried out.","Wang, Jie-xiu; Feng, Hong-you; Liu, Dong; Zhang, Zhi-lun; Shan, Ai-lan; Zhu, Xiang-jun; Gao, Zhi-gang; Wang, Xu-dong; Xia, Ying-yi; Chen, Qian",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,29,1

Suspicious necrosis was found at 42 femoral heads of 23 patients, 67% of which were MRI negative. Among 30 patients with normal three-phase scintigraphic results, 10% of whom were suspicious on MRI. In addition, abnormal distributions of radioactivity were observed in other bones on the whole-body bone scans of 29 patients, including osteonecrosis of knees in 15 patients. CONCLUSIONS Radionuclide bone scintigraphy is valuable in early diagnosis of osteonecrosis in SARS patients in convalescence. It provides a mutually supplementary tool for MRI.","Ba, Jian-Tao; Zhu, Zhao-Hui; Li, Fang; Xing, Hai-Qun; Ma, Yan-Ru; Jing, Hong-Li; Wang, Zheng-Hua",Zhongguo yi xue ke xue yuan xue bao.

RECENT FINDINGS In June 2001, researchers in The Netherlands reported the discovery of a virus associated with respiratory tract disease in infants and children. Genetic studies of this newly discovered viral pathogen revealed that it was a paramyxovirus. This virus is the first human pathogen in the Genus Metapneumovirus and was called human metapneumovirus (hMPV). hMPV may be a common respiratory virus. Seroepidemiologic studies in The Netherlands suggested that, by age 5 years, nearly all individuals have been exposed to hMPV. The results of several studies suggest that hMPV may account for about 10% of respiratory tract infections in which a common respiratory virus, such as respiratory syncytial virus, or influenza or parainfluenza viruses, could not be detected. hMPV has been detected in patients with either upper or lower respiratory tract disease, or both. Symptoms associated with hMPV include cough, dyspnea, wheeze, and hypoxia. This newly recognized pathogen has been detected in children and adults. Epidemiological findings suggest that it may circulate worldwide and may have a seasonal distribution. SUMMARY hMPV is a newly emerging respiratory pathogen and may be the cause of a significant proportion of both upper and lower respiratory tract infection in infants, children, and adults.","Kahn, Jeffrey S",Current opinion in infectious diseases,29,8

Forty male adolescent juvenile offenders were divided into psychopaths and nonpsychopaths using cluster analysis. Subjects were administered a passive avoidance learning task which required learning when to respond to cards associated with either reward or punishment. Results showed a greater responsivity to reward in psychopaths, with no group differences in passive avoidance errors. Results lend support to the view that psychopaths tend to focus on the prospect of reward under conditions of mixed incentives and, when sufficiently motivated, are capable of improved performance. Together with findings of recent psychophysiological studies, these results suggest that adolescent psychopaths may have latent abilities which could have treatment implications.","Scerbo, A; Raine, A; O'Brien, M; Chan, C J; Rhee, C; Smiley, N",Journal of abnormal child psychology,29,1

We aimed to determine whether the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system is associated with a worse clinical course of COVID-19, and to evaluate what clinical variables are associated with COVID severity in our population. We included adult subjects with rtPCR-confirmed COVID-19. The use of renin system inhibitors was defined according to its registration in the electronic medical record or the hospital pharmacy registry during the previous three months. Our endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation requirement. Patients were followed up until discharge or death. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of the composite endpoint. In all, we included 4930 COVID+ patients, the median age was 52 years, and 48.1% were male. The endpoint occurred in 488 patients (9.9%). In adjusted analysis, neither angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors nor angiotensin receptor blockers were associated with the outcome. Independent predictors of mortality and/or mechanical ventilation requirement were age, male sex, a history of diabetes and/or chronic kidney disease, smoking and dementia. To conclude, renin system inhibitors seem to be unrelated to COVID-19 severity, whereas prognosis is independently associated with age, male sex and comorbidities.","Barochiner, Jessica; Martínez, Rocío; Conti, Patricia Roxana; Marín, Marcos José; Ko, Ery Ayelén; Osorno, María Sol",Le infezioni in medicina,29,1

The cervical/vaginal mucosa is the main port of HIV entry in women. A safe and effective topical microbicide against HIV is urgently needed to prevent sexual transmission. Hence, we evaluated griffithsin (GRFT), a 12.7 kDa carbohydrate-binding protein, both native and recombinant GRFT, potently inhibited both CXCR4-and CCR5-tropic HIV infection and transmission in vitro. METHODS The antiviral efficacy of native and recombinant GRFT against CXCR4-and CCR5-tropic HIV and SHIV strains and SIVmac251 was evaluated by in vitro assays. We also evaluated the time course of antiviral activity and stability of GRFT in cervical/vaginal lavage as a function of pH 4-8. RESULTS Griffithsin blocked CXCR4-and CCR5-tropic viruses at less than 1 nm concentrations and exhibited a high potency. GRFT was stable in cervical/vaginal lavage fluid and maintained a similar potency of anti-HIV activity. GRFT is not only a highly potent HIV entry inhibitor, but also prevents cell fusion and cell-to-cell transmission of HIV. CONCLUSIONS The in vitro efficacy of GRFT revealed low cytotoxicity, high potency, rapid onset of antiviral activity and long-term stability in cervical/vaginal lavage. GRFT is an excellent candidate for anti-HIV microbicide development.","Emau, P; Tian, B; O'keefe, B R; Mori, T; McMahon, J B; Palmer, K E; Jiang, Y; Bekele, G; Tsai, C C",Journal of medical primatology,29,20

This article presents the Canadian experience in attempting to address the challenges associated with developing the needed taxonomies for systematically capturing, measuring, and analyzing the national investment in the Canadian public health system. The first phase of this process was completed in 2005, which was a 2-year project to estimate public health spending based on a more classic definition by removing the administration component of the previously combined public health and administration category. Comparing the refined public health estimate with recent data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development still positions Canada with the highest share of total health expenditure devoted to public health than any other country reporting. The article also provides an analysis of the comparability of public health estimates across jurisdictions within Canada as well as a discussion of the recommendations for ongoing improvement of public health spending estimates. The Canadian Institute for Health Information is an independent, not-for-profit organization that provides Canadians with essential statistics and analysis on the performance of the Canadian health system, the delivery of healthcare, and the health status of Canadians. The Canadian Institute for Health Information administers more than 20 databases and registries, including Canada's Health Accounts, which tracks historically 40 categories of health spending by 5 sources of finance for 13 provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Until 2005, expenditure on public health services in the Canadian Health Accounts included measures to prevent the spread of communicable disease, food and drug safety, health inspections, health promotion, community mental health programs, public health nursing, as well as all the costs for the general administration of government health departments.","Ballinger, Geoff",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,29,1

Several trials have investigated the role of self-adhesive mesh repair for inguinal hernia, with special attention to the incidence of chronic postoperative inguinal pain and recurrence. The purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate the early and long-term results using a self-gripping mesh (Parietex Progrip® , Covidien) in our institution. A total of 204 patients, mean age 50.3 standard deviation (SD) 15.3, was included in the study. The repair was performed under local anaesthesia in 159 (78%) cases and locoregional anaesthesia in remaining 45 (22%). Mean operative time was 39 ± 20 minutes. The time for self-gripping mesh placement ranged from 5 to 9 minutes (mean 7 ± 2 minutes). There were no intraoperative complications. Clinical follow-up was performed at 1 month, 1 year and 2 years and consisted in the evaluation of complications, discomfort/pain and recurrence. One case of cutaneous infection and three cases of seroma were observed at one-month follow-up and were all treated conservatively. 8 patients were lost at one year follow-up, and another 4 were lost at 2 years. 3 patients died for other causes during follow-up. At 1 year and 2 years follow-up no cases of seroma, testicular complications or mesh infection were observed. Two cases of recurrence were recorded at 2 years follow up. No patient reported VAS score > 2 at one month, 1 year and 2 years follow-up. There were no readmissions, systemic complications or death during 2 years follow-up. Lichtenstein open repair using Parietex Progrip® mesh is a simple, rapid, effective and safe method for inguinal hernia repair. The main advantage of self-fixing mesh is the reduced operative time. A suturless fixation seems to prevent the development of postoperative chronic pain, without increasing recurrence rate in the majority of the trials.","Del Papa, M; D'Amata, G; Manzi, F; Carnì, P; Florio, G; Crovaro, M; Musmeci, L; Buonocore, C",Il Giornale di chirurgia,29,13

The literature review identified 299 possible indicators. After consulting infection control experts and healthcare managers and having collected data in the hospitals, a proposed dashboard was created that includes 97 indicators divided in three categories (structure, process and outcome) and grouped in 22 themes. The proposed indicators are both scientifically valid and administratively feasible.

METHODS Three autopsy cases were studied retrospectively. Routine HE stain was used to study all the cases. Part of the lung tissue specimens were studied further with Macchiavello's stain, viral inclusion body stain, reticulin and PAS stains, immunohistochemistry, thin sections with staining, light microscopy and transmission electronic microscope investigation. RESULTS The earliest symptom of all 3 cases was hyperpyrexia and followed by progressive dyspnea and appearance of lung field shadows in X rays findings. Pulmonary lesions included: bilateral and extensive consolidation, localized hemorrhage and necrosis, desquamative alveolitis and bronchitis, alveolar proliferation and desquamation, accumulation of protein exudates, mononuclear cells, lymphocytes, and plasma cells as well as hyaline membrane formation in alveoli and viral inclusion bodies were seen in the alveolus epithelial cells. The exudated organization tended to become glomeruloid organizing pneumonitis in a few avaoli. Lesions of the immune organs included: large patchy necrosis in the spleens and localized necrosis in the lymph nodes were seen. Bone marrow became restrained. There were lesions of systemic small vasculitis including edema of the perivascular tissue and vascular wall of the small veins with localized fibrinoid necrosis distributing in the heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenal glands and the striated muscles accompanying with mononuclear cells and lymphocytes infiltration. Thrombosis was seen in part of the small veins. In addition, there were also the systemic poisonous changes including: degeneration and necrosis of the parenchyma cells in lungs, liver, kidneys, heart and adrenals. Electronic microscopy demonstrated clusters of virus particles seen in the lung tissue. CONCLUSION SARS is a systemic disease. Lungs, immune system and systemic small vessels are the main target organs attacked by the virus. Extensive consolidation of lungs, formation of hyaline membrane to a large extent, respiratory distress and decrease of immune function are the main causes of death.","Ding, Yan-qing; Wang, Hui-jun; Shen, Hong; Li, Zu-guo; Geng, Jian; Han, Hui-xia; Cai, Jun-jie; Li, Xin; Kang, Wei; Weng, De-sheng; Lu, Yao-dan; Yao, Kai-tai",Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology,29,1

We searched on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords psychiatric disorders, epigenome, microbiome and family relationships. RESULTS Some gene polymorphisms interact with negative environment and lead to psychiatric disorders. Negative environment is correlated with different epigenetic modifications in genes implicated in mental health. Gut microbiota diversity affect host epigenetic. Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and psychiatric disorders. Several environmental characteristics such as traumatic life events, family adversity, psychological stress or internal environment such as gut microbiota diversity and diet showed an impact on epigenetic. These epigenetic modifications are also correlated with neurophysiological, inflammatory or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulations.","Dubois, Thomas; Reynaert, Christine; Jacques, Denis; Lepiece, Brice; Zdanowicz, Nicolas",Psychiatria Danubina,29,17

METHODS CRCLM treated by RF ablation at a single tertiary care center from 2004-2012, with a minimum of six months of postprocedure follow-up, were included in this retrospective study. LTP morphology was classified as focal nodular (<90° of ablation margin), circumferential (>270°), or crescentic (90°-270°). Initial metastasis size, minimum ablation margin size, morphology of LTP, presence of a heat sink, and time to progression were recorded independently by two radiologists. RESULTS Thirty-two of 127 RF ablation treated metastases (25%) with a mean size of 23 mm (standard deviation 12 mm) exhibited LTP. Fifteen of 32 LTPs (47%) were classified as focal nodular, with seven having no procedure-related factor to explain recurrence. Ten of 32 LTPs (31%) were circumferential, with four having no procedure-related factor to explain recurrence. Seven of 32 LTPs (22%) were crescentic, with two having no procedure-related factor to explain recurrence. Of the 13 lesions without any obvious procedure-related reason for LTP, six (46%) were <3 cm in size. CONCLUSION Although LTP in RF ablation treated CRCLM can often be explained by procedure-related factors or size of the lesion, in this study up to six (5%) of the CRCLM we treated showed LTP without any reasonable cause.","Napoleone, Marc; Kielar, Ania Z; Hibbert, Rebecca; Saif, Sameh; Kwan, Benjamin Y",Diagnostic and interventional radiology,29,17

EBF-1 has been shown to directly interact with and regulate expression of a set of genes involved in the functional formation of the pre-B cell receptor, but the dramatic phenotype observed in the EBF-1-deficient mice suggests that several additional genes are activated by this protein. In order to identify additional target genes for EBF-1, we transduced a hematopoietic progenitor cell line, BaF/3, with an EBF-1-encoding retrovirus and investigated the induced gene expression pattern by micro-arrays. This analysis suggested that among others, the CD53 and the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM)-1 genes both were induced by ectopic expression of EBF-1. Identification of the 5' end of the cDNA enabled the identification of promoter elements with functional binding sites for EBF-1 and ability to respond to EBF-1 expression in transient transfection assays. These data suggest that CD53 and CEACAM-1 are direct genetic targets for EBF-1, providing additional information concerning the activity of this crucial transcription factor in hematopoiesis.","Månsson, Robert; Lagergren, Anna; Hansson, Frida; Smith, Emma; Sigvardsson, Mikael",European journal of immunology,29,12

However, despite the extensive use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, poor clinical response to treatment of acute otitis media is common in children. Numerous studies ranging from animal experiments to extensive clinical studies have clearly demonstrated that respiratory viruses play a crucial role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of acute otitis media. Viral infection of the upper respiratory tract initiates the whole cascade of events that finally leads to the development of acute otitis media as a complication. Respiratory viruses induce a release of inflammatory mediators in the nasopharynx, increase bacterial colonization and adherence, and have a suppressive effect on the host's immune defense. Recent data indicate that at least some types of viruses actively invade the middle ear. Viruses also seem to enhance the inflammatory process in the middle ear and impair the outcome of the disease. Vaccines against the major viruses predisposing to acute otitis media hold a great promise for the prevention of this disease. Major advances in the management of acute otitis media will require further research into the mechanisms of viral infection, viral-bacterial interaction and the host inflammatory response during viral infection.","Heikkinen, T; Chonmaitree, T",Annals of medicine,29,26

RESULTS Results: 37%, of those undergoing systemic treatment, experienced postponement of their treatment, and in the case of radiotherapy, it was 35%. Visits to the clinical oncologist/radiotherapist specialist were postponed in 51% of respondents. Imaging studies were delayed in 41.7% of respondents. CONCLUSION Conclusions: The course of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted the health care system and, therefore, also on the availability of medical care among oncologicalpatients. The results signal an emerging problem. These visit shifts may negatively affect the outcome of cancer treatment. The potential risk of COVID-19 infection should beindividually balanced against cancer treatment delay in each patient. The ongoing pandemic, therefore, prompts a careful analysis of the effects of deferring cancer therapy.","Kościelecka, Klaudia Ewa; Kuć, Aleksandra Joanna; Kubik, Daria Małgorzata; Męcik-Kronenberg, Tomasz; Ceglarz, Dariusz",Wiadomosci lekarskie,29,1

The gp41 heptad repeat 1 (HR1) domain is the molecular target of the fusion-inhibitor drug enfuvirtide (T20). The HR1 sequence is highly conserved and therefore considered an attractive target for vaccine development, but it is unknown whether antibodies can access HR1. Herein, we use gp41-based peptides to select a human antibody, 5H/I1-BMV-D5 (D5), that binds to HR1 and inhibits the assembly of fusion intermediates in vitro. D5 inhibits the replication of diverse HIV-1 clinical isolates and therefore represents a previously unknown example of a crossneutralizing IgG selected by binding to designed antigens. NMR studies and functional analyses map the D5-binding site to a previously identified hydrophobic pocket situated in the HR1 groove. This hydrophobic pocket was proposed as a drug target and subsequently identified as a common binding site for peptide and peptidomimetic fusion inhibitors. The finding that the D5 fusion-inhibitory antibody shares the same binding site suggests that the hydrophobic pocket is a ""hot spot"" for fusion inhibition and an ideal target on which to focus a vaccine-elicited antibody response. Our data provide a structural framework for the design of new immunogens and therapeutic antibodies with crossneutralizing potential.","Miller, Michael D; Geleziunas, Romas; Bianchi, Elisabetta; Lennard, Simon; Hrin, Renee; Zhang, Hangchun; Lu, Meiqing; An, Zhiqiang; Ingallinella, Paolo; Finotto, Marco; Mattu, Marco; Finnefrock, Adam C; Bramhill, David; Cook, James; Eckert, Debra M; Hampton, Richard; Patel, Mayuri; Jarantow, Stephen; Joyce, Joseph; Ciliberto, Gennaro; Cortese, Riccardo; Lu, Ping; Strohl, William; Schleif, William; McElhaugh, Michael; Lane, Steven; Lloyd, Christopher; Lowe, David; Osbourn, Jane; Vaughan, Tristan; Emini, Emilio; Barbato, Gaetano; Kim, Peter S; Hazuda, Daria J; Shiver, John W; Pessi, Antonello",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,29,9

With the current rarity of pneumonic plague epidemics, our epidemiological knowledge remains insufficient for detailed characterization of effective control measures. METHODS Temporal patterns and key biological parameters of a pneumonic plague epidemic in Manchuria from 1910 to 1911 were analysed based on historical records collected by Kanto Totokufu, the administration of the Japanese Empire in Manchuria at that time. The serial intervals were fitted to gamma distribution using the maximum likelihood method, and time-delay distributions from onset-to-admission, admission-to-death, and onset-to-death were investigated. RESULTS Whereas a total of 228 cases were diagnosed with pneumonic plague in areas under direct control of the Japanese Empire, 4,781 cases were also recorded in surrounding areas. Although the epidemic grew exponentially in the early phase, the average doubling time steadily increased reflecting successful control efforts. The estimated mean serial interval (and standard deviation) was 5.7 (3.6) days. All cases with known dates of onset were admitted to hospital within 4 days after onset, and the mean time from onset to admission was 1.1 (0.4) days. CONCLUSIONS The increase in doubling time demonstrates the efficient and rapid countermeasures employed. Since the short interval from onset to death implies the importance of rapid responses, the challenge in confronting a future bioterrorist attack is to implement rapid and appropriate integration of control measures both at the individual and community level to prevent further transmissions as well as lower case fatality.","Nishiura, Hiroshi",International journal of epidemiology,29,1

The clinical samples collected from infected monkeys were examined by immumnofluorescence assay (IFA), pathological inspection, RTPCR, and by virus isolation. The infected animals demonstrated mild clinical symptoms including fever. Two of the six infected monkeys developed fever (1.5 above the level before challenge) on the day 10 post inoculation (p.i.). Although the severe clinical symptoms or mortality were not observed, the virological and histopathological evidences of the illness were evident. The specimens collected from the infected animals showed the presence of SARS-CoV detected by RT-PCR, IFA, and by virus isolation. From the organs examined postmortem, a major pathological change was observed in the lungs. The walls of the alveoli were thicker, infiltrated with inflammation cells and an exudative fluid was found in the alveolar spaces. In addition, some alveolar spaces showed hyaline membrane lining.

Lack of widespread awareness of the exercise in HD literature may be contributing to these shortcomings of clinical practice. Therefore, our objectives are: (1) to systematically review trials of exercise training involving adult HD patients; (2) to provide empirical evidence that exercise can elicit health-related adaptations in this cohort, and (3) to provide recommendations for future investigations. METHOD A systematic review of the literature using computerized databases was performed. RESULTS According to the 29 trials reviewed, HD patients can safely derive a myriad of health-related adaptations from engaging in appropriately structured exercise regimens involving aerobic and/or resistance training. However, methodological limitations within this body of literature may be partially responsible for minimal advocacy for exercise in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS Robustly designed RCTs with thorough, standardized reporting are required if clinical practice and quality of life of this cohort is to be enhanced through the integration of exercise training and mainstream medical practice. Future trials should demonstrate the clinical importance, and long-term feasibility and applicability of exercise training for this vulnerable patient population.","Cheema, Birinder Singh B; Singh, Maria A Fiatarone",American journal of nephrology,29,19

With this service, hospital pharmacists develop a distinct role via the implementation of pharmacovigilance services and pharmaceutical care plans for patients with comorbidities, and for special populations as immunosuppressed patients.MethodsCross-sectional study involving hospital and community pharmacists actively practising during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients who could not come to the hospital pharmacy department were provided with a delivery service to the community pharmacy of their choice. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients requested this service. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were the most in-demand medication, followed by rheumatoid arthritis and antiretroviral drugs. 125 patients responded to the telephone survey, most of whom stated that they would use the delivery service again, and expressed their desire to continue doing so. DISCUSSION: Without a doubt, telepharmacy and medication delivery services have provided multiple benefits during home quarantine. The delivery service enabled us to provide drugs to patients in their immediate environment through a service that was free for both the patient and the hospital pharmacy service. However, at present, the available evidence of the impact of telepharmacy models is sparse. CONCLUSIONS: This medication delivery service has provided multiple benefits to patients during home quarantine. Although the users of this service seem to be satisfied with the current model, in the future, we should consider which patients would benefit most from this service and shape it to individual needs.","Peláez Bejarano, Ana; Villar Santos, Pilar; Robustillo-Cortés, Maria de Las Aguas; Sánchez Gómez, Ernesto; Santos Rubio, Maria Dolores",,29,5

Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is an analytical technique with promising impact for the point-of-care diagnosis of viruses. It has been applied to a variety of influenza A virus subtypes, such as the H1N1 and the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this work, a review of the strategies used for the detection of RVsZO by SERS is presented. In addition, relevant information about the SERS technique, anthropozoonosis, and RVsZO is provided for a better understanding of the theme. The direct identification is based on trapping the viruses within the interstices of plasmonic nanoparticles and recording the SERS signal from gene fragments or membrane proteins. Quantitative mono- and multiplexed assays have been achieved following an indirect format through a SERS-based sandwich immunoassay. Based on this review, the development of multiplex assays that incorporate the detection of RVsZO together with their specific biomarkers and/or secondary disease biomarkers resulting from the infection progress would be desirable. These configurations could be used as a double confirmation or to evaluate the health condition of the patient.","Saviñon-Flores, Fernanda; Méndez, Erika; López-Castaños, Mónica; Carabarin-Lima, Alejandro; López-Castaños, Karen A; González-Fuentes, Miguel A; Méndez-Albores, Alia",Biosensors (Basel),29,26

DESIGN: Observational cohort study of healthcare workers, including SARS-CoV-2 serology testing and participant questionnaires. SETTINGS: A multisite healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County. PARTICIPANTS: A diverse and unselected population of adults (n=6062) employed in a multisite healthcare delivery system located in Los Angeles County, including individuals with direct patient contact and others with non-patient-oriented work functions. MAIN OUTCOMES: Using Bayesian and multivariate analyses, we estimated seroprevalence and factors associated with seropositivity and antibody levels, including pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics; potential COVID-19 illness-related exposures; and symptoms consistent with COVID-19 infection. RESULTS: We observed a seroprevalence rate of 4.1%, with anosmia as the most prominently associated self-reported symptom (OR 11.04, p<0.001) in addition to fever (OR 2.02, p=0.002) and myalgias (OR 1.65, p=0.035). After adjusting for potential confounders, seroprevalence was also associated with Hispanic ethnicity (OR 1.98, p=0.001) and African-American race (OR 2.02, p=0.027) as well as contact with a COVID-19-diagnosed individual in the household (OR 5.73, p<0.001) or clinical work setting (OR 1.76, p=0.002). Importantly, African-American race and Hispanic ethnicity were associated with antibody positivity even after adjusting for personal COVID-19 diagnosis status, suggesting the contribution of unmeasured structural or societal factors. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The demographic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among our healthcare workers underscore the importance of exposure sources beyond the workplace. The size and diversity of our study population, combined with robust survey and modelling techniques, provide a vibrant picture of the demographic factors, exposures and symptoms that can identify individuals with susceptibility as well as potential to mount an immune response to COVID-19.","Ebinger, Joseph E; Botwin, Gregory J; Albert, Christine M; Alotaibi, Mona; Arditi, Moshe; Berg, Anders H; Binek, Aleksandra; Botting, Patrick; Fert-Bober, Justyna; Figueiredo, Jane C; Grein, Jonathan D; Hasan, Wohaib; Henglin, Mir; Hussain, Shehnaz K; Jain, Mohit; Joung, Sandy; Karin, Michael; Kim, Elizabeth H; Li, Dalin; Liu, Yunxian; Luong, Eric; McGovern, Dermot P B; Merchant, Akil; Merin, Noah; Miles, Peggy B; Minissian, Margo; Nguyen, Trevor Trung; Raedschelders, Koen; Rashid, Mohamad A; Riera, Celine E; Riggs, Richard V; Sharma, Sonia; Sternbach, Sarah; Sun, Nancy; Tourtellotte, Warren G; Van Eyk, Jennifer E; Sobhani, Kimia; Braun, Jonathan G; Cheng, Susan",BMJ Open,29,26

We aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia for COVID-19. METHODS: A comprehensive electronic search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar from 1 June 2020 to 12 June 2020. All studies reporting symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19-positive patients were included. A total of 23 studies were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: Symptoms of anosmia and dysgeusia were frequently reported by COVID-19-positive patients. Symptoms were more common in females and in younger patients. There was no direct association between the severity of COVID-19 and the presence of symptoms. However, some evidence was found for a longer duration of these symptoms and increased severity of COVID-19 infection in young patients. CONCLUSION: OTD is commonly reported by COVID-19 patients. Due to limited literature on the association between OTD and COVID-19, it is currently not possible to conclude that these symptoms alone can be used to diagnose COVID-19. However, the presence of OTD can potentially be used as a screening tool for COVID-19 especially in young and female patients. Further research is required to establish the true diagnostic value of these symptoms and efficacy as screening tools for COVID-19 patients.","Zahra, Syeda Anum; Iddawela, Sashini; Pillai, Kiran; Choudhury, Rozina Yasmin; Harky, Amer",Brain Behav,29,20

The Young Group of the Italian Association of Nuclear Medicine (AIMN) developed the first international survey to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in nuclear medicine (NM). The aim of this study was to perform a preliminary report of the ongoing survey. METHODS: A questionnaire of thirty questions was prepared for all NM professionals addressing three main issues: (1) new scheduling praxes for NM diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, (2) assistance of patients with diagnosed or suspected COVID-19, and (3) prevention of COVID-19 spreading in the departments. An invitation to the survey was sent to the corresponding authors of NM scientific papers indexed in SCOPUS in 2019. Personal data were analysed per individual responder. Organisation data were evaluated per single department. RESULTS: Two-hundred and ninety-six individual responders from 220 departments were evaluated. Most of the responders were from Europe (199/296, 67%). Approximately, all departments already changed their scheduling praxes due to the pandemic (213/220, 97%). In most departments, scheduled diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were allowed but quantitatively reduced (112/220, 51%). A significant reduction of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (more than 20%) affected 198/220 (90%) and 158/220 (72%) departments, respectively. Incidental COVID-19 signs in NM exams occurred in 106/220 departments (48%). Few departments were closed or shifted to assist patients with COVID-19 (36/220, 16%). Most of the responders thought that pandemic would not permanently change the work of NM departments in the future (189/296, 64%). CONCLUSIONS: According to this preliminary report of the first international survey, COVID-19 heavily impacted NM departments and professionals. New praxes for NM procedures, assistance, and prevention of COVID-19 have been applied during the pandemic.","Annunziata, Salvatore; Bauckneht, Matteo; Albano, Domenico; Argiroffi, Giovanni; Calabrò, Diletta; Abenavoli, Elisabetta; Linguanti, Flavia; Laudicella, Riccardo",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,29,16

It has been recently shown that the sensitivity of homonuclear correlations involving RNA's labile imino protons can be significantly enhanced, by exploiting the repolarization brought about by solvent exchanges. Homonuclear correlations, however, are of limited spectral resolution, and usually incapable of tackling relatively large homopolymers with repeating structures like RNAs. This study presents a heteronuclear-resolved version of those NOESY experiments, in which magnetization transfers between the aqueous solvent and the nucleic acid protons are controlled by selecting specific chemical shift combinations of a coupled 1H-15N spin pair. This selective control effectively leads to a pseudo-3D version of HSQC-NOESY, but with cross-peaks enhanced by â¼2-5× as compared with conventional 2D NOESY counterparts. The enhanced signal sensitivity as well as access to both 15N-1H and 1H-1H NOESY dimensions can greatly facilitate RNA assignments and secondary structure determinations, as demonstrated here with the analysis of genome fragments derived from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Kim, Jihyun; Novakovic, Mihajlo; Jayanthi, Sundaresan; Lupulescu, Adonis; Kupce, Eriks; Grün, J Tassilo; Mertinkus, Klara; Oxenfarth, Andreas; Richter, Christian; Schnieders, Robbin; Wirmer-Bartoschek, Julia; Schwalbe, Harald; Frydman, Lucio",J Am Chem Soc,29,9

Based on this premise, the current research offers a novel and timely view by examining how communication messages in public service advertisements (PSAs) can alter the perception of threat under uncertain situations such as the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic. This article investigates the role of additional relative statistical information on the perception of threat and stockpiling intention. First, we examine whether there is a reduction in the perceived threat of the coronavirus if information about the potential severity of an alternative threat (car accidents) is activated, when compared to offering only statistics on the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is known as COVID-19. Furthermore, we established the mediating role of a perceived threat in consumers’ decisions and behavior in times of severe crisis. This suggests that organizations and policymakers can influence individuals by increasing or decreasing their perceived level of threat depending on the desired outcomes (e.g., respecting authorities’ recommendations or avoiding stockpiling). This research offers a deeper understanding of how consumers can be “nudged” toward desired behavior in the context of public health and safety.","Kim, Jungkeun; Giroux, Marilyn; Gonzalez-Jimenez, Hector; Jang, Seongsoo; Kim, Seongseop; Park, Jooyoung; Kim, Jae-Eun; Lee, Jacob C.; Choi, Yung Kyun",J.

It is not the first time, nor will it be last, that our increasingly globalized world has been significantly affected by the emergence of a new disease. In much of the Northern Hemisphere, the academic year begins in September, and for many countries, September 2020 marked the return to full schooling after some period of enforced closure due to COVID-19. In this paper, we focus on the airborne spread of disease and investigate the likelihood of transmission in school environments. It is crucial to understand the risk airborne infection from COVID-19 might pose to pupils, teachers, and their wider social groups. We use monitored CO2 data from 45 classrooms in 11 different schools from within the UK to estimate the likelihood of infection occurring within classrooms regularly attended by the same staff and pupils. We determine estimates of the number of secondary infections arising via the airborne route over pre/asymptomatic periods on a rolling basis. Results show that, assuming relatively quiet desk-based work, the number of secondary infections is likely to remain reassuringly below unity; however, it can vary widely between classrooms of the same school even when the same ventilation system is present. Crucially, the data highlight significant variation with the seasons with January being nearly twice as risky as July. We show that such seasonal variations in risk due to changes in ventilation rates are robust and our results hold for wide variations in disease parameterizations, suggesting our results may be applied to a number of different airborne diseases.","Vouriot, Carolanne V M; Burridge, Henry C; Noakes, Catherine J; Linden, Paul F",Indoor Air,29,24

DESIGN: A retrospective cohort from January 25 to February 29, 2020. SETTING: Cities of Wuhan, Xiaogan, and Huanggang, China. PATIENTS: The COVID-19 cases detected each day. METHODS: We collected daily data of COVID-19 incidence, 8 ambient air pollutants (particulate matter of &#8804;2.5 µm [PM2.5], particulate matter &#8804;10 µm [PM10], sulfur dioxide [SO2], carbon monoxide [CO], nitrogen dioxide [NO2], and maximum 8-h moving average concentrations for ozone [O3-8h]) and 3 meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, and wind) in China's 3 worst COVID-19-stricken cities during the study period. The multivariate Poisson regression was performed to understand their correlation. RESULTS: Daily COVID-19 incidence was positively associated with PM2.5 and humidity in all cities. Specifically, the relative risk (RR) of PM2.5 for daily COVID-19 incidences were 1.036 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.032-1.039) in Wuhan, 1.059 (95% CI, 1.046-1.072) in Xiaogan, and 1.144 (95% CI, 1.12-1.169) in Huanggang. The RR of humidity for daily COVID-19 incidence was consistently lower than that of PM2.5, and this difference ranged from 0.027 to 0.111. Moreover, PM10 and temperature also exhibited a notable correlation with daily COVID-19 incidence, but in a negative pattern The RR of PM10 for daily COVID-19 incidence ranged from 0.915 (95% CI, 0.896-0.934) to 0.961 (95% CI, 0.95-0.972, while that of temperature ranged from 0.738 (95% CI, 0.717-0.759) to 0.969 (95% CI, 0.966-0.973).

Considering the global prevalence of obesity, exploring relationships with COVID-19 are of clinical importance. The aim was to provide a comprehensive summary and recommendations on this relationship between COVID-19 and obesity. Method: A literature search was performed to prepare a narrative review of COVID-19 and obesity. Results: An obesity state promotes chronic inflammation, vitamin D deficiency, hinders immunity and causes mechanical lung compression. These increase susceptibilities to COVID-19 infection, complications including the requirement of invasive ventilation. Existing co-morbidities enhances these complications. Preventive measures of social distancing and self-isolation may increase stigmatisation and psychological deterrents. Hence, special recommendations targeting this vulnerable population are required. Conclusion: The obese population is a COVID-19 vulnerable group, requiring special attention during this pandemic to avoid complications and healthcare systems burden. Lacking COVID-19 vaccination, regular physical activity and a healthy diet are recommended with attention to mental health.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Between the onset of pandemics and January 2021, approximately 9000 patients have been treated for conf i rmed COVID-19 in the Olexandrivska Clinical Hospital. Assessment of all hospitalized patients included hematology, chemistries and proinf l ammatory cytokines - IL-6, CRP, procalcitonin, ferritin. Diagnosis was conf i rmed by PCR for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Chest X-ray was performed in all hospitalized cases, while CT was available approximately in 30% of cases during hospital stay. Lung ultrasound was proactively utilized to assess the type and extent of lung damage and to monitor the progress of disease in patients hospitalized into the ICU and Infection Unit (n=135). Ultrasound fi ndings were recorded numerically based on scales. RESULTS: Results: In the setting of SOVID-19, bedside lung ultrasound has been promptly recognized as a tool to diagnose and monitor the nature and extent of lung injury. Lung ultrasound is a real time assessment, which helps determine the nature of a pathologic process af f ecting lungs. In this paper the accuracy of bedside LUS, chest X-ray and computer tomography are compared based on clinical cases, typical for COVID-19 lung ultrasound appearance is evaluated. Described in article data is collected in one of the biggest facility that deals with COVID-19. Chest X-ray was performed in all hospitalized cases, while CT was available approximately in 30% of cases during hospital stay. The cases presented in the paper indicate potential advantages to the use of ultrasound in limited resource healthcare settings, especially when the risk of transportation to CT outweighs the value of information obtained. CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Grading of ultrasonographic findings in the lungs was suf f i cient for both initial assessment with identif ication of high risk patients, and routine daily monitoring. Hence, lung ultrsound may be used to predict deterioration, stratify risks and make clinical decisions.","Pronyuk, K. O.; Kondratiuk, L. O.; Vysotskyi, A. D.; Golubovska, O. A.; Nikitina, I.

Consequently, SARS-CoV-2 immunoassays with high specificity and positive predictive values are needed to obtain an accurate epidemiological picture. As more data accumulate about the immune responses and the kinetics of neutralizing antibody (nAb) production in SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, new applications are forecasted for serological assays such as nAb activity prediction in convalescent plasma from recovered patients. This multicenter study, involving six hospital centres, determined the baseline clinical performances, reproducibility and nAb level correlations of ten commercially available immunoassays. In addition, three lateral flow chromatography assays were evaluated as these devices can be used in logistically challenged area. All assays were evaluated using the same patient panels in duplicate thus enabling accurate comparison of the tests. Seven immunoassays examined in this study were shown to have excellent specificity (98 to 100%) and good to excellent positive predictive values (82 to 100%) when used in a low (5%) seroprevalence setting. We observed sensitivity values as low as 74% and as high as 95% at &#8805;15 days post symptom onset. The determination of optimized cut-off values through ROC curves analyses had a significant impact on the diagnostic resolution of several enzyme immunoassays by increasing the sensitivity significantly without a large trade-off in specificity. We found that Spike-based immunoassays seems to be better correlates of nAb activity. Finally, the results reported here will add up to the general knowledge of the inter-laboratory reproducibility of clinical performance parameters of immunoassays and provide new evidence about nAb activity prediction.","Therrien, C; Serhir, B; Bélanger-Collard, M; Skrzypczak, J; Shank, D K; Renaud, C; Girouard, J; Loungnarath, V; Carrier, M; Brochu, G; Tourangeau, F; Gilfix, B; Piche, A; Bazin, R; Guérin, R; Lavoie, M; Martel-Laferrière, V; Fortin, C; Benoit, A; Marcoux, D; Gauthier, N; Laumaea, A M; Gasser, R; Finzi, A; Roger, M",J. clin. microbiol,29,33

Test-negative study designs are often utilized to calculate influenza vaccine effectiveness. The virus interference phenomenon goes against the basic assumption of the test-negative vaccine effectiveness study that vaccination does not change the risk of infection with other respiratory illness, thus potentially biasing vaccine effectiveness results in the positive direction. This study aimed to investigate virus interference by comparing respiratory virus status among Department of Defense personnel based on their influenza vaccination status. Furthermore, individual respiratory viruses and their association with influenza vaccination were examined. Results: We compared vaccination status of 2880 people with non-influenza respiratory viruses to 3240 people with pan-negative results. Comparing vaccinated to non-vaccinated patients, the adjusted odds ratio for non-flu viruses was 0.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.86, 1.09; p = 0.60). Additionally, the vaccination status of 3349 cases of influenza were compared to three different control groups: all controls (N = 6120), non-influenza positive controls (N = 2880), and pan-negative controls (N = 3240). The adjusted ORs for the comparisons among the three control groups did not vary much (range: 0.46–0.51). Conclusions: Receipt of influenza vaccination was not associated with virus interference among our population. Examining virus interference by specific respiratory viruses showed mixed results. Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus; however, significant protection with vaccination was associated not only with most influenza viruses, but also parainfluenza, RSV, and non-influenza virus coinfections.","Wolff, Greg G.",Vaccine,29,2

The objectives were to evaluate; the rate and influences of vaccine hesitancy compared to a decade ago, vaccination patterns between Amish affiliations, vaccine practices of Amish special needs children, and the Amish's acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. STUDY DESIGN: In April of 2020, a survey assessing vaccination patterns and beliefs were mailed to 1000 Amish families, including ultra-conservative Amish sects and special needs families. RESULTS: The response rate was 39%. Among 391 respondents, 59% did not vaccinate their children, compared to only 14% that refused all vaccinations reported by Wenger et al in the same community only a decade ago. The ultra-conservative Amish rejected vaccines more often. Amish special needs children were more likely to receive vaccines than healthy Amish children. 75% responded they would reject a COVID-19 vaccine. Fear of adverse effects was the most common reason to reject vaccines. Families that accepted vaccines were more likely to cite a healthcare worker as the primary influence to vaccinate. Wives were more likely to cite their spouse as the primary influence to vaccinate. Families that rejected vaccines were more likely to state their bishop was the most influential person on vaccination. CONCLUSION: The Holmes County Amish have decreasing vaccine acceptance. Efforts to improve vaccination will require a targeted focus on the primary influences and beliefs of sub-populations within the Amish. Physician advocacy, peer mentorship, father-directed education, and close partnership with Church leadership will be needed to limit vaccine-preventable disease. The Amish may be at risk for low uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine.","Scott, Ethan M; Stein, Rachel; Brown, Miraides F; Hershberger, Jennifer; Scott, Elizabeth M; Wenger, Olivia K",Vaccine,29,16

In Cuba, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 11, 2020. Elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities are particularly susceptible to adverse clinical outcomes in the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. During the outbreak, a local transmission event took place in a nursing home in Villa Clara province, Cuba, in which 19 elderly residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Based on the increased susceptibility to cytokine release syndrome, inducing respiratory and systemic complications in this population, 19 patients were included in an expanded access clinical trial to receive itolizumab, an anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. RESULTS: All patients had underlying medical conditions. The product was well tolerated. After the first dose, the course of the disease was favorable, and 18 of the 19 patients (94.7%) were discharged clinically recovered with negative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test results at 13 days. After one dose of itolizumab, circulating IL-6 decreased within the first 24-48 h in patients with high baseline values, whereas in patients with low levels, this concentration remained over low values. To preliminarily assess the effect of itolizumab, a control group was selected among the Cuban COVID-19 patients that did not receive immunomodulatory therapy. The control subjects were well matched regarding age, comorbidities, and severity of the disease. The percentage of itolizumab-treated, moderately ill patients who needed to be admitted to the intensive care unit was only one-third of that of the control group not treated with itolizumab. Additionally, treatment with itolizumab reduced the risk of death 10 times as compared with the control group. CONCLUSION: This study corroborates that the timely use of itolizumab in combination with other antivirals reduces COVID-19 disease worsening and mortality. The humanized antibody itolizumab emerges as a therapeutic alternative for patients with COVID-19. Our results suggest the possible use of itolizumab in patients with cytokine release syndrome from other pathologies.","Díaz, Yayquier; Ramos-Suzarte, Mayra; Martín, Yordanis; Calderón, Néstor Antonio; Santiago, William; Viñet, Orlando; La O, Yulieski; Oyarzábal, Jorge Pérez Augusto; Pérez, Yoan; Lorenzo, Geidy; Cepeda, Meylan; Saavedra, Danay; Mazorra, Zaima; Estevez, Daymys; Lorenzo-Luaces, Patricia; Valenzuela, Carmen; Caballero, Armando; Leon, Kalet; Crombet, Tania; Hidalgo, Carlos Jorge",Gerontology,29,16

Such an objective should be harmonized with social, economic, and environmental sustainability aspects to maintain safe food production and food security worldwide. For more than a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has raised and is still strongly disrupting the agro-livestock production sector, similar to several other economic sectors. In this sector, the relationships between suppliers, producers, and consumers should always continue to maintain the activity of the production chain, which are impaired by social distancing decisions taken following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, a global cross-sectional survey (translated into four languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish) was shared with people belonging to the agricultural sector to identify: (1) the role of the agricultural information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agro-livestock farming systems sustainability during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the need for such technologies in the agricultural sector, and (3) the factors that affect the use of such technologies. The results showed that the most frequently used agricultural ICTs were social media (Facebook and/or WhatsApp;27.3%) and online platforms and Internet services (26.3%), whereas robotic vehicles and/or drones (6.6%) were less frequently used. During the emergence of the pandemic, the major reasons impacting agro-livestock farming systems’ sustainability were social distancing (30.0%), shortage of labor (17.7%), maintaining precision farm management (14.8%), product marketing (14.2%), access production inputs (7.2%), and others (16.1%). Applying agricultural ICTs solved many obstacles related to the production process, such as maintaining precision farm management (25.6%), product marketing (23.6%), and access production inputs (16.1%). The subgroup analyses of the results considering the degree of country advancement, size of agribusinesses, and role/position of respondents in the farm highlighted the importance of supporting the use, availability, and awareness of agricultural ICTs at least for some groups of people such as those belong to developing countries, laborers, and small-scale agri-business holders. This cross-sectional study highlights the urgent need to turn to and to expand the use of new agricultural ICTs to meet the growing demand for food production in the world and to ensure the resilience and sustainability of farming systems, specifically under unexpected and extreme conditions.","Hashem, Nesrein M.; Hassanein, Eman M.; Hocquette, Jean-François Gonzalez-Bulnes Antonio Ahmed Fayrouz A.; Attia, Youssef A.; Asiry, Khalid A.",Sustainability,29,20

The relationship between the progression of COVID-19 and Nutritional status is still unclear. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of 342 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, and analyzed the relationship between the progression of COVID-19 and Nutritional status. METHODOLOGY: 342 COVID-19 were enrolled from ten different hospitals in China. The clinical characteristics were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI) of the mild patients (Group A) was higher than those in severe patients (Group B) and critical patients (Group C); The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of Group A was lower than those of the other two groups; Sex, age, and BMI, was strongly correlated with Clinical classification (CT); Among the laboratory test results, Neutrophil (NEU%), Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), LDH, and blood glucose (BG) were positively correlated with CT; Lymphocyte ( LYM%), Platelet (PLT), Albumin (ALB), and Creatinine (Cr) were negatively correlated with CT. BMI, NEU%, LYM%, ALB, Cr, and PLT are all protective factors that affect CT. CONCLUSION: People with poor nutritional status (lower BMI and ALB) have a higher risk of developing severe disease after infection with SARS-CoV-2. In the clinical treatment of COVID-19, individualized nutritional support is very important for the rehabilitation of patients.","Li, Yang; Zhu, Chuanwu; Zhang, Biao; Liu, Longgen; Ji, Fang; Zhao, Yun; Cheng, Juan; Shao, Huaping; Guan, Xinying; Ming, Fang; Wu, Chao; Du, Zhi Xiang",J Infect Dev Ctries,29,16

This paper presents an end-to-end automated system, called C2CL, comprised of a mobile finger photo capture app, preprocessing, and matching algorithms to handle the challenges inhibiting previous cross-matching methods; namely i) low ridge-valley contrast of contactless fingerprints, ii) varying roll, pitch, yaw, and distance of the finger to the camera, iii) non-linear distortion of contact-based fingerprints, and vi) different image qualities of smartphone cameras. Our preprocessing algorithm segments, enhances, scales, and unwarps contactless fingerprints, while our matching algorithm extracts both minutiae and texture representations. A sequestered dataset of 9,888 contactless 2D fingerprints and corresponding contact-based fingerprints from 206 subjects (2 thumbs and 2 index fingers for each subject) acquired using our mobile capture app is used to evaluate the cross-database performance of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, additional experimental results on 3 publicly available datasets demonstrate, for the first time, contact to contactless fingerprint matching accuracy that is comparable to existing contact to contact fingerprint matching systems (TAR in the range of 96.67% to 98.15% at FAR=0.01%).","Grosz, Steven A.; Engelsma, Joshua J.; Jain, Anil K.",,29,11

This virus induced a large number of deaths and millions of confirmed cases worldwide, creating a serious danger to public health. However, there are no specific therapies or drugs available for COVID-19 treatment. While new drug discovery is a long process, repurposing available drugs for COVID-19 can help recognize treatments with known clinical profiles. Computational drug repurposing methods can reduce the cost, time, and risk of drug toxicity. In this work, we build a graph as a COVID-19 related biological network. This network is related to virus targets or their associated biological processes. We select essential proteins in the constructed biological network that lead to a major disruption in the network. Our method from these essential proteins chooses 93 proteins related to COVID-19 pathology. Then, we propose multiple informative features based on drug–target and protein−protein interaction information. Through these informative features, we find five appropriate clusters of drugs that contain some candidates as potential COVID-19 treatments. To evaluate our results, we provide statistical and clinical evidence for our candidate drugs.

Published results are inconclusive, possibly due to differences in participant comorbidities and sociodemographic backgrounds. Since ACEI and ARB are frequently used anti-hypertension medications, we aim to determine whether the use of ACEI and ARB is associated with the occurrence and severity of COVID-19 in a large study of US Veterans with hypertension. METHODS: Data were collected from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) National Corporate Data Warehouse (VA-COVID-19 Shared Data Resource) between February 28, 2020 and August 18, 2020. Using data from 228,722 Veterans with a history of hypertension who received COVID-19 testing at the VA, we investigated whether the use of ACEI or ARB over the two years prior to the index date was associated with increased odds of (1) a positive COVID-19 test, and (2) a severe outcome (hospitalization, mortality, and use of intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation) among COVID-19-positive patients. We used logistic regression with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between ACEI/ARB use and a positive COVID-19 test result. The association between medication use and COVID-19 outcome severity was examined using multinomial logistic regression comparing participants who were not hospitalized to participants who were hospitalized, were admitted to the ICU, used a mechanical ventilator, or died. All models were adjusted for relevant covariates, including demographics (age, sex, race, ethnicity), selected comorbidities, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). RESULTS: The use of ACEI significantly decreased the odds of a positive COVID-19 test among Veterans with hypertension (OR = 0.917, (0.887, 0.948) and OR = 0.926, (0.894, 0.958) with PSW). The use of ACEI, but not of ARB, was also associated with significantly increased odds of using mechanical ventilators (OR = 1.265, (1.010, 1.584) and OR = 1.210, (1.053, 1.39) with PSW) among all COVID-19 inpatients compared to outpatients. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of Veterans with hypertension, ACEI was significantly associated with decreased odds of testing positive for COVID-19. With the exception of the association of ACEI with a small non-clinically-important increase in the odds of using mechanical ventilators, neither ACEI nor ARB was found to be associated with clinical severity or mortality among COVID-19-positive Veterans. The results of this study need further corroboration and validation in other cohort samples outside the VA.","Li, Mingfei; Wang, Ying; Ndiwane, Ndindam; Orner, Michelle B.; Palacios, Natalia; Mittler, Brant; Berlowitz, Dan; Kazis, Lewis E.; Xia, Weiming",PLoS One,29,16

While PCR is rapid and highly accurate, it requires costly laboratory equipment and healthcare professionals that limit its use for large‐scale screening of mild or asymptomatic patients. Self‐collection kits for use in the home could remedy this and have consequently received great attention. In April, 2020, a self‐collection kit from LapCorp was the first such kit to be approved by the FDA. In the following month, May 2020, another kit developed by Everlywell received FDA approval, and more kits are evidently on their way to the market in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. Because these home‐based, self‐collection kits are easy to use and may be more acceptable for patients, they provide a superior screening option for mild or asymptomatic patients under self‐quarantine. These kits conserve personal protective equipment and healthcare manpower already in short supply. The primary issues affecting the efficacy of this approach are the potential for inappropriate sampling and insufficient clinical examination. A detailed review of the commercially available kits currently available is provided and their prospective impact is noted during the current pandemic.","Liao, Wan‐Ting; Hsu, Min‐Yen; Shen, Ching‐Fen; Hung, Kai‐Feng; Cheng, Chao‐Min",Adv Biosyst,29,20

In this study, we investigated the potential of the pilin subunit protein encoded by the mtp gene as a diagnostic biomarker. BLAST analysis of the mtp gene on published genome databases, and amplicon sequencing were performed in Mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex (MTBC) strains and other organisms. The protein secondary structure of the amino acid sequences of non-tuberculous Mycobacteria that partially aligned with the mtp sequence was analysed with PredictProtein software. The mtp gene and corresponding amino acid sequence of MTBC were 100% homologous with H37Rv, in contrast to the partial alignment of the non-tuberculous Mycobacteria. The mtp gene was present in all 91 clinical isolates of MTBC. Except for 2 strains with point mutations, the sequence was 100% conserved among the clinical strains. The mtp gene could not be amplified in all non-tuberculous Mycobacteria and respiratory organisms. The predicted MTP protein structure of Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium ulcerans and Mycobacterium abscessus differed significantly from that of the M. tuberculosis, which was similar to Mycobacterium marinum. The absence of the mtp gene in non-tuberculous Mycobacteria and other respiratory bacteria suggests that its encoded product, the pilin subunit protein of M. tuberculosis may be a suitable marker for a point of care TB test.","Naidoo, Natasha; Ramsugit, Saiyur; Pillay, Manormoney",Tuberculosis (Edinb),29,1

The timely diagnosis of grave diseases like different forms of cancer and other life-threatening diseases can save a valuable life or at least extend the life span of an afflicted individual. The advancement of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) enabled healthcare technologies can provide effective medical facilities to the population and contribute greatly towards the recuperation of patients. The usage of IoMT in the diagnosis and study of histopathological images can enable real-time identification of diseases and corresponding remedial actions can be taken to save an affected individual. This can be achieved by the use of imaging apparatus with the capacity of auto-analysis of captured images. However, most deep learning-based image classifying models are bulk in size and are inappropriate for use in IoT based imaging devices. The objective of this research work is to design a deep learning-based lightweight model suitable for histopathological image analysis with appreciable accuracy. This paper presents a novel lightweight deep learning-based model ""ReducedFireNet"", for auto-classification of histopathological images. The proposed method attained a mean accuracy of 96.88% and an F1 score of 0.968 on evaluating an actual histopathological image data set. The results are encouraging, considering the complexity of histopathological images. In addition to the high accuracy the lightweight design (size in few KBs) of the ReducedFireNet model, makes it suitable for IoMT imaging equipment. The simulation results show the proposed model has computational requirement of 0.201 GFLOPS and has a mere size of only 0.391 MB.","Datta Gupta, Koyel; Sharma, Deepak Kumar; Ahmed, Shakib; Gupta, Harsh; Gupta, Deepak; Hsu, Ching-Hsien",Neural Process Lett,29,16

Non-gestational choriocarcinoma, or primary choriocarcinoma is a trophoblastic disease which is associated with a poor patient prognosis and is markedly angioinvasive. Primary non-gestational mediastinal choriocarcinoma is a very rare disease and represents an aggressive malignancy, primarily seen in young males. Those with primary mediastinal choriocarcinoma have symptoms that are non-specific such as cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis, and chest pain. Here we present the case of a 47-year-old Caucasian female who presented with worsening dyspnea and cough. Laboratory testing revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase, human chorionic gonadotropin, and cancer antigen 125. Chest X-ray was significant for a large right pleural effusion and a computed tomography angiogram of the chest showed a soft tissue mass in the anterior medial right lung base/right middle lobe. Thoracentesis yielded results consistent with malignant cells favoring a germ cell tumor. Biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed positivity for inhibin and both human chorionic gonadotropin and CD-10 which led to the diagnosis of primary choriocarcinoma. Primary mediastinal choriocarcinoma is uncommon and often has a non-specific clinical presentation. A high degree of suspicion is needed as this malignancy can be aggressive, necessitating urgent definitive tissue biopsy diagnosis to guide appropriate therapy.","Hamera, Leonard; Posch, Marie-Louise; Abraham, Sunoj; Jordan, Jeffrey",Cureus,29,16

The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the utilization of hospice services is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the utilization of hospice care services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: All patients (n = 19,900) cared for at Taipei City Hospital from January 2019 to April 2020 were divided into three time points: January–April 2019 (before COVID-19), May–December 2019 (interim), and January–April 2020 (during COVID-19). This cohort study compared the monthly utilization of hospice services before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in hospice home visits (194 vs. 184; P = 0.686) and new enrollments (15 vs. 14; P = 0.743) to hospice home care before and during the pandemic. However, the bed occupancy rate in hospice units in the hospital was significantly reduced from 66.2% before the pandemic to 37.4% during the pandemic (P = 0.029), whereas that in nonhospice units had a nonsignificant decrease from 81.6% before the pandemic to 71.8% during the pandemic (P = 0.086). During the pandemic, the number of inpatient days was affected more severely in hospice units than in nonhospice units (−42.4% vs. −10.9%; P = 0.029). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that hospice home care services were maintained during the COVID-19 pandemic, while the utilization of hospice inpatient care services reduced. Home care for hospice patients is an essential component of palliative care during a pandemic.","Chou, Yi-Chang; Yen, Yung-Feng; Feng, Rung-Chuang; Wu, Meng-Ping; Lee, Ya-Ling; Chu, Dachen; Huang, Sheng-Jean; Curtis, J.

Ce virus a été rapidement responsable d’une pandémie majeure. La maladie COVID-19 se manifeste souvent par des symptômes respiratoires, néanmoins des manifestations digestives ont été rapportées soulevant le potentiel tropisme du SARS-CoV2 pour le tractus digestif. Objectifs Préciser les manifestations digestives liées au SARS-CoV2 et leur impact sur le pronostic de la maladie. Matériels et méthodes Une étude rétrospective incluant tous les patients hospitalisés pour une infection à COVID-19 confirmée par une RT-PCR et/ou un test rapide sur une période de 3 mois (1er novembre 2020 au 31 janvier 2021). Résultats Au total, 133 parmi 303 patients hospitalisés pour une infection COVID-19 confirmée, avaient des manifestations digestives (44 %). L’âge moyen de ces patients était 63,4±14 ans avec une prédominance masculine (sex-ratio=1,8). Les patients étaient obèses dans 17 % des cas. Une comorbidité était notée chez la majorité des patients: le diabète (46 %), l’hypertension artérielle (40 %), l’insuffisance coronaire (13 %) et la dyslipidémie (10,5 %). Aucuns malades n’avaient une pathologie gastrique ou hépatique sous-jacente. Les manifestations digestives étaient révélatrices de la maladie dans 68% des cas et isolés sans signes respiratoires dans 17 % des cas. Le délai moyen d’hospitalisation était 8±4 jours. Les principaux symptômes digestifs étaient la diarrhée (34,6 %), les vomissements (34,6 %), la douleur abdominale (26 %) et les nausées (10 %). L’examen clinique a trouvé une sensibilité abdominale dans 10 % des cas. Les principales anomalies constatées à la biologie hépatique étaient la cytolyse (52 %), l’hyper bilirubinémie (9 %) et la cholestase hépatique (10 %). La lipasémie était élevée chez deux patients (1,5 %). Un scanner abdominal a été pratiqué chez 7 patients montrant un kyste hydatique du foie non compliqué (1 cas), une iléo-jéjunite (1 cas), une cholangite non spécifique (1 cas), une hypertrophie de la tète du pancréas (1 cas) et une ascite de faible abondance (1 cas). Le reste des patients avait un scanner abdominal normal. Les formes graves étaient notées dans 41 % des cas. La perturbation du bilan hépatique était associée à des formes graves dans 42 % des cas. Cent neuf patients (82 %) avaient reçu une oxygénothérapie au cours de leur hospitalisation pour des manifestations respiratoires associées. L’évolution était fatale dans 19,5 % des cas. Conclusion Devant la fréquence des manifestations digestives, le tropisme entérocytaire du SARS-CoV-2 est bien établi. Le tropisme hépatique est aussi probable. Ces manifestations peuvent être révélatrices d’une infection COVID-19 mais aussi peuvent être à l’origine d’erreurs et de retards diagnostiques en l’absence de manifestations respiratoires.","Mnif, K.; Smaoui, F.; Ben Hmida, S.; Hana Chaabouni, H.; Gassara, F.; Rekik, K.; Koubaa, M.; Marrakchi, C.; Ben Jemaa, M.",Infectious Diseases Now,29,20

We investigated whether patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated with infliximab have attenuated serological responses to a single-dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Methods Antibody responses and seroconversion rates in infliximab-treated patients (n=865) were compared to a cohort treated with vedolizumab (n=428), a gut-selective anti-integrin a4B7 monoclonal antibody. Our primary outcome was anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antibody concentrations 3-10 weeks after vaccination in patients without evidence of prior infection. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion rates, and antibody responses following past infection or a second dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Findings Geometric mean [SD] anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations were lower in patients treated with infliximab than vedolizumab, following BNT162b2 (6.0 U/mL [5.9] vs 28.8 U/mL [5.4] P<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (4.7 U/mL [4.9]) vs 13.8 U/mL [5.9] P<0.0001) vaccines. In our multivariable models, antibody concentrations were lower in infliximab- compared to vedolizumab-treated patients who received the BNT162b2 (fold change [FC] 0.29 [95% CI 0.21, 0.40], p<0.0001) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (FC 0.39 [95% CI 0.30, 0.51], p<0.0001) vaccines. In both models, age > 59 years, immunomodulator use, Crohn's disease, and smoking were associated with lower, whilst non-white ethnicity was associated with higher, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody concentrations. Seroconversion rates after a single-dose of either vaccine were higher in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and after two doses of BNT162b2 vaccine. Interpretation Infliximab is associated with attenuated immunogenicity to a single-dose of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccination after SARS-CoV-2 infection, or a second dose of vaccine, led to seroconversion in most patients. Delayed second dosing should be avoided in patients treated with infliximab.

The respiratory tract is a primary target of potential concurrent exposure to both inhaled pollutants and pathogens, including viruses. Although there are various associative studies linking adverse outcomes to co- or subsequent exposures to inhaled pollutants and viruses, knowledge about causal linkages and mechanisms by which pollutant exposure may alter human respiratory responses to viral infection is more limited. In this article, we review what is known about the impact of pollutant exposure on antiviral host defense responses and describe potential mechanisms by which pollutants can alter the viral infection cycle. This review focuses on evidence from human observational and controlled exposure, ex vivo, and in vitro studies. Overall, there are a myriad of points throughout the viral infection cycle that inhaled pollutants can alter to modulate appropriate host defense responses. These alterations may contribute to observed increases in rates of viral infection and associated morbidity and mortality in areas of the world with high ambient pollution levels or in people using tobacco products. Although the understanding of mechanisms of interaction is advancing through controlled in vivo and in vitro exposure models, more studies are needed because emerging infectious pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, present a significant threat to public health.","Rebuli, Meghan E; Brocke, Stephanie A; Jaspers, Ilona",J. allergy clin. immunol,29,16

TropNO2VCDs from OMI and TROPOMI reveal sharp reductions of 33%–72% during 2020 LNY holiday season and the co-occurring outbreak of COVID-19 relative to the climatological mean of 2005–2019 LNY holiday seasons, and 22%–67% relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season. These reductions of TropNO2VCD occur majorly over highly polluted metropolitan areas with condensed industrial and transportation emission sources. COVID-19 control measures including lockdowns and shelter-in-place regulations are the primary reason for these tropospheric NO2 reductions over most areas of East China in 2020 LNY holiday season relative to the 2019 LNY holiday season, as COVID-19 control measures may explain ~87%–90% of tropospheric NO2 reduction in Wuhan as well as ~62%–89% in Beijing, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) areas. The clean air regulation of China also contributes significantly to reductions of tropospheric NO2 simultaneously and is the primary factor in the Sichuan Basin area, by explaining ~56%–62% of the tropospheric NO2 reduction there.","Huang, Guanyu; Sun, Kang",Sci Total Environ,29,33

This study analyses the epidemiology of pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D) onset during the first two pandemic waves and three previous years. METHODS: All the 13 pediatric diabetes centers in Lombardy prospectively evaluated charts of children at T1D onset (0–17 years), during year 2020. After calculating the annual incidence, the data were compared with those of the 3 previous years, using generalized linear models, adjusted for age and sex. Monthly T1D new onsets and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were investigated yearly from 2017 to 2020. Data were extracted from outpatients charts of the pediatric diabetes centers and from the database of the national institute of statistics. FINDINGS: The estimated incidence proportion of T1D was 16/100·000 in 2020, compared to 14, 11 and 12 in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. When adjusting for age and gender, the incidence was significantly lower in 2018 and 2017 compared to 2020 (adjusted incidence ratio: 0.73 and 0.77 respectively, with 95% CI: 0.63 to 0.84, and 0.67 to 0.83; p = 0·002 and p = 0·01), but no difference was found between the years 2020 and 2019. A reduction trend in the percentage of T1D diagnosis during the first wave (March-April) over the total year diagnoses was observed compared to previous years (11·7% in 2020, 17·7% in 2019, 14·1% in 2018 and 14·4% 2017). No difference was observed during the second wave (October-December) (32·8% in 2020, 33·8% in 2019, 34% in 2018, 30·7% in 2017). The proportion of DKA over the total T1D diagnoses during the second wave had higher trend than the first one (41·7% vs 33·3%), while severe DKA over the total DKA appeared higher during the first wave (60% vs 37·1%). INTERPRETATION: The study suggests an increase in the incidence of pediatric T1D in Lombardy throughout the past five years. Pandemic waves may have affected the clinical presentation at onset.

Likewise, the identification of factors that shape symbiont metacommunity structures is important in disease ecology because resulting structures drive disease transmission. We tested the hypothesis that distributions of virus species and viral families from rodents and bats are defined by shared responses to host phylogeny and host functional characteristics, shaping the viral metacommunity structures at four spatial scales (Continental, Biogeographical, Zoogeographical, and Regional). The contribution of host phylogeny and host traits to the metacommunity of viruses at each spatial scale was calculated using a redundant analysis of canonical ordering (RDA). For rodents, at American Continental scale the coherence of viral species metacommunity increased while the spatial scale decreased and Quasi-Clementsian structures were observed. This pattern suggests a restricted distribution of viruses through their hosts, while in the Big Mass (Europe, Africa, and Asia), the coherence decreased as spatial scale decreased. Viral species metacommunities associated with bats was dominated by random structures along all spatial scales. We suggest that this random pattern is a result of the presence of viruses with high occupancy range such as rabies (73%) and coronavirus (27%), that disrupt such structures. At viral family scale, viral metacommunities associated with bats showed coherent structures, with the emergence of Quasi- Clementsian and Checkerboard structures. RDA analysis indicates that the assemblage of viral diversity associated with rodents and bats responds to phylogenetic and functional characteristics, which alternate between spatial scales. Several of these variations could be subject to the spatial scale, in spite of this, we could identify patterns at macro ecological scale. The application of metacommunity theory at symbiont scales is particularly useful for large-scale ecological analysis. Understanding the rules of host-virus association can be useful to take better decisions in epidemiological surveillance, control and even predictions of viral distribution and dissemination.

Genome sequencing is the gold standard method to identify the emerging variants of concern. But it is time-consuming and expensive, limiting the widespread deployment of genome surveillance in some countries. Health authorities surge the development of alternative assay to expand screening capacity with reduced time and cost. In this study, we developed an in-house TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probe-based one-step RT-qPCR assay to detect the presence of N501Y mutation in SARS-CoV-2. A total of 168 SARS-CoV-2 positive respiratory specimens were collected to determine diagnostic accuracy of the RT-qPCR assay. As a reference standard, PANGO lineages and the mutation patterns of all samples were characterised by whole-genome sequencing. The analytical sensitivity and the ability of the assay to detect low frequency of N501Y variants were also evaluated. A total of 31 PANGO lineages were identified from 168 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, in which 34 samples belonged to N501Y variants, including B.1.1.7 (n = 20), B.1.351 (n = 12) and P.3 (n = 2). The N501Y RT-qPCR correctly identified all 34 samples as N501Y-positive and the other 134 samples as wildtype. The limit-of-detection of the assay consistently achieved 1.5 copies/μL on four different qPCR platforms. N501Y mutation was successfully detected at an allele frequency as low as 10% in a sample with mixed SARS-CoV-2 lineage. The N501Y RT-qPCR is simple and inexpensive (US$1.6 per sample). It enables robust high-throughput screening for surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern harbouring N501Y mutation.","Chan, Chloe Toi-Mei; Leung, Jake Siu-Lun; Lee, Lam-Kwong; Lo, Hazel Wing-Hei; Wong, Evelyn Yin-Kwan; Wong, Denise Sze-Hang; Ng, Timothy Ting-Leung; Lao, Hiu-Yin; Lu, Kelvin Keru; Jim, Stephanie Hoi-Ching; Yau, Miranda Chong-Yee; Lam, Jimmy Yiu-Wing; Ho, Alex Yat-Man; Luk, Kristine Shik; Yip, Kam-Tong; Que, Tak-Lun; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Siu, Gilman Kit-Hang",J Virol Methods,29,28

With this study we investigated the perceptions of doctors and nurses on hybridization in clinical directorates (CDs) in hospitals. METHODS: We investigated the attitudes of healthcare professionals (doctors and nurses) towards eight hospital CDs in the Local Health Authority (LHA) of Bologna (Emilia Romagna, Italy) 6 years after their implementation. We used a validated questionnaire by Braithwaite and Westbrook (2004). Drawing on Palmer et al. (2007), we added a section about the characteristics of department heads. In all, 123 healthcare professionals in managerial roles completed and returned the questionnaire. The return rate was 47.4% for doctors and 31.6% for nurses. RESULTS: Doctors reported an increase in clinical governance, interdisciplinarity collaboration, and standardization of clinical work. Hybridization of practices was noted to have taken place. While doctors did not see these changes as a threat to professional values, they felt that hospital managers had taken greater control. There was a large overlap of attitudes between doctors and nurses: inter-professional integration in CDs fostered alignment of values and aims. The polarity index was higher for responses from the doctors than from the nurses. CONCLUSION: The study findings have implications for policy makers and managers: mission and strategic mandate of CDs; governance of CDs, leadership issues; opportunities for engaging healthcare professionals; changes in managerial involvement during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Drawing on the experience of multiple clinical trials at a single academic medical centre in the USA, we posit that concurrent COVID-19 trials are liable to unfair and inequitable subject selection on account of scientific uncertainty, lack of transparency, scarcity and, lastly, structural barriers to equity compounded by implicit bias. To address the critical gap in the current literature and international regulation, we propose new ethical guidelines for research design and conduct that bolsters fair and equitable subject selection. Although the proposed guidelines are tailored to the research design and protocol of concurrent trials in the COVID-19 pandemic, they may have broader relevance to single COVID-19 trials.","Jansen, Maud O.; Angelos, Peter; Schrantz, Stephen J.; Donington, Jessica S.; Madariaga, Maria Lucia L.; Zakrison, Tanya L.",J Med Ethics,29,28

In this scenario, pre-pectoral implant-based breast reconstruction can be definitively considered a sustainable technique. Nevertheless, the authors focus on the management of patients who had already undergone a same day procedure with two-stage breast reconstruction, implanting a breast tissue expander during the last two-year period and have been progressively delayed according to a surgical care based on priority. We coined the expression “unhappy tissue expander” to define all those symptomatic patients for which surgery should not be delayed even during an epidemic context.

Among these is the urgent need for a better understanding of humoral immune response against the virus as a basis for developing public health strategies to control viral spread. For this, sensitive, specific and quantitative serological assays are required. Here we describe the development of a semi-quantitative high-content microscopy-based assay for detection of three major classes (IgG, IgA and IgM) of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies in human samples. The possibility to detect antibodies against the entire viral proteome together with a robust semi-automated image analysis workflow resulted in specific, sensitive and unbiased assay which complements the portfolio of SARS-CoV-2 serological assays. The procedure described here has been used for clinical studies and provides a general framework for the application of quantitative high-throughput microscopy to rapidly develop serological assays for emerging virus infections.","Pape, Constantin; Remme, Roman; Wolny, Adrian; Olberg, Sylvia; Wolf, Steffen; Cerrone, Lorenzo; Cortese, Mirko; Klaus, Severina; Lucic, Bojana; Ullrich, Stephanie; Anders-Össwein, Maria; Wolf, Stefanie; Cerikan, Berati; Neufeldt, Christopher J.; Ganter, Markus; Schnitzler, Paul; Merle, Uta; Lusic, Marina; Boulant, Steeve; Stanifer, Megan; Bartenschlager, Ralf; Hamprecht, Fred A.; Kreshuk, Anna; Tischer, Christian; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg; Müller, Barbara; Laketa, Vibor",bioRxiv,29,20

This has led to conceptual advances including biological membrane:protein assemblies or “memteins” as the fundamental functional units of biological membranes. Tools including cryo-electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography are maturing such that it is becoming increasingly feasible to solve structures of large, multicomponent complexes, while complementary methods including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy yield unique insights into interactions and dynamics. Challenges remain, including elucidating exactly how lipids and ligands are recognized at atomic resolution and transduce signals across asymmetric bilayers. In this special volume some of the latest thinking and methods are gathered through the analysis of a range of transmembrane targets. Ongoing work on areas including polymer design, protein labelling and microfluidic technologies will ensure continued progress on improving resolution and throughput, providing deeper understanding of this most important group of targets.","Lemieux, M.

Persistent illness has been reported; however, its prevalence and characteristics are unclear. We aimed to determine illness duration and characteristics in symptomatic UK school-aged children tested for SARS-CoV-2 using data from the COVID Symptom Study, one of the largest UK citizen participatory epidemiological studies to date. METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, data from UK school-aged children (age 5–17 years) were reported by an adult proxy. Participants were voluntary, and used a mobile application (app) launched jointly by Zoe Limited and King's College London. Illness duration and symptom prevalence, duration, and burden were analysed for children testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom illness duration could be determined, and were assessed overall and for younger (age 5–11 years) and older (age 12–17 years) groups. Children with longer than 1 week between symptomatic reports on the app were excluded from analysis. Data from symptomatic children testing negative for SARS-CoV-2, matched 1:1 for age, gender, and week of testing, were also assessed. FINDINGS: 258 790 children aged 5–17 years were reported by an adult proxy between March 24, 2020, and Feb 22, 2021, of whom 75 529 had valid test results for SARS-CoV-2. 1734 children (588 younger and 1146 older children) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and calculable illness duration within the study timeframe (illness onset between Sept 1, 2020, and Jan 24, 2021). The most common symptoms were headache (1079 [62·2%] of 1734 children), and fatigue (954 [55·0%] of 1734 children). Median illness duration was 6 days (IQR 3–11) versus 3 days (2–7) in children testing negative, and was positively associated with age (Spearman's rank-order r(s) 0·19, p<0·0001). Median illness duration was longer for older children (7 days, IQR 3–12) than younger children (5 days, 2–9). 77 (4·4%) of 1734 children had illness duration of at least 28 days, more commonly in older than younger children (59 [5·1%] of 1146 older children vs 18 [3·1%] of 588 younger children; p=0·046). The commonest symptoms experienced by these children during the first 4 weeks of illness were fatigue (65 [84·4%] of 77), headache (60 [77·9%] of 77), and anosmia (60 [77·9%] of 77); however, after day 28 the symptom burden was low (median 2 symptoms, IQR 1–4) compared with the first week of illness (median 6 symptoms, 4–8). Only 25 (1·8%) of 1379 children experienced symptoms for at least 56 days. Few children (15 children, 0·9%) in the negatively tested cohort had symptoms for at least 28 days; however, these children experienced greater symptom burden throughout their illness (9 symptoms, IQR 7·7–11·0 vs 8, 6–9) and after day 28 (5 symptoms, IQR 1·5–6·5 vs 2, 1–4) than did children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. INTERPRETATION: Although COVID-19 in children is usually of short duration with low symptom burden, some children with COVID-19 experience prolonged illness duration. Reassuringly, symptom burden in these children did not increase with time, and most recovered by day 56. Some children who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 also had persistent and burdensome illness. A holistic approach for all children with persistent illness during the pandemic is appropriate.

Genetic screens are often performed in transformed cell lines that poorly represent viral target cells in vivo, leading to discoveries that may not be translated to the clinic. Intestinal organoids are increasingly used to model human disease and are amenable to genetic engineering. To discern which host factors are reliable anti-coronavirus therapeutic targets, we generate mutant clonal IOs for 19 host genes previously implicated in coronavirus biology. We verify ACE2 and DPP4 as entry receptors for SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV respectively. SARS-CoV-2 replication in IOs does not require the endosomal Cathepsin B/L proteases, but specifically depends on the cell surface protease TMPRSS2. Other TMPRSS family members were not essential. The newly emerging coronavirus variant B.1.1.7, as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV similarly depended on TMPRSS2. These findings underscore the relevance of non-transformed human models for coronavirus research, identify TMPRSS2 as an attractive pan-coronavirus therapeutic target, and demonstrate that an organoid knockout biobank is a valuable tool to investigate the biology of current and future emerging coronaviruses.","Beumer, Joep; Geurts, Maarten H.; Lamers, Mart M.; Puschhof, Jens; Zhang, Jingshu; van der Vaart, Jelte; Mykytyn, Anna Z.; Breugem, Tim I.; Riesebosch, Samra; Schipper, Debby; van den Doel, Petra B.; de Lau, Wim; Pleguezuelos-Manzano, Cayetano; Busslinger, Georg; Haagmans, Bart L.; Clevers, Hans",Nat Commun,29,28

METHODS: A single institution, retrospective cohort study was performed in women with EOC who underwent IDS with HIPEC from 2017 to 2019 via MIS or LAP. Peri-operative outcomes were compared using univariate analysis. RESULTS: In total, 50 eligible women were identified; ten (20.0%) underwent MIS + HIPEC and 40 (80.0%) LAP + HIPEC. The median age of patients in the MIS group was 71.1 vs. 64.2 years in LAP (p = 0.031). There was no significant difference in pre-operative complete radiographic response following NACT (p = 0.18). Notably, there was no difference in the rate of R0 resection (70.0% vs. 77.5%; p = 0.39). There was no significant difference in ICU admission, estimated blood loss, operative time, or use of vasopressors between the cohorts. Similarly, there was no difference in 30-day adverse events for MIS vs. LAP, but length of stay was decreased for those who underwent minimally invasive procedures (3 vs. 4 days, p = 0.016). Time to initiation of chemotherapy following surgery was not significantly different between groups (26.2 days vs 32.0 days, p = 0.090). With median follow-up of 15.1 months, there was no difference in recurrence free survival (median 15.0 vs 17.2 months log-rank, p = 0.30) for MIS vs. LAP. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective cohort study, we demonstrate that in women with advanced EOC, HIPEC with MIS at the time of IDS following NACT is feasible. Our institutional experience demonstrates similar rates of R0 cytoreduction, compared to LAP. An MIS approach should not prevent surgeons from utilizing HIPEC where indicated for management of advanced EOC.","Morton, Molly; Chambers, Laura M.; Costales, Anthony B.; Chichura, Anna; Gruner, Morgan; Horowitz, Max P.; Rose, Peter G.; Yao, Meng; Debernardo, Robert; Michener, Chad",Gynecol Oncol,29,16

We identified 85 cases from 22 studies. The frequency of CAPA is currently unknown but ranges between <5% to >30% in different case series; the possibility of colonization rather than invasive disease is the most important confounder. The vast majority of patients with CAPA did not have any of the classic host risk factors, such as immunosuppression from organ transplant or neutropenia, although a significant proportion (46%) had received corticosteroids. Age, pulmonary comorbidities and male sex were associated with higher mortality. Patients treated with voriconazole had numerically lower case-fatality rate. Clinical vigilance for CAPA is advisable in critically ill patients with COVID-19 who are not improving, even those who do not meet classic host criteria for invasive mycoses, especially if they are receiving corticosteroids. A thorough, multi-faceted diagnostic work-up and early initiation of a mold-active triazole may be lifesaving. Further research studies using standardized, uniform definitions of invasive disease and colonization are urgently needed.","Apostolopoulou, Anna; Esquer Garrigos, Zerelda; Vijayvargiya, Prakhar; Lerner, Alexis Hope; Farmakiotis, Dimitrios",Diagnostics (Basel),29,16

Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M(pro)) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. Despite the weaker enzymatic inhibition of calpain inhibitors II and XII against M(pro) compared to GC-376, calpain inhibitors II and XII had more potent cellular antiviral activity. This observation promoted us to hypothesize that the cellular antiviral activity of calpain inhibitors II and XII might also involve the inhibition of cathepsin L in addition to M(pro). To test this hypothesis, we tested calpain inhibitors II and XII in the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay in Vero E6 cells and found that both compounds significantly decreased pseudoviral particle entry into cells, indicating their role in inhibiting cathepsin L. The involvement of cathepsin L was further confirmed in the drug time-of-addition experiment. In addition, we found that these four compounds not only inhibit SARS-CoV-2, but also SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral M(pro), which was supported by the thermal shift binding assay and enzymatic FRET assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir. Altogether, these results suggest that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 are not only promising antiviral drug candidates against existing human coronaviruses, but also might work against future emerging CoVs.","Hu, Yanmei; Ma, Chunlong; Szeto, Tommy; Hurst, Brett; Tarbet, Bart; Wang, Jun",bioRxiv,29,7

Under a mixed-methods approach, qualitative data (caller, call purpose, and call outcome) were categorized with categories arising de novo. Resulting variables were numerically analyzed to identify trends by categories and time. RESULTS: Of the 3468 calls retrieved, 160 duplicates and 26 irrelevant calls were excluded. Of 3282 included calls, general practitioners, followed by the public, contributed the greatest call volumes. Health-care–related callers and the public made 84.2% of calls.

However, the strain diversity of species and its association with LC have received little attention. Here, we constructed a computational framework to study the strain heterogeneity in the gut microbiome of patients with LC. Only Faecalibacterium prausnitzii shows different single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) patterns between the LC and healthy control (HC) groups. Strain diversity analysis discovered that although most F. prausnitzii genomes are more deficient in the LC group than in the HC group at the strain level, a subgroup of 19 F. prausnitzii strains showed no sensitivity to LC, which is inconsistent with the species-level result. The functional differences between this subgroup and other strains may involve short-chain fatty acid production and chlorine-related pathways. These findings demonstrate functional differences among F. prausnitzii subgroups, which extend current knowledge about strain heterogeneity and relationships between F. prausnitzii and LC at the strain level. IMPORTANCE Most metagenomic studies focus on microbes at the species level, thus ignoring the different effects of different strains of the same species on the host. In this study, we explored the different microbes at the strain level in the intestines of patients with liver cirrhosis and of healthy people. Previous studies have shown that the species Faecalibacterium prausnitzii has a lower abundance in patients with liver cirrhosis than in healthy people. However, our results found multiple F. prausnitzii strains that do not decrease in abundance in patients with liver cirrhosis. It is more sensitive to select the appropriate strains as indicators to distinguish between the disease and the control samples than to use the entire species as an indicator. We clustered multiple F. prausnitzii strains and discuss the functional differences of different clusters. Our findings suggest that more attention should be paid to metagenomic studies at the strain level.","Chen, Yaowen; Liu, Pu; Liu, Runyan; Hu, Shuofeng; He, Zhen; Dong, Guohua; Feng, Chao; An, Sijing; Ying, Xiaomin",mSystems,29,16

The present study was to explore the association of prognostic nutritional index (PNI) with the severity of COVID-19 and its predictive value of the severe form of COVID-19. Methods: The clinical data were collected from 122 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in the Sixth People's hospital of Wenzhou, which is the specialized infectious hospital affiliated to Wenzhou Central Hospital. PNI = serum albumin (g/L) + 5 × total lymphocyte count (/nL). Results: The study population consisted of 105 patients with common form (86.1%) and 17 patients with severe form (13.9%) of COVID-19. PNI was significantly declined from patients with common to severe form of COVID-19 (P = 0.029) regardless of gender, age range, and body mass index (BMI)-category. After adjustment of gender, age, indexes of liver and renal function, C-reactive protein, and current smoking, PNI remained to be independently and inversely associated with the severity of COVID-19 (odd ratio = 0.797, P = 0.030).

Early diagnosis is essential to reducing the transmission rate and mortality of COVID-19. PCR-based tests are the gold standard for the confirmation of COVID-19, but immunological tests for SARS-CoV-2 detection are widely available and play an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of COVID-19. Nanomechanical sensors are biosensors that work based on a change in the mechanical response of the system when a foreign object is added. In this paper, a graphene-based nanoresonator sensor for SARS-CoV-2 detection was introduced and analyzed by using the finite element method (FEM). The sensor was simulated by coating a single-layer graphene sheet (SLGS) with a specific antibody against SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 antigen. In the following, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses were randomly distributed on the SLGSs, and essential design parameters of the nanoresonator, including frequency shift and relative frequency shift, were evaluated. The effect of the SLGS size, aspect ratio and boundary conditions, antibody concentration, and the number of viruses variation on the frequency shift and relative frequency shift were investigated. The results revealed that, by proper selection of the nanoresonator design variables, a good sensitivity index is achievable for identifying the SARS-CoV-2 virus even when the number of the viruses are less than 10 per test. Eventually, according to the simulation results, by using SLGS geometry determination, an analytical relationship is presented to predict the limit of detection (LOD) of the sensor with the required sensitivity index. The results can be applied in designing and fabricating specific graphene-based nanoresonator sensors for SARS-CoV-2.","Payandehpeyman, Javad; Parvini, Neda; Moradi, Kambiz; Hashemian, Nima",ACS Appl Nano Mater,29,1

Telemedicine moved from the periphery of our healthcare system to center stage more rapidly than anyone could have envisioned. In order to swiftly deliver virtual care during the pandemic, we have replicated our episodic care paradigm that has been used for decades. However, we can and should do more with the connectedness and convenience that telemedicine technology makes possible. An option for a more patient-centered telemedicine experience is Continuous Remote Care (CRC). This approach includes data-driven, proactive outreach to patients, which in contrast to today's episodic, reactive, patient-initiated care, represents a decisive step forward. CRC is ideally implemented in chronic diseases such as diabetes, where patients need assistance with medication dosing, acute care issues, and lifestyle changes multiple times per day. In these cases, patient-driven episodic care falls short of day-to-day patient needs. Our CRC was created with multifaceted, holistic patient support, ranging from medication adjustments to transformational lifestyle changes. Physicians are alerted by algorithmic prioritization to situations that may be a safety concern or where medications need to be adjusted based on incoming biomarkers, allowing proactive outreach to patients. Health coaches operate in pods so that many specialties (nursing, behavioral health, dietician, exercise physiologist) allow for specialized and personalized care for each individual using the same prioritization system as physicians to guide lifestyle interventions. Barriers to widespread use include appropriate CPT codes for proactive outreach and lack of universal connectivity, especially in vulnerable patient populations. A Continuous Remote Care paradigm, beyond merely providing the greater convenience and lower cost of episodic telemedicine, brings the opportunity for improved patient care and outcomes.","Hallberg, Sarah; Harrison, David",JMIR diabetes,29,16

A viral quasispecies is a group of abundant and diversified genetically related viruses found in a single carrier. Current mainstream assembly methods, such as Velvet and SOAPdenovo, were not originally intended for the assembly of such metagenomics data, and therefore demands for new methods to provide accurate and informative assembly results for metagenomic data. RESULTS: In this study, we present a hybrid method for assembling highly polymorphic data combining the partial de novo-reference assembly (PDR) strategy and the BLAST-based assembly pipeline (BBAP). The PDR strategy generates in situ reference sequences through de novo assembly of a randomly extracted partial data set which is subsequently used for the reference assembly for the full data set. BBAP employs a greedy algorithm to assemble polymorphic reads. We used 12 hepatitis B virus quasispecies NGS data sets from a previous study to assess and compare the performance of both PDR and BBAP. Analyses suggest the high polymorphism of a full metagenomic data set leads to fragmentized de novo assembly results, whereas the biased or limited representation of external reference sequences included fewer reads into the assembly with lower assembly accuracy and variation sensitivity. In comparison, the PDR generated in situ reference sequence incorporated more reads into the final PDR assembly of the full metagenomics data set along with greater accuracy and higher variation sensitivity. BBAP assembly results also suggest higher assembly efficiency and accuracy compared to other assembly methods. Additionally, BBAP assembly recovered HBV structural variants that were not observed amongst assembly results of other methods. Together, PDR/BBAP assembly results were significantly better than other compared methods. CONCLUSIONS: Both PDR and BBAP independently increased the assembly efficiency and accuracy of highly polymorphic data, and assembly performances were further improved when used together. BBAP also provides nucleotide frequency information. Together, PDR and BBAP provide powerful tools for metagenomic data studies.

Intracellular compartmentalization—governed by biomembranes as well—is a characteristic feature of eukaryotic cells, which allows them to fulfill multiple and highly specialized anabolic and catabolic functions in strictly controlled environments. Although cellular membranes are generally visualized as flat sheets or closely folded isolated objects, multiple observations also demonstrate that membranes may fold into “unusual”, highly organized structures with 2D or 3D periodicity. The obvious correlation of highly convoluted membrane organizations with pathological cellular states, for example, as a consequence of viral infection, deserves close consideration. However, knowledge about formation and function of these highly organized 3D periodic membrane structures is scarce, primarily due to the lack of appropriate techniques for their analysis in vivo. Currently, the only direct way to characterize cellular membrane architecture is by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). However, deciphering the spatial architecture solely based on two-dimensionally projected TEM images is a challenging task and prone to artifacts. In this review, we will provide an update on the current progress in identifying and analyzing 3D membrane architectures in biological systems, with a special focus on membranes with cubic symmetry, and their potential role in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Proteomics and lipidomics approaches in defined experimental cell systems may prove instrumental to understand formation and function of 3D membrane morphologies.","Almsherqi, Zakaria A.; Landh, Tomas; Kohlwein, Sepp D.; Deng, Yuru",Int Rev Cell Mol Biol,29,30

METHODS: This longitudinal, internet-based survey included 2,141 people (50.8% men; 20-79 years). The baseline and follow-up surveys were conducted from February 25-27, 2020 and April 1-6, 2020, respectively. Participants were asked how often they implemented the 5 personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation) in the baseline and follow-up surveys. RESULTS: The prevalence of 3 of the 5 personal protective measures significantly improved in the community transmission phase compared to the early phase. Social distancing measures showed significant improvement, from 67.4% to 82.2%. However, the prevalence of avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, which had the lowest prevalence in the early phase, showed no significant improvement (approximately 60%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed, men and persons of low-income households made fewer improvements than women and persons of high-income households. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens is improving, however there is potential for improvement, especially in regard to avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth.","Machida, Masaki; Nakamura, Itaru; Saito, Reiko; Nakaya, Tomoki; Hanibuchi, Tomoya; Takamiya, Tomoko; Odagiri, Yuko; Fukushima, Noritoshi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Amagasa, Shiho; Kojima, Takako; Watanabe, Hidehiro; Inoue, Shigeru",Int J Infect Dis,29,1

COVID-19 is a systemic infection affecting several systems including the haematopoietic system. Surveys illustrating the laboratory findings of these patients conclude that lymphocytopenia, neutrophilia and thrombocytopenia are prominent amongst them. Moreover, it has been reported a significant decrease in T lymphocyte subsets and an increase of inflammatory cytokines of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Generally, thrombocytopenia is commonplace in critically ill patients and usually suggests serious organ malfunction. In view of this, this review investigates the correlation between these abnormalities and the prognosis and disease course. Full blood count is an easy, economic and widely available tool which may help to discriminate between patients with or without severe disease. Last but not least, this review examines potential pathophysiological mechanisms by the novel coronavirus which contribute to these haematological alterations aiding the clinicians to better understand this disease and provide more clinical treatment options.","Violetis, Odyssefs A.; Chasouraki, Angeliki M.; Giannou, Alexandra M.; Baraboutis, Ioannis G.",SN Compr Clin Med,29,16

A growing body of evidence suggests that the inhalation of both respiratory droplets (>5 µm) and tiny aerosols (<5 µm) is a possible route of virus transmission. Recently, innovative barrier enclosures (aerosol boxes) have been designed to cover patients’ heads while allowing the implementation of airway management procedures through fitted holes. The initial design has undergone a series of modifications to improve staff safety, operators’ ergonomics, and the efficacy of airway procedures. METHODS: We reviewed the literature concerning different box modifications and provided an insight into our experience of using the box. Aerosol boxes have garnered the attention of clinicians who are frequently exposed to aerosols while performing aerosol-generating medical procedures, particularly endotracheal intubation. Current evidence comes from simulation-based studies rather than real-life clinical investigations. RESULTS: The reports indicated that the box has significantly reduced the diffusion of aerosols into the room; however, the operators have experienced difficulties in the maneuverability of airway devices. CONCLUSION: Aerosol boxes should be used for patients necessitating simple elective intubations after healthcare providers are adequately trained. Customized designs can be further made based on clinicians’ experiences.","AAl Ibrahim, Ahmad M; Kentab, Osama; Aljahany, Muna; Aljohani, Khalid",Open Access Emerg Med,29,20

Because the IFR is the number of deaths divided by the number of infected, serological studies are needed to identify asymptomatic and mild cases. Also, because ascertainment of deaths attributable to COVID-19 is often incomplete, the calculation of the IFR needs to be complemented with data on excess mortality. We used data from a nation-wide seroepidemiological study and two sources of mortality information -deaths among laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and excess deaths- to estimate the range of IFR, both overall and by age and sex, in Spain. The overall IFR ranged between 1.1% and 1.4% in men and 0.58% to 0.77% in women. The IFR increased sharply after age 50, ranging between 11.6% and 16.4% in men [≥]80 years and between 4.6% and 6.5% in women [≥]80 years.

Multiple repurposed drugs have already been in several clinical trials or recently completed. However, none of them shows any promising effect in combating COVID-19. Therefore, developing an effective drug is an unmet global need. RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) plays a pivotal role in viral replication. Therefore, it is considered as a prime target of drugs that may treat COVID-19. In this study, we have screened a library of compounds, containing approved RdRp inhibitor drugs that were or in use to treat other viruses (favipiravir, sofosbuvir, ribavirin, lopinavir, tenofovir, ritonavir, galidesivir and remdesivir) and their structural analogues, in order to identify potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Extensive screening, molecular docking and molecular dynamics show that five structural analogues have notable inhibitory effects against RdRp of SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, comparative protein-antagonists interaction revealed that these compounds fit well in the pocket of RdRp. ADMET analysis of these compounds suggests their potency as drug candidates.

Does Leptin Play a Role?,9.628701,5.8088675,2021-03-20,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 infection, in the UK in early 2020, resulted in the introduction of several control policies to reduce disease spread. As part of these restrictions, schools were closed to all pupils in March (except for vulnerable and key worker children), before re-opening to certain year groups in June. Finally, all school children returned to the classroom in September. METHODS: Here, we analyse data on school absences in late 2020 as a result of COVID-19 infection and how that varied through time as other measures in the community were introduced. We utilise data from the Department for Education Educational Settings database and examine how pupil and teacher absences change in both primary and secondary schools. RESULTS: Our results show that absences as a result of COVID-19 infection rose steadily following the re-opening of schools in September. Cases in teachers declined during the November lockdown, particularly in regions previously in tier 3, the highest level of control at the time. Cases in secondary school pupils increased for the first 2 weeks of the November lockdown, before decreasing. Since the introduction of the tier system, the number of absences with confirmed infection in primary schools was observed to be (markedly) lower than that in secondary schools. In December, we observed a large rise in the number of absences per school in secondary school settings in the South East and London, but such rises were not observed in other regions or in primary school settings. We conjecture that the increased transmissibility of the new variant in these regions may have contributed to this rise in secondary school cases. Finally, we observe a positive correlation between cases in the community and cases in schools in most regions, with weak evidence suggesting that cases in schools lag behind cases in the surrounding community. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that there is no significant evidence to suggest that schools are playing a substantial role in driving spread in the community and that careful monitoring may be required as schools re-open to determine the effect associated with open schools upon community incidence.","Southall, Emma; Holmes, Alex; Hill, Edward M.; Atkins, Benjamin D.; Leng, Trystan; Thompson, Robin N.; Dyson, Louise; Keeling, Matt J.; Tildesley, Michael J.",BMC Med,29,20

It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. METHODS: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. LIMITATIONS: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers.

No studies in children have tested for an extended panel of upper airway respiratory viruses and bacteria to identify whether they predict cough outcomes, irrespective of clinical diagnosis at the time of acute respiratory illness (ARI). We therefore determined whether upper airway microbes independently predicted hospitalization and persistent cough 28‐days later in children presenting with an ARI, including cough as a symptom. Methods: A cohort study of children aged <15‐years were followed for 28‐days after presenting to a pediatric emergency department with an ARI where cough was also a symptom. Socio‐demographic factors, presenting clinical features and a bilateral anterior nasal swab were collected at enrolment. Polymerase chain reaction assays tested for seven respiratory bacteria and 17 viruses. Predictors of hospitalization and persistent cough at day‐28 were evaluated in logistic regression models. Results: Eight hundred and seventeen children were included in the analysis; median age 27.7‐months. 116 (14.2%, 95%CI 11.8, 16.6) children were hospitalized and 163 (20.0%, 95%CI 17.2, 22.7) had persistent cough at day‐28. Hospitalized children were more likely to have RSV A or B detected on nasal swab than those not admitted (adjusted relative risk (aRR) 1.8, 95%CI 1.0, 3.3). M. catarrhalis was the only microbial difference between children with and without cough persistence (aRR for those with cough at day 28: 2.1, 95%CI 1.3, 3.1). Discussion: An etiologic role for M. catarrhalis in the pathogenesis of persistent cough post‐ARI is worth exploring, especially given the burden of chronic cough in children and its relationship with chronic lung disease.

In this format, learners are allowed to use revision notes, textbooks and other permitted material during their examination. Traditionally, dentistry is assessed using closed-book examinations where the use of such materials is prohibited. Learners will have limited or no prior experience of open-book examinations in dentistry, hence this educational evaluation aimed to explore their experiences and assess suitability for continuity of this examination. Methods A retrospective anonymous survey was conducted on all undergraduate dentistry and oral health sciences learners on completion of their examination and once they received their results. The questionnaire was designed to contain both qualitative and quantitative data items, validated through previous published studies. All authors independently analysed the data through tallying quantitative parameters and thematically analysing qualitative free text. Results In total, 210 learners participated in the survey, with 52.4% strongly agreeing a preference for open-book examinations. In addition, 42.9% of learners either agreed or strongly agreed that less preparation was required for open-book examinations; however, 80.5% reported learning new information. Furthermore, 85.2% disagreed or strongly disagreed that open-book examinations were stressful. Thematic analysis highlighted four core themes: stress, memorisation of facts, motivation to learn and unfairness. Conclusions There were several learning points for both educators and learners that can be actioned for future open-book examinations, including tailoring exam questions to foster application of knowledge rather than resource-searching skills, intended learning objective mapping against curriculum requirements and learner preparation.

Although several cases of cats and dogs infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 have been reported during this outbreak, the prevalence of SARS‐CoV‐2 in dog and its transmission among other companion animals are still unknown. Here, we report an extensive serological study of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in dogs in Wuhan and analyze the infection rates at different stages of the pandemic outbreak. A total of 946 dogs serum samples were collected from Wuhan, of which 36 samples were obtained prior to the pandemic outbreak. Indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) showed that 16 sera collected during the outbreak were detected as positive through the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS‐CoV‐2. Of these 16 sera, 10 exhibited measurable SARS‐CoV‐2 specific neutralizing antibodies whose titers ranged from 1/20 to 1/180. No serological cross‐reactivity was detected between SARS‐CoV‐2 and canine coronavirus (CCV). Furthermore, with the effective control of the outbreak, a decrease in the SARS‐CoV‐2 seropositive dog number was observed. Our results suggest that SARS‐CoV‐2 has infected companion dogs during the outbreak, and that COVID‐19 patient families have a higher risk of dog infection.

The project investigated the migraine illness experience through Narrative Medicine (NM) to understand daily life, needs and personal resources of migraneurs, their caregivers and clinicians, and to provide insights for clinical practice. METHODS: The project involved 13 Italian headache centres and targeted migraneurs, their caregivers and migraine specialists at these centres. Written narratives, composed by a sociodemographic survey and illness plot or parallel chart, were collected through the project’s webpage. Illness plots and parallel charts employed open words to encourage participants’ expression. Narratives were analysed through Nvivo software, interpretive coding and NM classifications. RESULTS: One hundred and seven narratives were collected from patients and 26 from caregivers, as well as 45 parallel charts from clinicians. The analysis revealed migraine perception in social, domestic and work life within the care pathway evolution and a bond between chaos narratives and day loss due to migraine; furthermore, narratives suggested the extent of the caregiving burden and a risk of underestimation of migraine burden in patients’ and caregivers’ life. CONCLUSION: The project represents the first investigation on migraine illness experience through NM simultaneously considering migraneurs’, caregivers’ and clinicians’ perspectives. Comparing narratives and parallel charts allowed to obtain suggestions for clinical practice, while NM emerged as able to foster the pursuing of migraine knowledge and awareness.

Serological studies, through providing evidence of past infection, can aid understanding of the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Objectives This systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in Europe was undertaken to inform public health strategies including vaccination, that aim to accelerate population immunity. Methods We searched the databases Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and grey literature sources for studies reporting seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Europe published between 01/12/2019 - 30/09/20. We provide a narrative synthesis of included studies. Studies were categorized into subgroups including healthcare workers (HCWs), community, outbreaks, pregnancy and children/school. Due to heterogeneity in other subgroups, we only performed a random effects meta-analysis of the seroprevalence amongst HCWs stratified by their country. Results 109 studies were included spanning 17 European countries, that estimated the seroprevalence of SAR-CoV2 from samples obtained between November 2019 – August 2020. A total of 53/109 studies included HCWs with a reported seroprevalence among HCWs ranging from 0.7% to 45.3%, which did not differ significantly by country. In community studies significant heterogeneity was reported in the seroprevalence among different age groups and the majority of studies reported there was no significant difference by gender. Conclusion This review demonstrates a wide heterogeneity in reported seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between populations. Continued evaluation of seroprevalence is required to understand the impact of public health measures and inform interventions including vaccination programmes.","Vaselli, Natasha Marcella; Hungerford, Daniel; Shenton, Ben; Khashkhusha, Arwa; Cunliffe, Nigel A.; French, Neil",bioRxiv,29,16

OBJECTIVES: Our study investigated the relationship between time spent during the first ANC contact and eight or more ANC contacts, and between home visits and eight or more ANC contacts. We also assessed the prevalence of eight or more ANC contacts. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 519 mothers with children 12 months old and below attending child welfare clinics in the Nabdam district in the Upper East Region, Ghana. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between time spent during the first ANC contact, home visits, and eight or more ANC contacts, while controlling for potential confounders. RESULTS: The proportion of mothers who attained eight or more ANC contacts during pregnancy was 31.2%. Spending 20 minutes or more during the first ANC contact was associated with 2.07 times the odds of having eight or more ANC contacts compared to spending less than 20 minutes [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 2.07, 95% CI: 1.18,3.63]. Mothers who received at least a home visit from skilled health professionals during pregnancy were 2.44 times more likely to have eight or more ANC contacts compared to mothers who were not visited (aOR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.51,3.94). CONCLUSION: Spending at least 20 minutes during the first ANC contact and home visits were positively associated with eight or more ANC contacts. We recommend that skilled health professionals should spend at least 20 minutes during the first ANC contact as well as encourage home visits in order to increase the coverage of eight or more ANC contacts.","Kumbeni, Maxwell Tii; Apanga, Paschal Awingura; Yeboah, Eugene Osei; Kolog, Jonas Timbire; Awuni, Baba",Global health action,29,20

A critical weakness has resulted from the excessive centralization of the current biomanufacturing capacities, a matter of great concern, if not a source of nationalistic tensions. On the positive side, scientific data and information have been shared at an unprecedented speed fuelled by the preprint phenomena, and this has considerably strengthened our ability to develop new technology-based solutions. In this work we explore how, in a context of rapid exchange of scientific information, plant biofactories can serve as a rapid and easily adaptable solution for local manufacturing of bioreagents, more specifically recombinant antibodies. For this purpose, we tested our ability to produce, in the framework of an academic lab and in a matter of weeks, milligram amounts of six different recombinant monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in Nicotiana benthamiana. For the design of the antibodies we took advantage, among other data sources, of the DNA sequence information made rapidly available by other groups in preprint publications. mAbs were all engineered as single-chain fragments fused to a human gamma Fc and transiently expressed using a viral vector. In parallel, we also produced the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 N protein and its Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in planta and used them to test the binding specificity of the recombinant mAbs. Finally, for two of the antibodies we assayed a simple scale-up production protocol based on the extraction of apoplastic fluid. Our results indicate that gram amounts of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be easily produced in little more than 6 weeks in repurposed greenhouses with little infrastructure requirements using N. benthamiana as production platform. Similar procedures could be easily deployed to produce diagnostic reagents and, eventually, could be adapted for rapid therapeutic responses.","Diego-Martin, Borja; González, Beatriz; Vazquez-Vilar, Marta; Selma, Sara; Mateos-Fernández, Rubén; Gianoglio, Silvia; Fernández-del-Carmen, Asun; Orzáez, Diego",bioRxiv,29,16

The case fatality rate of a new infectious disease can vary by different risk factors and over time. We analysed the trends and associated factors of COVID-19 case fatality rates in Brazilian public hospital admissions during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of all COVID-19-related admissions between epidemiological weeks 10–40 in the Brazilian Public Health System (SUS) was delimited from available reimbursement records. Smoothing time series and survival analyses were conducted to evaluate the trends of hospital case fatality rates (CFR) and the probability of death according to factors such as sex, age, ethnicity, comorbidities, length of stay and ICU use. RESULTS: With 398,063 admissions and 86,452 (21.7%) deaths, the overall age-standardized hospital CFR trend decreased throughout the period, varying from 31.8% (95%CI: 31.2 to 32.5%) in week 10 to 18.2% (95%CI: 17.6 to 18.8%) in week 40. This decreasing trend was observed in all sex, age, ethnic groups, length of stay and ICU admissions. Consistently, later admission (from July to September) was an independent protective factor. Patients 80+ year old had a hazard ratio of 8.18 (95% CI: 7.51 to 8.91). Ethnicity, comorbidities, and ICU need were also associated with the death risk. Although also decreasing, the CFR was always around 40–50% in people who needed an ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: The overall hospital CFR of COVID-19 has decreased in Brazilian public hospitals during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020. Nevertheless, during the entire period, the CFR was still very high, suggesting the need for improving COVID-19 hospital care in Brazil.","Zimmermann, Ivan Ricardo; Sanchez, Mauro Niskier; Frio, Gustavo Saraiva; Alves, Layana Costa; Pereira, Claudia Cristina de Aguiar; Lima, Rodrigo Tobias de Sousa; Machado, Carla; Santos, Leonor Maria Pacheco; da Silva, Everton Nunes",PLoS One,29,20

There is only a small amount of research conducted with regard to the consequences of the Pandemic in Fiji. Thus, in order to gather a longitudinal dataset, a cross-sectional survey was conducted from February to August 2020. 300 physical education and sports teachers used Google Forms to complete an online survey. There are questions on the form about age, gender, marital status, and other daily activities. A similar survey was conducted to study the long-term psychological effects (coronavirus fear and fascination with COVID-19). The characteristics of society have been explored. Efforts have been made to use different sets of psychological data, showing the anticipated results. Sex, age, marital status, and family type are significantly affected by stress, anxiety, sexual satisfaction, and social support. There is a substantial difference between marital status, gender, and social support when it comes to the Pandemic. According to research findings, fifty per cent of secondary school physical education and sports teachers in Fiji may have been affected by the Pandemic. Considerations should be taken to keep teachers calm during a pandemic.

Provincial Geriatrics Leadership Ontario, in collaboration with interRAI and the International Federation on Aging, hosted a virtual Town Hall on September 25 2020. The purpose of this event was to bring together international perspectives from researchers, clinicians, and policy experts to address important themes potentially amenable to timely policy interventions. This manuscript summarizes these themes and the ensuing discussions among 130 attendees from 5 continents. The disproportionate impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on frail residents of LTC homes reflects a systematic lack of equitable prioritization by health system decision-makers around the world. The primary risk factors for an outbreak in a LTC home were outbreaks in the surrounding community, high staff and visitor traffic in large facilities, and crowding of residents in ageing buildings. Infection control measures must be prioritized in LTC homes, though care must be taken to protect frail and vulnerable residents from their overly blunt application that deprives residents from appropriate physical and psychosocial support. Staffing, in terms of overall numbers, training, and leadership skills, was inadequate. The built environment of LTC homes can be configured for both optimal resident well-being and infection control. Infection control and resident wellness need not be mutually exclusive. Improving outcomes for LTC residents requires more staffing with proper training and interprofessional leadership. All these initiatives must be underpinned by an effective quality assurance system based on standardized, comprehensive, accessible, and clinically relevant data, and which can support broad communities of practice capable of effecting real and meaningful change for frail older persons, wherever they chose to reside.","Heckman, George A.; Kay, Kelly; Morrison, Adam; Grabowski, David; Hirdes, J.; Mor, Vine; Shaw, Greg; Benjamin, Sophiya; Boscart, Veronique M.; Costa, Andrew P.; Declercq, Anja; Geffen, Leon; Sang Lum, Terry Yat; Moser, Andrea; Onder, Graziano; van Hout, Hein",J Am Med Dir Assoc,29,1

However, during vaccination campaigns, some vaccine recipients, including those partially and fully vaccinated, will experience severe COVID-19, requiring hospitalization. This may particularly concern patients with a diminished immune response to the vaccine, as well as non-responders. This work has retrospectively analyzed the 92 cases of patients who were hospitalized between 27 December 2020 and 31 May 2021 in four Polish healthcare units due to COVID-19, and who have previously received the COVID-19 vaccine (54.3% ≤ 14 days after the first dose, 26.1% > 14 days after the first dose, 7.6% ≤ 14 days after the second dose, and 12% > 14 days after the second dose). These patients represented a minute fraction (1.2%) of all the COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized during the same period in the same healthcare institutions. No significant differences in white blood count, absolute lymphocyte count nadir, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, oxygen saturation, lung involvement, and fever frequency were found between the recipients of the first and second vaccine dose. A total of 15 deaths were noted (1.1% of all fatal COVID-19 cases in the considered period and healthcare units), including six in patients who received the second dose (five > 14 days after the second dose)—three of these subjects were using immunosuppressive medicines, and two were confirmed to be vaccine non-responders. The study reassures that severe COVID-19 and deaths are not common in vaccinated individuals, highlights that the clinical course in such patients may not reveal any distinctive features, and advocates for close monitoring of those at a higher risk of vaccine failure.","Rzymski, Piotr; Pazgan-Simon, Monika; Simon, Krzysztof; Łapiński, Tadeusz; Zarębska-Michaluk, Dorota; Szczepańska, Barbara; Chojnicki, Michał; Mozer-Lisewska, Iwona; Flisiak, Robert",Vaccines (Basel),29,6

A very novel idea of “sustainable chemical science facility”, encompassing a teaching module capable of imparting strong fundamental Chemistry concepts, a virtual environment for undergoing the basic industrial training and a production unit with modular reactors for resource funding is proposed here. Often research is restricted to academic qualification, and a substantial band gap exists between the microscopic realm of academic research and the macroscopic domain of industrial chemistry, which thrives on research application. This band gap can be overcome by arming young chemists with training, tools and experience to possess complete control (synthetic and functional) on the materials they produce. The conceptual facility if turned into reality will definitely be the right step towards achieving materials with sustainable functionalities. We will have learning, training and production under one roof. Students will receive theoretical, practical and real-life experience of the production in industries, making them efficiently employable at a very young age. The idea is to bridge some critical engineering concepts with core chemistry, but with a clear distinction between chemical reactor engineering and core chemistry. This paper is a brainchild of the author and is more of a policy paper, needed to be elaborately discussed in academic and industrial forums.","Ganarajan, Sivasubramanian; Ashok, Kamakshi",Environ Dev Sustain,29,1

Individuals with mental disorders may have a higher risk of infection and worse clinical outcomes because of a variety of factors such as poorer general resilience and lower immune function. However, there have been no studies to date specifically investigating the risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality in these patients. This was addressed in the present study by analyzing the data of 473,958 subjects included in the UK Biobank, 14,877 of whom tested positive for COVID-19 infection. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations between mental disorders and risks of COVID-19 infection and associated mortality. The results showed that subjects who were diagnosed with a mental disorder had a significantly higher risk of developing COVID-19 and a worse outcome as evidenced by higher rates of COVID-19-related mortality, with the strongest effects observed for dementia. Among dementia subtypes, Alzheimer disease patients had the highest risks of COVID-19 infection (7.39-fold increase) and associated mortality (2.13-fold increase). Late-life anxiety only increased the risk of developing COVID-19 while late-life depression not only was associated with a higher risk of infection but also a worse outcome. These findings highlight the need to prioritize patients with mental disorders-especially those who experience these disorders later in life—when implementing preventive strategies such as vaccinations.","Wang, Yongjun; Yang, Yang; Ren, Lina; Shao, Yuan; Tao, Weiqun; Dai, Xi-jian",Front Public Health,29,1

RESULTS The high age-related risk group perceived the coronavirus as more severe, their belongingness to a risk group as higher, and the behavioral recommendations as more effective compared to the low age-related risk group. The part of perceived vulnerability that is not explained by belonging to an age-related risk group (defined as residual perceived vulnerability) was lower in the high age-related risk group. Mediation analysis indicated that the high (compared to the low) age-related risk group had lower anxiety levels, and that this effect was mediated by lower residual perceived vulnerability and higher perceived disease severity levels.

Prior research suggests that demographic factors, such as gender and age, are associated with greater distress during a global health crisis. Less is known about how emotion regulation impacts levels of distress during a pandemic. The present study aimed to identify predictors of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 2,787) provided demographics, history of adverse childhood experiences, current coping strategies (use of implicit and explicit emotion regulation), and current psychological distress. The overall prevalence of clinical levels of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress was higher than the prevalence outside a pandemic and was higher than rates reported among healthcare workers and survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Younger participants (<45 years), women, and non-binary individuals reported higher prevalence of symptoms across all measures of distress. A random forest machine learning algorithm was used to identify the strongest predictors of distress. Regression trees were developed to identify individuals at greater risk for anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress. Somatization and less reliance on adaptive defense mechanisms were associated with greater distress. These findings highlight the importance of assessing individuals’ physical experiences of psychological distress and emotion regulation strategies to help mental health providers tailor assessments and treatment during a global health crisis.","Prout, Tracy A.; Zilcha-Mano, Sigal; Aafjes-van Doorn, Katie; Békés, Vera; Christman-Cohen, Isabelle; Whistler, Kathryn; Kui, Thomas; Di Giuseppe, Mariagrazia",Front Psychol,29,20

It also aims at identifying the messages and sources that were most effective in managing communication correctly in such a crucial phase that is likely characterized by a fall in perceived health risk (due to the flattening of the epidemic curve) and a simultaneous rise in perceived economic and social risks (due to the enduring calamity). Knowing what source will be most effective to convey a specific message is fundamental in enabling individuals to focus on and comply with the rules. At the same time, it is necessary to understand how the message should be presented, and the relationships between messages, sources and targets. To meet these goals, data were collected through a self-administered online questionnaire submitted to a sample of undergraduate students from a University in Lombardy–the region most affected by the pandemic in the first wave- (Study 1), and to a national sample composed of Italian citizens (Study 2). Through our first manipulation which explored the effectiveness of social norms in relation to different sources, we found that, in the national sample, the injunctive norm conveyed by the government was the most effective in promoting behavioral intentions. By contrast, among the students, results showed that for the critical group with a lower risk perception (less inclined to adopt prevention behavior) descriptive norms, which implicitly convey the risk perception of peers, were as effective as the government injunctive norm. Our second manipulation, identical in Study 1 and 2, compared four types of communication (emotional, exponential growth, both of them, or neutral). The neutral condition was the most memorable, but no condition was more effective than the others. Across all message types there was a high intention to adopt protective behaviors.

A national scheme supported purchase of spirometers enabling pwCF to do home spirometry to support virtual clinics. PwCFattending the York Hull adult CF centre (YHACFC) were provided with NuvoAir spirometers. Objectives: To evaluate how the change from clinic to home spirometry impacted on the experiences of pwCF & clinicians, focusing on anxiety levels & use of time. Methods: Online questionnaires were sent to pwCF & clinicians at YHACFC. Mock scenarios established potential differences in time taken for home spirometry (HS) & clinic spirometry (CS). Results: 28/70 pwCF & 8/15 clinicians responded. PwCF & clinicians were confident that pwCF could use HS. Frequently used words for both groups were “quick,” “convenient” & “easy” when describing HS. When describing CS, “expertise” & “helpful” featured for pwCF and “time”, “stressful” & “accurate” for clinicians. PwCF reported the main benefit of CS was regular contact with clinicians. 62.5% of clinicians agreed that the change to HS gave better time efficiency & 87.5% agreed clinic flow was more efficient with HS. Timed scenarios indicated 7½ minutes per test saved with HS. Most clinicians believed pwCF are anxious with spirometry, 50% linking anxiety to the clinic setting. Most pwCF reported never being anxious about HS or CS. Only 4% reported anxiety with CS;however, when describing CS, the words “anxious” & “worry” were used frequently. The preference for 82% of pwCF for future care was access to a combination of spirometry in the home & clinic. Conclusion: • Home spirometry saved time for pwCF & clinicians. • Virtual technology has an important & developing role in the care of pwCF but relationships remain valued. • Style of questioning affects response from pwCF about spirometry anxiety. • Disparity between pwCF reported anxiety & clinicians’ perceptions of anxiety needs further investigation.","Daniels, T.; Budden, B.; Metcalfe, J.; France, K.; Hasney, K.; Lee, K.; Robson, N.; Thomas, R.",Journal of Cystic Fibrosis,29,20

Professional phagocytes (e.g., macrophages) and ECs have co-evolved in vertebrates to adapt to increased physiological demands. Intercellular interactions between components of the hemovascular system facilitate numerous functions in physiology and disease in part through the utilization of shared signaling pathways and factors. Krüppel-like factors (KLFs) 2 and 4 are two such transcription factors with critical roles in both cellular compartments. Decreased expression of either factor in myeloid or endothelial cells increases susceptibility to a multitude of inflammatory diseases, underscoring the essential role for their expression in maintaining cellular quiescence. Given the close evolutionary relationship between macrophages and ECs, along with their shared utilization of KLF2 and 4, we hypothesize that KLF genes evolved in such a way that protected their expression in myeloid and endothelial cells. Within this Perspective, we review the roles of KLF2 and 4 in the hemovascular system and explore evolutionary trends in their nucleotide composition that suggest a coordinated protection that corresponds with the development of mature myeloid and endothelial systems.","Sweet, David R.; Lam, Cherry; Jain, Mukesh K.",Front Cardiovasc Med,29,1

There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination. Enteric viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with AIDS are also discussed.","Schwab, Kenneth S.; Shaw, Robert D.",Baillière's Clinical Gastroenterology,29,10

Little attention has been paid to the influence of environmental factors. CASES: Retrospective analysis of consecutive PD patients seen in our outpatient Movement Disorders Clinic during 2 months (September–November 2020) to explore the frequency of ICD during the preceding 2‐month lockdown period, and comparison with an equivalent control group (September–November 2019). Among 114 patients assessed, 15 (13%) presented ICD during the lockdown, versus 6 (4.5%, P 0.02) in the control group. When analyzing only patients on DA, ICD occurrence increased to 31% (vs. 9.6% pre‐lockdown, P 0.026). ICD during lockdown required drug regime adjustment in 80% (vs. 16.7% pre‐lockdown, P 0.014). CONCLUSION: During COVID‐19 lockdown, the occurrence of ICD in PD patients taking DA was higher than expected, and with increased severity.

Lockdowns and restrictions to safeguard public health have exacerbated the pre-existing mental health crisis and rise of non-communicable diseases. Thus, the importance of nature as a health resource has been elevated, hastening calls for a better understanding of how health benefits might differ across user groups and nature provisions. In this regard, urban green spaces have become the greatest research focus; however, blue spaces, especially inland freshwater (e.g., wetlands), remain less studied. First-hand user experiences are also under-represented. This exploratory study examines the motivations and benefits of active wetland centre users in the UK, both during and after visits. Responses to three open-ended questions were collated online from 385 participants, and a qualitative content analysis was conducted based on an existing taxonomy from users of urban green spaces. The results showed strong motivations to visit due to the biodiversity at the site (mainly the birdlife), while less tangible nature (e.g., fresh air) and amenities were also important. In contrast to other studies on natural environments, physical activity was a less influential motivation. Salient derived effects included positive and intensely positive emotions, relaxation and mental restoration. After visits to wetland centres, feelings of vitality and satisfaction were the most prominent effects that emerged. For decision-makers looking to leverage inland blue spaces for public health benefit, our results highlight the broad range and relative prominence of the reasons for use and the associated perceived health benefits derived by users of UK wetland centres. They highlight how biodiversity, abiotic nature and good amenities are important qualities to consider when planning, managing and encouraging people to use natural environments for health benefit, qualities that may also provide important environmental co-benefits.","Reeves, Jonathan P.; John, Conor H.

However, economic factors limited the prescription of original biologicals in China. Yisaipu(®) is a biosimilar for etanercept as pre fill syringes (PFS), which has entered China’s national medical insurance catalog for more than 10 yr and was widely used because it greatly reduced the economic burden of AS patients. Yisaipu(®) is provided subcutaneous injection in hospital setting only. We collected clinical data of AS patients before, during and after COVID-19 epidemic, in an attempt to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of original biologicals and Yisaipu(®) during regular follow up and COVID-19 epidemic. Methods: AS patients who received original biologicals or Yisaipu(®) in our department for more than 1 yr were included in our study. General data, demographic characteristics, disease activity, quality of life and medical compliance were collected from regular visits. The patients were followed up through telephone interviews from April 20th to 27th, 2020 about the overall impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Results: There was no significant difference in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score-CRP (ASDAS-CRP) between the two groups. Health Assessment Questionnaire for Spondyloarthropathies (HAQ-s) showed that Yisaipu(®) group was superior to original biological group in terms of eating, gripping and driving. In addition, the medical cost of Yisaipu(®) was lower than that of original biologicals. The overall impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on patients of original biological group was comparatively smaller than that on Yisaipu(®) group. Conclusions: Yisaipu(®) provided AS patients with an economical selection during regular follow-up, while original biologicals had certain advantages in the COVID-19 epidemic setting, including a longer time interval between two drug administrations and the self-injection dose form of medication.","Lu, Hongjuan; Wang, Yuanqiong; Wang, Xiuwen; Wu, Xin; Zhou, Ling; Lin, Li; Sheng, Rong; Tian, Haoran; Li, Ting; Xu, Huji",Front Pharmacol,29,22

However, their accuracy at quantifying limb motion, and clinical acceptability, have not yet been demonstrated. To this end we conducted a two-stage study: First, we compared the inertial accuracy of wrist-worn IMUs, both research-grade (Xsens MTw Awinda, and Axivity AX3) and consumer-grade (Apple Watch Series 3 and 5), and optical motion tracking (OptiTrack). Given the moderate to strong performance of the consumer-grade sensors, we then evaluated this sensor and surveyed the experiences and attitudes of hospital patients (N = 44) and staff (N = 15) following a clinical test in which patients wore smartwatches for 1.5–24 h in the second study. Results indicate that for acceleration, Xsens is more accurate than the Apple Series 5 and 3 smartwatches and Axivity AX3 (RMSE 1.66 ± 0.12 m·s(−2); R(2) 0.78 ± 0.02; RMSE 2.29 ± 0.09 m·s(−2); R(2) 0.56 ± 0.01; RMSE 2.14 ± 0.09 m·s(−2); R(2) 0.49 ± 0.02; RMSE 4.12 ± 0.18 m·s(−2); R(2) 0.34 ± 0.01 respectively). For angular velocity, Series 5 and 3 smartwatches achieved similar performances against Xsens with RMSE 0.22 ± 0.02 rad·s(−1); R(2) 0.99 ± 0.00; and RMSE 0.18 ± 0.01 rad·s(−1); R(2) 1.00± SE 0.00, respectively. Surveys indicated that in-patients and healthcare professionals strongly agreed that wearable motion sensors are easy to use, comfortable, unobtrusive, suitable for long-term use, and do not cause anxiety or limit daily activities. Our results suggest that consumer smartwatches achieved moderate to strong levels of accuracy compared to laboratory gold-standard and are acceptable for pervasive monitoring of motion/behaviour within hospital settings.","Auepanwiriyakul, Chaiyawan; Waibel, Sigourney; Songa, Joanna; Bentley, Paul; Faisal, A.

PURPOSE: Gabapentin has increasingly been identified as a drug of abuse, especially when used concurrently with opioids. Rescheduling gabapentin as a schedule V controlled substance may strengthen monitoring and prescribing restrictions. The purpose of this study was to characterize the impact of rescheduling gabapentin from a nonscheduled to a schedule V substance in Virginia on discharge prescribing patterns in a health system. METHODS: This was a retrospective, pre-post, multicenter chart review conducted at 4 sites. Data from 3 months before gabapentin rescheduling (prerescheduling group) and 3 months after gabapentin rescheduling (postrescheduling group) were evaluated. The primary outcome was the percentage of newly prescribed gabapentin prescriptions upon discharge, which was compared between the pre- and postrescheduling groups. RESULTS: A similar percentage of gabapentin prescriptions were newly prescribed in the prerescheduling group as compared to the postrescheduling group (55.0% vs 50.0%, P = 0.479). Gabapentin prescribing characteristics did not differ between the groups for new gabapentin prescriptions (n = 55 in the prerescheduling group, n = 50 in the postrescheduling group). Concomitant discharge prescribing of benzodiazepines (5.5% vs 2.0%, P = 0.619) and opioids (45.5% vs 60.0%, P = 0.136) did not differ significantly between the postrescheduling group and prerescheduling group for new gabapentin prescriptions. However, fewer opioid prescriptions exceeded 90 daily morphine milligram equivalents (MME) in the postrescheduling group as compared to the prerescheduling group for new gabapentin prescriptions (36.0% vs 20.0%, P = 0.020). CONCLUSION: Gabapentin prescribing practices did not differ before and after rescheduling of gabapentin as a controlled substance. There was a trend toward dosages with reduced daily MME for concomitant opioid prescriptions after rescheduling. However, additional investigation with larger studies over longer periods of time is needed to discover whether gabapentin rescheduling significantly changes prescribing practices.","Robbins, Melody J; Floroff, Catherine; Ingemi, Amanda; Kaplan, Marcus C",Am J Health Syst Pharm,29,16

Entre ellos se cuenta el aumento en los casos de delirio. La enfermedad grave por SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, tiene vulnerabilidades comunes con el delirio y produce alteraciones en órganos como el pulmón o el cerebro, entre otros, que tienen potencial para precipitar el trastorno mental; de hecho, este puede ser la primera manifestación de la infección, antes de la fiebre, el malestar general, la tos o las alteraciones respiratorias. Está ampliamente sustentado que el delirium incrementa la morbilidad y la mortalidad de quienes lo padecen durante una hospitalización, por lo que se debe buscar activamente para realizar las intervenciones pertinentes. Ante la ausencia de evidencia sobre el abordaje del delirio en el contexto de la COVID-19, se elaboró este consenso sobre tres aspectos fundamentales: diagnóstico, tratamiento no farmacológico y tratamiento farmacológico, en pacientes ingresados en el hospital general. El documento contiene recomendaciones sobre uso sistemático de herramientas diagnósticas, cuándo hospitalizar al paciente con delirio, la aplicación de acciones no farmacológicas dentro de las restricciones que impone la COVID-19 y la utilización de antipsicóticos teniendo en cuenta los efectos secundarios más relevantes y las interacciones farmacológicas. The pandemic caused by the new coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2 poses unprecedented challenges in the health care. Among them is the increase in cases of delirium. The severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, COVID-19, has common vulnerabilities with delirium and produces alterations in organs such as the lungs or the brain, among others, which have the potential to trigger mental disorder. In fact, this may be the first manifestation of the infection, before fever, general malaise, cough or respiratory disturbances. It is widely supported that delirium increases the morbidity and mortality in those who suffer from it during hospitalisation, so it should be actively sought to carry out the relevant interventions. In the absence of evidence on the approach to delirium in the context of COVID-19, this consensus was developed on three fundamental aspects: diagnosis, non-pharmacological treatment and pharmacological treatment, in patients admitted to the general hospital.

To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4. These issues are highlighted by the current COVID-19 pandemic, wherein many clinical manifestations of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection parallel bacterial sepsis5–8. We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Reyes, Miguel; Filbin, Michael R.; Bhattacharyya, Roby P.; Sonny, Abraham; Mehta, Arnav; Billman, Kianna; Kays, Kyle R.; Pinilla-Vera, Mayra; Benson, Maura E.; Cosimi, Lisa A.; Hung, Deborah T.; Levy, Bruce D.; Villani, Alexandra-Chloe; Sade-Feldman, Moshe; Baron, Rebecca M.; Goldberg, Marcia B.; Blainey, Paul C.; Hacohen, Nir",bioRxiv,29,26

In particular, the use of off-label therapies outside of a clinical trial setting has been controversial. AIM: We aimed to longitudinally study policies and prescribing practices pertaining to therapies for COVID-19 in Australian Health Services in 2020. METHODS: Prospective data was collected from participating Australian health services who may care for patients with COVID-19 via an electronic portal. A single informant from each health service was emailed a survey link at regular intervals. Information was sought regarding changes to COVID-19 policy at their service and use of therapies for COVID-19. RESULTS: Overall, 78 hospitals were represented from 39 respondents with longitudinal data collection from May to December 2020. All Australian states/territories were represented with the majority of respondents located in a major city (34/39; 87%). Just over half (20/39) of respondents had a written policy for COVID-19 therapy use at their health service at survey enrolment and policies changed frequently throughout the pandemic. Therapy use outside of a clinical trial was reported in 54% of health services, most frequently in Victoria, correlating with higher numbers of COVID-19 cases. At study commencement hydroxychloroquine was most frequently used, with corticosteroids and remdesivir use increasingly throughout the study period. CONCLUSION: Our results reflect the reactive nature of prescribing of therapies for COVID-19 and highlight the importance of evidence-based guidelines to assist prescribers.

Those patients usually underwent a stage of excessive inflammation before developing acute respiratory distress syndrome. In this study, we test the hypothesis that short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids would benefit patients when used in the early phase of excessive inflammation, namely, the therapeutic window. Among a Shanghai cohort and a validation cohort, we enrolled COVID-19 patients showing marked radiographic progression. Short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids were considered for them. After identifying the possible markers for the therapeutic window, we then divided the patients, based on whether they were treated with corticosteroids within the therapeutic window, into the early-start group and control group. We identified that the therapeutic window for corticosteroids was characterized by a marked radiographic progression and lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) less than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The Shanghai cohort comprised of 68 patients, including 47 in the early-start group and 21 in the control group. The proportion of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation was significantly lower in the early-start group than in the control group (10.6% vs. 33.3%, difference, 22.7%, 95% confidence interval 2.6–44.8%). Among the validation cohort of 51 patients, similar difference of the primary outcome was observed (45.0% vs. 74.2%, P = 0.035). Among COVID-19 patients with marked radiologic progression, short-term, low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids benefits patients with LDH levels of less than two times the ULN, who may be in the early phase of excessive inflammation.","Li, Yang; Zhou, Xian; Li, Tao; Chan, Shiji; Yu, Yiqi; Ai, Jing-Wen; Zhang, Haocheng; Sun, Feng; Zhang, Qiran; Zhu, Lei; Shao, Lingyun; Xu, Bin; Zhang, Wenhong",Emerging microbes & infections,29,5

Real‐time PCR is the reference method for the diagnosis of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection; however, the unprecedented increase in the number of infections worldwide calls for faster and easy methods that do not require skilled personnel and special equipment. Rapid antigen tests have been developed and used as first line screening. Here, we assessed the performance of a rapid antigen test in comparison to a real‐time qualitative PCR as gold standard. Fifty nasopharyngeal swabs from suspected cases of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection have been tested by Coris coronavirus disease 2019 Ag Respi‐Strip test and Allplex 2019n‐CoV assay. Of the 50 nasopharyngeal swabs tested, 11 were negative by both tests, 27 were negative by Ag test but positive by real‐time PCR, and 12 were positive by both methods. PCR detected the 39 positive samples at a median cycle threshold (Ct) value of 22.78 (mean: 24.51; range: 13.59–39.6). In the 12 concordant samples, the median Ct value was 17.37. The sensitivity of the Ag test was 30.77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.02%–47.57%), specificity 100% (95% CI: 71.51%–100.00%), positive predictive value 100%, negative predictive value 85.25% (95% CI: 82.42%–87.69%), and accuracy 86.15% (95% CI: 73.45%–94.28%). The level of agreement between the two tests was poor, k = 0.164. The Ag test performs well in the presence of high viral loads, whereas lower levels are missed. Considering the poor sensitivity of the method, real‐time PCR remains the gold standard as front line screening for SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.","Ciotti, Marco; Maurici, Massimo; Pieri, Massimo; Andreoni, Massimo; Bernardini, Sergio",J Med Virol,29,29

But for these data to be precise, reliable and unbiased, women’s perspectives must be accurately represented. Throughout 2020, we conducted seven household surveys in rural India to understand households’ experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and contemporaneous relief programmes. Given social distancing protocols, we conducted these surveys over the phone, using household phone numbers collected during earlier, face-to-face research. Analysing metadata from these surveys (along with women’s responses to questions about phone use), we determine how gaps in phone access inhibit women’s representation in phone surveys. We find that the prevalence of male management of household phones significantly reduces access to female respondents. This is a problem for two reasons. Firstly, men are usually the first to pick up the phone: in two surveys in which we tracked the gender of the person who picked up, men picked up 63.2% and 71.1% of the time, respectively. Moreover, only a small minority of those we reached by phone were able and willing to pass the phone to a household member of the opposite gender, when prompted (with no statistically significant difference between pass rates for women and men). This low immediate pass rate, in combination with low female pickup, led to fewer women respondents. As such, we recommend that researchers dedicate time and resources to taking appointments and making call-backs to reach more women. We also show that the use of female enumerators improves households’ willingness to participate in women-centred surveys, and call for more investment into female enumerator teams.","Hersh, Skye; Nair, Divya; Komaragiri, Pradyot Bharadwaj; Adlakha, Raghav Kapoor",BMJ Glob Health,29,26

Presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human feces and its passage to sewage system is an emerging concern for public health. Pieces of evidence of the occurrence of viral RNA in feces and municipal wastewater (sewage) systems have not only warned reinforcing the treatment facilities but also suggest that these systems can be monitored to get epidemiological data for checking trend of COVID-19 infection in the community. This review summarizes the occurrence and persistence of novel coronavirus in sewage with an emphasis on the possible water environment contamination. Monitoring of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) via sewage-based epidemiology could deliver promising information regarding rate of infection providing a valid and complementary tool for tracking and diagnosing COVID-19 across communities. Tracking the sewage systems could act as an early warning tool for alerting the public health authorities for necessary actions. Given the impracticality of testing every citizen with limited diagnostic resources, it is imperative that sewage-based epidemiology can be tested as an early warning system. The need for the development of robust sampling strategies and subsequent detection methodologies and challenges for developing countries are also discussed.

These devices can be transmitters of bacterial pathogens. Therefore, it is necessary to implement effective disinfection procedures. The aim of this work was to show the impact of the modification of a cleaning and disinfection method of mechanical ventilators of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and ventilator-associated pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 338 mechanical ventilators of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria were divided in two groups. Group A and B were subjected to cleaning and disinfection with superoxidation solution-Cl/enzymatic detergent and isopropyl alcohol, respectively. Both groups were cultured for the detection of ESKAPE bacteria. The isolates were subjected to tests for identification, resistance, adherence, and genomic typing. RESULTS: Contamination rates of 21.6% (n=36) were identified in group A. The inspiratory limb was the circuit involved in most cases of post-disinfection contamination. Acinetobacter baumanni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multi-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae were the pathogens involved in the contamination cases. The pathogens were highly adherent and in the case of A. baumanni, clonal dispersion was detected in 14 ventilators. Disinfection with enzymatic detergents allows a 100% reduction in contamination rates. CONCLUSION: The implementation of cleaning and disinfection with enzymatic detergents/ isopropyl alcohol of mechanical ventilators of patients with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria had a positive impact on post-disinfection microbial contamination rates.","Cureño-Díaz, Monica Alethia; Durán-Manuel, Emilio Mariano; Cruz-Cruz, Clemente; Ibáñez-Cervantes, Gabriela; Rojo-Gutiérrez, María Isabel; Moncayo-Coello, Vivian; Loyola-Cruz, Miguel Ángel; Castro-Escarpulli, Graciela; Hernández, Dulce Milgragros Razo-Blanco; Bello-López, Juan Manuel",Am J Infect Control,29,1

Aims of our study are to describe prevalence and clinical features of neurological manifestations, mortality and hospital discharge in subjects hospitalized with COVID‐19. All individuals admitted for to our hospital COVID‐19 were retrospectively included. Patients were classified according to the symptoms at hospital entry in (1) isolated respiratory, (2) combined respiratory and neurologic, (3) isolated neurologic and (4) stroke manifestations. Descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests to compare the groups were calculated. Kaplan Meier probability curves and multivariable Cox regression models for survival and hospital discharge were applied. The analysis included 901 patients: 42.6% showed a severe or critical disease with an overall mortality of 21.2%. At least one neurological symptom or disease was observed in 30.2% of subjects ranging from dysgeusia/anosmia (9.1%) to postinfective diseases (0.8%). Patients with respiratory symptoms experienced a more severe disease and a higher in‐hospital mortality compared to those who showed only neurologic symptoms. Kaplan Meier estimates displayed a statistically significant different survival among groups (p = 0.003): subjects with stroke had the worst. After adjusting for risk factors such as age, sex and comorbidity, individuals with isolated neurologic manifestations exhibited a better survival (aHR 0.398, 95% CI [0.206, 0.769], p = 0.006).

Studies also hypothesize that the S glycoproteins present in the virus interacts with different hosts in different ways which might be due to the mutations taking place in the genome of the virus over time.

Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a penchant for sudden emergence, as evidenced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) and most recently, swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV). Small animal models of emerging viral pathogenesis are crucial to better understand the virus and host factors driving disease progression. However, rodent models are often criticized for their limited translatability to humans. The complete blood count is the most ordered clinical test in the United States serving as the cornerstone of clinical medicine and differential diagnosis. We recently generated a mouse model for MERS-CoV pathogenesis through the humanization of the orthologous entry receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). To increase the translatability of this model, we validated and established the use of an automated veterinary hematology analyzer (VetScan HM5) at biosafety level 3 for analysis of peripheral blood. MERS-CoV lung titer peaked 2 days post infection concurrent with lymphopenia and neutrophilia in peripheral blood, two phenomena also observed in MERS-CoV infection of humans. The fluctuations in leukocyte populations measured by Vetscan HM5 were corroborated by standard flow cytometry, thus confirming the utility of this approach. Comparing a sublethal and lethal dose of MERS-CoV in mice, analysis of daily blood draws demonstrates a dose dependent modulation of leukocytes. Major leukocyte populations were modulated before weight loss was observed. Importantly, neutrophil counts on 1dpi were predictive of disease severity with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV highlighting the predictive value of hematology in this model. Taken together, the inclusion of hematological measures in mouse models of emerging viral pathogenesis increases their translatability and should elevate the preclinical evaluation of MERS-CoV therapeutics and vaccines to better mirror the complexity of the human condition.","Leist, Sarah R.; Jensen, Kara L.; Baric, Ralph S.; Sheahan, Timothy P.",PLoS One,29,20

Inflammasomes, once activated, promote caspase-1–mediated maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18, leading to pyroptosis. Current advances in inflammasome research support their involvement in the development of chronic inflammatory disorders in contrast to their role in regulating innate immunity. Cannabis (marijuana) is a natural product obtained from the Cannabis sativa plant, and pharmacologically active ingredients of the plant are referred to as cannabinoids. Cannabinoids and cannabis extracts have recently emerged as promising novel drugs for chronic medical conditions. Growing evidence indicates the potent anti-inflammatory potential of cannabinoids, especially Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), cannabidiol (CBD), and synthetic cannabinoids; however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Several attempts have been made to decipher the role of cannabinoids in modulating inflammasome signaling in the etiology of chronic inflammatory diseases. In this review, we discuss recently published evidence on the effect of cannabinoids on inflammasome signaling. We also discuss the contribution of various cannabinoids in human diseases concerning inflammasome regulation. Lastly, in the milieu of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, we confer available evidence linking inflammasome activation to the pathophysiology of COVID-19 suggesting overall, the importance of cannabinoids as possible drugs to target inflammasome activation in or to support the treatment of a variety of human disorders including COVID-19.","Suryavanshi, Santosh V.; Kovalchuk, Igor; Kovalchuk, Olga",Front Immunol,29,22

Imparting the ability to respond to external stimuli can further enhance its scope of application. In order to imbue stimuli-responsive behavior in silk fibroin, we propose a new conjugated material, namely cationic SF (CSF) obtained by chemical modification of silk fibroin with ε-Poly-(L-lysine) (ε-PLL). This pH-responsive CSF hydrogel was prepared by enzymatic crosslinking using horseradish peroxidase and H(2)O(2). Zeta potential measurements and SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis show successful synthesis, with an increase in isoelectric point from 4.1 to 8.6. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show that the modification does not affect the crystalline structure of SF. Most importantly, the synthesized CSF hydrogel has an excellent pH response. At 10 wt.% ε-PLL, a significant change in swelling with pH is observed. We further demonstrate that the hydrogel can be glucose-responsive by the addition of glucose oxidase (GOx). At high glucose concentration (400 mg/dL), the swelling of CSF/GOx hydrogel is as high as 345 ± 16%, while swelling in 200 mg/dL, 100 mg/dL and 0 mg/dL glucose solutions is 237 ± 12%, 163 ± 12% and 98 ± 15%, respectively. This shows the responsive swelling of CSF/GOx hydrogels to glucose, thus providing sufficient conditions for rapid drug release. Together with the versatility and biological properties of fibroin, such stimuli-responsive silk hydrogels have great potential in intelligent drug delivery, as soft matter substrates for enzymatic reactions and in other biomedical applications.","Tao, Xiaosheng; Jiang, Fujian; Cheng, Kang; Qi, Zhenzhen; Yadavalli, Vamsi K.; Lu, Shenzhou",Int J Mol Sci,29,16

It could be difficult to participate rehabilitation program due to transportation problems and cautions for contagiousness. Tele‐rehabilitation could serve as a favorable alternative. The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether supervised telerehabilitation is superior to home exercise program regarding walking distance and secondarily muscle strength, muscle endurance, quality of life, physical activity level and perceived respiratory disability. METHODS: This is a randomized assessor blinded control trial with two groups; tele‐rehabilitation and home exercise. One hundred twenty‐two COVID‐19 survivors following discharge from intensive care unit will be allocated into two groups. The tele‐rehabilitation group will receive breathing, aerobic, posture, stretching, strengthening exercises at their home under remote supervision via Internet for 3 days/week for 10 weeks. Home exercise group will receive the same program at their home on their own and they will be called weekly. The patients will be evaluated at the beginning, at the end of the program, 6(th) and 12(th) months following the rehabilitation. The primary outcome is the change in 6‐minute walking distance; the secondary outcomes are changes in quality of life, physical function, health status, dyspnea and muscle strength. IMPACT STATEMENT: This detailed description of the rehabilitation protocol will guide to plan the rehabilitation program and help how to design an efficacy study comparing different models of rehabilitation in COVID‐19 survivors following discharge from intensive care unit with evidence‐based contribution to the literature.","Turan, Zeynep; Topaloglu, Mahir; Ozyemisci Taskiran, Ozden",Physiother Res Int,29,5

Many health authorities around the world have implemented wastewater-based epidemiology as a rapid and complementary tool for the COVID-19 surveillance system and more recently for variants of concern emergence tracking. In this study, three SARS-CoV-2 target genes (N1, N2, and E) were quantified from wastewater influent samples (n = 250) obtained from the capital city and 7 other cities in various size in central Ohio from July 2020 to January 2021. To determine human-specific fecal strength in wastewater samples more accurately, two human fecal viruses (PMMoV and crAssphage) were quantified to normalize the SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater. To estimate the trend of new case numbers from SARS-CoV-2 gene levels, different statistical models were built and evaluated. From the longitudinal data, SARS-CoV-2 gene concentrations in wastewater strongly correlated with daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases (average Spearman r = 0.70, p < 0.05), with the N2 gene being the best predictor of the trend of confirmed cases. Moreover, average daily case numbers can help reduce the noise and variation from the clinical data. Among the models tested, the quadratic polynomial model performed best in correlating and predicting COVID-19 cases from the wastewater surveillance data, which can be used to track the effectiveness of vaccination in the later stage of the pandemic. Interestingly, neither of the normalization methods using PMMoV or crAssphage significantly enhanced the correlation with new case numbers, nor improved the estimation models. Whole-genome sequencing result showed that those detected SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern from the wastewater matched with the clinical isolates from the communities. The findings from this study suggest that wastewater surveillance is effective in COVID-19 trend tracking and variant emergence and transmission within a community.","Ai, Y.; Davis, A.; Jones, D.; Lemeshow, S.; Tu, H.; He, F.; Ru, P.; Pan, X.; Bohrerova, Z.; Lee, J.",,29,1

Although several factors affect its sufficiency; it has been argued that an optimal diet can ensure the intake of micronutrients with effects on immune response. Therefore, in this work we aimed to evaluate the food intake quality of SARS-CoV-2 positive Mexican patients and some of the common factors related to vitamin D deficiency. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 40 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Serum samples and clinical parameters were collected. Micronutrient intake and food intake quality were assessed with a 24-h dietary recall and the Mini-ECCA v.2, respectively. Thirty-eight percent of the sample had a healthy food intake. The median 25(OH)D concentration was 22.7 ng/mL. A considerable insufficient intake of micronutrients with immunomodulatory effects such as vitamin D (p < 0.0001), vitamin E (p < 0.0001), and zinc (p < 0.0001) was shown. Patients with 25(OH)D sufficiency, defined as a concentration >30 ng/mL, had better food intake quality (p = 0.02) and an intense physical activity (p = 0.03). In conclusion, a better level of food intake quality and intense physical activity are associated with 25(OH)D sufficiency in SARS-CoV-2 positive Mexican patients.","González-Estevez, Guillermo; Turrubiates-Hernández, Francisco Javier; Herrera-Jiménez, Laura Elena; Sánchez-Zuno, Gabriela Athziri; Herrera-Godina, Melva Guadalupe; Muñoz-Valle, José Francisco",Int J Environ Res Public Health,29,20

We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with COVID-19 or SARS. Study Design and Setting: We extracted the data from: (1) a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, (2) a public data set of the first 37 cases of patients who died of COVID-19 and 1,019 patients who survived in China, and (3) data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing in early 2003. Results: Older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. Age was comparable between men and women in all data sets. In the case series, however, men's cases tended to be more serious than women's (P = 0.035). In the public data set, the number of men who died from COVID-19 is 2.4 times that of women (70.3 vs. 29.7%, P = 0.016). In SARS patients, the gender role in mortality was also observed. The percentage of males were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (P = 0.015). Conclusion: While men and women have the same prevalence, men with COVID-19 are more at risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age.","Jin, Jian-Min; Bai, Peng; He, Wei; Wu, Fei; Liu, Xiao-Fang; Han, De-Min; Liu, Shi; Yang, Jin-Kui",Front Public Health,29,24

The economic and environmental advantages of virtual learning are clear, while access to a wider range of resources and subject specialists makes the adoption of virtual learning within surgical education an attractive prospect. AIMS This literature review aims to evaluate evidence on the effectiveness of virtual education in orthopaedics and how we might implement positive changes to educational practice in the future, as a result of lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY We performed a review of the literature reporting on efficacy of learning outcomes achieved as a result of virtual education within orthopaedic surgery. Electronic searches were performed using NICE healthcare databases from the date of inception to March 2021. Relevant studies were identified, data extracted, and qualitative synthesis performed. RESULTS 14 manuscripts with a total of 1548 participants (orthopaedic trainees or medical students) were included for analysis. Nine studies (n = 1109) selected compared e-learning to conventional learning material (control group). All nine studies reported significantly higher outcome scores for e-learning participants compared to control participants (p < 0.001 to p < 0.05). The remaining studies compared blended e-learning approaches or evaluated pre/post intervention improvements in learning outcomes. All studies demonstrated a significant improvement in learning outcomes (p < 0.0001 to p < 0.01). The majority of studies (64%) used a blended approach. No studies were identified reporting efficacy of webinars or videoconferencing within orthopaedic education. CONCLUSION A blended approach, combining virtual teaching, face-to-face instruction and distance learning tools, based on the evidence we have provided, would improve the quality of knowledge reception and retention, and learner satisfaction. However, in order to be successful, it is vital that these educational programmes are designed with the needs of the learner in mind, and an awareness of best practice for virtual teaching and learning.","Thompson, Joshua W; Thompson, Emma L; Sanghrajka, Anish P",The surgeon : journal of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Ireland,29,16

Several studies have suggested that the pandemic affects not only physical health but also all aspects of society. A lot of information has been reported about the disease since the beginning of the outbreak. For that reason, it is essential to investigate the attitudes and level of knowledge and awareness that different populations had regarding COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and awareness of and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic among different populations in Central China during the critical period of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Central China from February to March 2020. The study participants included three different populations: medical workers, students, and those with other occupations. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to collect information on the following four aspects: sociodemographic information, knowledge related to COVID-19, awareness of COVID-19, and attitude toward COVID-19. The chi-square test and Fisher test were used for comparison among groups. The level of significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 508 participants. Among them, there were 380 students (74.8%), 39 medical workers (7.7%), and 89 people with other occupations (17.5%). Most of the participants were female (n=272, 53.5%), lived in rural areas (n=258, 50.8%), and were single (n=423, 86.9%). The majority of the respondents had attended college (n=454, 89.4%). Most of the participants said they had heard about COVID-19 by January, and most of them looked for information on social media (Sina Weibo, 84.7%), and WeChat and QQ groups (74.2%). The participants showed an adequate level of knowledge about COVID-19 with no significant differences among the groups. However, medical workers demonstrated a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions such as the potential susceptible population, possible host, treatment of COVID-19, and disease category. A higher proportion of medical workers (71.8%) and those in the other occupations group (52.8%) were highly concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 43% of the participants stated that the lockdown of their village/city had a significant impact on their lives. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents had an overall optimistic attitude toward the control of the disease (92.1% of students [n=350], 94.9% of medical workers [n=37], and 92.3% of those in other occupations [n=83]). CONCLUSIONS: All three groups reported an adequate background knowledge about COVID-19 but medical workers showed a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions. Most of the participants were highly concerned about COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. The majority of respondents declared that the village/city lockdown policy had a significant impact on their daily life but most of them held an optimistic attitude toward the control of COVID-19.","Xu, Huifang; Gonzalez Mendez, Maria Jose; Guo, Lanwei; Chen, Qiong; Zheng, Liyang; Chen, Peipei; Cao, Xiaoqin; Liu, Shuzheng; Sun, Xibin; Zhang, Shaokai; Qiao, Youlin",J Med Internet Res,29,20

In this study, we generated inactivated virus-laden aerosols of 0.3–2 microns in diameter (0.9 µm mean diameter by mass) and dispersed the aerosolized viral particles onto electrostatic face mask filters. The limit of detection for inactivated coronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-NL63 extracted from filters was between 10 to 100 copies/filter for both viruses. Testing for SARS-CoV-2, using face mask filters and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from hospitalized COVID-19-patients, showed that filter samples offered reduced sensitivity (8.5% compared to nasopharyngeal swabs). The low concordance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between filters and nasopharyngeal swabs indicated that number of viral particles collected on the face mask filter was below the limit of detection for all patients but those with the highest viral loads. This indicated face masks are unsuitable to replace diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 diagnosis.

Ninety-one newborn calves from three dairy farms were assigned into two groups; “Eco” group (n=46) calves were drenched with Greek oregano (Origanum vulgare ssp. Hirtum) essential oil (ECODIAR® liquid 5%) at the dose of 12.5mg/kg body weight once per day until the age of 10days. “Conts” group (n=45) calves were left untreated and served as controls. All animals were monitored daily for the incidence of diarrhea until the age of 15days and their fecal score was recorded. Fecal samples were collected on days 3, 6 and 10 for microbiological and parasitological evaluation. Average fecal score throughout the experiment, incidence of diarrhea, duration and severity of diarrhea episodes were significantly lower in Eco group compared to the controls. Daily administration of oregano essential oil in calves for the first 10days of their life effectively diminishes the severity of naturally acquired diarrhea under field conditions and, under certain hygiene practices, possess a preventive effect against neonatal diarrhea syndrome.","Katsoulos, Panagiotis D.; Karatzia, Maria A.; Dovas, Chrysostomos I.; Filioussis, George; Papadopoulos, Elias; Kiossis, Evangelos; Arsenopoulos, Konstantinos; Papadopoulos, Theologos; Boscos, Constantin; Karatzias, Harilaos",Research in Veterinary Science,29,3

The diversity of coronaviruses in many mammalian species is contributed by relatively high mutation and recombination rates during replication. This dynamic nature of coronaviruses may facilitate cross-species transmission and shifts in tissue or cell tropism in a host, resulting in substantial change in virulence. Feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) causes inapparent or mild enteritis in cats, but a highly fatal disease, called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), can arise through mutation of FECV to FIP virus (FIPV). The pathogenesis of FIP is intimately associated with immune responses and involves depletion of T cells, features shared by some other coronaviruses like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus. The increasing risks of highly virulent coronavirus infections in humans or animals call for effective antiviral drugs, but no such measures are yet available. Previously, we have reported the inhibitors that target 3C-like protease (3CLpro) with broad-spectrum activity against important human and animal coronaviruses. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of our 3CLpro inhibitor in laboratory cats with FIP. Experimental FIP is 100% fatal once certain clinical and laboratory signs become apparent. We found that antiviral treatment led to full recovery of cats when treatment was started at a stage of disease that would be otherwise fatal if left untreated. Antiviral treatment was associated with a rapid improvement in fever, ascites, lymphopenia and gross signs of illness and cats returned to normal health within 20 days or less of treatment. Significant reduction in viral titers was also observed in cats. These results indicate that continuous virus replication is required for progression of immune-mediated inflammatory disease of FIP. These findings may provide important insights into devising therapeutic strategies and selection of antiviral compounds for further development for important coronaviruses in animals and humans.","Kim, Yunjeong; Liu, Hongwei; Galasiti Kankanamalage, Anushka C.; Weerasekara, Sahani; Hua, Duy H.; Groutas, William C.; Chang, Kyeong-Ok; Pedersen, Niels C.",PLoS Pathog,29,24

METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among 422 households of Jimma Zone, and the data were collected by interviewing individuals from the selected households. The medicinal plants were recorded on Microsoft excel 2010 with their parts used, dosage form, route of administration and source of plants and tabulated in the table. Descriptive statistics were used to describe and organize the data. The Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) was calculated for each traditional medicine to identify the top 10 medicinal products. RESULTS: Around 46% of participants used traditional medicines for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The study recorded 32 herbal and non-herbal medicinal products. Garlic (RFC: 0.166), ginger (RFC: 0.133), lemon (RFC: 0.133), garden cress (RFC: 0.069) and “Damakase” (RFC: 0.031) were the frequently used herbal medicines.

Garlic, ginger, lemon, garden cress and “Damakase” were the frequently used herbal products. Seeds and leaves were regularly used parts. The oral route is the most used route of administration. The majority of medicinal plants were from home gardens. This quantity of traditional medicine practice is probably challenging to control the pandemic.

Eighty‐two diarrhoeic calves and 18 healthy calves were used as subjects. Faeces were taken from the rectums of all the calves and were subjected to bacterial culture. Antigen enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed to detect rotavirus, coronavirus and E. coli K99 in faeces of all the calves. A multiplex PCR was used to characterize E. coli strains in all the calves. Escherichia coli was isolated from 37 faeces samples, Enterococcus ssp. was isolated from 22 faeces samples and Salmonella was isolated from one faeces sample in diarrhoeic calves. Furthermore, only E. coli was isolated from all 18 faeces samples of healthy calves. Of the 37 E. coli isolated from diarrhoeic calves, K99 (18.9%), F41 (18.9%), heat‐stable enterotoxin a (STa) (18.9%), Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1; 13.5%) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2; 5.4%) and intimin (8.1%) genes were identified by multiplex PCR. Of the 18 E. coli isolated from healthy calves, K99 (16.6%) and intimin (55.5%) genes were identified by PCR. A total of 15 rotavirus, 11 coronavirus and 11 E. coli K99 were detected in diarrhoeic calves by the antigen ELISA. As a result, this study shows that rotavirus, coronavirus, E. coli and Enterococcus ssp. were determined to play a role in the aetiology of diarrhoea in the neonatal calves. K99, F41, STa, Stx1 and Stx2 were found as the most common virulence gene markers of E. coli strains isolated from calves with diarrhoea.

After immunizing these mice against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, we identified 29 hybridoma antibodies that reacted with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Nine antibodies neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection at IC50 values in the subnanomolar range. ELISA-binding studies and DNA sequence analyses revealed one cluster of clonally related neutralizing antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain and compete with the cellular receptor hACE2. A second cluster of neutralizing antibodies binds to the N-terminal domain of the spike protein without competing with the binding of hACE2 or cluster 1 antibodies. SARS-CoV-2 mutants selected for resistance to an antibody from one cluster are still neutralized by an antibody from the other cluster. Antibodies from both clusters markedly reduced viral spread in mice transgenic for human ACE2 and protected the animals from SARS-CoV-2 induced weight loss. Thus, we report two clusters of potent non-competing SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies providing potential candidates for therapy and prophylaxis of COVID-19.

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure following a melanoma diagnosis can be modified to reduce risk of a new melanoma diagnosis. Yet research shows that many melanoma survivors do not report optimal sun protection practices. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a UVR-sensor wearable device to improve sun protection behaviors and reduce sunburns in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in melanoma survivors. METHODS: We will conduct an RCT among 368 melanoma survivors in two waves (Summer 2020, Summer 2021). This approach allows for adequate recruitment of the required sample and potential improvements to recruitment, compliance, and retention strategies between waves. The intervention includes an informational brochure about sun protection behaviors and a commercially available UVR-sensor wearable device (Shade), which accurately measures UVR. The device, along with its associated mobile application, measures and stores UVR exposure. As UVR exposure accumulates, the device provides notifications to increase sun protection action. Survivors in the control group receive the device and a separate mobile application that does not provide notifications or summary UVR exposure data. Participants will be asked to wear the device for 12 weeks. They will complete surveys about their sun behaviors at study entry, every 4 weeks during the intervention, and 1 year later. At the end of the intervention period, intervention and control groups will be compared for differences in a summary measure of sun protection habits and experience of a sunburn. We will also measure self-reported physical activity, depression, and anxiety to examine potential unintended negative consequences of the intervention. DISCUSSION: The study intervention will be completed Fall 2021, with anticipated results available in 2022. If this intervention improves sun protection behaviors in melanoma survivors, these findings would support expanding the use of this technology with other populations at high risk for melanoma.

To investigate the association of the pandemic-related impacts with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with melanoma. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to melanoma patients through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (unemployment and income loss) were collected. HRQoL was determined by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and its disease-specific module (the melanoma subscale, MS). A total of 135 patients with melanoma completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 ± 14.2 years, 48.1% (65/135) were male, and 17.04% (34/135) were unemployed since the epidemic. Unemployment of the patients and their family members and income loss were significantly associated with a lower FACT-G score, while the MS score was associated with the unemployment of the patients' family members. Our findings suggested that unemployment is associated with impaired HRQoL in melanoma patients during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Guo, Yeye; Shen, Minxue; Zhang, Xu; Xiao, Yi; Zhao, Shuang; Yin, Mingzhu; Bu, Wenbo; Wang, Yan; Chen, Xiang; Su, Juan",Front Public Health,29,1

(2019) outline what they perceive as a bias toward an “Asian super consumer”. They argue that wildlife trade demand reduction campaigns are unfocused, untargeted, and therefore have a tendency to place blame on people of colour and communities in the Global South as key actors in driving illegal wildlife trade. As researchers and practitioners, we have been studying the demand for wildlife and wildlife products for many years. While we agree that it is vitally important to consider the cultural nuances of illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade and to operate in a manner that is respectful toward different cultures, we believe that the authors have overlooked the fact that modern wildlife trade demand reduction campaigns are already conducting this research and using it to target their campaigns to specific groups.","Bergin, Daniel; Wu, Derek; Meijer, Wander",Geoforum,29,3

This study was conducted as part of the calf component of the National Animal Health Monitoring System's Dairy 2014 study, which included 104 dairy operations in 13 states. The calf component was an 18-mo longitudinal study focused on dairy heifer calves from birth to weaning; data were collected on 2,545 calves. The percentage morbidity for all calves enrolled in the study was 33.9%. Backward elimination model selection was used after univariate screening to determine which management practices and environmental factors significantly affected morbidity and mortality. The final morbidity model included birth weight, serum IgG concentration, ventilation type, and average temperature-humidity index (THI) during the preweaning period. After controlling for other independent variables in the model, calves born at a higher birth weight had a lower predicted risk of morbidity than calves with a lower birth weight. An increase in serum IgG concentration was associated with decreased morbidity. Calves housed in positive- or cross-ventilated systems had a 2.2 times higher odds of developing disease compared with calves housed in natural ventilation systems. Average THI during the preweaning period was inversely correlated with morbidity; as THI increased, the predicted morbidity risk decreased. The percent mortality for all calves enrolled in the study was 5.0%. The final mortality model included birth weight, serum IgG concentration, amount of fat/day in the liquid diet, and morbidity. After controlling for other independent variables in the model, calves born at a higher birth weight had a lower risk of mortality. An increase in serum IgG concentration decreased the risk of mortality. The odds of mortality were 3.1 times higher in calves fed ≤0.15 kg of fat/d in the liquid diet compared with calves fed ≥0.22 kg of fat/d. The odds of mortality were 4.7 times higher in calves that experienced any disease throughout the preweaning period than in calves with no disease. In summary, morbidity and mortality were both associated with birth weight and serum IgG concentration. Additionally, morbidity was associated with ventilation type and average monthly THI, and mortality was associated with amount of fat per day in the liquid diet and morbidity.","Urie, N.J.; Lombard, J.E.; Shivley, C.B.; Kopral, C.A.; Adams, A.E.; Earleywine, T.J.; Olson, J.D.; Garry, F.B.",J Dairy Sci,29,16

The high mortality rate of MERS-CoV focused attention on the ecology of the virus. It has been found that MERS-CoV belongs to the group C lineage of the genus Betacoronavirus. Coronavirus surveillance studies in different populations of bats have suggested that they are probable reservoirs for this novel virus, and phylogenetic analysis of both the spike (S1) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins of MERS-CoV have revealed that it is related to bat viruses. Recently, the MERS-CoV and its neutralizing antibodies were detected in dromedary camels.

We analyzed the influence of timing and clinical severity on the diagnostic value of class-specific COVID-19 serology testing. Cross-sectional analysis revealed higher sensitivity and specificity at lower optical density cutoffs for IgA in hospitalized patients than for IgG and IgM serology (IgG area under the curve [AUC] of 0.91 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.89 to 0.93] versus IgA AUC of 0.97 [95% CI, 0.96 to 0.98] versus IgM AUC of 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92 to 0.97]). The enhanced performance of IgA serology was apparent in the first 2 weeks after symptom onset and the first week after PCR testing. In patients requiring intubation, all three tests exhibit enhanced sensitivity. Among PCR-negative patients under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 2 out of 61 showed clear evidence of seroconversion IgG, IgA, and IgM. Suspected false-positive results in the latter population were most frequently observed in IgG and IgM serology tests. Our findings suggest the potential utility of IgA serology in the acute setting and explore the benefits and limitations of class-specific serology as a complementary diagnostic tool to PCR for COVID-19 in the acute setting.","Verkerke, Hans; Horwath, Michael; Saeedi, Bejan; Boyer, Darra; Allen, Jerry W.; Owens, Joshua; Arthur, Connie M.; Nakahara, Hirotomo; Rha, Jennifer; Patel, Kashyap; Wu, Shang-Chuen; Paul, Anu; Yasin, Nini; Wang, Jianmei; Shin, Sooncheon; Brown, DeAndre; Normile, Katherine; Cole, Lisa; Meyers, Mark; Lin, Heather; Woods, Emily; Isaac, Jennifer; Broder, Kari; Wade, Jenna; Kauffman, Robert C.; Patel, Ravi; Josephson, Cassandra D.; Reynolds, Stacian; Sherman, Melanie; Wrammert, Jens; Alter, David; Guarner, Jeannette; Roback, John D.; Neish, Andrew; Stowell, Sean R.",J Clin Microbiol,29,1

The current COVID-19 pandemic poses a challenge to nursing staff, who are in a key position to provide high-quality palliative care for people with dementia and their families. OBJECTIVE: To formulate practice recommendations for nursing staff with regard to providing palliative dementia care in times of COVID-19. DESIGN AND METHOD: A rapid scoping review following guidelines from the Joanna Briggs Institute. Eligible papers focused on COVID-19 in combination with palliative care for older people or people with dementia and informed practical nursing recommendations for long-term care facilities. After data extraction, we formulated recommendations covering essential domains in palliative care adapted from the National Consensus Project's Clinical Practice Guidelines for Quality Palliative Care. DATA SOURCES: We searched the bibliographic databases of PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO for academic publications. We searched for grey literature using the search engine Google. Moreover, we included relevant letters and editorials, guidelines, web articles and policy papers published by knowledge and professional institutes or associations in dementia and palliative care. RESULTS: In total, 23 documents (7 (special) articles in peer-reviewed journals, 6 guides, 4 letters to editors, 2 web articles (blogs), 2 reports, a correspondence paper and a position paper) were included. The highest number of papers informed recommendations under the domains ‘advance care planning’ and ‘psychological aspects of care’. The lowest number of papers informed the domains ‘ethical care’, ‘care of the dying’, ‘spiritual care’ and ‘bereavement care’. We found no papers that informed the ‘cultural aspects of care’ domain. CONCLUSION: Literature that focuses specifically on palliative care for people with dementia in long-term care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic is still largely lacking. Particular challenges that need addressing involve care of the dying and the bereaved, and ethical, cultural and spiritual aspects of care. Moreover, we must acknowledge grief and moral distress among nursing staff. Nursing leadership is needed to safeguard the quality of care and nursing staff should work together within an interprofessional care team to initiate advance care planning conversations in a timely manner, to review and document advance care plans, and to adapt goals of care as they may change due to the COVID-19 situation. Tweetable abstract: The current COVID-19 pandemic affects people living with dementia, their families and their professional caregivers. This rapid scoping review searched for academic and grey literature to formulate practical recommendations for nursing staff working in long-term care facilities on how to provide palliative care for people with dementia in times of COVID-19. There is a particular need for grief and bereavement support and we must acknowledge grief and moral distress among nursing staff. This review exposes practice and knowledge gaps in the response to COVID-19 that reflect the longstanding neglect and weaknesses of palliative care in the long-term care sector. Nursing leadership is needed to safeguard the quality of palliative care, interprofessional collaboration and peer support among nursing staff.","Bolt, SR; van der Steen, JT; Mujezinović, I; Janssen, DJA; Schols, JMGA; Zwakhalen, SMG; Khemai, C; Knapen, PAGM; Dijkstra, L; Meijers, JMM",Int J Nurs Stud,29,16

Understanding the spillover from bats to humans and other animals, and the associated health risks requires an analysis of the disease dynamics in bat populations. Traditional compartmental epizootic models, which are relatively easy to implement and analyze, usually impose unrealistic aggregation assumptions about disease-related structure and depend on parameters that frequently are not measurable in field conditions. We propose a novel combination of computational and adaptive modeling approaches that address the maintenance of emerging diseases in bat colonies through individual (intra-host) models of the response of the host to a viral challenge. The dynamics of the individual models are used to define survival, susceptibility and transmission conditions relevant to epizootics as well as to develop and parametrize models of the disease evolution into uniform and diverse populations. Applications of the proposed approach to modeling the effects of immunological heterogeneity on the dynamics of bat rabies are presented.","Dimitrov, Dobromir T.; Hallam, Thomas G.; Rupprecht, Charles E.; McCracken, Gary F.",J Theor Biol,29,18

Within 4 days of the request, the NIH COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel was established and the first meeting took place (virtually—as did subsequent meetings). The Panel comprises 57 individuals representing 6 governmental agencies, 11 professional societies, and 33 medical centers, plus 2 community members, who have worked together to create and frequently update the guidelines on the basis of evidence from the most recent clinical studies available. The initial version of the guidelines was completed within 2 weeks and posted online on 21 April 2020. Initially, sparse evidence was available to guide COVID-19 treatment recommendations. However, treatment data rapidly accrued based on results from clinical studies that used various study designs and evaluated different therapeutic agents and approaches. Data have continued to evolve at a rapid pace, leading to 24 revisions and updates of the guidelines in the first year. This process has provided important lessons for responding to an unprecedented public health emergency: Providers and stakeholders are eager to access credible, current treatment guidelines; governmental agencies, professional societies, and health care leaders can work together effectively and expeditiously; panelists from various disciplines, including biostatistics, are important for quickly developing well-informed recommendations; well-powered randomized clinical trials continue to provide the most compelling evidence to guide treatment recommendations; treatment recommendations need to be developed in a confidential setting free from external pressures; development of a user-friendly, web-based format for communicating with health care providers requires substantial administrative support; and frequent updates are necessary as clinical evidence rapidly emerges.","Kuriakose, Safia; Singh, Kanal; Pau, Alice K.; Daar, Eric; Gandhi, Rajesh; Tebas, Pablo; Evans, Laura; Gulick, Roy M.; Lane, H.

Each ReTi-PCR test was validated for specificity, analytical sensitivity (detection limits), and experimental infection studies were performed to compare the conventional virus isolation methods with the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests. All five developed ReTi-PCR tests are very rapid compared to virus isolation, highly specific, and even more sensitive (lower detection limits) than conventional virus isolation methods for the detection of mentioned viruses in semen. In semen of experimentally infected boars, viruses were detected much earlier after infection and more frequently by ReTi-PCR tests than by virus isolations. The high throughput of these rapid ReTi-PCR tests makes it possible to screen large number of semen samples for the presence of viruses prior to insemination. This is a substantial advantage, in particular for boar semen the quality of which deteriorates quickly after storage. In general, the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests are valuable tools for the early, reliable and rapid detection of five economically important viruses, namely PRV, CSFV, FMDV, SVDV, and PRRSV in boar semen. These ReTi-PCR tests will improve the control of viral diseases transmitted via semen.","van Rijn, Piet A; Wellenberg, Gerard J; Hakze-van der Honing, Renate; Jacobs, Liesbeth; Moonen, Peter L.J.M; Feitsma, Hanneke",J Virol Methods,29,24

Au 14/02/20, 64 460 cas ont été recensés dans le monde dont 99 % en Chine, avec une mortalité globale estimée à 2,1 %. L’unité des risques épidémiologiques et biologiques (REB) de notre établissement de santé de référence (ESR) a été mobilisée pour la prise en charge diagnostique des cas possibles. L’objectif de ce travail est de décrire les caractéristiques de ces patients. Matériels et méthodes Les cas étaient classés possibles à partir des critères proposés par Santé Publique France, modulés par les cliniciens de notre ESR en tenant compte de l’évolution rapide des données cliniques et épidémiologiques disponibles. Tous les cas possibles bénéficiaient d’un prélèvement naso-rétro-pharyngé avec RT-PCR spécifique SARS-CoV-2 et PCR multiplex respiratoire. Résultats Sur la période du 21/01 au 14/02/20, l’unité REB a reçu 288 signalements de patients suspects dont 101 (35,1 %) ont été classés cas possibles. Parmi ces cas, l’âge moyen était de 36 ans [26–42,5] et le sex-ratio de 0,7. Dix-huit (17,8 %) personnes revenaient de la région de Hubei, 63 (62,4 %) revenaient de Chine hors Hubei, 12 (11,9 %) avaient été en contact avec un cas confirmé et 10 (9,9 %) avaient eu un contact avec le système de santé en Chine. Le délai moyen entre le début des symptômes et le signalement était de 6jours [1–7]. Cliniquement, 45 (44,6 %) patients présentaient de la fièvre, 93 (92,1 %) des signes d’infection respiratoire basse et 41 (40,6 %) des signes d’infection respiratoire haute. Les signes d’infection respiratoire basse et haute étaient isolés chez 57 (56,4 %) et 5 (5,0 %) patients respectivement. Six (5,9 %) patients présentaient de la diarrhée et 3 (3,0 %) une conjonctivite. Quatre cas avaient une infection confirmée à SARS-CoV-2 dont 1 patient hospitalisé en réanimation. Parmi les 97 cas infirmés, 50 (51,5 %) avaient une infection virale respiratoire documentée dont 28 (28,9 %) un virus Influenza, 9 (9,3 %) un rhinovirus, 5 (5,2 %) un autre coronavirus, 4 (4,1 %) un adénovirus, 4 (4,1 %) un métapneumovirus et 3 (3,1 %) un virus respiratoire syncytial. Quarante-trois (44,3 %) des infections n’ont pas été documentées. Concernant les patients dont la PCR multiplex était négative, 41 (95,3 %) patients présentaient des signes d’infection respiratoire basse et 13 (30,2 %) des signes d’infection respiratoire haute. Conclusion Parmi les cas possibles d’infection à SARS-CoV-2, la majorité des patients était jeune et présentait des signes cliniques aspécifiques de virose respiratoire sans gravité.

Colchicine was considered for this purpose based on well-recognised anti-inflammatory effects and potential antiviral properties. In the present study, colchicine was proposed to patients with COVID-19, and its effects compared with ‘standard-of-care’ (SoC). METHODS: In the public hospital of Esine, northern Italy, 140 consecutive inpatients, with virologically and radiographically confirmed COVID-19 admitted in the period 5–19 March 2020, were treated with ‘SoC’ (hydroxychloroquine and/or intravenous dexamethasone; and/or lopinavir/ritonavir). They were compared with 122 consecutive inpatients, admitted between 19 March and 5 April 2020, treated with colchicine (1 mg/day) and SoC (antiviral drugs were stopped before colchicine, due to potential interaction). RESULTS: Patients treated with colchicine had a better survival rate as compared with SoC at 21 days of follow-up (84.2% (SE=3.3%) vs 63.6% (SE=4.1%), p=0.001). Cox proportional hazards regression survival analysis showed that a lower risk of death was independently associated with colchicine treatment (HR=0.151 (95% CI 0.062 to 0.368), p<0.0001), whereas older age, worse PaO2/FiO2, and higher serum levels of ferritin at entry were associated with a higher risk. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-concept study may support the rationale of use of colchicine for the treatment of COVID-19. Efficacy and safety must be determined in controlled clinical trials.","Scarsi, Mirko; Piantoni, Silvia; Colombo, Enrico; Airó, Paolo; Richini, Donata; Miclini, Marco; Bertasi, Valeria; Bianchi, Marta; Bottone, Damiano; Civelli, Patrizia; Cotelli, Maria-Sofia; Damiolini, Ezio; Galbassini, Gloria; Gatta, Diego; Ghirardelli, Maria-Laura; Magri, Roberto; Malamani, Paola; Mendeni, Monia; Molinari, Stefano; Morotti, Andrea; Salada, Luisa; Turla, Marinella; Vender, Angiola; Tincani, Angela; Brucato, Antonio; Franceschini, Franco; Furloni, Roberto; Andreoli, Laura",Ann Rheum Dis,29,9

This has led to the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects and damages the vascular endothelium. However, endothelial expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, has not been convincingly demonstrated. Interrogating human bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data, we found ACE2 expression in endothelial cells to be extremely low or absent in vivo and not upregulated by exposure to inflammatory agents in vitro. Also, the endothelial chromatin landscape at the ACE2 locus showed presence of repressive and absence of activation marks, suggesting that the gene is inactive in endothelial cells. Finally, we failed to achieve infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured human endothelial cells, which were permissive to productive infection by coronavirus 229E that uses CD13 as the receptor. Our data suggest that SARS-Cov-2 is unlikely to infect endothelial cells directly; these findings are consistent with a scenario where endothelial injury is indirectly caused by the infection of neighbouring epithelial cells and/or due to systemic effects mediated by immune cells, platelets, complement activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokines.","McCracken, Ian; Saginc, Gaye; He, Liqun; Huseynov, Alik; Daniels, Alison; Fletcher, Sarah; Peghaire, Claire; Kalna, Viktoria; Andaloussi-Mäe, Maarja; Muhl, Lars; Craig, Nicky M.; Griffiths, Samantha J.; Haas, Jürgen G.; Tait-Burkard, Christine; Lendahl, Urban; Birdsey, Graeme M.; Betsholtz, Christer; Noseda, Michela; Baker, Andrew; Randi, Anna M.",bioRxiv,29,16

Easy detection of COVID-19 through any technological tool like a mobile phone can help a lot. In this research, we focus on detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images on Android mobile with the help of Artificial Intelligence (AI). METHODS: A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed in MATLAB and then converted to the CNN model to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) model to deploy on Android mobile. An Android application is developed which uses the TFLite model to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. RESULTS: By employing a 5-fold cross-validation, an average accuracy of 98.65%, sensitivity of 98.49%, specificity of 98.82%, precision of 98.81%, and F1-score of 98.65% are achieved in COVID-19 detection.

Analytical risk assessment is a valuable approach to guide decision-making on travel restrictions and border measures during the early phase of an outbreak, when transmission is primarily contained within a source country. Here we introduce a modular framework for estimating the importation risk of an emerging disease when the direct travel route is restricted and the risk stems from indirect importation via intermediary countries. This was the situation for Australia in February 2020. The framework was specifically developed to assess the importation risk of COVID-19 into Australia during the early stages of the outbreak from late January to mid-February 2020. The dominant importation risk to Australia at the time of analysis was directly from China, as the only country reporting uncontained transmission. However, with travel restrictions from mainland China to Australia imposed from February 1, our framework was designed to consider the importation risk from China into Australia via potential intermediary countries in the Asia Pacific region. The framework was successfully used to contribute to the evidence base for decisions on border measures and case definitions in the Australian context during the early phase of COVID-19 emergence and is adaptable to other contexts for future outbreak response.","Shearer, Freya; Walker, James; Tellioglu, Nefel; McCaw, James M; McVernon, Jodie; Black, Andrew; Geard, Nicholas",,29,17

MAb 201 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV)–specific MAb that prevents establishment of viral replication in vitro and prevents viral replication in vivo when administered prophylactically. The efficacy of MAb 201 in the treatment of SARS was evaluated in golden Syrian hamsters, an animal model that supports SARS-CoV replication to high levels and displays severe pathological changes associated with infection, including pneumonitis and pulmonary consolidation MethodsGolden Syrian hamsters that were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV were treated with various doses of MAb 201 or an irrelevant MAb 24 h after inoculation. Two to 7 days after infection, the hamsters were killed, and their lungs were collected for evaluation of viral titers and pathological findings ResultsPostexposure treatment with MAb 201 can alleviate the viral burden and associated pathological findings in a golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV infection.

The cellular factors exploited by filoviruses for their spread constitute potential targets for intervention, but are incompletely defined. The viral glycoprotein (GP) mediates filovirus entry into host cells. Recent studies revealed important insights into the host cell molecules engaged by GP for cellular entry. The binding of GP to cellular lectins was found to concentrate virions onto susceptible cells and might contribute to the early and sustained infection of macrophages and dendritic cells, important viral targets. Tyrosine kinase receptors were shown to promote macropinocytic uptake of filoviruses into a subset of susceptible cells without binding to GP, while interactions between GP and human T cell Ig mucin 1 (TIM-1) might contribute to filovirus infection of mucosal epithelial cells. Moreover, GP engagement of the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 was demonstrated to be essential for GP-mediated fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. Finally, mutagenic and structural analyses defined GP domains which interact with these host cell factors. Here, we will review the recent progress in elucidating the molecular interactions underlying filovirus entry and discuss their implications for our understanding of the viral cell tropism.","Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Kaup, Franziska; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Viruses,29,24

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of the implementation of government policies and the Nowruz holidays on the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran, using an intervention time series analysis. METHODS: Daily data on COVID-19 cases registered between February 19 and May 2, 2020 were collected from the World Health Organization (WHO)’s website. Using an intervention time series modeling, the effect of two government policies on the number of confirmed cases were evaluated, namely the closing of schools and universities, and the implementation of social distancing measures. Furthermore, the effect of the Nowruz holidays as a non-intervention factor for the spread of COVID-19 was also analyzed. RESULTS: The results showed that, after the implementation of the first intervention, i.e., the closing of universities and schools, no statistically significant change was found in the number of new confirmed cases. The Nowruz holidays was followed by a significant increase in new cases (1,872.20; 95% CI, 1,257.60 to 2,476.79; p<0.001)), while the implementation of social distancing measures was followed by a significant decrease in such cases (2,182.80; 95% CI, 1,556.56 to 2,809.04; p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The Nowruz holidays and the implementation of social distancing measures in Iran were related to a significant increase and decrease in COVID-19 cases, respectively. These results highlight the necessity of measuring the effect of health and social interventions for their future implementations.","Hadianfar, Ali; Yousefi, Razieh; Delavary, Milad; Fakoor, Vahid; Shakeri, Mohammad Taghi; Lavallière, Martin",PLoS One,29,16

Excessive abdominal fat is associated with adipose tissue dysfunction, leading to systemic low-grade inflammation, fat overflow, ectopic lipid deposition, and reduced insulin sensitivity. Physical activity is recommended for primary prevention and treatment of obesity, T2DM, and related disorders. Achieving a stable reduction in body weight with exercise training alone has not shown promising effects on a population level. Because fat has a high energy content, a large amount of exercise training is required to achieve weight loss. However, even when there is no weight loss, exercise training is an effective method of improving body composition (increased muscle mass and reduced fat) as well as increasing insulin sensitivity and cardiorespiratory fitness. Compared with traditional low-to-moderate-intensity continuous endurance training, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and sprint interval training (SIT) are more time-efficient as exercise regimens and produce comparable results in reducing total fat mass, as well as improving cardiorespiratory fitness and insulin sensitivity. During high-intensity exercise, carbohydrates are the main source of energy, whereas, with low-intensity exercise, fat becomes the predominant energy source. These observations imply that HIIT and SIT can reduce fat mass during bouts of exercise despite being associated with lower levels of fat oxidation. In this review, we explore the effects of different types of exercise training on energy expenditure and substrate oxidation during physical activity, and discuss the potential effects of exercise training on adipose tissue function and body fat distribution.","Kolnes, Kristoffer Jensen; Petersen, Maria Houborg; Lien-Iversen, Teodor; Højlund, Kurt; Jensen, Jørgen",Front Physiol,29,1

For the pyrolysis of single-use food containers or corrugated fiberboard, an increase in temperature tended to increase the yield of pyrolytic gas (i.e., non-condensable gases) and decrease the yield of pyrolytic liquid (i.e., a mixture of condensable compounds) and solid residue. The single-use food container-derived pyrolytic product was largely composed of hydrocarbons with a wide range of carbon numbers from C(1) to C(32), while the corrugated fiberboard-derived pyrolytic product was composed of a variety of chemical groups such as phenolic compounds, polycyclic aromatic compounds, and oxygenates involving alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, acetates, and esters. Changes in the pyrolysis temperature from 500 °C to 900 °C had no significant effect on the selectivity toward each chemical group found in the pyrolytic liquid derived from either the single-use food containers or corrugated fiberboard. The co-pyrolysis of the single-use food containers and corrugated fiberboard led to 6 times higher hydrogen (H(2)) selectivity than the pyrolysis of the single-use food containers only. Furthermore, the co-pyrolysis did not form phenolic compounds or polycyclic aromatic compounds that are hazardous environmental pollutants (0% selectivity), indicating that the co-pyrolysis process is an eco-friendly method to treat single-use disposable waste.","Joo, Junghee; Lee, Seonho; Choi, Heeyoung; Lin, Kun-Yi Andrew; Lee, Jechan",Polymers (Basel),29,1
