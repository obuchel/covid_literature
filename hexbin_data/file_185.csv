16,Herpes simplex virus type 1 and normal protein permeability in the lungs of critically ill patients: a case for low pathogenicity?,2004-03-31,"INTRODUCTION: The pathogenicity of late respiratory infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the critically ill is unclear. METHODS: In four critically ill patients with persistent pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin and isolation of HSV-1 from tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, at 7 (1–11) days after start of mechanical ventilatory support, a pulmonary leak index (PLI) for (67)Gallium ((67)Ga)-transferrin (upper limit of normal 14.1 × 10(-3)/min) was measured. RESULTS: The PLI ranged between 7.5 and 14.0 × 10(-3)/min in the study patients. Two patients received a course of acyclovir and all survived. CONCLUSIONS: The normal capillary permeability observed in the lungs argues against pathogenicity of HSV-1 in the critically ill, and favors that isolation of the virus reflects reactivation in the course of serious illness and immunodepresssion, rather than primary or superimposed infection in the lungs.","Verheij, Joanne; Groeneveld, AB Johan; Beishuizen, Albertus; Lingen, Arthur van; Simoons-Smit, Alberdina M; van Schijndel, Rob JM Strack",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC468896/,185
450,Efficacy of Oseltamivir-Zanamivir Combination Compared to Each Monotherapy for Seasonal Influenza: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial,2010-11-02,"BACKGROUND: Neuraminidase inhibitors are thought to be efficacious in reducing the time to alleviation of symptoms in outpatients with seasonal influenza. The objective of this study was to compare the short-term virological efficacy of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination versus each monotherapy plus placebo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008–2009 seasonal influenza epidemic. Patients, general practitioners, and outcome assessors were all blinded to treatment assignment. Adult outpatients presenting influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O), or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Treatment efficacy was assessed virologically according to the proportion of patients with nasal influenza reverse transcription (RT)-PCR below 200 copies genome equivalent (cgeq)/µl at day 2 (primary outcome), and clinically to the time to alleviation of symptoms until day 14. Overall 541 patients (of the 900 planned) were included (OZ, n = 192; O, n = 176; Z, n = 173), 49% male, mean age 39 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A, 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ (n = 157), O (n = 141), and Z (n = 149) arms had RT-PCR<200 cgeq/µl (−13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −23.1 to −2.9, p = 0.025; +12.3%, 95% CI 2.39–22.2, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean day 0 to day 2 viral load decrease was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log(10) cgeq/µl (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Median time to alleviation of symptoms was 4.0, 3.0, and 4.0 days (+1.0, 95% CI 0.0–4.0, p = 0.018; +0.0, 95% CI −3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.960 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Four severe adverse events were observed. Nausea and/or vomiting tended to be more frequent in the combination arm (OZ, n = 13; O, n = 4; and Z, n = 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with seasonal influenza A mainly H3N2 virus infection, the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination appeared less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy. Despite the theoretical potential for the reduction of the emergence of antiviral resistance, the lower effectiveness of this combination calls for caution in its use in clinical practice.

1134,Risk factors for severe acute lower respiratory infections in children – a systematic review and meta-analysis,2013-04-11,"AIM: To identify the risk factors in children under five years of age for severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), which are the leading cause of child mortality. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of published literature available in the public domain. We conducted a quality assessment of all eligible studies according to GRADE criteria and performed a meta-analysis to report the odds ratios for all risk factors identified in these studies. RESULTS: We identified 36 studies that investigated 19 risk factors for severe ALRI. Of these, 7 risk factors were significantly associated with severe ALRI in a consistent manner across studies, with the following meta-analysis estimates of odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals): low birth weight 3.18 (1.02-9.90), lack of exclusive breastfeeding 2.34 (1.42-3.88), crowding – more than 7 persons per household 1.96 (1.53-2.52), exposure to indoor air pollution 1.57 (1.06-2.31), incomplete immunization 1.83 (1.32-2.52), undernutrition – weight-for-age less than 2 standard deviations 4.47 (2.10-9.49), and HIV infection 4.15 (2.57-9.74). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the role of the above seven risk factors in the development of severe pneumonia in under-five children. In addition, it emphasizes the need for further studies investigating other potential risk factors. Since these risk factors are potentially preventable, health policies targeted at reducing their prevalence provide a basis for decreasing the burden of childhood pneumonia.","Jackson, Stewart; Mathews, Kyle H.; Pulanić, Dražen; Falconer, Rachel; Rudan, Igor; Campbell, Harry; Nair, Harish",Croat Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3641871/,185
2391,Blood metal ion levels are not a useful test for adverse reactions to metal debris: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2016-09-09,"OBJECTIVES: Alarm over the reported high failure rates for metal-on-metal (MoM) hip implants as well as their potential for locally aggressive Adverse Reactions to Metal Debris (ARMDs) has prompted government agencies, internationally, to recommend the monitoring of patients with MoM hip implants. Some have advised that a blood ion level >7 µg/L indicates potential for ARMDs. We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance of metal ion testing for ARMDs. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify articles from which it was possible to reconstruct a 2 × 2 table. Two readers independently reviewed all articles and extracted data using explicit criteria. We computed a summary receiver operating curve using a Bayesian random-effects hierarchical model. RESULTS: Our literature search returned 575 unique articles; only six met inclusion criteria defined a priori. The discriminative capacity of ion tests was homogeneous across studies but that there was substantial cut-point heterogeneity. Our best estimate of the “true” area under curve (AUC) for metal ion testing is 0.615, with a 95% credible interval of 0.480 to 0.735, thus we can state that the probability that metal ion testing is actually clinically useful with an AUC ≥ 0.75 is 1.7%. CONCLUSION: Metal ion levels are not useful as a screening test for identifying high risk patients because ion testing will either lead to a large burden of false positive patients, or otherwise marginally modify the pre-test probability. With the availability of more accurate non-invasive tests, we did not find any evidence for using blood ion levels to diagnose symptomatic patients. Cite this article: M. Pahuta, J. M. Smolders, J.

10726,Validation of RESP and PRESERVE score for ARDS patients with pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA),2020-05-02,"Contaminated hospital surfaces have been demonstrated to be an important environmental reservoir of microorganisms that can increase the risk of nosocomial infection in exposed patients. As a consequence, cleaning and disinfecting hospital environments play an important role among strategies for preventing healthcare-associated colonization and infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether adenosine triphosphate (ATP) presence, measured by bioluminescence methods, can predict microbiological contamination of hospital surfaces. The study was carried out between September and December 2012 at the University Hospital “P. Giaccone” of Palermo. A total of 193 randomly selected surfaces (tables, lockers, furnishings) were sampled and analyzed in order to assess ATP levels (expressed as relative light units or RLU) and aerobic colony count (ACC) or presence of S. aureus. ACC had median values of 1.85 cfu/cm(2) (interquartile range = 4.16) whereas ATP median was 44.6 RLU/cm(2) (interquartile range = 92.3). Overall, 85 (44.0%) surfaces exceeded the established microbial benchmark: 73 (37.8%) exceeded the 2.5 cfu/cm(2) ACC standard, 5 (2.6%) surfaces were positive for S. aureus and 7 (3.6%) showed both the presence of S. aureus and an ACC of more than 2.5 cfu/cm(2). ACC and bioluminescence showed significant differences in the different surface sites (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was found between ACC and RLU values (p-value < 0.001; R(2) = 0.29) and increasing RLU values were significantly associated with a higher risk of failing the benchmark (p < 0.001). Our data suggest that bioluminescence could help in measuring hygienic quality of hospital surfaces using a quick and sensitive test that can be an useful proxy of microbial contamination; however, further analysis will be necessary to assess the cost-efficacy of this methodology before requiring incorporation in hospital procedures.","Harper, Martin; Amodio, Emanuele; Cannova, Lucia; Villafrate, Maria Rosaria; Merendino, Anna Maria; Aprea, Luigi; Calamusa, Giuseppe",J Occup Environ Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7196686/,185
10842,Early signs of right ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction in acute severe respiratory failure: the importance of diastolic restrictive pattern,2019-11-25,"BACKGROUND: The role of site of infection in sepsis has been poorly characterized. Additionally, sepsis epidemiology has evolved. Early mortality has decreased, but many survivors now progress into chronic critical illness (CCI). This study sought to determine if there were significant differences in the host response and current epidemiology of surgical sepsis categorized by site of infection. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal study of surgical sepsis patients characterized by baseline predisposition, insult characteristics, serial biomarkers, hospital outcomes, and long-term outcomes. Patients were categorized into five anatomic sites of infection. RESULTS: The 316 study patients were predominantly Caucasian; half were male, with a mean age of 62 years, high comorbidity burden, and low 30-day mortality (10%). The primary sites were abdominal (44%), pulmonary (19%), skin/soft tissue (S/ST, 17%), genitourinary (GU, 12%), and vascular (7%). Most abdominal infections were present on admission and required source control. Comparatively, they had more prolonged proinflammation, immunosuppression, and persistent organ dysfunction. Their long-term outcome was poor with 37% CCI (defined as > 14 in ICU with organ dysfunction), 49% poor discharge dispositions, and 30% 1-year mortality. Most pulmonary infections were hospital-acquired pneumonia. They had similar protracted proinflammation and organ dysfunction, but immunosuppression normalized. Long-term outcomes are similarly poor (54% CCI, 47% poor disposition, 32% 1-year mortality). S/ST and GU infections occurred in younger patients with fewer comorbidities, less perturbed immune responses, and faster resolution of organ dysfunction. Comparatively, S/ST had better long-term outcomes (23% CCI, 39% poor disposition, 13% 1-year mortality) and GU had the best (10% CCI, 20% poor disposition, 10% 1-year mortality). Vascular sepsis patients were older males, with more comorbidities. Proinflammation was blunted with baseline immunosuppression and organ dysfunction that persisted. They had the worst long-term outcomes (38% CCI, 67% poor disposition, 57% 1-year mortality). CONCLUSION: There are notable differences in baseline predisposition, host responses, and clinical outcomes by site of infection in surgical sepsis. While previous studies have focused on differences in hospital mortality, this study provides unique insights into the host response and long-term outcomes associated with different sites of infection.","Stortz, Julie A.; Cox, Michael C.; Hawkins, Russell B.; Ghita, Gabriela L.; Brumback, Babette A.; Mohr, Alicia M.; Moldawer, Lyle L.; Efron, Philip A.; Brakenridge, Scott C.; Moore, Frederick A.",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206740/,185
11323,"Chest Trauma: Current Recommendations for Rib Fractures, Pneumothorax, and Other Injuries",2020-01-15,"This study was designed to investigate the effect of low-temperature laminar flow ward (LTLFW) on the Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia (MDR-ABP) in neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU) patients. We evaluated whether patients in a LTLFW had significantly improved clinical outcomes as compared to those in nonconstant-temperature NICU (room temperature). The association of temperature with the prevalence of ABP and A. baumannii isolates (ABI) found in NICU patients was specifically investigated. In vitro microbiological experiments were conducted to measure the proliferation, antibiotic sensitivity, and genomic profiles of A. baumannii (AB) that grew in variable temperatures. MDR-ABP patients in LTLFW had significantly improved outcomes than those in the room temperature NICU. In addition, the numbers of ABI were positively associated with mean ambient outdoor temperatures (P = 0.002), with the incidence of ABP and average numbers of ABI among NICU patients being substantially lower in the winter as compared to other seasons. However, there were no significant seasonal variations in the other strains of the top five bacteria. Consistent with these clinical observations, AB growing at 20°C and 25°C had significantly reduced viability and antibiotic resistance compared to those growing at 35°C. The expression of genes related to AB survival ability, drug resistance, and virulence also differed between AB growing at 20°C and those at 35°C. LTLFW is effective in promoting the recovery of MDR-ABP patients because low temperatures reduced the density and virulence of AB and enhanced the efficacy of antibiotics, likely at the genetic level.

12045,Awake Prone Positioning for Non-intubated Oxygen Dependent COVID-19 Pneumonia Patients,2020-07-16,"OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of earlier vs. later re-initiation of enteral feeds after necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). STUDY DESIGN: We reviewed the literature to assess timing of enteral feeding after NEC using fixed effects models. RESULTS: Three studies met inclusion criteria; no randomized trials. After removal of Bell’s Stage I infants, the earlier refeeding group (<5–7 or median 4 days) included 79 infants and later refeeding group (≥5–7 or median 10 days) included 119 infants. Pooled analysis revealed earlier re-initiation reduced the incidence in the composite outcome of recurrent NEC and/or post-NEC stricture (OR = 0.27; 95% Cl = 0.10–0.75; p = 0.012). Individually, NEC recurrence (pooled OR = 0.34; 95% Cl = 0.09–1.29; p = 0.112) or stricture (OR = 0.34; 95% Cl = 0.09–1.26; p = 1.06) did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: There was no increase in negative outcomes with earlier refeeding after NEC. Earlier initiation of enteral feeds resulted in a significantly lower risk for the combined outcome of recurrent NEC and/or post-NEC stricture.","Patel, Ekta U.; Wilson, Dulaney A.; Brennan, Emily A.; Lesher, Aaron P.; Ryan, Rita M.",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7368613/,185
12048,Earlier re-initiation of enteral feeding after necrotizing enterocolitis decreases recurrence or stricture: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-07-18,"In previous research, voltage-dependent anion channel protein 2 (VDAC2) and the receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1) in flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) were confirmed as functional receptors for lymphocystis disease virus (LCDV) entry; however, the underlying mechanism of VDAC2- and RACK1-mediated LCDV entry remains unclear. In this study, we elucidated the endocytosis pathway of LCDV entry into flounder gill (FG) cells by treatment with specific inhibitory agents, siRNAs, and co-localization analysis. LCDV entry was significantly inhibited by the disruption of caveolae-mediated endocytosis, dynamin, and microtubules, and the knockdown of caveoline-1 and dynamin expression, but was not inhibited by the disruption of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, micropinocytosis, or low-pH conditions. The disruption of caveolae-mediated and clathrin-mediated endocytosis was verified by the internalization of cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) and transferrin, respectively. Confocal immunofluorescence assay demonstrated that LCDV was co-localized with VDAC2 and RACK1, CTB was co-localized with VDAC2 and RACK1 and partially with LCDV, but transferrin was not co-localized with LCDV, VDAC2, or RACK1, indicating that LCDV utilized the same pathway as CTB, i.e., caveolae-mediated endocytosis. This was different from the pathway of transferrin, which used clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, caveolin-1 was co-localized with LCDV, VDAC2, and RACK1, suggesting that caveolin-1 was involved in LCDV entry. These results revealed for the first time that LCDV entered into FG cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis facilitated by VDAC2 and RACK1 receptors, relying on dynamin and microtubules in a pH-independent manner, which provided new insight into the molecular mechanisms of LCDV entry and potential for the development of antiviral agents, expanding our understanding of iridovirus infection.","Sheng, Xiuzhen; Zhong, Ying; Zeng, Jing; Tang, Xiaoqian; Xing, Jing; Chi, Heng; Zhan, Wenbin",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7370161/,185

13402,The impact of delayed treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria on progression to severe malaria: A systematic review and a pooled multicentre individual-patient meta-analysis,2020-10-19,"BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) self-testing may help improve test uptake among female sex workers. China has implemented many HIV self-testing programs among men who have sex with men, creating an opportunity for promotion among female sex workers. However, there is a limited literature on examining HIV self-testing among female sex workers. This study aimed to examine HIV self-testing experiences and its determinants among female sex workers in China. METHODS: A venue-based, cross-sectional study was conducted among Chinese female sex workers in 2019. Participants completed a survey including social-demographic characteristics, sexual behaviors, and HIV self-testing history, the distribution of which were analyzed using descriptive analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify associations with HIV self-testing. RESULTS: Among 1287 Chinese female sex workers, 1072 (83.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 81.2–85.3%) had ever tested for HIV, and 103 (8.0%, 95% CI 6.6–9.6%) had ever used HIV self-testing. More than half reported that the self-test was their first HIV test (59.2%, 61/103), around one-fifth reported HIV self-testing results influenced the price of sex (21.4%, 22/103). A minority of individuals reported ever experiencing pressure to undertake HIV self-testing (6.8%, 7/103). After adjusting for covariates, HIV self-testing was positively associated with receiving anal sex in the past month (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.2, 95% CI 1.4–3.5), using drugs before or during sex (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI 1.8–4.5), injecting drugs in the past 6 months (aOR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.2–6.0), being diagnosed with other sexually transmitted infections (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.5), tested for other sexually transmitted infections in the past six months (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.1–5.5), ever tested in the hospital (aOR = 3.4, 95% CI 2.0–5.6), and ever tested in the community (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.2–1.9). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HIV self-testing could expand overall HIV testing uptake, increase HIV testing frequency, reach sub-groups of high-risk female sex workers and has limited potential harms among female sex workers. HIV self-testing should be incorporated among Chinese female sex workers as a complement to facility-based HIV testing services.","Wang, Cheng; Wang, Ya-Jie; Tucker, Joseph D.; Xiong, Ming-Zhou; Fu, Hong-Yun; Smith, M.

16374,Angiotensinogen Gene Missense Polymorphisms (rs699 and rs4762): The Association of End-Stage Renal Failure Risk with Type 2 Diabetes and Hypertension in Egyptians,2021-02-25,"Since the 1970s, eight closely related serotypes of classical human astroviruses (HAstV) have been associated with gastrointestinal illness worldwide. In the late 2000s, three genetically unique human astrovirus clades, VA1-VA3, VA2-VA4, and MLB, were described. While the exact disease associated with these clades remains to be defined, VA1 has been associated with central nervous system infections. The discovery that VA1 could be grown in cell culture, supports exciting new studies aimed at understanding viral pathogenesis. Given the association of VA1 with often lethal CNS infections, we tested its susceptibility to the antimicrobial drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), which we showed could inhibit classical HAstV infections. Our studies demonstrate that NTZ inhibited VA1 replication in Caco2 cells even when added at 12 h post-infection, which is later than in HAstV-1 infection. These data led us to further probe VA1 replication kinetics and cellular responses to infection in Caco-2 cells in comparison to the well-studied HAstV-1 strain. Overall, our studies highlight that VA1 replicates more slowly than HAstV-1 and elicits significantly different cellular responses, including the inability to disrupt cellular junctions and barrier permeability.","Hargest, Virginia; Davis, Amy E.; Tan, Shaoyuan; Cortez, Valerie; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7997325/,185

Beneficial effects have also been shown during exercise, but this is restricted to rehabilitation programs. New portable NIV (pNIV) devices may now enable NIV application during walking at home. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In two randomized crossover trials, the impact of pNIV on dyspnea and endurance capacity was investigated in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Participants performed a standardized 6-min walking test, with and without pNIV, using a pre-set inspiratory/expiratory positive airway pressure of 18/8 cmH(2)O. The first study was performed in NIV-naïve patients (Study I), while the second study was performed in those already established on long-term NIV (Study II). RESULTS: 38 patients (66.9 ± 7.4 years, mean FEV(1): 30.3 ± 8%pred) and 23 patients (67.6 ± 8.7 years, mean FEV(1): 29.8 ± 10.4%pred) participated in Study I and II, respectively. In Study I, the mean difference in the Borg Dyspnea Scale (BDS, primary outcome) score following walking was 3.2 (IQR 2–4) without pNIV, compared to 2.6 (IQR 1–4) with pNIV (ΔBDS 0.65, P = 0.04), while walking distance increased from 311.8 m (95%CI 276.9–346.6 m) to 326.3 m (95%CI 291.5–361.2 m) (P = 0.044) when pNIV was used. Accordingly, in Study II, the mean difference in BDS was 4.4 (IQR 3–6) without pNIV, compared to 4.5 (IQR 3–6) with pNIV (ΔBDS 0.09, P = 0.54), while walking distance decreased from 291.5 m (95%CI 246.1–336.9 m) to 258.4 m (95%CI 213–303.8 m) (P ≤ 0.001). INTERPRETATION: The use of a pNIV device during walking can improve dyspnea and walking distance in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Patients who do not already receive long-term NIV therapy are more likely to benefit compared to those undergoing long-term NIV. Careful patient selection is mandatory.

Cells with more than two genomes can exist transiently, such as in developing germlines or embryos, or can be part of mature somatic tissues. Such nuclear collectives span multiple levels of organization, from mononuclear or binuclear polyploid cells to highly multinucleate structures known as syncytia.

We previously showed that treatment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infected mice with 5-OP-RU, a major antigen for MAIT cells, expands MAIT cells and enhances bacterial control. Here we treated M. tuberculosis infected rhesus macaques with 5-OP-RU intratracheally but found no clinical or microbiological benefit. In fact, after 5-OP-RU treatment MAIT cells did not expand, but rather upregulated PD-1 and lost the ability to produce multiple cytokines, a phenotype resembling T cell exhaustion. Furthermore, we show that vaccination of uninfected macaques with 5-OP-RU+CpG instillation into the lungs also drives MAIT cell dysfunction, and PD-1 blockade during vaccination partly prevents the loss of MAIT cell function without facilitating their expansion. Thus, in rhesus macaques MAIT cells are prone to the loss of effector functions rather than expansion after TCR stimulation in vivo, representing a significant barrier to therapeutically targeting these cells.","Sakai, Shunsuke; Lora, Nickiana E.; Kauffman, Keith D.; Dorosky, Danielle E.; Oh, Sangmi; Namasivayam, Sivaranjani; Gomez, Felipe; Fleegle, Joel D.; Arlehamn, Cecilia S.

18625,Effects of intraoperative lung-protective ventilation on clinical outcomes in patients with traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial,2021-06-28,"The high Romanian Cesarean delivery rates have led to an increase in a women's desire to achieve vaginal birth after Cesarean delivery (VBAC), but certain impediments make this process difficult. We retrospectively evaluated the VBAC cases in a tertiary maternity hospital from Romania, and assessed the Romanian women's opinion about VBAC using a questionnaire that was distributed to three specific Facebook groups. We evaluated 63 patients who achieved VBAC between January 2014 and August 2020. In addition, an online survey with 41 open and closed questions assessed the participants' opinion regarding VBAC in Romania. The results are summarized and discussed. The results revealed that VBAC rates were under 1%. The main observed complications that followed VBAC were postpartum hemorrhage (15.8%), and uterine atony (7.93%), while the most frequent types of lesions encountered after VBAC were cervical tear (12.6%), followed by labial fissure (9.5%) and vaginal tear (7.9%). The patient's confidence in the health care system is low, and many women decide to try TOLAC at home. In conclusion, VBAC is an important topic in the context of high Romanian Cesarean rates, and the decision factors must provide consistent strategies that promote this mode of delivery.","Carauleanu, Alexandru; Tanasa, Ingrid Andrada; Nemescu, Dragos; Haba, Raluca; Socolov, Demetra",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8237270/,185

For the second-generation Grubbs and Hoveyda catalysts (GII: RuCl(2)(H(2)IMes)(PCy(3))(=CHPh); HII: RuCl(2)(H(2)IMes)(=CHAr), Ar = C(6)H(4)-2-O(i)Pr), slow salt metathesis is shown to arise from the low lability of the ancillary PCy(3) or ether ligands, which retards access to the four-coordinate intermediate required for efficient halide exchange. To exploit the lability of the first-generation catalysts, the diiodide complex RuI(2)(PCy(3))(=CHAr) HI-I(2) was prepared by treating “Grubbs I” (RuCl(2)(PCy(3))(2)(=CHPh), GI) with NaI, H(2)C=CHAr (1a), and a phosphine-scavenging Merrifield iodide (MF-I) resin. Subsequent installation of H(2)IMes or cyclic (alkyl)(amino)carbene (CAAC) ligands afforded the second-generation iodide catalysts in good to excellent yields. Given the incompatibility of the nitro group with a free carbene, the iodo-Grela catalyst RuI(2)(H(2)IMes)(=CHAr′) (nG-I(2): Ar′ = C(6)H(3)-2-O(i)Pr-4-NO(2)) was instead accessed by sequential salt metathesis of GI with NaI, installation of H(2)IMes, and finally cross-metathesis with the nitrostyrenyl ether H(2)C=CHAr′ (1b), with MF-I as the phosphine scavenger. The bulky iodide ligands improve the selectivity for macrocyclization in ring-closing metathesis.","Blanco, Christian O.; Nascimento, Daniel L.; Fogg, Deryn E.",Organometallics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8289337/,185

TsGSCP has a functional C1 peptidase domain; C1 peptidase belongs to cathepsin B family. The TsGSCP gene cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 showed intensive immunogenicity. qPCR and Western blotting revealed that TsGSCP mRNA and protein were expressed at various T. spiralis stages, but their expression levels in intestinal infectious larvae (IIL) were clearly higher than those in muscle larvae (ML), adult worms (AWs) and new-born larvae (NBL). Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) analysis showed that TsGSCP was primarily located at the outer cuticle and the intrauterine embryos of this parasite. rTsGSCP showed the ability to specifically bind with IECs, and the binding site is within the IEC cytoplasm. rTsGSCP accelerated larval intrusion into host intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), whereas anti-rTsGSCP antibodies suppressed larval intrusion; the acceleration and suppression was induced by rTsGSCP and anti-rTsGSCP antibodies, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. When ML were transfected with TsGSCP-specific dsRNA, TsGSCP expression and enzymatic activity were reduced by 46.82 and 37.39%, respectively, and the capacity of the larvae to intrude into IECs was also obviously impeded. Intestinal AW burden and adult female length and fecundity were significantly decreased in the group of mice infected with dsRNA-transfected ML compared to the control dsRNA and PBS groups. The results showed that TsGSCP plays a principal role in gut intrusion, worm development and fecundity in the T. spiralis lifecycle and might be a candidate target for vaccine development against Trichinella intrusion and infection.","Hu, Yuan Yuan; Zhang, Ru; Yan, Shu Wei; Yue, Wen Wen; Zhang, Jia Hang; Liu, Ruo Dan; Long, Shao Rong; Cui, Jing; Wang, Zhong Quan",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8390047/,185

RARS results in infectious symptoms, antibiotic courses, sick leaves, and impaired quality of life. Theoretically, the ESS procedure, through improving the drainage of the paranasal sinuses, decreases the symptoms and enhances the quality of life of the RARS patients. Whether this is true has not been reported in a randomized trial yet. METHODS: We conduct a single-center, non-blinded, randomized, 6-month, parallel group superiority clinical study including 80 adult participants referred to surgical treatment for RARS. The participants will either have ESS or conservative medical treatment (control group). The primary outcome will be the difference between the mean disease-specific Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 (quality of life questionnaire) change scores (from baseline to 6 months) of ESS and control group. DISCUSSION: This study will add significant new information to the effect and harms of ESS procedure in the treatment of adults with RARS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.govNCT04241016.

The purpose of this research note is twofold: (1) to document how Canadian legislatures have changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) to assess the effect of these responses on legislatures’ ability to fulfill their core functions. Through an analysis of parliamentary records from all elected federal, provincial and territorial legislatures in Canada, we find that the role of parliaments as sites of citizen representation has suffered the most, whereas the scrutinizing and legislative functions of parliaments have tended to be preserved, albeit in a significantly truncated form. We argue that patterns in legislatures' varied responses to the pandemic reveal which aspects of parliamentary functioning these bodies de facto prioritize and which are at risk of being eroded.","Rayment, Erica; VandenBeukel, Jason",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256419/,185

However, a recent review of the literature on engineering education found that fewer than 1% of reviewed articles focused on issues of equity and broadening participation. For this reason, there are few frameworks to build on when designing for equitable engineering instruction in K-12 settings. Diversifying participation in engineering means that we need to not just bring learners into existing engineering practices, structures, and ways of knowing, but that we take a critical look at the field of engineering education and challenge researchers and educators to create learning opportunities that build on diverse ways of knowing about engineering and being engineers in the world, with a focus on relating course materials to learners’ everyday lives. In this paper, we leverage the diverse histories, epistemologies, and ways of knowing in engineering to outline the possibilities for learners to critically engage with engineering in K-12 settings and we ask the question, “How can we design learning environments to help students critically understand the intrinsic and systemic sociotechnical relationships between people, communities, and the built environment?” To answer this question, we propose an instructional framework for developing learners’ critical sociotechnical literacy, which is a place-based approach for critically engaging learners in understanding the impacts of engineering and technology on their own communities and everyday lives in order to restory these spaces for a more equitable and just future.","McGowan, Veronica Cassone; Bell, Philip",Sci Educ (Dordr),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7410977/,185

It has different scientific applications such as heat dissipation, dynamic sealing, damping, etc. Owing to the vast ferrofluid applications, the time-dependent squeezed flow of hybrid ferroliquids under the impact of non-linear radiation and mixed convection within two disks was explored for the first time in this analysis. Here, the cobalt and magnetite ferrofluids are considered and scattered in a 50%:50% mixture of water–EG (ethylene glycol). The similarity technique is used to reduce the leading PDEs into coupled non-linear ODEs. The transmuted equations together with recommended boundary restrictions are numerically solved via Matlab solver bvp4c. The opposing and assisting flows are considered. The impacts of an emerging parameter on fluid velocity and temperature field of hybrid ferroliquids are examined through the different graphical aids. The results showed that the opposite trend is scrutinized due to the magnetic influence on the temperature and velocity in the case of assisting and opposing flows. The velocity augments due to the volume fraction of nanoparticles in the assisting flow and declines in the opposing flow, while the opposite direction is noticed in the temperature field.","Nisar, Kottakkaran Sooppy; Khan, Umair; Zaib, A.; Khan, Ilyas; Baleanu, Dumitru",Front Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7538667/,185

Soon, however, studies aimed to further establish the efficacy of the vaccine in different populations discovered that the vaccine has a larger effect in reducing mortality rate than could be explained by its effect on tuberculosis alone, which sparked suggestions that the BCG vaccine could have effects on other unrelated or non-mycobacterial pathogens causing diseases in humans. These effects were termed heterologous, non-specific or off-target effects and have been shown to be due to both innate and adaptive immune system responses. Experiments carried out in a bid to further understand these effects led to many more discoveries about the applicability of the BCG vaccine for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of certain disease conditions. As we approach the second century since the discovery of the vaccine, we believe it is timely to review these interesting applications of the BCG vaccine, such as in the prevention of diabetes, atherosclerosis, and leukemia; the diagnosis of Kawasaki disease; and the treatment of multiple sclerosis, non-muscle invading bladder cancer, and stage III melanoma. Furthermore, complications associated with the administration of the BCG vaccine to certain groups of patients, including those with severe combined immunodeficiency and HIV, have been well described in literature, and we conclude by describing the mechanisms behind these complications and discuss their implications on vaccination strategies, especially in low-resource settings.","Adesanya, Oluwafolajimi A.; Uche-Orji, Christabel I.; Adedeji, Yeshua A.; Joshua, John I.; Adesola, Adeniyi A.; Chukwudike, Chibuike J.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7769055/,185

We conduct backcasting and nowcasting exercises, which demonstrate that our model fits very well the past and ongoing trends in international migration, and that historical trends were mostly governed by demographic changes. Then, we describe a set of migration projections for the 21st century. In line with the backcasts, our world migration prospects are mainly governed by socio-demographic changes. Using immigration restrictions or development policies to curb these pressures requires sealing borders or triggering unprecedented economic takeoffs in migrants’ countries of origin.

National (CoViD-19) Guidelines (NG) were issued by the Colleges of Surgeons for the management of surgical patients. AIM: To assess the impact of CoViD-19 in the management of patients with acute appendicitis (AA) and review patients’ characteristics and compliance with NG. METHOD: A single-centre retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on surgical admissions with suspected AA between March and May 2020. Main outcomes of interest were the pre-operative investigation, the type of operation and the negative appendicectomy rate (NAR) comparing to 2019. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were referred for suspected AA. Out of 39 patients who had surgery 21 (53.8%) were investigated with a CT and 13 (33%) with an ultrasound. There was a 31.6% reduction in appendicectomies compared to 2019. 30 patients (76.9%) had an open procedure vs 9 laparoscopic (23.1%) in alignment with the NG(2). Histology showed AA in 37 out of 39 of the cases. The NAR was 5.12 vs 12.2 for 2019. CONCLUSIONS: There was a 31.6% reduction in appendicectomies during CoViD-19. Most patients were investigated with a CT and underwent an open procedure.

Specifically, parental opioid and methamphetamine abuse have increased over the last decade, with associated increases of families reported to the child welfare system. The Families Actively Improving Relationships (FAIR) program was developed to address the complexities of these families. Evidence-based strategies to address the interrelated needs of parents—including substance abuse and mental health treatment, parent skills training, and supportive case management to improve access to ancillary needs—are integrated in an intensive community outpatient program. This study examined the clinical effectiveness of FAIR when delivered in a Medicaid billable outpatient clinic. Parents (n = 99) were randomized either to the immediate FAIR condition or to the Waitlist (WL) condition, using a dynamic wait-listed design, with all parents provided the opportunity to eventually receive FAIR. Outcomes show statistically and clinically significant reductions in parental opioid and methamphetamine use, mental health symptoms, and parenting risk, and improvements in stability in parents receiving FAIR. Providing services to families who require travel in excess of 20 miles for sessions has challenging implications for program costs under a Medicaid structure.

The proposed technique uses a simple finite-state predictive current control (FS-PCC). In this control method, the switching vector for the IGBT is selected to minimize the error between the reference value and the predicted value of the rotor current. Moreover, the discrete-time models of (DFIG) are needed to predict the future value of the rotor current for all possible voltage vectors generated by the rotor-side converter (RSC). Since the classic control methods in the literature use inner control loops and are based on pulse width modulation (PWM), this method does not require complex modulation stages and omits the current control loops, which reduces the control requirements. The main objective in a standalone DFIG system is to keep the stator voltage has constant in amplitude and frequency and equal to the reference value, regardless of the changes in rotor speed or load. The proposed control strategy was implemented through a 3 kW DFIG prototype platform-based dSPACE 1104 card. The simulation and experimental results show that the proposed FS-PCC offers excellent reference tracking with less total harmonic distortion (THD) in stator voltages and rotor currents.","Chabani, Mohammed Saci; Benchouia, M.

57914,Impact of air temperature on occurrence of bath-related cardiac arrest,2021-09-17,"Traditional pain assessment approaches ranging from self-reporting methods, to observational scales, rely on the ability of an individual to accurately assess and successfully report observed or experienced pain episodes. Automatic pain assessment tools are therefore more than desirable in cases where this specific ability is negatively affected by various psycho-physiological dispositions, as well as distinct physical traits such as in the case of professional athletes, who usually have a higher pain tolerance as regular individuals. Hence, several approaches have been proposed during the past decades for the implementation of an autonomous and effective pain assessment system. These approaches range from more conventional supervised and semi-supervised learning techniques applied on a set of carefully hand-designed feature representations, to deep neural networks applied on preprocessed signals. Some of the most prominent advantages of deep neural networks are the ability to automatically learn relevant features, as well as the inherent adaptability of trained deep neural networks to related inference tasks. Yet, some significant drawbacks such as requiring large amounts of data to train deep models and over-fitting remain. Both of these problems are especially relevant in pain intensity assessment, where labeled data is scarce and generalization is of utmost importance. In the following work we address these shortcomings by introducing several novel multi-modal deep learning approaches (characterized by specific supervised, as well as self-supervised learning techniques) for the assessment of pain intensity based on measurable bio-physiological data. While the proposed supervised deep learning approach is able to attain state-of-the-art inference performances, our self-supervised approach is able to significantly improve the data efficiency of the proposed architecture by automatically generating physiological data and simultaneously performing a fine-tuning of the architecture, which has been previously trained on a significantly smaller amount of data.","Thiam, Patrick; Hihn, Heinke; Braun, Daniel A.; Kestler, Hans A.; Schwenker, Friedhelm",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8440852/,185

However, YF47 is highly susceptible to rice blast (Magnaporthe oryzae), one of the most destructive rice diseases. In this study, we developed novel TPAP (tetra-primer ARMS-PCR) functional markers for the genes Pita, Pib, and Pid2, all of which afford broad-spectrum resistance to blast. A collection of 91 japonica rice germplasms with similar ecological characteristics to YF47 were screened, and Wuyunjing 27 (WYJ27) with Pita and Pib alleles and P135 with the Pid2 allele were identified. Furthermore, the corresponding positive Pita, Pib, and Pid2 alleles were transferred into YF47 using single, mutual, and backcrosses, together with molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) and anther culture technology. These genetic materials, carrying one, two, or three functional alleles, were generated within 3 years, and compared to YF47, they all showed improved resistance to naturally inoculated rice blast. Further improved lines (IL) 1 to 5 (all containing Pita, Pib, and Pid2 alleles) were evaluated for yield performance, and when no fungicide was applied, all lines except IL-4 showed increased traits compared with those of YF47. IL-5, renamed Yanjing 144 (YJ144), showed yield increases in the Liaoning province regional variety comparison test and superior appearance quality compared to YF47. Our work provides a molecular design strategy for pyramiding multiple beneficial genes to rapidly improve rice blast resistance, yield, and quality using multiple breeding strategies.

59572,The most appropriate conventional DMARD to combine with different advanced therapies in rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review with meta-analysis.,2020-03-26,"A comprehensive understanding of common diseases of backyard poultry flocks is important to providing poultry health information to flock owners, veterinarians, and animal health officials. We collected autopsy reports over a 3-y period (2015-2017) from diagnostic laboratories in 8 states in the United States; 2,509 reports were collected, involving autopsies of 2,687 birds. The primary cause of mortality was categorized as infectious, noninfectious, neoplasia or lymphoproliferative disease, or undetermined. Neoplasia or lymphoproliferative disease was the most common primary diagnosis and involved 42% of the total birds autopsied; 63% of these cases were diagnosed as Marek's disease or leukosis/sarcoma. Bacterial, parasitic, and viral organisms were commonly detected, involving 42%, 28%, and 7% of the birds autopsied, respectively, with 2 or more organisms detected in 69% of birds. Our findings demonstrate the importance of educating flock owners about disease prevention and biosecurity practices. The detection of zoonotic bacteria including paratyphoid salmonellae, Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Mycobacterium avium, and the detection of lead and other heavy metals, indicate public health risks to flock owners and consumers of backyard flock egg and meat products.","Cadmus, Kyran J; Mete, Aslı; Harris, Macallister; Anderson, Doug; Davison, Sherrill; Sato, Yuko; Helm, Julie; Boger, Lore; Odani, Jenee; Ficken, Martin D; Pabilonia, Kristy L","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638719848718; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31084344/,185
60106,Steroids in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"PURPOSE Ascent to high altitude increases right ventricular (RV) afterload and decreases myocardial energy supply. This study evaluates physiologic variables and comprehensive echocardiographic indices of RV and right atrial (RA) function following rapid ascent to high altitude. METHODS Fifty healthy volunteers actively ascended from 1130 to 4559 m in < 22 h. All participants underwent 2D echocardiography during baseline examination at low altitude (424 m) and at three study time-points (7, 20 and 44 h) after arrival at high altitude. In addition to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP), comprehensive 2D planimetric-, tissue Doppler- and speckle-tracking-derived strain indices of RA and RV function were obtained. RESULTS sPAP increased from baseline (24 ± 4 mmHg) to the first altitude examination (39 ± 8 mmHg, p < 0.001) and remained elevated during the following 44 h. Global RV function did not change. RA reservoir strain showed a trend towards increase from baseline (50.2 ± 12.1%) to the first altitude examination (53.8 ± 11.0%, p = 0.07) secondary to a significant increase of RA contraction strain (19.2 ± 6.4 vs. 25.4 ± 9.6%, p < 0.001). Volumetric RA data largely paralleled RA strain results and RA active emptying volume was increased throughout the 44 h stay at high altitude. CONCLUSION Active and rapid ascent of healthy individuals to 4559 m is associated with an increased contractile performance of the RA that compensates for the increased workload of the RV.","Sareban, Mahdi; Perz, Tabea; Macholz, Franziska; Reich, Bernhard; Schmidt, Peter; Fried, Sebastian; Mairbäurl, Heimo; Berger, Marc M; Niebauer, Josef",The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10554-020-01803-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152809/,185
60610,Relation of Baseline Hemoglobin Levels and Adverse Events in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes (from the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage strategY and Harmonizing Outcomes with RevasculariZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction Trials).,2017,"PURPOSE Acute care teams work in dynamic and complex environments and must adapt to changing circumstances. A team process that helps teams process information and adapt is in-action team reflection (TR), defined as concurrent collective reflection on group objectives, strategies, or processes during an ongoing care event. However, the health care field lacks a means for systematically observing and ultimately training in-action TR in acute care teams. To bridge this gap, the authors developed a theoretically and empirically informed framework, TuRBO (Team Reflection Behavioral Observation), for measuring in-action TR. METHOD In 2018 at ETH, Zurich, Switzerland, the authors developed a theoretical framework based on the literature and theory. They then conducted exploratory reviews of preexisting videos of acute care teams training simulated emergencies. The authors adapted observation codes using an iterative approach. Using the developed coding framework, they coded 23 video recordings of acute care teams and provided validity evidence from the 3 sources: content, internal structure (interrater reliability), and relations to other variables. RESULTS The final TuRBO framework consists of 3 general dimensions-seeking information, evaluating information, and planning-that are further specified in 7 subcodes. Interrater agreement of the coding was substantial (κ = 0.80). As hypothesized, the data showed a positive relationship between in-action TR and team performance. Also, physicians spent significantly more time on in-action TR than nurses. CONCLUSIONS The TuRBO framework for assessing in-action TR in acute care teams provides positive validity evidence of the data. TuRBO integrates different team communication and calibration processes under the overarching concept of in-action TR and provides descriptive behavioral markers. TuRBO taps into powerful cultural and normative components of patient safety. This tool can augment team training that allows all team members to serve as an important resource for flexible, resilient, and safer patient care.","Schmutz, Jan B; Lei, Zhike; Eppich, Walter J",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000004105; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33788785/,185
60670,Neurological manifestations in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-10-19,"Minimally invasive surgery has gained increasing acceptance over the last few years, which has expanded to pancreaticoduodenectomy. Laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy has been determined to be a feasible, safe, and effective procedure in an experienced surgeon's hands, but the adaptations to the clumsy instruments are needed. The improved dexterity of the Da Vinci robotic system provides a good opportunity to perform this challenging procedure in the minimally invasive context. The aim of this study was to share our preliminary experience of totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy. From April 2015 to August 2015, four patients were selected to undergo totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy in the Department of Pancreatic Surgery, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China. The demographic characteristics, perioperative details, and pathological results were retrospectively reviewed. One female and two male patients underwent totally robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy, while another male patient underwent robotic total pancreatectomy due to the severe atrophy of pancreatic body and tail. The mean age of the four patients was 56.8 years. The average operation time and intraoperative blood loss were 563 min and 228 mL, respectively. No one needed blood transfusion, conversion to open pancreaticoduodenectomy, or postoperative analgesia. The postoperative courses of these patients were uneventful. The mean postoperative hospital stay was 10 days. No one required to be readmitted, and there was no death within 30 days following the surgery. Final pathologic examinations revealed one malignant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and three benign lesions. Based on this initial study, robotic pancreaticoduodenectomy is safe and feasible, with acceptable oncological outcomes for highly selected patients in experienced surgeons' hands. However, concerns such as long-term outcomes, cost-effectiveness analysis, and learning curve analysis should be fully demonstrated before the popularization of this challenging procedure.","Wang, Mingjun; Cai, Yunqiang; Li, Yongbin; Peng, Bing",The Indian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12262-016-1555-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29581684/,185
60856,Medical regimens for abortion at 12 weeks and above: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020,"Response Gene to Complement 32 (RGC-32) is an important mediator of the TGF-β signaling pathway, and an increasing amount of evidence implicates this protein in regulating astrocyte biology. We showed recently that spinal cord astrocytes in mice lacking RGC-32 display an immature phenotype reminiscent of progenitors and radial glia, with an overall elongated morphology, increased proliferative capacity, and increased expression of progenitor markers when compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts that make them incapable of undergoing reactive changes during the acute phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, in order to decipher the molecular networks underlying RGC-32's ability to regulate astrocytic maturation and reactivity, we performed next-generation sequencing of RNA from WT and RGC-32 knockout (KO) neonatal mouse brain astrocytes, either unstimulated or stimulated with the pleiotropic cytokine TGF-β. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that RGC-32 is critical for the TGF-β-induced up-regulation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in brain development and tissue remodeling, such as axonal guidance molecules, transcription factors, extracellular matrix (ECM)-related proteins, and proteoglycans. Our next-generation sequencing of RNA analysis also demonstrated that a lack of RGC-32 results in a significant induction of WD repeat and FYVE domain-containing protein 1 (Wdfy1) and stanniocalcin-1 (Stc1). Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cords isolated from normal adult mice and mice with EAE at the peak of disease showed that RGC-32 is necessary for the in vivo expression of ephrin receptor type A7 in reactive astrocytes, and that the lack of RGC-32 results in a higher number of homeodomain-only protein homeobox (HOPX)+ and CD133+ radial glia cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that RGC-32 plays a major role in modulating the transcriptomic changes in astrocytes that ultimately lead to molecular programs involved in astrocytic differentiation and reactive changes during neuroinflammation.","Tatomir, Alexandru; Beltrand, Austin; Nguyen, Vinh; Courneya, Jean-Paul; Boodhoo, Dallas; Cudrici, Cornelia; Muresanu, Dafin F; Rus, Violeta; Badea, Tudor C; Rus, Horea",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.705308; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394104/,185

62346,Effect of remdesivir on mortality in patients with COVID-19: A meta-analysis of randomized control trials.,2020-10-29,"Sin Nombre virus (SNV) is a rodent-borne hantavirus that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) predominantly in North America. SNV infection of immunocompetent hamsters results in an asymptomatic infection; the only lethal disease model for a pathogenic hantavirus is Andes virus (ANDV) infection of Syrian hamsters. Efforts to create a lethal SNV disease model in hamsters by repeatedly passaging virus through the hamster have demonstrated increased dissemination of the virus but no signs of disease. In this study, we demonstrate that immunosuppression of hamsters through the administration of a combination of dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, followed by infection with SNV, results in a vascular leak syndrome that accurately mimics both HPS disease in humans and ANDV infection of hamsters. Immunosuppressed hamsters infected with SNV have a mean number of days to death of 13 and display clinical signs associated with HPS, including pulmonary edema. Viral antigen was widely detectable throughout the pulmonary endothelium. Histologic analysis of lung sections showed marked inflammation and edema within the alveolar septa of SNV-infected hamsters, results which are similar to what is exhibited by hamsters infected with ANDV. Importantly, SNV-specific neutralizing polyclonal antibody administered 5 days after SNV infection conferred significant protection against disease. This experiment not only demonstrated that the disease was caused by SNV, it also demonstrated the utility of this animal model for testing candidate medical countermeasures. This is the first report of lethal disease caused by SNV in an adult small-animal model.","Brocato, Rebecca L; Hammerbeck, Christopher D; Bell, Todd M; Wells, Jay B; Queen, Laurie A; Hooper, Jay W",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02906-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24198421/,185

With this study, we have evaluated the diagnostic properties of such a tracer, 68 Ga-DOTATOC, in patients with hormone-producing PitNETs before and after surgery. DESIGN /Methods This prospective case-control study presents preoperative positron emission tomography (PET) and histopathological data in 18 patients with somatotroph (n = 8), corticotroph (n = 7), and thyrotroph (n = 3) PitNETs. Patients were scanned pre- and postoperatively with 68 Ga-DOTATOC PET. For the postoperative part of the study, patients with gonadotroph tumors (n = 7) were also included. Fifteen pituitary healthy controls underwent the same protocol once. The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax ) was analyzed in manually outlined regions around the tumor in patients and around the pituitary gland in controls. Tumor specimens were collected during surgery in subjects for assessment of adenohypophyseal tumor cell type and the SSTR expression. RESULTS Thyrotroph tumors showed higher uptake (median SUVmax 41.1; IQR 37.4-60.0) and corticotroph tumors lower uptake (SUVmax 6.8; 2.6-9.3) than normal pituitary gland (SUVmax 13.8; 12.1-15.5). The uptake in somatotroph tumors (SUVmax 15.9; 11.6-19.7) was similar to the uptake in the pituitary gland. There was a strong correlation between SUVmax and SSTR2 expression (r = 0.75 (P < .01)). In the postoperative evaluation, PET was able to correlate tracer uptake with biochemical cure and non-cure in patients with an abnormal postoperative magnetic resonance image and a preoperative tumor uptake SUVmax >13.8. CONCLUSIONS 68 Ga-DOTATOC PET can be used to detect thyrotroph tumors in the pre- and postoperative imaging assessment. Corticotroph tumors had a significantly lower uptake compared to the pituitary gland but without a distinct increased tumor uptake the clinical postoperative value is limited.","Tjörnstrand, Axel; Casar-Borota, Olivera; Heurling, Kerstin; Schöll, Michael; Gjertsson, Peter; Ragnarsson, Oskar; Filipsson Nyström, Helena",Clinical endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cen.14425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484167/,185

RESULTS The databases CNKI, WanFang, VIP, and CBM were searched from inception until July 2018. Two appropriately-trained reviewers screened and extracted articles independently. The ARRIVE guidelines were used to assess the quality of the published reports of animal experiments. The compliance rate of every item was analyzed relative to their date of publication. A total of 4342 studies were included, of which 73.0% had been cited ≤5 times. Only 29.0% (1261/4342) were published in journals listed in the Chinese Science Citation Database. The results indicate that the compliance rate of approximately half of the sub-items (51.3%, 20/39) was less than 50%, of which 65.0% (13/20) was even less than 10%. CONCLUSIONS The reporting quality of animal experiments in Chinese journals is not at a high level. Following publication of the ARRIVE guidelines in 2010, the compliance rate of the majority of its requirements has improved to some extent. However, less attention has been paid to the ethics and welfare of experimental animals, and a number of specific items in the Methods, Results, and Discussion sections continue to not be reported in sufficient detail. Therefore, it is necessary to popularize the ARRIVE guidelines, advocate researchers to adhere to them in the future, and in particular promote the use of the guidelines in specialized journals in order that the design, implementation, and reporting of animal experiments is promoted, to ultimately improve their quality.","Zhao, Bing; Jiang, Yanbiao; Zhang, Ting; Shang, Zhizhong; Zhang, Weiyi; Hu, Kaiyan; Chen, Fei; Mei, Fan; Gao, Qianqian; Zhao, Li; Kwong, Joey S W; Ma, Bin",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-020-02664-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243206/,185

67798,Meta-analysis and systematic review of risk factors for shunt dependency after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.,2017,"INTRODUCTION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a moderate risk of hemorrhagic complications (HC). There is a debate regarding the relationship between HC and high blood pressure in postoperative period. AIM The aim is to clarify whether the postoperative blood pressure is an independent risk factor for hemorrhagic complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. METHODS Medical records of 522 patients were reviewed. A case-control study of postoperative blood pressure was undertaken in patients with bleeding after LSG and matched controls. Patients who required surgical revision, due to the hemorrhagic complications within 72 hours, were identified as the cases. Controls were matched (1:1) with cases by age (±1 year), gender (female versus male), staple line reinforcement (running suture versus haemostatic clips) and surgeon's experience (>50 or <50 LSG procedures per year). 12-hour postoperative blood pressure was recorded. RESULTS 17 patients after LSG with HC in postoperative period were matched with 17 controls. Patients who experienced hemorrhagic complications after LSG had non statistically significant decreased mean systolic blood pressure (mmHg) in 12 hours observation (130.7 ± 12.9 versus 139.1 ± 10.8); p = 0.15; mean difference - 11.6 (95% CI -29.5 - 6.1). Mean 12 hour diastolic pressure was also comparable. The detailed analysis of controls revealed a significantly higher systolic blood pressure measurements in 5th and 11th hour postoperatively, as well as higher diastolic blood pressure in 12th hour postoperatively. However, the differences were not clinically significant. CONCLUSION Compared with closely matched control subjects, patients with HC after LSG have decreased systolic blood pressure without clinical significance.","Janik, Michał Robert; Rogula, Tomasz; Kowalewski, Piotr; Walędziak, Maciej; Matłok, Maciej; Brągoszewski, Jakub; Kwiatkowski, Andrzej; Paśnik, Krzysztof",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-017-2569-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28138899/,185
68410,PAD is no longer related to Rodney: the benefit of statins.,2014,"This paper explores how poor health outcomes in the HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics in the United States are undergirded by iatrogenesis. Data are drawn from two projects in Southern California: one among men who have sex with men (MSM) engaging with pre-exposure prophylaxis to HIV (PrEP) and the other in a public hospital system encountering patients with chronic pain and opioid use disorder (OUD). Ethnographic evidence demonstrates how efforts to minimize risk via PrEP and opioid prescription regulation paradoxically generate new forms of risk. Biomedical risk management paradigms engaged across the paper's two ethnographic field sites hinge on the production and governance of deserving patienthood, which is defined by providers and experienced by patients through moral judgments about risk underlying both increased surveillance and abandonment. This paper argues that the logic of deservingness disconnects clinical evaluations of risk from patients' lived, intersectional experiences of race, class, gender, and sexuality. This paper's analysis thus re-locates patients in the context of broader historical and sociopolitical trajectories to highlight how notions of clinical risk designed to protect patients can in fact imperil them. Misalignment between official, clinical constructions of risk and the embodied experience of risk borne by patients produces iatrogenesis.","Textor, Lauren; Schlesinger, William",Anthropology & medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/13648470.2021.1926916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34190020/,185
68781,"Clinical Features of COVID-19 in Newborns, Infants, and Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",2021-06-14,"Zoonotic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) likely evolved to infect humans by a series of transmission events between humans and animals in markets in China. Virus sequence data suggest that the palm civet served as an amplification host in which civet and human interaction fostered the evolution of the epidemic SARS Urbani strain. The prototypic civet strain of SARS-CoV, SZ16, was isolated from a palm civet but has not been successfully cultured in vitro. To propagate a chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV bearing an SZ16 spike (S) glycoprotein (icSZ16-S), we constructed cell lines expressing the civet ortholog (DBT-cACE2) of the SARS-CoV receptor (hACE2). Zoonotic SARS-CoV was completely dependent on ACE2 for entry. Urbani grew with similar kinetics in both the DBT-cACE2 and the DBT-hACE2 cells, while icSZ16-S only grew in DBT-cACE2 cells. The SZ16-S mutant viruses adapted to human airway epithelial cells and displayed enhanced affinity for hACE2 but exhibited severe growth defects in the DBT-cACE2 cells, suggesting that the evolutionary pathway that promoted efficient hACE2 interactions simultaneously abolished efficient cACE2 interactions. Structural modeling predicted two distinct biochemical interaction networks by which zoonotic receptor binding domain architecture can productively engage hACE2, but only the Urbani mutational repertoire promoted efficient usage of both hACE2 and cACE2 binding interfaces. Since dual species tropism was preserved in Urbani, it is likely that the virus evolved a high affinity for cACE2/hACE2 receptors through adaptation via repeated passages between human and civet hosts. Furthermore, zoonotic SARS-CoV was variably neutralized by antibodies that were effective against the epidemic strain, highlighting their utility for evaluating passive immunization efficacy.","Sheahan, Timothy; Rockx, Barry; Donaldson, Eric; Corti, Davide; Baric, Ralph",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00818-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18579604/,185
69273,Prewarming neurosurgical patients to minimize hypotension on induction of anesthesia: a randomized trial.,2016,"BACKGROUND The Minnesota Hospital Association (MHA) recognized the impact that burnout and disengagement had on the clinician population. A clinician task force developed a conceptual framework, followed by annual surveys and a series of interventions. Features of the job demands-resources model were used as the conceptual underpinning to this analysis. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to assess the applicability of a clinician-driven conceptual model in understanding burnout and work engagement in the state of Minnesota. METHODOLOGY Four thousand nine hundred ninety clinicians from 94 MHA member hospitals/systems responded to a 2018 survey using a brief instrument adapted, in part, from previously validated measures. RESULTS As hypothesized, job demands were strongly related to burnout, whereas resources were most related to work engagement. Variables from the MHA model explained 40% of variability in burnout and 24% of variability in work engagement. Variables related to burnout with the highest beta weights included having sufficient time for work (-0.266), values alignment with leaders (-0.176), and teamwork efficiency (-0.123), all ps < .001. Variables most associated with engagement included values alignment (0.196), feeling appreciated (0.163), and autonomy (0.093), ps < .001. CONCLUSION Findings support the basic premises of the proposed conceptual model. Remediable work-life conditions, such as having sufficient time to do the job, values alignment with leadership, teamwork efficiency, feeling appreciated, and clinician autonomy, manifested the strongest associations with burnout and work engagement. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS Interventions reducing job demands and strengthening resources such as values alignment, teamwork efficiency, and clinician autonomy are seen as having the greatest potential efficacy.","Koranne, Rahul; Williams, Eric S; Poplau, Sara; Banks, Kathryn M; Sonneborn, Mark; Britt, Heather R; Linzer, Mark",Health care management review,https://doi.org/10.1097/hmr.0000000000000298; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33298803/,185
69322,Hospital Inpatient Admissions With Dehydration and/or Malnutrition in Medicare Beneficiaries Receiving Enteral Nutrition: A Cohort Study.,2018,"INTRODUCTION Administration of ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener levcromakalim triggers headache in healthy volunteers and migraine attacks in migraine patients. Here, we investigated the effect of ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker glibenclamide on levcromakalim-induced headache in healthy volunteers. METHODS In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study, 15 healthy volunteers aged 18-40 years were randomly allocated to receive glibenclamide and levcromakalim (day 1), glibenclamide and placebo (day 2), and placebo and placebo (day 3) on three different days separated by at least 1 week. The primary endpoints were the difference in incidence of headache and the difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores (0-12 hours) between the days. RESULTS Fifteen healthy volunteers completed the 3 days of the study. More participants (12/15, 80%) developed headache on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (5/15, 33%) (p = 0.01; mean difference 47%; 95% confidence interval 18-75%) and compared to the placebo-placebo day (1/15, 7%) (p = 0.001; mean difference 73%; 95% confidence interval 48-99%). We found no difference in headache incidence between glibenclamide-placebo day and placebo-placebo day (p = 0.12; mean difference 27%; 95% confidence interval 1.3-52%). The area under the curve for headache intensity was significantly larger on the glibenclamide-levcromakalim day compared to the glibenclamide-placebo day (p = 0.003); and compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.001). We found no difference in the area under the curve between the glibenclamide-placebo day compared to the placebo-placebo day (p = 0.07). The median time to onset for headache after levcromakalim infusion with glibenclamide pretreatment was delayed (180 min) compared to levcromakalim without pretreatment (30 min) from a previously published study. CONCLUSION Glibenclamide administration did not cause headache, and glibenclamide pretreatment did not prevent levcromakalim-induced headache. However, glibenclamide delayed the onset of levcromakalim-induced headache. More selective blockers are needed to further elucidate the role of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel in headache initiation.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03886922.","Al-Karagholi, Mohammad Al-Mahdi; Ghanizada, Hashmat; Kokoti, Lili; Paulsen, Joachim S; Hansen, Jakob Møller; Ashina, Messoud",Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache,https://doi.org/10.1177/0333102420949863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806954/,185

Aim To evaluate the SADI-S procedure with regard to weight loss, comorbidity resolution, and complication rate in the super obese population. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed on initial 72 patients who underwent laparoscopic or robot-assisted laparoscopic SADI-S between December 17th, 2013 and July 29th, 2015. Results A total of 48 female and 21 male patients were included with a mean age of 42.4±10.0 years (range, 22-67). The mean body mass index (BMI) at the time of procedure was 58.4±8.3 kg/m2 (range, 42.3-91.8). Mean length of hospital stay was 4.3±2.6 days (range, 3-24). Thirty-day readmission rate was 4.3% (n=3), due to tachycardia (n=1), deep venous thrombosis (n=1), and viral gastroenteritis (n=1). Thirty-day reoperation rate was 5.8% (n=4) for perforation of the small bowel (n=1), leakage (n=1), duodenal stump leakage (n=1), and diagnostic laparoscopy (n=1). Percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) was 28.5±8.8 % (range, 13.3-45.0) at three months (n=28), 41.7±11.1 % (range, 19.6-69.6) at six months (n=50), and 61.6±12.0 % (range, 40.1-91.2) at 12 months (n=23) after the procedure. A total of 18 patients (26.1%) presented with type II diabetes mellitus at the time of surgery. Of these patients, 9 (50.0%) had their diabetes resolved, and six (33.3%) had it improved by 6-12 months after SADI-S.

Although ITDSs are fairly accurate in detecting fever in adults, there is little information about their utility in children. METHODS In a pediatric emergency department, we compared temperatures of children (<18 years old) measured using 3 ITDSs (OptoTherm Thermoscreen, FLIR ThermoVision 360, and Thermofocus 0800H3) to standard, age-appropriate temperature measurements (confirmed fever defined as ≥38.0°C [oral or rectal], ≥37.0°C [axillary]). Measured temperatures were compared with parental reports of fever using descriptive, multivariate, and receiver operating characteristic analyses. RESULTS Of 855 patients, 400 (46.8%) had parent-reported fever, and 306 (35.8%) had confirmed fever. At optimal fever thresholds, OptoTherm and FLIR had sensitivity (83.0% and 83.7%, respectively) approximately equal to parental report (83.9%) and greater than Thermofocus (76.8%), and specificity (86.3% and 85.7%) greater than parental report (70.8%) and Thermofocus (79.4%). Correlation coefficients between traditional thermometry and ITDSs were 0.78 (OptoTherm), 0.75 (FLIR), and 0.66 (Thermofocus). CONCLUSIONS Compared with traditional thermometry, FLIR and OptoTherm were reasonably accurate in detecting fever in children and better predictors of fever than parental report. These findings suggest that ITDSs could be a useful noninvasive screening tool for fever in the pediatric age group.","Selent, Monica U; Molinari, Noelleangelique M; Baxter, Amy; Nguyen, An V; Siegelson, Henry; Brown, Clive M; Plummer, Andrew; Higgins, Andrew; Podolsky, Susan; Spandorfer, Philip; Cohen, Nicole J; Fishbein, Daniel B",Pediatric emergency care,https://doi.org/10.1097/pec.0b013e3182854465; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23426254/,185

OBJECTIVES Using camelid specimens and commercial quality control materials (QCM), we investigatee EPOC analytical performance and establish EPOC camelid reference intervals (RIs). METHODS Camelid blood (n = 124) was analyzed using the EPOC (pH, pCO2 , pO2 , HCO3 , base excess, SO2 , sodium, potassium, chloride, ionized calcium, TCO2 , anion gap, HCT, HGB, glucose, lactate, and creatinine); plasma was analyzed using a Roche Cobas c501 (sodium, potassium, chloride, TCO2 , anion gap, glucose, and creatinine). Method comparison data were assessed using Pearson's correlation, Passing-Bablok regression, and Bland-Altman plots. EPOC precision was evaluated using QCM and camelid blood. RESULTS For all measurands except anion gap, the EPOC vs Cobas instrument correlation was r > .85. Except for pO2 and pCO2 , EPOC precision (QCM and blood) ranged from a repeatability CV <1%-6.3%. Mild constant bias for chloride, glucose, TCO2 , anion gap, and creatinine, and mild proportional bias for chloride, glucose, and anion gap were present. The total error (QCM data) for the EPOC instrument was below the ASVCP-recommended allowable total error. Alpacas had higher potassium and lactate, while llamas had higher creatinine, sodium, chloride, ionized calcium, pO2 , and SO2 . Statistical RIs based on alpaca (n = 74-96) and llama data (n = 12-17) are reported descriptively. CONCLUSIONS The EPOC analyzer shows good performance with camelid blood.

74345,Effects of dexmedetomidine vs sufentanil during percutaneous tracheostomy for traumatic brain injury patients: A prospective randomized controlled trial.,2019,"THE ISSUE Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives. Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a global pandemic by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. RECOMMENDATIONS The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

METHODS This was an experimental study on healthy human volunteers (n=8 eyes). In an experimental set up, NCT was performed on eyes (n=8) of human volunteers under normal setting, with a single and 2 drops of lubricant. High speed shadowgraphy, frontal lighting technique and fluorescein analysis were used to detect the possible generation of any droplets and aerosols. Mathematical computation of the spread of the droplets was then performed. RESULTS In natural setting, there was no droplet or aerosol production. Minimal splatter along with droplet ejection was observed when 1 drop of lubricant was used prior to NCT. When 2 drops of lubricant were instilled, we noted significant amount of fluid ejection in the form a sheet which broke up into multiple droplets. Some these droplets traversed back to the tonometer. Droplets ranging from 100 to 500▒µm in diameter were measured. CONCLUSIONS There was no droplet generation during NCT performed in natural setting. However, NCT should be avoided in conditions with high tear volume (natural or artificial) as it would lead to droplet spread and tactile contamination.","Shetty, Rohit; Balakrishnan, Nikhil; Shroff, Sujani; Shetty, Naren; Kabi, Prasenjit; Roy, Durbar; Joseph, Sophia Marie; Khamar, Pooja; Basu, Saptarshi; Roy, Abhijit Sinha",Journal of glaucoma,https://doi.org/10.1097/ijg.0000000000001672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32947358/,185
74884,"Intraoperative awareness risk, anesthetic sensitivity, and anesthetic management for patients with natural red hair: a matched cohort study.",2015,"INTRODUCTION Pregnancy in sickle cell disease is fraught with many complications including pre-eclampsia (PE) and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Previously, we found an abnormality in prostacyclin-thromboxane ratio in sickle cell pregnant women, a situation that is also found in non-sickle pregnancies with PE and unexplained IUGR. Low-dose aspirin (LDA) has been shown to reduce the incidence of PE and IUGR in high-risk women by reducing the vasoconstrictor thromboxane while sparing prostacyclin, in effect 'correcting' the ratio. It has been found to be safe for use in pregnancy but has not been tested in sickle cell pregnancy. We hypothesise that LDA will reduce the incidence of IUGR and PE in pregnant haemoglobin SS (HbSS) and haemoglobin SC (HbSC) women. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This is a multisite, double blind, randomised controlled trial, comparing a daily dose of 100 mg aspirin to placebo, from 12 to 16 weeks' gestation until 36 weeks, in Lagos state, Nigeria. Four hundred and seventy-six eligible pregnant HbSS and HbSC women will be recruited consecutively, randomly assigned to either group and followed from recruitment until delivery. The primary outcome will be the incidence of birth weight below 10th centile for gestational age on INTERGROWTH 21 birth weight charts, or incidence of miscarriage or perinatal death. Secondary outcomes will include PE, maternal death, preterm delivery, perinatal death, number of crises, need for blood transfusion and complications such as infections and placental abruption. Analysis will be by intention to treat and the main treatment effects will be quantified by relative risk with 95% CI, at a 5% significance level. ETHICAL APPROVAL Ethical approval has been granted by the Health Research and Ethics committees of the recruiting hospitals and the National Health Research and Ethics Committee.

Infection by CHIKV is often characterized by long-lasting, incapacitating arthritis, and some fatal cases have been described among elderly and newborns. Currently, there is no available vaccine or specific treatment against CHIKV. Blood B cells from a donor with history of CHIKV infection were activated, immortalized, amplified, and cloned. Two human mAbs against CHIKV, 5F10 and 8B10, were identified, sequenced, and expressed in recombinant form for characterization. In a plaque reduction neutralization test, 5F10 and 8B10 show mean IC(50) of 72 and 46 ng/ml, respectively. Moreover, both mAbs lead to a strong decrease in extracellular spreading of infectious viral particles from infected to uninfected cells. Importantly, the mAbs neutralize different CHIKV isolates from Singapore, Africa, and Indonesia, as well as O'nyong-nyong virus, but do not recognize other alphaviruses tested. Both mAbs are specific for the CHIKV envelope: 5F10 binds to the E2 glycoprotein ectodomain and 8B10 to E1 and/or E2. In conclusion, these two unique human mAbs strongly, broadly, and specifically neutralize CHIKV infection in vitro and might become possible therapeutic tools against CHIKV infection, especially in individuals at risk for severe disease. Importantly, these mAbs will also represent precious tools for future studies on host-pathogen interactions and the rational design of vaccines against CHIKV.","Warter, Lucile; Lee, Chia Yin; Thiagarajan, Rekha; Grandadam, Marc; Lebecque, Serge; Lin, Raymond T P; Bertin-Maghit, Sebastien; Ng, Lisa F P; Abastado, Jean-Pierre; Desprès, Philippe; Wang, Cheng-I; Nardin, Alessandra",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1003139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21278338/,185
75582,Dietary intake of anthocyanins and risk of cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.,2018,"Objectives Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) increases morbidity, hospital stay and healthcare expenditure. This study aims to determine the perioperative factors correlating with POAF as well as to evaluate both treatment strategies and AF persistence beyond discharge. Methods The records of all patients undergoing anatomical lung resection over a 1-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Patients with a history of arrhythmia were excluded. POAF was defined by clinical diagnosis and electrocardiography. Pre- and postoperative demographic and clinical data were collected, and uni- and multivariable regression were performed to determine the factors associated with POAF. Results POAF occurred in 11.4% (43/377) of patients with a mean of 3.55 days postoperatively and significantly increased hospital stay (6.78 ± 4.42 vs 10.8 ± 5.8 days (P = 0.0014)). No correlation was found with gender, hypertension, ischaemic heart disease, beta-blocker use, alcohol consumption or thyroid dysfunction. However, older age (P = 0.001) and postoperative infection (P < 0.0001; χ2 = 26.03) were found to be significant uni- and multivariable predictors of POAF. Open surgery rather than video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) (open 26/189 (13.8%); VATS 17/188 (9.0%); P = 0.150) demonstrated a tendency towards increased postoperative AF; however, this was not statistically significant. Four (9.3%) patients remained in AF on discharge, and three required long-term anticoagulation. Three (7%) patients were found to have ongoing AF at 1-month follow-up. Conclusions Increasing age and postoperative infection are most strongly associated with POAF. Adoption of enhanced recovery protocols, along with more rigorous monitoring and early treatment of postoperative infection may help reduce POAF and its associated morbidity. Rhythm assessment is crucial to identify persistent AF after discharge, and clinicians should be vigilant for recurrence of AF at follow-up.","Garner, Megan; Routledge, Tom; King, Juliet E; Pilling, John E; Veres, Lukacs; Harrison-Phipps, Karen; Bille, Andrea; Harling, Leanne",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivw348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27803121/,185
76269,Risk factors for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo recurrence: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-08-24,"Given the chronic stress that families experienced during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic accompanied by school closures, many parents were vulnerable to parental burnout as they supervised their children's remote learning in addition to other roles. According to self-determination theory (SDT), when parents' basic needs are met, they are optimally motivated to support their children's learning and create environments that support their children's needs. Using a variable- and person-centered approach, we explored associations between parents' burnout, academic concern, motivational styles and profiles, and need-supportive behavior. Considering the pandemic, we expected parents with increased burnout and academic concern to report higher levels of controlled motivation or belong to a low-quality motivation profile and report less support for their children's needs. Parents with 5- to 8-year-olds were recruited, targeting states in the U.S. with the longest shelter-in-place restrictions (CA, NY), to complete an online survey, resulting in a sample (N = 218) of parents from 38 states in the U.S. Results showed parents exhibiting more autonomous motivation and two latent profiles denoting only motivation quantity but not quality. Higher burnout was related to nonoptimal motivation styles and profiles, while academic concern was related to increased motivation. Parents of older children had increased motivation. Findings highlight that even during a global pandemic, parents showed some levels of optimal motivation to support their children's remote learning. Results also highlight the importance of meeting parents' basic needs in order for them to support the developmental and learning needs of their children.

Of even greater concern is the association of the adiposity with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiopulmonary failure, asthma, pseudotumor cerebri, infertility, and crippling arthritis. OBJECTIVE Diets, exercise, behavioral modification, and drugs are not effective in these individuals. This article examines the effect of surgery on the control of the weight and the comorbidities, as well as the safety of these operations. INTERVENTIONS Although the article focuses on the outcomes of the three most commonly performed operations, i.e. adjustable gastric banding, the gastric bypass, and the biliopancreatic bypass with duodenal switch, it aims for perspective with the inclusion of abandoned and current investigational procedures, a review of the complications, and an emphasis on the appropriate selection of patients. POSITIONS: Ample evidence, including controlled randomized studies, now document that bariatric surgery produces durable weight loss exceeding 100 lb (46 kg), full and long-term remission of type 2 diabetes in over 80% with salutary effects on the other comorbidities as well with significant reductions in all-cause mortality. Although the severely obese present with serious surgical risks, bariatric surgery is performed safely with a 0.35% 90-d mortality in Centers of Excellence throughout the United States-similar to the complication rates after cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS Until better approaches become available, bariatric surgery is the therapy of choice for patients with severe obesity.","Pories, Walter J",The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1210/jc.2008-1641; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18987275/,185

Previous authors have commented on the use of flow-diverting stents for treatment of aneurysms of the V3 segment of the vertebral artery. CASE DESCRIPTION Here, we report a case in which injury occurred at the V2 segment of the vertebral artery with the development of a pseudoaneurysm, which was found on angiography. After decompressing the spinal cord from an epidural hematoma, the pseudoaneurysm was treated by deploying two Pipeline flow-diverting stents (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). Obliteration of the pseudoaneurysm was noted on follow-up angiography 4 days after the treatment.

Librarians utilized train-the-trainer sessions, detailed documentation toolkits, and a robust outreach plan to ensure success. After initial implementation of this new model, librarians observed above average use of the service and excellent user feedback.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an open debate on the impact of biologic drugs used in the treatment of psoriasis. In order to define whether patients under treatment with biologics suffer from increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19, compared to psoriatic patients treated only with topical drugs, we designed an observational, monocentric prevalence study recording the personal and clinical data of psoriatic patients, with focus on the presentation of signs and symptoms related to COVID-19 in the period of time going from 1.1.2020 to 31.5.2020. A total of 180 patients were enrolled in two groups: 100 patients in the topical therapy group, and 80 patients in the biologic therapy group. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups regarding the prevalence of COVID-19 infection and symptoms at a bivariable analysis with adjustment for confounders. In conclusion, psoriatic patients under treatment with biologics don't seem to be more susceptible to COVID-19 compared to other psoriatic patients and we suggest not interrupting treatment with biologic drugs, even in areas suffering from active outbreaks of the disease.

The established measure of these foundations-the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ)-has been used extensively in a range of empirical projects. However, recent analyses of its factor structure and the internal consistency of each of the foundation clusters have called its validity into question. In this paper, data from a large sample of British voters were used to re-examine the factor structure of the MFQ. As opposed to a 6-factor structure, only three meaningful clusters emerged in an exploratory principal factors analysis (Study 1; N = 428): traditionalism, compassion, and liberty. This structure was broadly confirmed in an independent sample (Study 2; N = 322). Concurrent validity was established via correlations with measures of 'social change' and 'systemic inequality' insecurities (Study 1) and voting behaviour and preferences (Study 2). Significant differences on each of the three factors of the revised MFQ (MFQ-r) were observed between the voters of different political parties (Study 1) and sides of the Brexit issue (Study 2). Implications for moral foundations theory and its measurement are discussed.","Harper, Craig A; Rhodes, Darren",The British journal of social psychology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12452; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33594721/,185
78084,Association of suicide with short-term exposure to air pollution at different lag times: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE Acute vertebrobasilar artery occlusion (AVBAO) is a devastating disease with a high mortality rate. One of the most important factors affecting favorable clinical outcome is early recanalization. Mechanical thrombectomy is an emerging treatment strategy for achieving a high recanalization rates. However, thrombectomy alone can be insufficient to complete recanalization, especially for acute stroke involving large artery atheromatous disease. The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of mechanical thrombectomy in AVBAO. METHODS Fourteen consecutive patients with AVBAO were treated with mechanical thrombectomy. Additional multimodal treatments were intra-arterial (IA) thrombolysis, balloon angioplasty, or permanent stent placement. Recanalization by thrombectomy alone and multimodal treatments were assessed by the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (TICI) score. Clinical outcome was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at 7 days and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. RESULTS Thrombectomy alone and multimodal treatments were performed in 10 patients (71.4%) and 4 patients (28.6%), respectively. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b-3) was achieved in 11 (78.6%). Among these 11 patients, 3 (27.3%) underwent multimodal treatment due to underlying atherosclerotic stenosis. Ten (71.4%) of the 14 showed NIHSS score improvement of >10. Overall mortality was 3 (21.4%) of 14. CONCLUSION We suggest that mechanical thrombectomy is safe and effective for improving recanalization rates in AVBAO, with low complication rates. Also, in carefully selected patients after the failure of recanalization by thrombectomy alone, additional multimodal treatment such as IA thrombolysis, balloons, or stents can be needed to achieve successful recanalization.","Kim, Seong Mook; Sohn, Sung-Il; Hong, Jeong-Ho; Chang, Hyuk-Won; Lee, Chang-Young; Kim, Chang-Hyun",Journal of Korean Neurosurgical Society,https://doi.org/10.3340/jkns.2015.58.5.419; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26713141/,185

Primary quantitative data (e.g., questionnaires with the ACS) and secondary data (e.g., HDI, homicide, illiteracy, Bolsa Família [PBF] coverage and Family Health Strategy [ESF] coverage) were used. There was a relationship between COVID-19 and indicators of social vulnerability, where cases had a negative relationship with HDI and illiteracy; and deaths had a positive relationship with the homicide rate and PBF coverage. Regions with high death rates due to COVID-19 and social vulnerability have greater FHS coverage and less home visits by the CHA. The latter's role in tackling COVID-19 is limited by the violence in the territory. The thorough performance of the ACS in confronting this pandemic is dependent on intersectoral policies. Thus, the creation of a policy to tackle COVID-19 with the participation of the ACS needs to consider intersectoral actions for curtailing and preventing violence in the territory, in addition to adequate training in the prevention and detection of COVID-19.","Vieira-Meyer, Anya Pimentel Gomes Fernandes; Morais, Ana Patrícia Pereira; Campelo, Isabella Lima Barbosa; Guimarães, José Maria Ximenes",Ciencia & saude coletiva,https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232021262.29922020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605342/,185

Many jurisdictions in the United States have therefore accelerated release of low-risk offenders. Early release, however, does not address how arrest and pre-trial detention practices may be contributing to disease spread. Using data from Cook County Jail, in Chicago, Illinois, one of the largest known nodes of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we analyze the relationship between jailing practices and community infections at the zip-code level. We find that jail cycling is a significant predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection, accounting for 55 percent of the variance in case rates across zip codes in Chicago and 37 percent in Illinois. By comparison, jail cycling far exceeds race, poverty, public transit utilization, and population density as a predictor of variance. The data suggest that cycling through Cook County Jail alone is associated with 15.7 percent of all documented novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases in Illinois and 15.9 percent in Chicago as of April 19, 2020. Our findings support arguments for reduced reliance on incarceration and for related justice reforms both as emergency measures during the present pandemic and as sustained structural changes vital for future pandemic preparedness and public health.

This pathology often progresses to acute respiratory distress (such as acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) and atypical pneumonia in humans, with characteristic age-related mortality rates approaching 50% or more in immunosenescent populations. The molecular basis for the extreme virulence of SARS-CoV remains elusive. Since young and aged (1-year-old) mice do not develop severe clinical disease following infection with wild-type SARS-CoV, a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (called MA15) was developed and was shown to cause lethal infection in these animals. To understand the genetic contributions to the increased pathogenesis of MA15 in rodents, we used reverse genetics and evaluated the virulence of panels of derivative viruses encoding various combinations of mouse-adapted mutations. We found that mutations in the viral spike (S) glycoprotein and, to a much less rigorous extent, in the nsp9 nonstructural protein, were primarily associated with the acquisition of virulence in young animals. The mutations in S likely increase recognition of the mouse angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor not only in MA15 but also in two additional, independently isolated mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs. In contrast to the findings for young animals, mutations to revert to the wild-type sequence in nsp9 and the S glycoprotein were not sufficient to significantly attenuate the virus compared to other combinations of mouse-adapted mutations in 12-month-old mice. This panel of SARS-CoVs provides novel reagents that we have used to further our understanding of differential, age-related pathogenic mechanisms in mouse models of human disease.","Frieman, Matthew; Yount, Boyd; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Page, Carly; Donaldson, Eric; Roberts, Anjeanette; Vogel, Leatrice; Woodruff, Becky; Scorpio, Diana; Subbarao, Kanta; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.05957-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22072787/,185

As the hydrophobicity of apoA-I is considered important for its lipid transport, novel AMPs were designed and synthesized in this study by gradually increasing the hydrophobicity of the parent peptide and their anti-atherosclerotic effects were tested. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Seventeen new AMPs (P1-P17) with incrementally increased hydrophobicity were designed and synthesized by replacing the amino acids 221-240 of apoA-I (VLESFKVSFLSALEEYTKKL). Their effects on cholesterol efflux were evaluated. Their cytotoxicity and hemolytic activity were also measured. The in vitro mechanism of the action of the new peptides were explored. Adult apolipoprotein E-/- mice were used to evaluate the anti-atherosclerotic activity of the best candidate, and the mechanistic basis of its anti-atherosclerotic effects were explored. KEY RESULTS Seventeen new AMPs (P1-P17) were synthesized and their cholesterol efflux activity and cytotoxicity were closely related to their hydrophobicity. P12 (FLEKLKELLEHLKELLTKLL), as the best candidate, most strongly promoted cholesterol efflux among the non-toxic peptides (P1-P12). With its phospholipid affinity, P12 can effortlessly facilitate cholesterol transport through ATP-binding cassette transporter A1. In vivo, P12 exhibited prominent anti-atherosclerotic activity via coupling with HDL. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS P12 featured proper hydrophobicity, which ensured its efficient binding with cytomembrane phospholipids, cholesterol, and HDL and provided a basis for its ability to reversely transport cholesterol and treat atherosclerosis.","Gou, Sanhu; Wang, Li; Zhong, Chao; Chen, Xinyue; Ouyang, Xu; Li, Beibei; Bao, Guangjun; Liu, Hui; Zhang, Yun; Ni, Jingman",British journal of pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1111/bph.15213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32726461/,185

In this study, emissions from anthracite and bitumite were examined. Red mud (RM) acts as an additive and is mixed in coal briquettes with a content of 0-10% as a single variable to demonstrate the reduction in the PM2.5 emissions. Burnt in a regulated combustion chamber, the 10% RM-containing bitumite and anthracite briquettes showed 52.3 and 18.6% reduction in PM2.5, respectively, compared with their chunk coals. Lower cytotoxicity (in terms of oxidative stresses and inflammation factors) was observed for PM2.5 emitted from the RM-containing briquettes than those from non-RM briquettes, especially for the bitumite groups. Besides, the results of western blotting illustrated that the inhibition of NF-κB and MAPK was the potential pathway for the reduction of cytokine levels by the RM addition. The regression analyses further demonstrated that the reduction was attributed to the lower emissions of transition metals (i.e., Mn) and PAHs (i.e., acenaphthene). This pilot study provides solid evidence for the cytotoxicity to vascular smooth muscle cells induced by PM2.5 from coal combustion and potential solutions for reducing the emission of toxic pollutants from human health perspectives.","Sun, Jian; Shen, Zhenxing; Niu, Xinyi; Zhang, Yue; Zhang, Bin; Zhang, Tian; He, Kun; Xu, Hongmei; Liu, Suixin; Ho, Steven Sai Hang; Li, Xuxiang; Cao, Junji",Environmental science & technology,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c02236; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138382/,185

82990,COVID-19 and comorbidities: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-06-23,"BACKGROUND Hypoxia and inflammation are hallmarks of critical illness, related to multiple organ failure. A possible mechanism leading to multiple organ failure is hypoxia- or inflammation-induced downregulation of the detoxifying glyoxalase system that clears dicarbonyl stress. The dicarbonyl methylglyoxal (MGO) is a highly reactive agent produced by metabolic pathways such as anaerobic glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. MGO leads to protein damage and ultimately multi-organ failure. Whether detoxification of MGO into D-lactate by glyoxalase functions appropriately under conditions of hypoxia and inflammation is largely unknown. We investigated the effect of inflammation and hypoxia on the MGO pathway in humans in vivo. METHODS After prehydration with glucose 2.5% solution, ten healthy males were exposed to hypoxia (arterial saturation 80-85%) for 3.5 hours using an air-tight respiratory helmet, ten males to experimental endotoxemia (LPS 2 ng/kg i.v.), ten males to LPS+hypoxia and ten males to none of these interventions (control group). Serial blood samples were drawn, and glyoxalase-1 mRNA expression, MGO, methylglyoxal-derived hydroimidazolone-1 (MG-H1), D-lactate and L-lactate levels, were measured serially. RESULTS Glyoxalase-1 mRNA expression decreased in the LPS (β (95%CI); -0.87 (-1.24; -0.50) and the LPS+hypoxia groups; -0.78 (-1.07; -0.48) (p<0.001).

83655,The C-MAC(®) D-BLADE™: use of the guide rail as a guiding channel for a gum elastic bougie.,2016,"BACKGROUND Telehealth services historically have played a small role in the provision of health care in the United States. However during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, public and private insurers rapidly expanded access to telehealth in order to reduce exposure and avoid transmission. It is unknown whether telehealth will become a more regular substitute for in-person care beyond the pandemic. OBJECTIVE Our objective was to provide evidence on the value of telehealth by comparing the productivity of physicians and other specialized clinicians who provide telehealth with the productivity of those who do not. RESEARCH DESIGN We conducted a retrospective data analysis of 17,705 unique providers in the areas of internal medicine, cardiology, dermatology, psychiatry, psychology, and optometry practicing in the US veterans affairs health care system during the period 2015 to 2018. For each year, we measured individual providers productivity by the total number of relative value units (RVUs) per full-time equivalent (FTE). We estimated the impact of providing telehealth on RVUs/FTE using fixed effects regression models estimated on a panel dataset of 58,873 provider-year observations and controlling for provider and patient characteristics. RESULTS Overall provider productivity increased in veterans affairs over the period, particularly in cardiology and dermatology. Providers of telehealth had above average productivity by 124 RVUs/FTE, or ∼4% of average total provider productivity. For the highest quartile of telehealth providers, average productivity was 188 RVUs/FTE higher than productivity of other providers. CONCLUSION Strategies that encourage long-term integration of telehealth into provider practices may contribute to overall health care value.","Stefos, Theodore; Carey, Kathleen; Shen, Mei-Ling; Poe, Stacy; Oh, Dennis H; Moran, Eileen",Medical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0000000000001529; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821831/,185

It manifests as lower extremity ischemic rest pain or ischemic skin lesions leading to ulceration or gangrene. Patients with CLI often have multiple medical comorbidities and a 1-year mortality rate of 25% and a 1-year amputation rate of 25%. Historically, bypass surgery with autogenous veins for flow restoration has been the first-line therapy for CLI. However, advances in endovascular techniques and device technology have changed the treatment paradigm. Catheter-based technologies are rapidly evolving at a rate that is outpacing large-scale studies evaluating relevant clinical outcomes. Patients with CLI require a multidisciplinary management approach centered on aggressive medical therapies, wound care and prompt revascularization, with an emphasis on limb salvage. This review summarizes the contemporary endovascular therapies including balloon angioplasty, atherectomy and bare-metal stenting.

Recent studies have reported that aberrant A-to-I RNA editing profiles are implicated in cancers. Albeit changes in expression and activity of ADAR genes are thought to have been responsible for the dysregulated RNA editome in diseases, they are not always correlated, indicating the involvement of secondary regulators. Here, we uncover DAP3 as a potent repressor of editing and a strong oncogene in cancer. DAP3 mainly interacts with the deaminase domain of ADAR2 and represses editing via disrupting association of ADAR2 with its target transcripts. PDZD7, an exemplary DAP3-repressed editing target, undergoes a protein recoding editing at stop codon [Stop →Trp (W)]. Because of editing suppression by DAP3, the unedited PDZD7WT, which is more tumorigenic than edited PDZD7Stop518W, is accumulated in tumors. In sum, cancer cells may acquire malignant properties for their survival advantage through suppressing RNA editome by DAP3.","Han, Jian; An, Omer; Hong, HuiQi; Chan, Tim Hon Man; Song, Yangyang; Shen, Haoqing; Tang, Sze Jing; Lin, Jaymie Siqi; Ng, Vanessa Hui En; Tay, Daryl Jin Tai; Molias, Fernando Bellido; Pitcheshwar, Priyankaa; Tan, Hui Qing; Yang, Henry; Chen, Leilei",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aba5136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596459/,185

There are few randomised trials studying wound repair. The objective was to compare two suture techniques with controls for simple elliptical excisions in a prospective, randomised, single-blinded study. MATERIALS One half of each wound was randomised to either one-layer closure with percutaneous nylon or modified two-layer closure where superficial closure was effected with adhesive tape. The control was the standard two-layer closure. Primary outcome measure was wound width at 6 months, with cosmesis as the secondary outcome. RESULTS A total of 161 participants with 214 excisions were recruited from general practice. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of wound width at 6 months between the groups. One-layer closure showed slight inferiority for cosmesis at 6 months versus the control. There was significant superiority for the modified two-layer closure versus the control for cosmesis at 6 months, and early wound erythema. Multivariate regression models adjusted for suture technique showed that younger age, wound infection and truncal location were predictors of increased scar width. Older age, wound erythema, and male gender were predictors of poorer patient-rated outcome. CONCLUSION One-layer closure is an acceptable choice for elliptical excision wound closure. Modified two-layer closure may be preferable to standard two-layer closure for elliptical wounds.","Ling, Nicholas; Martin, Andrew",The Australasian journal of dermatology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajd.12359; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150115/,185

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS Compared to the wild-type, TMM001 exhibits slower growth kinetics, siderophore hyper-secretion and the inability to utilize heme-containing proteins as iron sources. A series of animal challenge studies showed an inverse correlation between the percentage of survival in BALB/c mice and iron-dependent TMM001 growth. Upon evaluation of TMM001 as a potential protective strain against infection, we found 100% survival following B. mallei CSM001 challenge of mice previously receiving 1.5 x 10(4) CFU of TMM001. At 21 days post-immunization, TMM001-treated animals showed significantly higher levels of B. mallei-specific IgG1, IgG2a and IgM when compared to PBS-treated controls. At 48 h post-challenge, PBS-treated controls exhibited higher levels of serum inflammatory cytokines and more severe pathological damage to target organs compared to animals receiving TMM001. In a cross-protection study of acute inhalational melioidosis with B. pseudomallei, TMM001-treated mice were significantly protected. While wild type was cleared in all B. mallei challenge studies, mice failed to clear TMM001. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE Although further work is needed to prevent chronic infection by TMM001 while maintaining immunogenicity, our attenuated strain demonstrates great potential as a backbone strain for future vaccine development against both glanders and melioidosis.","Mott, Tiffany M; Vijayakumar, Sudhamathi; Sbrana, Elena; Endsley, Janice J; Torres, Alfredo G",PLoS neglected tropical diseases,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0003863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26114445/,185

At present, the commonly used indicators do not have high specificity and do not necessarily reflect disease severity. We therefore aimed to investigate diagnostic and prognostic value of plasma procalcitonin, heparin-binding protein, and interleukin-6 for acute pancreatitis by separate detection and joint detection. METHODS The study involved 451 participants, including 343 AP patients and 108 healthy controls. We analyzed the association of the three biomarkers with the severity and prognosis of AP. RESULTS A statistically significant increase in the mean plasma analyte levels was detected in the study group compared to the control group. Multivariate comparison showed that plasma levels of PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were all significantly different among the three groups at different sampling times (1st, 3rd, 7th, and 10th day of admission) (p < 0.01). The combination of the three indicators had significantly higher diagnostic value than either the individual markers or pairwise combinations (p < 0.001). The levels of the three were all significantly higher in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) patients than in non-SAP patients (p < 0.001); meanwhile, patients with high levels had a worse prognosis than those with low levels (p < 0.05). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age and sex, high levels of PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were found to be independently associated with the development of AP. CONCLUSIONS It dramatically improved the diagnostic power of AP when PCT, HBP, and IL-6 were combined; high PCT, HBP, and IL-6 levels within 3 days of admission may be the potentially useful indicators for predicting SAP.","Zhong, Yuhong; Yu, Zhongqi; Wang, Lin; Yang, Xufeng",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151489/,185

In this experimental study, we created a mechanical end-to-end anastomotic model and assessed the strength of the anastomotic site under high pressure. METHODS We used a computer-controlled circular stapler named iDrive (Power Medical Interventions, Covidien plc, Dublin, Ireland) for the anastomosis between the porcine aorta and an artificial graft. Then the mechanically stapled group (group A) and the manually sutured group (group B) were compared 10 times, and we assessed the differences at several levels of pressure. RESULTS To use a mechanical stapler in vascular anastomosis, some special preparations of both the aorta and the artificial graft are necessary to narrow the open end before the procedures. To solve this problem, we established a specially designed purse-string suture for both and finally established end-to-end vascular anastomosis. The anastomosis speed of group A was statistically significantly faster than that of group B (P < .01). The group A anastomotic sites also showed significantly more tolerance to high pressure than those of group B. CONCLUSIONS The computer-controlled stapling device enabled reliable anastomosis of the aorta and the artificial graft. This study showed that mechanical vascular anastomosis with the iDrive was sufficiently strong and safe relative to manual suturing.","Takata, Munehisa; Watanabe, Go; Ohtake, Hiroshi; Ushijima, Teruaki; Yamaguchi, Shojiro; Kikuchi, Yujiro; Yamamoto, Yoshitaka",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2010.05.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20947100/,185

During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Nigeria, couples were compelled to spend more time together, regardless of their pre-existing challenges. Our study aims to determine the prevalence of IPV, its forms, and mental health implications among Nigerian households amid the COVID-19 lockdown. A cross-sectional study was implemented which used the snowball sampling technique to recruit 474 participants across 31 states in Nigeria. A semi-structured online questionnaire was distributed using the WhatsApp platform. The relationship between IPV, its forms, and associated factors were analyzed using descriptive analysis and logistic regression with significant value at p ≤ .05 and confidence interval of 95%. Majority (98.1%) of the participants had at least a college degree and 90.1% were employed. Overall prevalence of IPV ranged from 7.2% to 13.5%. Using the lockdown as the landmark, higher prevalence was found before than during the lockdown across physical, emotional, financial, and sexual forms of IPV. Emotional form had the highest prevalence both before and during the lockdown with 11.4% and 3.8% respectively. Furthermore, 22.6% of participants reported that the lockdown affected their mental health. Hopelessness, feelings of failure, being irritable, and constantly under strain were psychological symptoms significantly associated with IPV amid the lockdown. Decreased prevalence of IPV were found in the early phase of the pandemic, suggesting that couples can experience less partner violence during periods of confinement. Our study supports existing evidence that forms of IPV have negative mental health consequences on abused partners.","Ojeahere, Margaret Isioma; Kumswa, Sahmicit Kankemwa; Adiukwu, Frances; Plang, Janet Punyit; Taiwo, Yetunde Folake",Journal of interpersonal violence,https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211015213; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33993788/,185

92837,Effects of closed-loop intravenous anesthesia guided by Bispectral Index in adult patients on emergence delirium: a randomized controlled study.,2018,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Despite several retrospective studies showing the safety and efficacy of transradial access for cerebral angiography, neurointerventionalists are apprehensive about implementing TRA for neurointerventions. This reluctance is mainly due to anatomic factors, technical factors, and a long learning curve (relative to transfemoral access). We present here our experience of TRA transition for cerebral aneurysm embolization. Our aim was to demonstrate the feasibility and safety of radial access for consecutive embolizations of ruptured and unruptured cerebral aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of a prospective data base on cerebral aneurysm embolizations. Between April and December 2018, radial access was considered for all consecutive patients referred to our institution for cerebral aneurysm embolization. Technical success was defined as radial access with insertion of the sheath and completion of the intervention without a crossover to conventional femoral access. The primary safety end point was the in-hospital plus 30-day incidence of radial artery occlusion. Secondary end points included intraoperative complications and neurologic complications at discharge and in the following 30 days. RESULTS Seventy-one patients with a cerebral aneurysm underwent 73 embolization procedures at our institution. The first-choice access route was the radial artery in 62 patients (87.3%) and the femoral artery in 9 (12.6%). Thirty-four embolizations were performed using coils, 22 used a balloon-assisted coil technique, 6 used a stent-assisted coil technique, and 2 used a flow diverter. Crossover to femoral access was observed in 2 patients (3.1%). Four patients developed coil-induced thrombi requiring intra-arterial tirofiban injections. In 1 case, an aneurysm ruptured during the operation but did not have a clinical impact. No cases of radial artery occlusion or hand ischemia were observed. CONCLUSIONS A transition to radial access for cerebral aneurysm embolization is feasible and does not increase the level of risk associated with the procedure.","Chivot, C; Bouzerar, R; Yzet, T",AJNR.

94250,Efficacy of raman spectroscopy in the diagnosis of kidney cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-07-02,"Policy Points Reflecting on current response deficiencies, we offer a model for a national contingency supply chain cell (NCSCC) construct to manage the medical materials supply chain in support of emergencies, such as COVID-19. We develop the following: a framework for governance and response to enable a globally independent supply chain; a flexible structure to accommodate the requirements of state and county health systems for receiving and distributing materials; and a national material ""control tower"" to improve transparency and real-time access to material status and location. CONTEXT Much of the discussion about the failure of the COVID-19 supply chain has centered on personal protective equipment (PPE) and the degree of vulnerability of care. Prior research on supply chain risks have focused on mitigating the risk of disruptions of specific purchased materials within a bounded region or on the shifting status of cross-border export restrictions. But COVID-19 has impacted every purchase category, region, and border. This paper is responsive to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine recommendation to study and monitor disasters and to provide governments with course of action to satisfy legislative mandates. METHODS Our analysis draws on our observations of the responses to COVID-19 in regard to acquisition and contracting problem-solving, our review of field discussions and interactions with experts, a critique of existing proposals for managing the strategic national stockpile in the United States a mapping of the responses to national contingency planning phases, and the identification of gaps in current national healthcare response policy frameworks and proposals. FINDINGS Current proposals call for augmenting a system that has failed to deliver the needed response to COVID-19. These proposals do not address the key attributes for pandemic plan renewal: flexibility, traceability and transparency, persistence and responsiveness, global independence, and equitable access. We offer a commons-based framework for achieving the opportunities and risks which are responsive to a constellation of intelligence assets working in and across focal targets of global supply chain risk. CONCLUSIONS The United States needs a ""commons-based strategy"" that is not simply a stockpile repository but instead is a network of repositories, fluid inventories, and analytic monitoring governed by the experts. We need a coordinated effort, a ""commons"" that will direct both conventional and new suppliers to meet demands and to eliminate hoarding and other behaviors.","Handfield, Robert; Finkenstadt, Daniel Joseph; Schneller, Eugene S; Godfrey, A Blanton; Guinto, Peter",The Milbank quarterly,https://doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12485; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33135814/,185
94287,Asymptomatic carotid stenosis: the not-so-silent disease: changing perspectives from thromboembolism to cognition.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Worldwide, traumatic casualties are projected to exceed 8 million by year 2020. Haemorrhagic shock and brain injury are the leading causes of death following trauma. While intravenous fluids have traditionally been used to support organ perfusion in the setting of haemorrhage, recent investigations have suggested that restricting fluid therapy by tolerating more severe hypotension may improve survival. However, the safety of permissive hypotension remains uncertain, particularly among patients who have suffered a traumatic brain injury. Vasopressors preferentially vasoconstrict blood vessels that supply non-vital organs and capacitance vessels, thereby mobilising the unstressed blood volume. Used as fluid-sparing adjuncts, these drugs can complement resuscitative measures by correcting hypotension without diluting clotting factors or increasing the risk for tissue oedema. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will identify randomised control trials comparing early resuscitation with vasopressors versus placebo or standard care in adults following traumatic injury. Data sources will include MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, clinical trial registries and conference proceedings. Two reviewers will independently determine trial eligibility. For each included trial, we will conduct duplicate independent data extraction and risk of bias assessment. We will assess the overall quality of the data for each individual outcome using the GRADE approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION We will report this review in accordance with the PRISMA statement. We will disseminate our findings at critical care and trauma conferences and through a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. We will also use this systematic review to create clinical guidelines (http://www.magicapp.org), which will be disseminated in a standalone publication.

MATERIALS & METHODS The weekly numbers of admitted patients with stroke were retrieved from electronic patient records from January 2019 to February 2021 and analysed to reveal potential fluctuations in patient volumes during the pandemic. RESULTS A total of 23,688 patients were included, of whom 2049 patients were treated with tissue-type plasminogen activators (tPA) and 552 underwent endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). We found a transient decrease in the number of weekly admitted patients (pts/week) with all strokes (-9.8 pts/week, 95% CI: -19.4; -0.2, p = .046) and stroke mimics (-30.1 pts/week, 95% CI: -39.9; -20.3, p < .001) during the first lockdown compared to pre-COVID-19. The number of subarachnoid haemorrhage, intracerebral haemorrhage, and ischaemic stroke admissions showed insignificant declines. Analysing all COVID-19 periods collectively revealed increased volumes of ischaemic stroke (+6.2 pts/week, 95% CI: +1.6; +10.7, p = .009) compared to pre-COVID levels, while numbers of stroke mimics remained lower than pre-COVID. Weekly tPA and EVT treatments remained constant throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS Our results are comparable with other studies in finding reductions in stroke-related admissions early in the pandemic. This is the first study to report increased stroke volumes following the first wave of the pandemic. The mechanisms behind the observed drop and subsequent rise in strokes are unclear and warrant further investigation.","Drenck, Nicolas; Grundtvig, Josefine; Christensen, Thomas; Iversen, Helle Klingenberg; Kruuse, Christina; Truelsen, Thomas; Wienecke, Troels; Christensen, Hanne",Acta neurologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/ane.13535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34605006/,185
95454,Stents for femoropopliteal disease: are some things better covered up?,2013,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS Round pneumonia (RP) is a rare radiological presentation of a subtype of lobar pneumonia that arises because of a developmental defect in connective tissues (pores of Köhn and channels of Lambert). The round appearance on chest X-ray (CXR) is thought to occur from an infectious process that spreads from small peripheral alveoli centrifugally through interalveolar channels via the pores of Kohn and the canals of Lambert. This explains the nonsegmental distribution and shape of RP. The pathogenesis of RP is unknown. An alternative theory holds that RP in children occurs because of underdeveloped pores of Kohn and the absence of canals of Lambert, limiting the spread of the organism and resulting in a focal, round mass seen on radiographs. As a result of this developmental defect, dissemination of infection remains in a limited area. While this is a well-known entity in childhood, it has been described infrequently in adults. Lesions of RP are not necessarily round; oval lesions can also be seen. It is a radiological subtype of the pneumonia subtype and presents as a solitary nodule or a mass lesion in CXR. METHODS We presented two cases of RP. One mimicked and was mistaken for pulmonary infarction because of triangular pleural-based density and the other mimicked pulmonary malignancy because of a homogeneous triangular opacity based on the pleura on the posteroanterior radiography and computed tomography. CONCLUSION These cases were presented because of RP's importance, and RP should be considered a part of differential diagnosis of pulmonary infarct and lung tumor.","Çimen, Dilay; Bulcun, Emel; Ekici, Aydanur; Güngör, Ömür; Ekici, Mehmet",The clinical respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/crj.12137; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24725533/,185
96087,Is denosumab associated with an increased risk for infection in patients with low bone mineral density? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND Although there are numerous supraglottic airway alternatives to endotracheal intubation, it remains unclear which airway technique is optimal for use in prehospital cardiac arrests. We evaluated the use of the laryngeal tube (LT) as an airway management tool among adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients treated by our ambulance services in the Haukeland and Innlandet hospital districts. METHODS Post-resuscitation forms and data concerning airway management in 347 adult OHCA victims were retrospectively assessed with regard to LT insertion success rates, ease and speed of insertion and insertion-related problems. RESULTS A total of 402 insertions were performed on 347 OHCA patients. Overall, LT insertion was successful in 85.3% of the patients, with a 74.4% first-attempt success rate. In the minority of patients (n = 46, 13.3%), the LT insertion time exceeded 30 seconds. Insertion-related problems were recorded in 52.7% of the patients. Lack of respiratory sounds on auscultation (n = 100, 28.8%), problematic initial tube positioning (n = 85, 24.5%), air leakage (n = 61, 17.6%), vomitus/aspiration (n = 44, 12.7%), and tube dislocation (n = 17, 4.9%) were the most common problems reported. Insertion difficulty was graded and documented for 95.4% of the patients, with the majority of insertions assessed as being ""Easy"" (62.5%) or ""Intermediate"" (24.8%). Only 8.1% of the insertions were considered to be ""Difficult"". CONCLUSIONS We found a high number of insertion related problems, indicating that supraglottic airway devices offering promising results in manikin studies may be less reliable in real-life resuscitations. Still, we consider the laryngeal tube to be an important alternative for airway management in prehospital cardiac arrest victims.","Sunde, Geir A; Brattebø, Guttorm; Odegården, Terje; Kjernlie, Dag F; Rødne, Emma; Heltne, Jon-Kenneth","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",https://doi.org/10.1186/1757-7241-20-84; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23249522/,185

The objective of this study was to assess the effects of tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) supplementation on immune response following tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccine challenge in healthy female volunteers. SUBJECTS/METHODS In this double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (control group) or 400 mg of TRF (study group) supplementation daily. Over the 2-month period of the study, volunteers were asked to attend three clinical sessions (that is, on days 0, 28 and 56) and blood samples were obtained from the volunteers during the follow-up. On day 28, all volunteers were also vaccinated with the TT vaccine (20 Lf) intramuscularly. RESULTS The results from the clinical trial showed that TRF supplementation significantly increased the total vitamin E level in the plasma of the TRF-supplemented volunteers compared with the placebo group, indicating overall compliance. Volunteers supplemented with TRF showed a significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced production of interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 by the mitogen or TT-stimulated leukocytes compared with the control group. Volunteers from the TRF group produced significantly (P < 0.05) lower amounts of IL-6 compared with the placebo group. Anti-TT IgG production was also significantly (P < 0.05) augmented in the TRF-supplemented group compared with the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that TRF has immunostimulatory effects and potential clinical benefits to enhance immune response to vaccines.","Mahalingam, D; Radhakrishnan, A K; Amom, Z; Ibrahim, N; Nesaretnam, K",European journal of clinical nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1038/ejcn.2010.184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20859299/,185

Palliative care facilities deliver early care, alongside antineoplastic treatments, whereas hospice care structures intervene lately, when cancer-modifying treatments stop. AIM This review identified factors associated with early and late interventions of specialised services, by considering the type of structures studied (palliative vs hospice care). DESIGN We performed a systematic review, prospectively registered on PROSPERO (ID: CRD42018110063). DATA SOURCES We searched Medline and Scopus databases for population-based studies. Two independent reviewers extracted the data and assessed the study quality using Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklists. RESULTS The 51 included articles performed 67 analyses. Most were based on retrospective cohorts and US populations. The median quality scores were 19/22 for cohorts and 15/16 for cross-sectional studies. Most analyses focused on hospice care (n=37). Older patients, men, people with haematological cancer or treated in small centres had less specialised interventions. Palliative and hospice facilities addressed different populations. Older patients received less palliative care but more hospice care. Patients with high-stage tumours had more palliative care while women and patients with a low comorbidity burden received more hospice care. CONCLUSION Main disparities concerned older patients, men and people with haematological cancer. We highlighted the challenges of early interventions for older patients and of late deliveries for men and highly comorbid patients.

Methods A retrospective cohort study of consecutive AIS patients with MCA M2 ELVO undergoing thrombectomy from 3 academic medical centers was conducted from October 1999 through June 2016. The patients were divided based on the device utilized. Multivariate analysis of associations between devices (stent retriever or aspiration only [manual or pump aspiration system]) was performed. Primary outcomes were good recanalization (i.e., modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score ≥2b) and a favorable modified Rankin scale (mRS) score (i.e. ≤2). The secondary outcome was symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Results A total of 197 AIS patients underwent MCA M2 ELVO thrombectomy with either a stent retriever (n = 120) or aspiration only (n = 77). The aspiration-only group utilized either manual (n = 38) or pump aspiration (n = 39). Utilization of a stent retriever over manual aspiration is independently associated with higher odds of a favorable mRS score (OR = 3.2; 95% CI 1.02-9.7) and lower odds of sICH (OR = 0.09; 95% CI 0.03-0.31). Utilization of a stent retriever over a pump aspiration system is independently associated with higher odds of good recanalization (OR = 3.8; 95% CI 1.5-9.6). Utilization of a newer-generation pump aspiration catheter compared to a stent retriever resulted in similar rates of favorable mRS scores, sICH, successful recanalization, and mortality. Conclusion Utilization of a newer-generation pump aspiration catheter compared to a stent retriever resulted in similar outcomes, but worse outcomes were seen with the manual aspiration technique. These findings need to be confirmed with a large randomized trial utilizing stent retrievers and newer-generation pump aspiration systems.","Atchaneeyasakul, Kunakorn; Malik, Amer M; Yavagal, Dileep R; Haussen, Diogo C; Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Bouslama, Mehdi; Kenmuir, Cynthia L; Desai, Shashvat; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Chaturvedi, Seemant; Jovin, Tudor G; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000500198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32508900/,185

RESULTS A total of 2631 oral cavity lesions (AF, n = 2076; CL, n = 555) from 26 studies (AF = 17; CL = 9) was used for calculation of diagnostic accuracy parameters. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity of the AF were 81.3% (95% CI: 74.3% - 87.5%) and 52.1% (95% CI: 36.9% - 67.1%), respectively. Cumulative diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) was 5.44 (95% CI: 2.29 - 10.56) with a significant heterogeneity between studies (I2 = 80.7%, 95% CI: 70.0% - 86.7%; p < .05). The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for the CL were 84.9% (95% CI: 66.7% - 96.7%) and 51.8% (95% CI: 37.3% - 65.9%), respectively.

99566,Hypertrophic Effects of Concentric vs. Eccentric Muscle Actions: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2017,"Diabetic dyslipidemia (DD), characterized by increased plasma triglycerides (TGs) and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels, is a major factor contributing to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cardiovascular risk in type-2 diabetes. Activation of both the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) are associated with NASH progression. Here, we tested whether dual-targeting inhibition of hepatic CB1R and iNOS improves DD in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. DIO mice were treated for 14 days with (S)-MRI-1867, a peripherally-restricted hybrid inhibitor of CB1R and iNOS. (R)-MRI-1867, the CB1R-inactive stereoisomer which retains iNOS inhibitory activity and JD-5037, a peripherally-restricted CB1R antagonist were used to assess the relative contribution of the two targets to the effects of (S)-MRI-1867. (S)-MRI-1867 reduced hepatic steatosis, the rate of hepatic VLDL secretion, upregulated hepatic LDLR expression and reduced the circulating levels of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). The decrease in VLDL secretion could be attributed to CB1R blockade while the reduction of PCSK9 levels and the related increase in LDLR resulted from iNOS inhibition via a mTORC1-dependent mechanism. In conclusion, this approach based on the concomitant inhibition of CB1R and iNOS represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of dyslipidemia.","Roger, Célia; Buch, Chloé; Muller, Tania; Leemput, Julia; Demizieux, Laurent; Passilly-Degrace, Patricia; Cinar, Resat; Iyer, Malliga R; Kunos, George; Vergès, Bruno; Degrace, Pascal; Jourdan, Tony",Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.2337/db20-0078; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680936/,185

The pain outcome value was extracted from studies for meta-analysis. Nine RCTs were included. Compared to the control groups, resistance exercise groups demonstrated a clinically and statistically significant effect on pain reduction when each exercise was performed in 1-2 sets or 3-5 sets of 4-12 or 5-20 repetitions twice a week, for 8-12 weeks, at intensities of 40-80% with one repetition maximum or perceived exertion. Resistance training exercises are effective to reduce pain in women with fibromyalgia when performed at moderate-to-high intensity in 1-2 sets of 4-20 repetitions twice a week, for 8-12 weeks. The protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) platform, CRD42018095205.","da Silva, Juliana Moura; de Barros, Brenison Souza; Almeida, Gustavo J; O'Neil, Jennifer; Imoto, Aline Mizusaki",Rheumatology international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-021-05025-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34652480/,185
101437,Comparison of outpatient and home-based exercise training programmes for COPD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"Aims The purpose of this study is to understand healthcare students' knowledge of COVID-19 and the precautionary behaviors they practiced in Saudi Arabia during the MERS-CoV2 outbreak. Subjects and Methods This cross-sectional study utilized an online questionnaire consisting of 29 items and three sections. The first section collected demographic information, including age, gender, location, and level of education. The second section assessed their knowledge of clinical characteristics, treatments, and disease prevention. The third section addressed the students' behaviors. Results Respondents included 223 students, of which 37.2% were males and 62.8% were females. The largest group of respondents included medical students (44.8%), followed by dental students (41.3%). Overall, students demonstrated a thorough knowledge of disease transmission, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19. However, some of the respondents could not identify the full name of the disease, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (64.6%), or provide a current estimate of the number of cases diagnosed globally (49.8%). Additionally, most of the survey respondents (93.3%) reported that they had followed social distancing guidelines issued by the Ministry of Health. Conclusion While most health students were knowledgeable about most aspects of COVID-19, others did not follow universal precautions during the outbreak, which identifies better incorporation of such information in students' academic programs.","Natto, Z S; Alshaeri, H K",Nigerian journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.4103/njcp.njcp_259_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723116/,185

Furthermore, cerebral regional saturation of oxygen (rSO2) was previously reported to be significantly lower in HD patients than in healthy subjects. We aimed to identify the factors affecting the cerebral rSO2 in HD patients. METHODS Fifty-four HD patients (38 men and 16 women; mean age, 67.7 ± 1.2 years, HD duration, 6.5 ± 1.9 years) were recruited. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored at the forehead before HD using an INVOS 5100C (Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan). RESULTS The rSO2 levels were significantly lower in HD patients compared with healthy controls (49.5 ± 1.7% vs. 68.9 ± 1.6%, p <0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 independently associated with pH (standardized coefficient: -0.35), HD duration (standardized coefficient: -0.33), and serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.28). Furthermore, the rSO2 was significantly lower in HD patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), compared with patients without DM (46.8 ± 1.7% vs. 52.1 ± 1.8%, p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS In HD patients, cerebral rSO2 was affected by multiple factors, including pH, HD duration, and serum albumin concentration. Furthermore, this is the first report describing significantly lower levels of rSO2 in HD patients with DM than in those without DM.","Ito, Kiyonori; Ookawara, Susumu; Ueda, Yuichiro; Goto, Sawako; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Yamada, Hodaka; Kitano, Taisuke; Shindo, Mitsunobu; Kaku, Yoshio; Hirai, Keiji; Yoshida, Masashi; Hoshino, Taro; Nabata, Aoi; Mori, Honami; Yoshida, Izumi; Kakei, Masafumi; Tabei, Kaoru",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25706868/,185

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the medical costs associated with bronchiolitis hospitalizations caused by RSV infection among infants aged < 2 years in Colombia. METHODS This was a prevalence-based cost-of-illness multicentric study performed from the societal perspective during 2016-2017. A case was defined as a laboratory-confirmed RSV infection with hospitalization. All costs and use of resources were collected directly from medical invoices and health records. RESULTS This study included 193 patients with a diagnosis of RSV. The average hospital stay duration was 5.55 days. The major contributors to hospitalization costs were room costs (31.5%), drugs (21.8%), and indirect costs (14.9%). Medications with the highest costs were nebulization with a hypertonic solution and systemic antibiotics. In total, 96% of β-lactam antibiotics, 90% of bronchodilators, and 86% of corticosteroids and epinephrine were classified as inappropriate. CONCLUSION RSV infection in Colombia places a high economic burden on the health system. Generating comprehensive data on healthcare resource use and costs associated with RSV will help to provide valuable information for the development of cost-effectiveness models and to guide RSV-prevention strategies.","Buendía, Jefferson Antonio; Patiño, Diana Guerrero",PharmacoEconomics - open,https://doi.org/10.1007/s41669-020-00218-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418086/,185

Part 2 - practical use, including problems, and their use with paediatric patients.",2011,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A recent study identified a preprocedural P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 as a strong independent predictor of perioperative thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications after treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device. This study aimed to determine whether a last-recorded P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 predicts thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after treatment of cerebral aneurysms with the Pipeline Embolization Device in the same patient cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS We recorded patient and aneurysm characteristics, P2Y12 receptor antagonist administered, P2Y12 reaction units value with VerifyNow, procedural variables, and thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after Pipeline Embolization Device procedures at our institution during an 8-month period. Complications causing a permanent disabling neurologic deficit or death were considered major. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications. RESULTS Forty-four patients underwent 48 Pipeline Embolization Device procedures at our institution during the study period. There were 11 thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after treatment in our cohort (22.9%), 5 of which were major (10.4%). A last-recorded P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 was the only independent predictor of all (P = .002) and major (P = .03) thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications in our cohort. Most patients (71%) required, on average, 2 adjustments to the dose or type of P2Y12 receptor antagonist to remain within the 60-240 target P2Y12 reaction units range. CONCLUSIONS In our cohort, a last-recorded P2Y12 reaction units value of <60 or >240 was the only independent predictor of all and major thromboembolic and hemorrhagic complications up to 6 months after Pipeline Embolization Device procedures.","Delgado Almandoz, J E; Crandall, B M; Scholz, J M; Fease, J L; Anderson, R E; Kadkhodayan, Y; Tubman, D E",AJNR.

104515,Telehealth for Uptitration of Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy in Heart Failure.,2020-10-20,"Background A large proportion of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) develop severe respiratory failure requiring admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and about 80% of them need mechanical ventilation (MV). These patients show great complexity due to multiple organ involvement and a dynamic evolution over time; moreover, few information is available about the risk factors that may contribute to increase the time course of mechanical ventilation.The primary objective of this study is to investigate the risk factors associated with the inability to liberate COVID-19 patients from mechanical ventilation. Due to the complex evolution of the disease, we analyzed both pulmonary variables and occurrence of non-pulmonary complications during mechanical ventilation. The secondary objective of this study was the evaluation of risk factors for ICU mortality. Methods This multicenter prospective observational study enrolled 391 patients from fifteen COVID-19 dedicated Italian ICUs which underwent invasive mechanical ventilation for COVID-19 pneumonia. Clinical and laboratory data, ventilator parameters, occurrence of organ dysfunction, and outcome were recorded. The primary outcome measure was 28 days ventilator-free days and the liberation from MV at 28 days was studied by performing a competing risks regression model on data, according to the method of Fine and Gray; the event death was considered as a competing risk. Results Liberation from mechanical ventilation was achieved in 53.2% of the patients (208/391). Competing risks analysis, considering death as a competing event, demonstrated a decreased sub-hazard ratio for liberation from mechanical ventilation (MV) with increasing age and SOFA score at ICU admission, low values of PaO2/FiO2 ratio during the first 5 days of MV, respiratory system compliance (CRS) lower than 40 mL/cmH2O during the first 5 days of MV, need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and cardiovascular complications.ICU mortality during the observation period was 36.1% (141/391). Similar results were obtained by the multivariate logistic regression analysis using mortality as a dependent variable. Conclusions Age, SOFA score at ICU admission, CRS, PaO2/FiO2, renal and cardiovascular complications, and late-onset VAP were all independent risk factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19.

Although it may yield immediate savings by diverting health care from higher-cost settings, these savings could be countered if direct-to-consumer telemedicine increases follow-up care and, therefore, episode costs. Comparing downstream care utilization data from a large, commercial payer for the period 2016-19, we found that patients with initial visits for acute respiratory infection were more likely to obtain follow-up care within seven days after direct-to-consumer telemedicine visits (10.3 percent) than after in-person visits (5.9 percent). In both settings approximately 90 percent of patients did not obtain additional care. The telemedicine cohort had fewer (0.5 percent versus 0.6 percent) emergency department visits-a small but statistically significant difference-but more subsequent office, urgent care, and telemedicine visits. Our findings suggest that potential savings from shifting initial care to a direct-to-consumer telemedicine setting should be balanced against the potential for higher spending on downstream care.","Li, Kathleen Yinran; Zhu, Ziwei; Ng, Sophia; Ellimoottil, Chad",Health affairs,https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01741; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33819099/,185

The most common cause of TCVO is central venous catheters (CVCs) which can induce intravascular scarring or endoluminal obstruction via thrombus formation. AREAS COVERED The Surfacer® System is used to obtain central venous access (CVA) in patients with TCVO by facilitating catheter insertion via the novel Inside-Out® approach. This review summarizes the results of clinical studies to date with the Surfacer System, focusing on the how the procedure is performed, clinical efficacy and safety of the device and patient populations where the device offers substantial clinical benefit. EXPERT OPINION The Surfacer System offers a safe and effective approach to reliably preserve and restore critical upper body vascular access sites. For dialysis patients, the device offers an alternative which avoids placement of dialysis catheters in veins which may impact the ability to achieve maturation of hemodialysis vascular access or in locations which have an increased risk of insertion-related complications or are associated with higher morbidity.","Razavi, Mahmood K",Expert review of medical devices,https://doi.org/10.1080/17434440.2020.1825938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941079/,185
105113,Therapeutic interventions for osteoarthritis of the wrist: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"Dehydrocorydaline (DHC), one of the main active components of Corydalis yanhusuo, is an important remedy for the treatment of coronary heart disease. Our previous study revealed a higher unbound concentration of DHC in the heart than plasma of mice after oral administration of Corydalis yanhusuo extract or DHC, but the underlying uptake mechanism remains unelucidated. In our investigations, we studied the transport mechanism of DHC in transgenic cells, primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and animal experiments. Using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, we found that uptake transporters expressed in the mouse heart include organic cation transporter 1/3 (OCT1/3) and carnitine/organic cation transporter 1/2 (OCTN1/2). The accumulation experiments in transfected cells showed that DHC was a substrate of OCT1 and OCT3, with Km of 11.29 {plus minus} 2.0 and 8.96 {plus minus} 3.3 μM, respectively, but not a substrate of OCTN1/2. Additionally, a higher efflux level (1.71-fold of MDCK-mock) of DHC was observed in MDCK-MDR1 cells than in MDCK-mock cells. Therefore, DHC is a weak substrate for MDR1. Studies using primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes showed that OCT1/3 inhibitors (quinidine, decynium-22, and levo-tetrahydropalmatine) prevented the accumulation of DHC, while OCTN2 inhibitors (mildronate and l-carnitine) did not affect its accumulation. Moreover, the co-administration of OCT1/3 inhibitors (levo-tetrahydropalmatine, THP) decreased the concentration of DHC in the mouse heart. Based on these findings, DHC may be accumulated partly by OCT1/3 transporters and excreted by MDR1 in the heart. THP could alter the distribution of DHC in the mouse heart. Significance Statement We reported the cardiac transport mechanism of dehydrocorydaline, highly distributed to the heart after oral administration of Corydalis yanhusuo extract or dehydrocorydaline only. Dehydrocorydaline (an OCT1/3 and MDR1 substrate) accumulation in primary cardiomyocytes may be related to the transport activity of OCT1/3. This ability, hampered by selective inhibitors (THP, an inhibitor of OCT1/3), causes nearly 40% reduction in exposure of the heart to dehydrocorydaline. These results suggest that OCT1/3 may contribute to the uptake of dehydrocorydaline in the heart.","Chen, Yingchun; Li, Cui; Yi, Yaodong; Du, Weijuan; Jiang, Huidi; Zeng, Su; Zhou, Hui",Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,https://doi.org/10.1124/dmd.120.000025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32723846/,185

105530,Open Versus Endoscopic Approach for Sinonasal Melanoma: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2019,"OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to compare the stroke/death rates between proximal embolic protection devices (P-EPDs) and distal filter embolic protection devices (F-EPDs) in elective carotid artery stenting (CAS). BACKGROUND P-EPDs have theoretical advantages that may make them superior to F-EPDs for stroke prevention during CAS. METHODS We examined 10,246 consecutive elective CAS procedures performed with embolic protection in the NCDR CARE registry between January 2009 and March 2013. We analyzed crude and propensity-matched rates of in-hospital combined death/stroke in patients treated with P-EPDs versus F-EPDs. Secondary analyses included 30-day adverse event rates and stroke rates by the involved cerebrovascular territory. RESULTS P-EPDs were used in 590 of 10,246 cases (5.8%). Patients treated with P-EPDs had higher rates of symptomatic lesion status (46.8% vs. 39.7%, p<0.001), atrial fibrillation/flutter (16.1% vs. 13.0%, p=0.03), and history of a neurological event (51.2% vs. 46.6%, p=0.03). In unadjusted and propensity-matched analyses, differences in in-hospital stroke/death between P-EPD and F-EPD cohorts were nonsignificant (1.5% vs. 2.4%, p=0.16 and 1.6% vs. 2.0%, p=0.56, respectively). For patients with available data (n=7,693, 75.1%), 30-day adverse events rates were similar for P-EPDs and F-EPDs before (2.5% vs. 4.2%, p=0.07) and after (2.7% vs. 4.0%, p=0.22) propensity matching. CONCLUSIONS Use of a P-EPD during CAS was associated with low rates of in-hospital stroke/death similar to those with an F-EPD in the first comparative effectiveness study of the devices. An adequately powered randomized trial comparing clinical outcomes between these devices is unlikely to be feasible.","Giri, Jay; Parikh, Sahil A; Kennedy, Kevin F; Weinberg, Ido; Donaldson, Cameron; Hawkins, Beau M; McCormick, Daniel J; Jackson, Benjamin; Armstrong, Ehrin J; Ramchand, Preethi; White, Christopher J; Jaff, Michael R; Rosenfield, Kenneth; Yeh, Robert W",JACC.

A systematic review and Meta-analysis.,2021-12-01,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Hemosiderin exhibits a stronger T2 shortening effect than deoxyhemoglobin. The extent of the 'blooming artifact' may therefore reflect a composition of different iron forms. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between extent of susceptibility vessel sign (SVS) width beyond the lumen and middle cerebral artery (MCA) recanalization. METHODS Clinical and imaging data from consecutive acute ischaemic stroke patients with MCA occlusion who underwent susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) before intravenous thrombolysis were examined. The source images of magnitude and angiography were used to obtain the width of SVS and MCA at the interface, respectively. RESULTS The presence of MCA SVS was observed in 64 patients on initial SWI scans and recanalization was observed in 30 (46.9%) patients. The overestimation ratio of thrombus width on SWI was an acceptable predictor for no recanalization [odds ratio 1.360 per 0.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.093-1.691; P = 0.006]. The optimal cut-off point was identified at 1.943, and this yielded a sensitivity of 67.6% and a specificity of 86.7%. Extensive blooming artifact, defined as overestimation ratio ≥2, independently predicted no recanalization (odds ratio 9.687, 95% CI 1.974-47.545; P = 0.005) and unfavorable outcome (odds ratio 4.916, 95% CI 1.049-23.051; P = 0.043). CONCLUSIONS The extent of SVS width beyond the lumen might reflect the content of hemosiderin. An extreme overestimation ratio might indicate aged thrombus, which may be resistant to thrombolysis.","Yan, S; Chen, Q; Zhang, X; Xu, M; Han, Q; Shao, A; Liebeskind, D S; Lou, M",European journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.12930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26706832/,185

Joining this conversation, the field of health professions education research is complex and contextual and there are ways of examining and reporting locally based activities and innovations which can be of general value. This position leads to a focus on case study research (CSR); inquiry bound in time and place that generates thick descriptions and close interpretations to reach explanations. CSR has grown in sophistication in recent years and can inform practice and advance the science of medical and health professions education. The authors evaluated the current state of the science of CSR in the medical education literature by identifying and reviewing 160 papers. Most articles presented as ""case studies"" were not in fact CSR. Moreover, most articles failed to go beyond a 'we did this' account. The authors explore definitions of CSR, they examine dominant CSR methodologists, Yin, Stake and Merriam, and their respective approaches to CSR. They then set out some of the basic tenets of CSR (case definition, methods of data collection and analysis) and consider the logics of CSR (its structures, purposes, assumptions and symbols). CSR challenges are considered next (such as emic and etic perspectives; ethical complexities; generalizability; quality; and reporting and reflexivity.

Recently, we developed a novel drug delivery model using protein transduction domains (PTD) overcoming limitation of soluble recombinant proteins, including bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7). This study aims at evaluating the therapeutic effects of PTD-BMP-7 consisted of PTD and full-length BMP-7 on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related fibrosis. Human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) were then treated with TGF-β1 or TGF-β1 + PTD-BMP-7. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters were inserted into Sprague-Dawley rats, and these rats were infused intra-peritoneally with saline, peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) or PDF + PTD-BMP-7. In vitro, TGF-β1 treatment significantly increased fibronectin, type I collagen, α-SMA and Snail expression, while reducing E-cadherin expression in HPMCs (P < .001). PTD-BMP-7 treatment ameliorated TGF-β1-induced fibronectin, type I collagen, α-SMA and Snail expression, and restored E-cadherin expression in HPMCs (P < .001). In vivo, the expressions of EMT-related molecules and the thickness of the sub-mesothelial layer were significantly increased in the peritoneum of rats treated with PDF, and these changes were significantly abrogated by the intra-peritoneal administration of PTD-BMP-7. PTD-BMP-7 treatment significantly inhibited the progression of established PD fibrosis. These findings suggest that PTD-BMP-7, as a prodrug of BMP-7, can be an effective therapeutic agent for peritoneal fibrosis in PD patients.","Kim, Seonghun; Shin, Dong Ho; Nam, Bo Young; Kang, Hye-Young; Park, Jimin; Wu, Meiyan; Kim, Nam Hee; Kim, Hyun Sil; Park, Jung Tak; Han, Seung Hyeok; Kang, Shin-Wook; Yook, Jong In; Yoo, Tae-Hyun",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.15992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079436/,185

They have proved to be an alternative, environmentally friendly and attractive candidate for the replacement of petroleum-based plastics in many applications. Many bacteria synthesize these compounds as an intracellular carbon and energy compound usually under unbalanced growth conditions. Biodegradability and biocompatibility of different PHA has been studied in cell culture systems or in an animal host during the last few decades. Such investigations have proposed that PHA can be used as biomaterials for applications in conventional medical devices such as sutures, patches, meshes, implants, and tissue engineering scaffolds as well. Moreover, findings related to encapsulation capability and degradation kinetics of some PHA polymers has paved their way for development of controlled drug delivery systems. The present review discusses about bio-plastics, their characteristics, examines the key findings and recent advances highlighting the usage of bio-plastics in different medical devices. The patents concerning to PHA application in biomedical field have been also enlisted that will provide a brief overview of the status of research in bio-plastic. This would help medical researchers and practitioners to replace the synthetic plastics aids that are currently being used. Simultaneously, it could also prove to be a strong step in reducing the plastic pollution that surged abruptly due to the COVID-19 medical waste.","Ansari, Sabbir; Sami, Neha; Yasin, Durdana; Ahmad, Nazia; Fatma, Tasneem",International journal of biological macromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.04.171; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932421/,185
106878,Predictive factors of maternal hypothermia during Cesarean delivery: a prospective cohort study.,2017,"BACKGROUND The accepted ""one-size-fits-all"" dose strategy for prophylactic enoxaparin may not optimize the medication's risks and benefits after surgical procedures. The authors hypothesized that weight-based administration might improve the pharmacokinetics of prophylactic enoxaparin when compared to fixed-dose administration. METHODS The FIxed or Variable Enoxaparin (FIVE) trial was a randomized, double-blind trial that compared the pharmacokinetic and clinical outcomes of patients assigned randomly to postoperative venous thromboembolism prophylaxis using enoxaparin 40 mg twice daily or enoxaparin 0.5 mg/kg twice daily. Patients were randomized after surgery and received the first enoxaparin dose at 8 hours after surgery. Primary hypotheses were (1) weight-based administration is noninferior to a fixed dose for avoiding underanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa <0.2 IU/ml) and (2) weight-based administration is superior to fixed-dose administration for avoiding overanticoagulation (anti-factor Xa >0.4 IU/ml). Secondary endpoints were 90-day venous thromboembolism and bleeding. RESULTS In total, 295 patients were randomized, with 151 assigned to fixed-dose and 144 to weight-based administration of enoxaparin. For avoidance of underanticoagulation, weight-based administration had a greater effectiveness (79.9 percent versus 76.6 percent); the 3.3 percent (95 percent CI, -7.5 to 12.5 percent) greater effectiveness achieved statistically significant noninferiority relative to the a priori specified -12 percent noninferiority margin (p = 0.004). For avoidance of overanticoagulation, weight-based enoxaparin administration was superior to fixed-dose administration (90.6 percent versus 82.2 percent); the 8.4 percent (95 percent CI, 0.1 to 16.6 percent) greater effectiveness showed significant safety superiority (p = 0.046). Ninety-day venous thromboembolism and major bleeding were not different between fixed-dose and weight-based cohorts (0.66 percent versus 0.69 percent, p = 0.98; 3.3 percent versus 4.2 percent, p = 0.72, respectively). CONCLUSION Weight-based administration showed superior pharmacokinetics for avoidance of underanticoagulation and overanticoagulation in postoperative patients receiving prophylactic enoxaparin.

To reflect this feature, we incorporate the media effect and a critical number of infected cases into the disease transmission rate and consider an susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with logistic growth. Our model analysis shows that early media alert and strong media effects are preferable to decrease the numbers of infected cases at endemic equilibria. Furthermore, we noticed that the model may have up to three endemic equilibria and bi-stability can occur in a threshold interval for the critical number. Note that the interval depends on parameters for the focal disease and the media effect. It is possible to roughly estimate the interval for re-emerging diseases in a given region. Therefore, the result could be useful to health policymakers. Global stability is also obtained when the model admits a unique endemic equilibrium.","Wang, Lianwen; Zhou, Da; Liu, Zhijun; Xu, Dashun; Zhang, Xinan",Journal of biological dynamics,https://doi.org/10.1080/17513758.2016.1181212; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27145100/,185
107456,Frequency of post-stroke electroencephalographic epileptiform activity - a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,2017,"OBJECTIVES Treatment with medications for opioid use disorder such as buprenorphine improves patient morbidity and mortality as well as treatment adherence, an important component of patient care. Buprenorphine is combined with naloxone to reduce misuse; and, when taken sublingually, naloxone is poorly absorbed. Urine testing for buprenorphine is a common way to monitor adherence. Some patients who want to appear adherent may directly tamper with their urine by adding buprenorphine to their urine to allow for the detection without ingestion. Practitioners may rely upon the concentration of buprenorphine and the metabolite, norbuprenorphine, and utilize the ratio of metabolite to parent compound (norbuprenorphine:buprenorphine - N:B ratio) to discern possible evidence of tampering; however, there remains debate as to what specific ratio may signify this practice. Testing for naloxone may also help determine if urine tampering occurred as only low naloxone concentrations are found in the urine when taken by a sublingual route. METHODS To determine a reliable N:B ratio that may be used to identify possible urine tampering by adding parent drug directly to urine, we examined 136,605 urine samples for quantitative concentrations of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine by LC-MS/MS performed at a commercial laboratory. After identifying abnormal ratios (<0.02), we then compared them with naloxone concentrations and specimen validity testing, other markers that may coincide with specimen tampering of this type. RESULTS Correlating urinary buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine concentrations, we found 2 distinct patient populations, which could be distinguished by N:B ratios ranging from 0.01 to 0.2. In addition, while the distribution of urine naloxone concentrations itself did not demonstrate distinct populations, naloxone was able to further flag potential tampered specimens when combined with N:B ratios. Abnormal specimen validity testing was additionally found more commonly in cases with N:B ratios <0.02. CONCLUSIONS This comprehensive study compared N:B ratios with naloxone concentrations and specimen validity testing. This study suggests that a N:B ratio of <0.02 in concert with high naloxone concentrations (>1000 ng/ml) can help to identify potential cases of tampered urine samples.","Warrington, Jill S; Warrington, Gregory S; Francis-Fath, Samuel; Brooklyn, John",Journal of addiction medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530884/,185

This study aims to compare these two surgical techniques. METHODS All patients who underwent LRR because of RP between January 2000 and January 2012 at Cleveland Clinic Florida (Weston, FL, USA) were identified, and all relevant characteristics were entered in a database. This same analysis was also conducted for all patients who underwent LVR in the Meander Medical Center (Amersfoort, the Netherlands) between January 2004 and January 2012. These two cohorts were retrospectively compared with regard to complications, functional results and recurrence. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (all female, mean age 50.1 years) were included in the LRR cohort at a mean follow-up of 57 (range 2-140; standard deviation (SD) ± 41.2) months. The LVR group consisted of 40 patients (36 females and 4 males) with a mean age of 67.0 years and a mean follow-up of 42 (range 2-82; SD ± 23.8) months. A significant reduction in constipation was observed in both cohorts after surgery: 57 versus 21% after LRR and 55 versus 23% after LVR (both P < 0.05). The incidence of incontinence also significantly decreased in both groups: 15% after LVR (55% before surgery) and 4% after LRR (61 % before surgery). Direct comparison of these two techniques showed a trend to significance (P = 0.09). Significantly, more complications occurred after LRR (n = 9: 1 major, 8 minor) then after LVR (n = 3: 2 major, 1 minor) (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Both LVR and LRR are effective for the treatment for RP. Although both techniques offer significant improvements in functional symptoms, continence may be better after LRR. However, LRR also had a higher complication rate then did LVR.","Formijne Jonkers, H A; Maya, A; Draaisma, W A; Bemelman, W A; Broeders, I A; Consten, E C J; Wexner, S D",Techniques in coloproctology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10151-014-1122-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24500726/,185

RECENT FINDINGS A range of imaging techniques is available for evaluation of patients with aortic disease. Magnetic resonance blood flow imaging can identify atherosclerosis prone aortic regions and may be useful for predicting aneurysm growth. Computational modeling can demonstrate significant differences in wall stress between abdominal aortic aneurysms of similar size and may better predict rupture than diameter alone. Metabolic imaging with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET [(FDG)-PET] can identify focal aortic wall inflammation that may portend rapid progression of disease. Molecular imaging with probes that target collagen and elastin can directly exhibit changes in the vessel wall associated with disease. SUMMARY The complexity of aortic disease is more fully revealed with new functional imaging techniques than with conventional anatomic analysis alone. This may better inform surveillance imaging regimens, medical management and decisions regarding early intervention for aortic disease.","Hope, Michael D; Hope, Thomas A",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0b013e3283644beb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24030165/,185

110062,Effect and Acceptability of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Program on Patients With Elevated Blood Pressure or Hypertension: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,2020-11-02,"BACKGROUND Impaired alveolar fluid clearance, determined in part by alveolar sodium transport, is associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Nasal sodium transport may reflect alveolar transport. The primary objective of this prospective, observational study was to determine if reduced nasal sodium transport, as measured by nasal potential difference (NPD), was predictive of the development of and outcome from ARDS. METHODS NPD was measured in 15 healthy controls and in 88 patients: 40 mechanically ventilated patients defined as 'at-risk' for ARDS, 61 mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS (13 who were previously included in the 'at-risk' group) and 8 ARDS survivors on the ward. RESULTS In at-risk subjects, maximum NPD (mNPD) was greater in those who developed ARDS (difference -8.4 mV; 95% CI -13.8 to -3.7; p=0.005) and increased mNPD predicted the development of ARDS before its onset (area under the curve (AUC) 0.75; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89). In the ARDS group, mNPD was not significantly different for survivors and non-survivors (p=0.076), and mNPD was a modest predictor of death (AUC 0.60; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75). mNPD was greater in subjects with ARDS (-30.8 mV) than in at-risk subjects (-24.2 mV) and controls (-19.9 mV) (p<0.001). NPD values were not significantly different for survivors and controls (p=0.18). CONCLUSIONS Increased NPD predicts the development of ARDS in at-risk subjects but does not predict mortality. NPD increases before ARDS develops, is greater during ARDS, but is not significantly different for controls and survivors. These results may reflect the upregulated sodium transport necessary for alveolar fluid clearance in ARDS. NPD may be useful as a biomarker of endogenous mechanisms to stimulate sodium transport. Larger studies are now needed to confirm these associations and predictive performance.","Mac Sweeney, Rob; Reddy, Kiran; Davies, Jane C; Parker, Mike; Kelly, Barry; Elborn, J Stuart; Conlon, John; Verghis, Rejina M; Calfee, Carolyn S; Matthay, Michael A; Alton, Eric W F W; McAuley, Daniel F",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2020-215587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33888572/,185

Open notes is an established best practice, but open results remains controversial, especially for diseases associated with stigma, morbidity, and mortality. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with all three of these effects and represents an ideal disease for the study of open results for sensitive test results. OBJECTIVES This study evaluates patient perspectives related to receiving COVID-19 test results via an online patient portal prior to discussion with a clinician. METHODS We surveyed adults who underwent COVID-19 testing between March 1, 2020 and October 21, 2020 who agreed to be directly contacted about COVID-19-related research about their perspectives on receiving test results via a patient portal. We evaluated user roles (i.e., patient vs. care partner), demographic information, ease of use, impact of immediate release, notification of results, impact of viewing results on health management, and importance of sharing results with others. RESULTS Users were mostly patients themselves. Users found the portal easy to use but expressed mixed preferences about the means of notification of result availability (e.g., email, text, or phone call). Users found immediate access to results useful for managing their health, employment, and family/childcare. Many users shared their results and encouraged others to get tested. Our cohort consisted mostly of non-Hispanic white, highly educated, English-speaking patients. CONCLUSION Overall, patients found open results useful for COVID-19 testing and few expressed increased worries from receiving their results via the patient portal.

The general mortality rate of the COVID-19 was about 3%. However, the mortality risk seems to be a significant increase in elderly and cases with chronic disease, who are more likely to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). There still lacks effective methods for ARDS of COVID-19 patients and the prognosis was poor. Mesenchyma stem cells (MSCs) based treatment has the advantage of targeting numerous pathophysiological components of ARDS by secreting a series of cell factors, exerting anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, immunomodulatory, antiapoptotic, and proangiogenic effects, resulting in significant structural and functional recovery following ARDS in various preclinical models. And recently pilot clinical studies indicated MSCs based therapy was promise in treatment of ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2.

111883,Non-pharmacological interventions to reduce sedation/general anaesthesia in paediatric patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging: A systematic review and meta-analysis protocol.,2021-05-15,"BACKGROUND In the last few decades, endoscopic treatment of early neoplastic lesions in the esophagus has established itself as a valid and less invasive alternative to surgical resection. Endoscopic resection (ER) is the cornerstone of endoscopic therapy. Next to the curative potential of ER, by removing neoplastic lesions, ER may also serve as a diagnostic tool. The relatively large tissue specimens obtained with ER enable accurate histological staging of a lesion, allowing for optimal decision-making for further patient management. ER was pioneered in Japan, mainly for the resection of gastric lesions and squamous esophageal neoplasia, and also Western countries have been increasingly implementing ER in the treatment of early gastroesophageal neoplasia, mostly associated with Barrett's esophagus (BE). In BE, however, there is still a risk of metachronous lesions in the remainder of the Barrett's after focal ER. Additional treatment of all Barrett's mucosa is therefore advised. Currently, the most effective method for this is by using radiofrequency ablation (RFA). This review will provide an overview of indications for ER and RFA. Key Messages and Conclusions: Endoscopic management of early esophageal neoplasia is a safe and valid alternative to surgery and is nowadays the treatment of choice. ER is the mainstay of endoscopic management of early esophageal neoplasia since it allows for removal of neoplastic lesions and provides a large tissue specimen for histological evaluation. In case of early neoplasia in BE, focal ER should be complemented by eradication of the remaining Barrett's mucosa. RFA has proven to be a safe and effective modality to achieve complete eradication of Barrett's mucosa.","Belghazi, Kamar; Bergman, Jacques; Pouw, Roos E",Digestive diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000445221; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27333327/,185

They are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses with positive polarity transmitted by arthropod vectors like mosquitoes or ticks, responsible for a significant and growing number of human deaths and illnesses. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) are highly structured and contain conserved cis-acting RNA elements that participate in viral translation, replication and host adaptation. Despite their role in fiaviviruses replication, few high-resolution structural studies have investigated the RNA elements required for viral replication. Here we report the NMR structures of stem-loop B from WNV and DENV4 viruses. Because this element is required for cyclization of the genome and the activity of the replicative viral enzymes, viral replication rates are sensitive to even small changes in these RNAs. Therefore, this work provides structural insight into a new drug target to reduce flavivirus replication rates.","Sharma, Shrikant; Varani, Gabriele",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.07.115; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807496/,185

116297,Everolimus-Eluting Bioresorbable Scaffolds Versus Everolimus-Eluting Metallic Stents.,2017,"Increasing geographical mobility and international travel augment the ease and speed by which infectious diseases can spread across large distances. It is therefore incumbent upon each state to ensure that immunisation programmes are effective and that herd immunity is achieved. Across Europe, a range of immunisation policies exist: compulsion, the offer of financial incentives to parents or healthcare professionals, social and professional pressure, or simply the dissemination of clear information and advice. Until recently, immunisation against particular communicable diseases was compulsory in Italy. The Italian National Vaccination Plan (NVP) (2005-7) paved the way for regions to suspend the sanctions associated with compulsory vaccinations for children when certain criteria are met--for example when immunisation coverage is high and when effective monitoring/surveillance systems are in place--and thus marked a milestone in the move from compulsory to voluntary immunisation. The forthcoming NVP for 2008-10 confirms the liberal approach to vaccination in Italy as it entrusts to the regions responsibility for the achievement and maintenance of herd immunity. This paper reviews the arguments for and against compulsory and voluntary immunisation in relation to the Italian NVP (2005-7) and in the context of the diverse immunisation policies that exist across Europe. It concludes with cautious support for the NVP and an associated shift from compulsory to voluntary immunisation in Italy, and draws similarities between issues concerning regional variation in immunisation policy in Italy and national variation in immunisation policy across Europe and beyond.","Moran, N E; Gainotti, S; Petrini, C",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/jme.2007.022343; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18757637/,185

The present study aimed to investigate miR-518b expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and determine its clinical significance and biological function in this malignancy. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was performed to assess miR-518b expression in NSCLC. The diagnostic value of miR-518b was determined via a receiver operating characteristic curve, while its prognostic value was assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to determine the functional role of miR-518b in NSCLC progression. The results demonstrated that miR-518b expression was upregulated in NSCLC serum, tissues and cell lines compared with the corresponding normal controls. Furthermore, high miR-518b expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage, as well as poor overall survival in patients with NSCLC. Serum miR-518b expression was identified as a candidate diagnostic biomarker for NSCLC, with sensitivity of 88.1% and specificity of 81.7%. Furthermore, the cell experiments indicated that NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were enhanced following overexpression of miR-518b; however, these effects were reversed following miR-518b knockdown. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that elevated miR-518b expression in NSCLC serves a potential oncogenic role by facilitating tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and thus may serve as a candidate diagnostic and prognostic biomarker.","Zhang, Xinfang; Hu, Ying; Gong, Cuixue; Zhang, Chunjie",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2020.11667; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724361/,185

117130,Suicide risk during the lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Colombia.,2020-06-26,"This study investigated the in vivo properties of two heavy chain antibody fragments (V(H)H), ni3A and pa2H, to differentially detect vascular or parenchymal amyloid-β deposits characteristic for Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Blood clearance and biodistribution including brain uptake were assessed by bolus injection of radiolabeled V(H)H in APP/PS1 mice or wildtype littermates. In addition, in vivo specificity for Aβ was examined in more detail with fluorescently labeled V(H)H by circumventing the blood-brain barrier via direct application or intracarotid co-injection with mannitol. All V(H)H showed rapid renal clearance (10-20 min). Twenty-four hours post-injection (99m)Tc-pa2H resulted in a small yet significant higher cerebral uptake in the APP/PS1 animals. No difference in brain uptake were observed for (99m)Tc-ni3A or DTPA((111)In)-pa2H, which lacked additional peptide tags to investigate further clinical applicability. In vivo specificity for Aβ was confirmed for both fluorescently labeled V(H)H, where pa2H remained readily detectable for 24 hours or more after injection. Furthermore, both V(H)H showed affinity for parenchymal and vascular deposits, this in contrast to human tissue, where ni3A specifically targeted only vascular Aβ. Despite a brain uptake that is as yet too low for in vivo imaging, this study provides evidence that V(H)H detect Aβ deposits in vivo, with high selectivity and favorable in vivo characteristics, making them promising tools for further development as diagnostic agents for the distinctive detection of different Aβ deposits.","Nabuurs, Rob J A; Rutgers, Kim S; Welling, Mick M; Metaxas, Athanasios; de Backer, Maaike E; Rotman, Maarten; Bacskai, Brian J; van Buchem, Mark A; van der Maarel, Silvère M; van der Weerd, Louise",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0038284; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22675537/,185
117398,Association between body mass index and urinary tract infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational cohort studies.,2021-01-09,"BACKGROUND Transvaginal rigid-hybrid transluminal endoscopic cholecystectomy (tvCCE) has become a routine procedure in some laparoscopic departments in recent years. Although intraoperative cholangiography is an important adjunct to cholecystectomy, its feasibility and safety in tvCCE have not been demonstrated to date. METHODS Patients undergoing tvCCE between April and October 2012 were included in this study. An intraoperative cholangiogram was obtained routinely for all the patients. Patient characteristics, operation data, feasibility, and duration of the cholangiography as well as the postoperative course were recorded prospectively. RESULTS For 32 (97 %) of the 33 patients enrolled in this study, intraoperative cholangiography could be performed successfully. The median duration of cholangiography was 6 min (interquartile range, 4-7 min). Common bile duct stones were detected in three patients (10 %). Laparoscopic bile duct revision with the aid of one additional port was successful in two of these patients. One patient needed postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography due to the impossibility of extracting an impacted prepapillary concrement. One operation was converted to a four-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One additional port was used in 11 patients (33 %) and two additional ports in three patients (9 %). Three intraoperative minor complications (9 %) and one postoperative minor complication (3 %) occurred. CONCLUSIONS Intraoperative cholangiography during tvCCE is feasible, safe, and easy to perform. The need for intraoperative cholangiography no longer represents a contraindication for tvCCE.","Ogredici, Onder; Linke, Georg R; Lamm, Sebastian; Rosenthal, Rachel; Zerz, Andreas; Steinemann, Daniel C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-013-3246-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24141474/,185
117500,Highlights from the first ever virtual American College of Cardiology World Congress of Cardiology 2020 (ACC.20/WCC).,2020-05-14,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The aim of this study was to assess the frequency and extent of early diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) lesion reversal after endovascular therapy and to determine whether early reversal is sustained or transient. METHODS MRI with DWI perfusion imaging was performed before (DWI 1) and within 12 hours after (DWI 2) endovascular treatment; follow-up MRI was obtained on day 5. Both DWIs were coregistered to follow-up MRI. Early DWI reversal was defined as the volume of the DWI 1 lesion that was not superimposed on the DWI 2 lesion. Permanent reversal was the volume of the DWI 1 lesion not superimposed on the day 5 infarct volume. Associations between early DWI reversal and clinical outcomes in patients with and without reperfusion were assessed. RESULTS A total of 110 patients had technically adequate DWI before endovascular therapy (performed median [interquartile range], 4.5 [2.8-6.2] hours after onset); 60 were eligible for this study. Thirty-two percent had early DWI reversal >10 mL; 17% had sustained reversal. The median volume of permanent reversal at 5 days was 3 mL (interquartile range, 1.7-7.0). Only 2 patients (3%) had a final infarct volume that was smaller than their baseline DWI lesion. Early DWI reversal was not an independent predictor of clinical outcome and was not associated with early reperfusion. CONCLUSIONS Early DWI reversal occurred in about one third of patients after endovascular therapy; however, reversal was often transient and was not associated with a significant volume of tissue salvage or favorable clinical outcome.","Inoue, Manabu; Mlynash, Michael; Christensen, Soren; Wheeler, Hayley M; Straka, Matus; Tipirneni, Aaryani; Kemp, Stephanie M; Zaharchuk, Greg; Olivot, Jean-Marc; Bammer, Roland; Lansberg, Maarten G; Albers, Gregory W",Stroke,https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.113.002135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24558095/,185

119661,"To whom do the results of the multicenter, randomized, controlled INSECT trial (ISRCTN 24023541) apply?--assessment of external validity.",2012,"Background : Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has necessitated public health responses on an unprecedented scale. Controlling infectious diseases requires understanding of the conditions that increase spread. Prior studies have identified sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic associations. Ireland offers an unusual opportunity to quantify how high infection rates in one country impacted cases in a neighbouring country. Methods : We analysed official statistics on confirmed COVID-19 cases on the island of Ireland for 52 weeks from March 2020. Our main research question was: Did higher cases in Northern Ireland (NI) impact the number of cases in the Republic of Ireland (ROI)? We used least squares regression to compare confirmed cases in ROI counties that border NI with the rest of the state. We included in our model sociodemographic, epidemiological and geographic factors. We employed the latitude of each county town as an instrumental variable to isolate a quasi-experimental estimate of the cross-border spread. Results : In the quasi-experimental framework, and controlling for population density, age distribution and circulatory disease prevalence, border counties had an extra 21.0 (95%CI: 8.4-33.6) confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1000 people. This equates to an estimated 9,611 additional cases in ROI, or 4% of the national total in the first year of the pandemic. Our results were substantively similar in non-experimental frameworks, with alternative additional predictors, and in sensitivity analyses. Additionally, population density in ROI counties was positively associated with confirmed cases and higher proportions of residents in the professional classes was negatively associated. Conclusion : On the island of Ireland during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, high infection rates in NI increased cases in the neighbouring ROI. Maximising co-ordination of pandemic responses among neighbouring countries is essential to minimising disease spread, and its associated disruptions to society and the economy. Socioeconomic disadvantage appeared to confer significant additional risk of spread.","Ahmed, Rakesh; May, Peter",HRB open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/hrbopenres.13263.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34355116/,185

The nurses work directly for the employer in an atmosphere designed to control employer costs and employee benefits. Their loyalty to the company and limited autonomy make it unlikely that they will represent the workers' interests. They generally embrace any expansion of their roles within the company. However, employers and government have made no serious effort to determine whether nurses can adequately take on these new functions and advance occupational health. A nurse-directed model carries the risk that nurses who are not knowledgeable enough about the law, or are overly committed to reducing costs, may overdelegate responsibilities, thereby aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of nursing. This overreaching is part of an ill-conceived effort to establish nursing as a profession with the greater independence, expertise, and control over training that longstanding professions such as medicine and law have achieved. An extensive literature devoted to the approval and acceptance of occupational health nursing exists, yet constructive criticism of occupational health nursing is almost nonexistent. Occupational health and safety is much too important to be largely relegated to an inadequately defined semi-profession, striving to attain higher professional status and control while lacking the expertise, power, professional standards, and autonomy required of a profession.","Draper, Elaine; Ladou, Joseph; Tennenhouse, Dan J",New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,https://doi.org/10.2190/ns.21.1.i; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21411426/,185

BACKGROUND The mental health specialty is facing a recruitment crisis in the United Kingdom but there is limited evidence about which factors encourage and discourage people to consider a career in mental health DESIGN: Quantitative, observational, online survey using a multiple ordinal logistic regression model to identify if there were any significant predictors of the extent to which participants would consider a career in mental health. The design and write up of the study were guided by the STROBE checklist. METHOD We gathered the views of 231 participants (female = 188, 81.7%) aged between 16 and 65 (mean = 22.7, SD = 8.9), using an online survey, the majority of whom were studying on, or graduates of, psychology/social studies degrees. Information was gathered about the extent to which a range of factors influenced consideration of a career in mental health. RESULTS The majority (71.2%) of participants reported that they would definitely or probably consider undertaking a career in mental health, and over half (51.4%) would consider a career as a mental health nurse. The ability to help others and receiving appropriate training required for the role were important career choice factors. Being female, having a mental health condition, and greater knowledge of mental health, were associated with a significantly greater likelihood of considering a career in mental health, while having had experience of working with people with mental health difficulties was significantly negatively associated. CONCLUSIONS Students and graduates of psychology and social studies degrees appear to be a large, untapped recruitment pool for mental health services.

No data exist on this topic. We, therefore, aimed to examine the risk of severe respiratory infection in children after pulmonary resection. METHODS A chart review was conducted on all pediatric patients who underwent pulmonary resection between August 1st, 2009 and January 31st, 2019. Collected data included patient characteristics, operation, complications and any admission for respiratory infection. RESULTS Fifty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Resections included lobectomy (45.6%), segmentectomy (14.0%), and wedge resection (40.4%). Twelve (21.1%) were immunocompromised and 6 (10.5%) had post-operative complications. Within 1 year of surgery, 2 (3.5%) patients were hospitalized for a viral upper respiratory illness (URI), 1 (1.8%) for bacterial pneumonia, and none due to influenza. CONCLUSION In the general pediatric population, the risk of admission for respiratory illness is 3-21%. At this institution, overall risk of respiratory infection after lung resection appears comparable to baseline community risk. Our findings could aid counseling pediatric patients and their families regarding the 1-year risk of infection after lung resection.","Fleming, Mark A; Xu, Thomas O; Gander, Jeffrey W; Levin, Daniel E",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-020-04851-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423100/,185

Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing in peripheral blood samples of 5 healthy donors and 13 patients with COVID-19, including moderate, severe and convalescent cases. Through determining the transcriptional profiles of immune cells, coupled with assembled T cell receptor and B cell receptor sequences, we analyzed the functional properties of immune cells. Most cell types in patients with COVID-19 showed a strong interferon-α response and an overall acute inflammatory response. Moreover, intensive expansion of highly cytotoxic effector T cell subsets, such as CD4+ effector-GNLY (granulysin), CD8+ effector-GNLY and NKT CD160, was associated with convalescence in moderate patients. In severe patients, the immune landscape featured a deranged interferon response, profound immune exhaustion with skewed T cell receptor repertoire and broad T cell expansion.

Adjuvant S-1 has been shown to be non-inferior to uracil and tegafur plus leucovorin in terms of disease-free survival. This study aims to confirm the non-inferiority of S-1 compared with capecitabine as adjuvant treatment in patients with stage III colorectal cancer. METHODS This study was an open-label, non-inferiority, randomised, phase 3, multicentre trial done in 56 Japanese centres to assess the non-inferiority of S-1 to capecitabine as adjuvant chemotherapy. Eligible patients were aged 20-80 years with stage III colorectal adenocarcinoma, as defined by the presence of an inferior margin of the primary tumour above the peritoneal reflection; R0 resection; and colectomy with D3 or D2 lymph node dissection. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive eight courses of capecitabine (1250 mg/m2 orally twice daily, days 1-14, every 21 days) or four courses of S-1 (40 mg/m2 orally twice daily, days 1-28, every 42 days). Randomisation was done via phone call, fax, or web-based systems to the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center and used a minimisation method with a random component adjusted by institution, tumour location (colon vs rectosigmoid and upper rectum), number of positive lymph node metastases (≤3 vs ≥4), and surgical technique (conventional vs non-touch isolation). The primary endpoint was disease-free survival with a non-inferiority margin for the hazard ratio (HR) set at 1·24, analysed by intention to treat. This trial was registered with UMIN Clinical Trial Registry, number UMIN000003272. FINDINGS Between March 1, 2010, and Aug 23, 2013, 1564 patients were randomly assigned to capecitabine (n=782) or S-1 (n=782), all of whom were included in the efficacy analysis; 777 patients in the capecitabine group and 768 in the S-1 group were included in the safety analysis. At the prespecified second interim analysis after final accrual, 258 (48%) of 535 required events were reported, and the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee recommended early publication because S-1 could not show non-inferiority compared with capecitabine for disease-free survival. With a median follow-up of 23·7 months (IQR 14·1-35·2), 3-year disease-free survival was 82·0% (95% CI 78·5-85·0) for the capecitabine group and 77·9% (74·1-81·1) for the S-1 group (HR 1·23, 99·05% CI 0·89-1·70; one-sided pnon-inferiority=0·46). The most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events in the capecitabine group were hand-foot skin reactions (123 [16%] of 777 patients), and in the S-1 group were diarrhoea (64 [8%] of 768 patients) and neutropenia (61 [8%]). There was one (<1%) treatment-related death in each group.

122107,Stratified meta-analysis of intermittent pneumatic compression of the lower limbs to prevent venous thromboembolism in hospitalized patients.,2013,"Skin grafting is often the only treatment for skin trauma when large areas of tissue are affected. This surgical intervention damages the deeper dermal layers of the skin with implications for wound healing and a risk of scar development. Photobiomodulation (PBM) therapy modulates biological processes in different tissues, with a positive effect on many cell types and pathways essential for wound healing. This study investigated the effect of fluorescent light energy (FLE) therapy, a novel type of PBM, on healing after skin grafting in a dermal fibrotic mouse model. Split-thickness human skin grafts were transplanted onto full-thickness excisional wounds on nude mice. Treated wounds were monitored, and excised xenografts were examined to assess healing and pathophysiological processes essential for developing chronic wounds or scarring. Results demonstrated that FLE treatment initially accelerated re-epithelialization and rete ridge formation, while later reduced neovascularization, collagen deposition, myofibroblast and mast cell accumulation, and connective tissue growth factor expression. While there was no visible difference in gross morphology, we found that FLE treatment promoted a balanced collagen remodeling. Collectively, these findings suggest that FLE has a conceivable effect at balancing healing after skin grafting, which reduces the risk of infections, chronic wound development, and fibrotic scarring.","Ding, Jie; Mellergaard, Maiken; Zhu, Zhensen; Kwan, Peter; Edge, Deirdre; Ma, Zengshuan; Hebert, Lise; Alrobaiea, Saad; Iwasaki, Takashi; Nielsen, Michael Canova Engelbrecht; Tredget, Edward E",Open medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/med-2021-0329; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522783/,185

The early recognition of rat pregnancy and confirmation of the exact embryonic day are vital. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation of maternal weight at the time of conception to its increase throughout gestation, aiming to develop a mathematical model, which can be used for the determination of the exact day of pregnancy, set the threshold, and monitor pregnancy from the onset. We studied a total of 173 Wistar rats with a mean body weight of 238.22 ± 34.9 g. After 72 h at the male's cages, we considered as Day 0 (D0) the day in which a copulatory plug or sperm was found during the vaginal smear examination. After that period the female animals were transferred into their cages, and weight monitoring started 14 days (D14) after D0, until parturition. Based on the statistical analysis, there is a correlation between maternal body weight at D0 and maternal body weight from D14 to D19. Moreover, the average weight gain from D14 to D19 is positively correlated to initial female body weight, while there is no correlation between each pregnant animal's weight from D14 to D19 and litter size. A mathematical model was developed as a tool for the verification of the day of pregnancy. In conclusion, continuous monitoring of maternal weight after D14 can be a reliable method for the recognition of pregnancy and determination of the exact gestational day.","Paronis, E; Samara, A; Polyzos, A; Spyropoulos, C; Kostomitsopoulos, N G",Laboratory animals,https://doi.org/10.1177/0023677214562846; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25488321/,185

The recent upsurge in the preference for oleogels (structured-oils) is due to being healthier than conventional solid fats. Present study reveals a simple means of modulating the mechanical and aesthetic properties of oleogels by physically mixing two isomeric low molecular weight gelators (LMWGs), mannitol dioctanoate (M8) and sorbitol dioctanoate (S8) which have contrasting oil-structuring behaviors; while M8 formed oleogels with higher gel strength, the S8 gels were more aesthetic, translucent, and appealing. The gelators were synthesized by enzyme catalysis (a GRAS or generally-regarded-as-safe protocol). The M8/S8 gels were systematically and thoroughly characterized using a suite of analytical techniques including minimum gelation concentration, gel melting point, rheological storage modulus, oil binding capacity, light transmittance and optical microscopy. The results showed % light transmittance, which is associated with aesthetics, increased from about 40% to 95% with increasing fraction of S8 from 0 to 1. Parameters associated with mechanical strength such rheology were also quite responsive to varying proportions of the gelators. Storage modulus (G', a rheological property) increased from about 3,300 Pa to about 12,500 Pa with increasing fraction of M8. As the fraction of M8 increased, solid-fat content (SFC) changed from about 3.51% to 2.08% while the oil binding capacity changed from about 70.2 to 100.0. This work enables the modulation of a gel's aesthetic and organoleptic properties via a simple formulation of stereoisomeric molecular gelators.","Samateh, Malick; Sagiri, Sateesh Sai; Sanni, Riliwan; Chee, Cindy; Satapathy, Sitakanta; John, George",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c00185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991807/,185

Our statistical analysis showed a strong positive association between profession (in favour of pharmacists) and pharmacogenetics knowledge p = 0.049; however, no correlation with experience p = 0.811 was found. A significant difference was reported between the knowledge of pharmacists and physicians p = 0.001 concerning drugs that need pharmacogenetics testing before being prescribed. The majority of respondents had no information about applying genetic tests in Syria before prescribing medications nor did they possess the knowledge regarding drugs that show differential responses in patients according to their unique genotypes. In our study, the percentage knowledge assessment score was low in general (mean ± Standard deviation, SD) (46% ± 13.9%). The majority of the respondents agreed that pharmacists should provide counselling to patients on the subject of pharmacogenetics. Respondents' opinions varied concerning making pharmacogenetics learning a priority. CONCLUSION Lack of pharmacogenetics knowledge was found amongst respondents in general. Our findings raise concerns about the lack of awareness amongst physicians, which may hinder the implementation of this crucial field in Syria. We suggest an emphasis on the role of education, training, and conducting genotyping research on the Syrian population.","Albitar, Lina; Alchamat, Ghalia Abou",BMC health services research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-021-07040-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34592972/,185
124567,Prophylactic antidepressant treatment following acute coronary syndrome: A systematic review of randomized controlled trials.,2017,"Coronavirus replication is associated with intracellular membrane rearrangements in infected cells, resulting in the formation of double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) and other membranous structures that are referred to as replicative organelles (ROs). The latter provide a structural scaffold for viral replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) and help to sequester RTC components from recognition by cellular factors involved in antiviral host responses. There is increasing evidence that plus-strand RNA (+RNA) virus replication, including RO formation and virion morphogenesis, affects cellular lipid metabolism and critically depends on enzymes involved in lipid synthesis and processing. Here, we investigated the role of cytosolic phospholipase A2α (cPLA2α) in coronavirus replication using a low-molecular-weight nonpeptidic inhibitor, pyrrolidine-2 (Py-2). The inhibition of cPLA2α activity, which produces lysophospholipids (LPLs) by cleaving at the sn-2 position of phospholipids, had profound effects on viral RNA and protein accumulation in human coronavirus 229E-infected Huh-7 cells. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that DMV formation in infected cells was significantly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor. Furthermore, we found that (i) viral RTCs colocalized with LPL-containing membranes, (ii) cellular LPL concentrations were increased in coronavirus-infected cells, and (iii) this increase was diminished in the presence of the cPLA2α inhibitor Py-2. Py-2 also displayed antiviral activities against other viruses representing the Coronaviridae and Togaviridae families, while members of the Picornaviridae were not affected. Taken together, the study provides evidence that cPLA2α activity is critically involved in the replication of various +RNA virus families and may thus represent a candidate target for broad-spectrum antiviral drug development.IMPORTANCE Examples of highly conserved RNA virus proteins that qualify as drug targets for broad-spectrum antivirals remain scarce, resulting in increased efforts to identify and specifically inhibit cellular functions that are essential for the replication of RNA viruses belonging to different genera and families. The present study supports and extends previous conclusions that enzymes involved in cellular lipid metabolism may be tractable targets for broad-spectrum antivirals. We obtained evidence to show that a cellular phospholipase, cPLA2α, which releases fatty acid from the sn-2 position of membrane-associated glycerophospholipids, is critically involved in coronavirus replication, most likely by producing lysophospholipids that are required to form the specialized membrane compartments in which viral RNA synthesis takes place. The importance of this enzyme in coronavirus replication and DMV formation is supported by several lines of evidence, including confocal and electron microscopy, viral replication, and lipidomics studies of coronavirus-infected cells treated with a highly specific cPLA2α inhibitor.","Müller, Christin; Hardt, Martin; Schwudke, Dominik; Neuman, Benjamin W; Pleschka, Stephan; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01463-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29167338/,185
124572,Point-counterpoint: Indirect calorimetry Is essential for optimal nutrition therapy in the intensive care unit.,2021-03-18,"BACKGROUND Evaluating a pharmacovigilance system helps identify its deficiencies and could facilitate measures to remedy and improve the quantity and quality of adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports and other opportunities for pharmacovigilance systems strengthening. This study aimed to evaluate the status of pharmacovigilance in Iran using the World Health Organization (WHO) pharmacovigilance indicators with the prospect of identifying the gaps and areas for improvement. METHODS This study was conducted in 2 parts. The first part included a secondary analysis of the national data obtained from the Iranian National Pharmacovigilance Center (PVC) using a structured data collection form based on WHO core pharmacovigilance indicators. In the second part, a 3-month prospective study was carried out to investigate 2 outcome indicators, ie, length of stay and costs of medicine-related hospitalization in all patients of 2 main referral hospitals in the southeast and north of Iran. RESULTS Iran has a PVC with national policy, trained staff, and a statutory budget. In 2017, the number of ADR reports was 15.0 per 100 000 population, and 262 signals were detected during the preceding 5 years. The average length of stay and costs of medicine-related hospitalization were 5 days and US$817.2 in Afzalipour hospital and 6.6 days and US$306.7 in Razi hospital, respectively. The status of pharmacovigilance in the Iranian public health programs (PHPs) is unknown, and most of the indicators could not be assessed. CONCLUSION A robust pharmacovigilance system is a pivotal part of the overall medicines regulatory system. The Iranian pharmacovigilance system has relatively the proper structural condition. Though the underreporting of ADRs, especially medicine-related deaths, is an important issue, and some indicators' status was unclear. The Iranian pharmacovigilance program requires a higher prioritization, particularly in the PHPs, a greater allocation of resources, and cross-sectoral cooperation to bolster and achieve the pharmacovigilance objectives.","Khalili, Malahat; Sharifi, Hamid; Mesgarpour, Bita; Kheirandish, Mehrnaz; Olsson, Sten; Javidnikou, Naghmeh; Haghdoost, Ali Akbar",International journal of health policy and management,https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33590736/,185

METHODS The technique was performed on five patients who presented with fasciotomy wounds on both upper and lower extremities, varying in size, observed after compartment syndrome due to different causes. The average width of the defects for which primary closure was planned was 8.8 cm. Following the fasciotomy incision, absorbable barbed sutures were inserted through the dermal tissue around the wound similar to that of a subcuticular closure, but left loose, after which closed dressing was applied. During the clinical follow-up, with the decrease in tissue edema and tightness around the wound, the barbed suture was tightened at bedside every 48-72 hours. RESULTS At the end of this gradual closure, all the fasciotomy defects were primarily closed within an average of 8.6 days. All the patients had complete and uncomplicated primary closure with the exception of one with high-voltage electrical burn injury, who developed necrosis in the distal part of the defect, and was treated by secondary healing. CONCLUSION The gradual fasciotomy closure technique with barbed suture seems to be an easy, rapid and effective method.","Ozyurtlu, Mustafa; Altınkaya, Süleyman; Baltu, Yahya; Ozgenel, Güzin Yeşim",Ulusal travma ve acil cerrahi dergisi = Turkish journal of trauma & emergency surgery : TJTES,https://doi.org/10.5505/tjtes.2014.54077; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24936841/,185

The 2019-nCoV first broke out in Wuhan and subsequently spreads worldwide owing to its extreme transmission efficiency. The fact that the COVID-19 cases and mortalities are reported in globally and the WHO has declared this outbreak as the pandemic. The international health authorities have focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as search for therapies able to counter the disease severity. Due to the lack of known specific, effective and proven therapies as well as the situation of public-health emergency, drug repurposing appears to be the best armour to find therapeutic solution against 2019-nCoV infection. Repurposing anti-malarial drugs, chloroquine (CQ)/ hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) have shown efficacy to inhibit most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus. These CQ analogues have shown potential efficacy to inhibit 2019-nCoV in vitro that lead to focus in several future clinical trials. This review discusses the possible effective roles and mechanisms of CQ analogues for interfering with the 2019-nCoV replication cycle and infection.","Al-Bari, Md Abdul Alim",Current drug targets,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389450121666200617133142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32552642/,185

We studied the nature of eosinophilic inflammation in COPD prospectively to examine the stability of this phenotype and its dynamics across exacerbations, and its associations with clinical phenotype, exacerbations and infection.127 patients aged 40-85 years with moderate to very severe COPD underwent repeated blood and sputum sampling at stable visits and within 72 h of exacerbation for 1 year.Blood eosinophils ≥2% was prevalent at baseline, and predicted both predominantly raised stable-state eosinophils across the year (area under the curve 0.841, 95% CI 0.755-0.928) and increased risk of eosinophilic inflammation at exacerbation (OR 9.16; p<0.001). Eosinophils ≥2% at exacerbation and eosinophil predominance at stable visits were associated with a lower risk of bacterial presence at exacerbation (OR 0.49; p=0.049 and OR 0.25; p=0.065, respectively). Bacterial infection at exacerbation was highly seasonal (winter versus summer OR 4.74; p=0.011) in predominantly eosinophilic patients.Eosinophilic inflammation is a common and stable phenotype in COPD.

Midzone cross-linkers and motors display only modest preferences for antiparallel filaments, and duplicated poles are initially tethered together, an arrangement that instead favors parallel interactions. Pivoting of microtubules around spindle poles might help overcome this geometric bias, but the intrinsic pivoting flexibility of the microtubule-pole interface has not been directly measured, nor has its importance during early spindle assembly been tested. By measuring the pivoting of microtubules around isolated yeast spindle poles, we show that pivoting flexibility can be modified by mutating a microtubule-anchoring pole component, Spc110. By engineering mutants with different flexibilities, we establish the importance of pivoting in vivo for timely pole separation. Our results suggest that passive thermal pivoting can bring microtubules from side-by-side poles into initial contact, but active minus end-directed force generation will be needed to achieve antiparallel alignment.","Fong, Kimberly K; Davis, Trisha N; Asbury, Charles L",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202007193; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33464308/,185

On the basis of IC50 values, we find that hydroxyl analogues 3 and 4 are only moderately less active than 1, while analogue 2 experiences a heavily diminished activity. Cytofluorimetric analyses of MCF-7 cells treated with HyVLMs suggest that the latter depolarize mitochondria, thus retaining the typical VLM behavior. It is likely that C6 cells, for which the exceptionally potent cytotoxicity of VLM has never reported previously, follow the same fate, as evidenced by alteration of mitochondrial morphology upon incubation with each ionophore.","Iacobazzi, Rosa M; Annese, Cosimo; Azzariti, Amalia; D'Accolti, Lucia; Franco, Massimo; Fusco, Caterina; La Piana, Gianluigi; Laquintana, Valentino; Denora, Nunzio",ACS medicinal chemistry letters,https://doi.org/10.1021/ml400300q; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24900628/,185

Iontophoresis was applied for 60 min at a 0.4 mA/sq·cm current density, while low-frequency sonophoresis was applied at a 20 kHz frequency (2 min application, and 6.9 W/sq·cm intensity). The treated skin was characterized by dye binding, transepidermal water loss, skin electrical resistance, and skin temperature measurement. Both sonophoresis and iontophoresis resulted in a significant reduction in skin electrical resistance as well as a marked increase in transepidermal water loss value (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the ultrasonic waves resulted in a significant increase in skin temperature (p < 0.05). In permeation studies, the use of iontophoresis led to a significantly higher drug permeability than the untreated group (n = 4, p < 0.05). The skin became markedly more permeable to methotrexate after the treatment by sonophoresis than by iontophoresis (p < 0.01). A synergistic effect for the combined application of sonophoresis and iontophoresis was also observed.

METHODS Seventy-eight eyes of 78 consecutive patients diagnosed with MPH were studied. Quantitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters including central foveal thickness, parafoveal thickness, parafoveal inner and outer retinal thickness (PIRT and PORT), pseudohole depth, pseudohole diameter, and inner nuclear layer (INL) angulation were measured and the morphologic features of the inner retina (disorganization of retinal inner layers (DRIL)) and the photoreceptor layer (external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoid zone (EZ), interdigitation zone (IZ), and cotton ball sign) were determined. Associations between OCT parameters and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were analyzed. Based on the location of the inner margin of INL, all patients were divided into three stages and the mean comparison between the three stages was analyzed. RESULTS PIRT (r = 0.6489; p < 0.0001) and pseudohole depth (r = 0.5266; p < 0.0001) had a statistically significant correlation with BCVA. Statistically significant visual acuity differences were found in eyes with DRIL (p < 0.001) and IZ disruption (p = 0.018), but not in ELM disruption (p = 0.916), EZ disruption (p = 0.581), and cotton ball sign (p = 0.075). According to the univariate and multivariate regression analyses, PIRT was associated with BCVA in both univariate (p < 0.001) and multivariate (p = 0.002) regression analyses. Defect diameters of both ELM (p = 0.025) and IZ (p = 0.006) were associated with BCVA in univariate regression analysis, but not in multivariate regression analysis. INL angulation and the ratio of the IZ disruption was significantly different in the three groups. Stage 3 (95.8%) had significantly higher disrupted IZ ratio than stage 1 (40%) and stage 2 (65.5%). The BCVA of stages 1, 2, and 3 were identified as 0.06 ± 0.07 (20/23 Snellen equivalent), 0.23 ± 0.17 (20/34 Snellen equivalent), and 0.48 ± 0.23 (20/60 Snellen equivalent), respectively, and the differences in BCVA between the three groups were significant (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION The parameters related to visual acuity were PIRT, pseudohole depth, DRIL, and IZ. The stage classification proposed in this study included morphologic changes of the inner retina and photoreceptor layer and is likely to be clinically useful for showing the severity of the MPH.","Ku, Hee Chan; Cho, Eun Hyung; Han, Jeong Mo; Lee, Eun Koo; Park, Young-Hoon",Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00417-020-04822-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32648155/,185

The most recent increase in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections over July to August 2020 resulted in more than 100 new cases per day for a prolonged period. The increased numbers of critically ill patients requiring ICU admission posed a capacity challenge to ICUs across the territory, and it may be reasonably anticipated that should a substantially larger outbreak occur, ICU services will be overwhelmed. Therefore, a transparent and fair prioritisation process for decisions regarding patient ICU admission is urgently required.

RESULTS In the pandemic period, it was found that there was an 84% decrease in outpatient admissions, a 43% decrease in inpatients, and a 75% decrease in emergency services. During the pandemic period, in outpatient setting, male and younger case admissions increased, admissions with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and interstitial lung diseases decreased, whereas the frequency of admission to asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary thromboembolism increased. In the period of the pandemic, patients with asthma, COPD, and lung cancer were less hospitalized, whereas patients with pulmonary thromboembolism, pneumonia, and pleural effusion were hospitalized more.

137164,[Advanced organ support and life-sustaining therapies in critically ill COVID-19 infected patients].,2020-04-01,"BACKGROUND Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is widely used to assess tissue and functional abnormalities in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Recently, a ARVC risk score was proposed to predict the 5-year risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ARVC. However, CMR features such as fibrosis, fat infiltration, and left ventricular (LV) involvement were not considered. OBJECTIVES The authors sought to evaluate the prognostic role of CMR phenotype in patients with definite ARVC and to evaluate the effectiveness of the novel 5-year ARVC risk score to predict cardiac events in different CMR presentations. METHODS A total of 140 patients with definite ARVC were enrolled (mean age 42 ± 17 years, 97 males) in this multicenter prospective registry. As per study design, CMR was performed in all the patients at enrollment. The novel 5-year ARVC risk score was retrospectively calculated using the patient's characteristics at the time of enrollment. During a median follow-up of 5 years (2 to 8 years), the combined endpoint of sudden cardiac death, appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator intervention, and aborted cardiac arrest was considered. RESULTS CMR was completely negative in 14 patients (10%), isolated right ventricular (RV) involvement was found in 58 (41%), biventricular in 52 (37%), and LV dominant in 16 (12%). During the follow-up, 48 patients (34%) had major events, but none occurred in patients with negative CMR. At Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with LV involvement (LV dominant and biventricular) had a worse prognosis than those with lone RV (p < 0.0001). At multivariate analysis, the LV involvement, a LV-dominant phenotype, and the 5-year ARVC risk score were independent predictors of major events. The estimated 5-year risk was able to predict the observed risk in patients with lone RV but underestimated the risk in those with LV involvement. CONCLUSIONS Different CMR presentations of ARVC are associated with different prognoses. The 5-year ARVC risk score is valid for the estimation of risk in patients with lone-RV presentation but underestimated the risk when LV is involved.","Aquaro, Giovanni Donato; De Luca, Antonio; Cappelletto, Chiara; Raimondi, Francesca; Bianco, Francesco; Botto, Nicoletta; Lesizza, Pierluigi; Grigoratos, Crysanthos; Minati, Monia; Dell'Omodarme, Matteo; Pingitore, Alessandro; Stolfo, Davide; Ferro, Matteo Dal; Merlo, Marco; Di Bella, Gianluca; Sinagra, Gianfranco",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2020.04.023; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32498802/,185

To find out whether there is any difference according to the nature of the nodules, nodules were subdivided into two groups of predominantly solid vs. predominantly cystic lesions. METHODS We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of thyroid nodules receiving percutaneous RFA treatment in our institution. We subdivided data into two groups according to the nodule's sonographic characteristics. We defined therapeutic success as a volume reduction rate >50% at 6 months post-RFA. The second ablation was performed in case where <50% VRR was achieved at 6 months. The primary endpoint was to identify factors prognosticating response to RFA treatment. RESULTS A total of 1000 patients with 1619 thyroid nodules received US-guided RFA treatment. A volume reduction of >50% (therapeutic success) after the first ablation was 78.9% vs. 78.2% (p = 0.439) and 91.4% vs. 93.4% (p = 0.148) after the final ablation for predominantly cystic vs. predominantly solid lesions, respectively, with comparable post-interventional morbidity. RFA sessions were more frequent in the solid group than in the cystic group. Small volume of thyroid nodule (<4 mL) was the only factor significantly associated with therapeutic success in the multivariate analysis (OR 1.848; 95% CI 1.537-2.789, p = 0.030). CONCLUSION RFA was effective in reducing the volume of benign thyroid nodules volume with non-inferior result in PS group comparing to PC group and can be considered a principal treatment method for treating benign thyroid nodules, including cystic nodules.","Lee, Gee Mun; You, Ji Young; Kim, Hoon Yub; Chai, Young Jun; Kim, Hong Kyu; Dionigi, Gianlorenzo; Tufano, Ralph P",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-018-1829-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569260/,185

METHODS A Markov model was built using TreeAgePro, version 2019 (TreeAge Software Inc.; Williamstown, MA) to assess the cost-effectiveness of five potential treatment algorithms: 1) treat all residents with psychotherapy, 2) screen and treat depressed residents with psychotherapy, 3) screen and treat depressed residents with pharmacotherapy, 4) screen and treat depressed residents with combination psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy, and 5) no intervention. A Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), consisting of 1 thousand simulations over a cumulative 5-year period, was performed to evaluate both base case values and a range of values for model variables. RESULTS Screening residents for depression and treating with combination psychotherapy/pharmacotherapy was cost-effective and the optimal strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50 thousand per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). This option demonstrated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $27,578 per QALY for base case values. PSA confirmed these results and demonstrated that screening residents for depression and treating with either combination pharmacotherapy/psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy alone, or psychotherapy alone were cost-effective options in 94.9% of simulations. CONCLUSION Depression and burnout remain crucial issues among resident physicians. This study demonstrates that actively screening residents for depression is cost-effective. Based on these results, residency programs may consider trialing standardized depression screening protocols. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE I and II.

It has been shown that heat stress could affect the meat quality characteristics by physiological and metabolic perturbations in live livestock. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a natural polyphenolic phytochemical compound that has many important biological activities, such as antioxidant, antimutagenic, and antitumor. The purpose of this study was to investigate the possible function and mechanism of RA on myoblast proliferation and differentiation under heat stress condition. The results showed that heat stress reduced the viability of myoblast and increased the percentage of apoptotic cells, and it also disrupted myotube formation by altering the expression of myogenic regulatory factors MyoD, myogenin, and MyHC. However, pretreatment of RA can protect C2C12 cells from heat stress-induced apoptosis, and it also increased the expression level of MyoD, myogenin, and MyHC under heat stress, which indicated that RA have protective effect on heat stress-caused failure of myotube formation during myoblast differentiation. Above all, our finding demonstrated that RA can promote the differentiation of C2C12 myoblast and maintain the formation of myotubes even under heat stress condition.","Chen, Kun-Lin; Wang, Yue; Lin, Zhi-Ping; Li, Hui-Xia",In vitro cellular & developmental biology.

METHODS Correlation significance test between the COVID-19 epidemiology sample and the PEECR allocation sample was conducted to estimate whether they came from the same population in Jinan from January 24 to June 30, 2020. The data used in empirical analysis were collected from the Health Commission of Shandong Province's daily epidemic information announcement (definite case increment, suspected case increment, suspected case stock, medical observation stock, close contact increment) and interview with some epidemic branch centers in Jinan City (vehicle using increment). Experiential analysis was used to analyze the waste of PEECR usage. RESULTS All the 5 COVID-19 epidemiology samples and the PEECR allocation sample came from different population. There was no correlation between the vehicle using increment and definite case increment, suspected case increment, suspected case stock, close contact increment (all P < 0.05), there was a weak correlation between the vehicle using increment and medical observation stock [the correlation coefficient was 0.048, ∈ (0.0, 0.2), P = 0.550]. There was systematic difference between PEECR indicator and COVID-19 epidemiology indicator. The waste in practice was also amplified by improper usage such as unsophisticated allocation, low effectiveness in primary units and unvalid emergency calling. CONCLUSIONS (1) A primary screening system should be established in control center to decrease the waste of efficiency. (2) Communities and units should improve overall epidemic dealing ability to assist emergency system. (3) The medical treatment ability and protection resource should be increased in normal pre-hospital care.","Guo, Pengpeng; Shang, Deya",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-20200722-00661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198877/,185

Such a DNA reaction network (RN)-powered protocell can realize the connection of logical computation and biological recognition due to the natural programmability and biological properties of DNA. Thus, the biological input molecules can be easily involved in the molecular computation and the computation process can be spatially isolated and protected by artificial bilayer membrane.

138835,Topical and Systemic Retinoids for the Treatment of Cutaneous Viral Warts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2020-12-05,"INTRODUCTION One of the great challenges in pancreas transplantation is the ischemia reperfusion injury. It is mentioned that free oxygen and/or nitrogen radicals play a prominent role in this phase. To minimize this problem, a modified histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution that contains modified antioxidants has been developed. Our aim was to evaluate this solution in improving the viability of the pancreas in comparison with standard HTK and University of Wisconsin (UW) solutions in a porcine model of pancreas transplantation. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-three Landrace pigs were divided into three identical groups. After a 10-hour preservation time at 4°C, the pancreas was implanted in the organs of the recipients in a standardized manner. Serum parameters were assessed prior to and after implantation on the 1(st) postoperative day, 3(rd) postoperative day, and 7(th) postoperative day. Furthermore, three biopsies were taken: prior to and after reperfusion, and on Day 7 to assess the grafts. RESULTS An analysis of serum glucose among the three groups showed no significant differences. Evaluation of the insulin levels showed no significant difference between the modified and standard HTK groups; however, differences between HTK and UW were significant (p = 0.004 in favor of UW solutions). The histopathological results showed a trend of a higher grade of rejection of pancreas tissue in the UW group compared to both HTK groups. CONCLUSION The modified HTK solution could preserve the pancreas for the preservation of the graft with similar results to those observed for standard solutions without any significant difference. The trend showed that the pathological finding in the UW group was not as good as that in the modified HTK and standard HTK groups.","Esmaeilzadeh, Majid; Fonouni, Hamidreza; Golriz, Mohammad; Majlesara, Ali; Kuttymuratov, Gani; Bergmann, Frank; Jarahian, Parvin; Khazaeipour, Zahra; Faridar, Alireza; Rad, Morva Tahmasbi; Longerich, Thomas; Gebhard, Martha M; Mehrabi, Arianeb",Asian journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asjsur.2015.03.017; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26216260/,185
139685,Inflammation as a Predictor of Recurrent Ventricular Tachycardia After Ablation in Patients With Myocarditis.,2020-10-06,"Linear ubiquitination, a newly discovered posttranslational modification, is catalyzed by the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC), which is composed of three subunits: one catalytic subunit HOIP and two accessory molecules, HOIL-1L and SHARPIN. Accumulating evidence suggests that linear ubiquitination plays a crucial role in innate immune signaling and especially in the activation of the NF-κB pathway by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains to NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO, also called IKKγ), the regulatory subunit of the IKK complex. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus that has devastated the swine industry worldwide, is an ideal model to study the host's disordered inflammatory responses after viral infection. Here, we found that LUBAC-induced NF-κB and proinflammatory cytokine expression can be inhibited in the early phase of PRRSV infection. Screening the PRRSV-encoded proteins showed that nonstructural protein 1α (nsp1α) suppresses LUBAC-mediated NF-κB activation and its CTE domain is required for the inhibition. Mechanistically, nsp1α binds to HOIP/HOIL-1L and impairs the interaction between HOIP and SHARPIN, thus reducing the LUBAC-dependent linear ubiquitination of NEMO. Moreover, PRRSV infection also blocks LUBAC complex formation and NEMO linear-ubiquitination, the important step for transducing NF-κB signaling. This unexpected finding demonstrates a previously unrecognized role of PRRSV nsp1α in modulating LUBAC signaling and explains an additional mechanism of immune modulation by PRRSV. IMPORTANCE Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most important veterinary infectious diseases in countries with intensive swine industries. PRRS virus (PRRSV) infection usually suppresses proinflammatory cytokine expression in the early stage of infection, whereas it induces an inflammatory storm in the late stage. However, precisely how the virus is capable of doing so remains obscure. In this study, we found that by blocking the interaction of its catalytic subunit HOIP and accessory molecule SHARPIN, PRRSV can suppress NF-κB signal transduction in the early stage of infection. Our findings not only reveal a novel mechanism evolved by PRRSV to regulate inflammatory responses but also highlight the important role of linear ubiquitination modification during virus infection.","Jing, Huiyuan; Fang, Liurong; Ding, Zhen; Wang, Dang; Hao, Wenqi; Gao, Li; Ke, Wenting; Chen, Huanchun; Xiao, Shaobo",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01911-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27881655/,185

144305,The Effect of Exercise Training Intensity on Quality of Life in Heart Failure Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2017,"Comprehensive and accurate comparisons of transcriptomic distributions of cells from samples taken from two different biological states, such as healthy versus diseased individuals, are an emerging challenge in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. Current methods for detecting differentially abundant (DA) subpopulations between samples rely heavily on initial clustering of all cells in both samples. Often, this clustering step is inadequate since the DA subpopulations may not align with a clear cluster structure, and important differences between the two biological states can be missed. Here, we introduce DA-seq, a targeted approach for identifying DA subpopulations not restricted to clusters. DA-seq is a multiscale method that quantifies a local DA measure for each cell, which is computed from its k nearest neighboring cells across a range of k values. Based on this measure, DA-seq delineates contiguous significant DA subpopulations in the transcriptomic space. We apply DA-seq to several scRNA-seq datasets and highlight its improved ability to detect differences between distinct phenotypes in severe versus mildly ill COVID-19 patients, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy comparing responders to nonresponders, embryonic development at two time points, and young versus aging brain tissue. DA-seq enabled us to detect differences between these phenotypes. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies but also reveals additional DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these subpopulations yields biological insights that would otherwise be undetected using conventional computational approaches.","Zhao, Jun; Jaffe, Ariel; Li, Henry; Lindenbaum, Ofir; Sefik, Esen; Jackson, Ruaidhrí; Cheng, Xiuyuan; Flavell, Richard A; Kluger, Yuval",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100293118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34001664/,185

METHODS A total of 36 patients (55 tumors) were treated with the LF system (915 MHz) and 30 patients (39 tumors) were treated with the HF system (2450 MHz) between January 2011 and March 2016. Computed tomography (CT) scans performed prior to and 24 hours after the ablation were used to measure the size of the ablation zone and to calculate the ablation margin. The subsequent CTs were used to detect local tumor progression. Possible predictive factors for local progression were analyzed. All patients had a minimum follow-up of 3 months with a median of 13.8 months for the LF group and 11.7 months for the HF group. RESULTS The ablation margin (P = 0.015), blood vessel proximity (P = 0.006), and colorectal origin (P = 0.029) were significantly associated with the local progression rate. The local progression rates were 36.3% for LF ablations and 12.8% for HF ablations. The 6, 12, and 18 months local progression-free survival rates were 79%, 65.2% and 53% for the LF group and 97.1%, 93.7%, and 58.4% for the HF group, with a significant difference between the survival curves (P = 0.048).

MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed a partially retrievable flow diverter composed of 48 strands of Nitinol and platinum wire. The FloWise is compatible with any microcatheter of 0.027-inch inner diameter, and is retrievable up to 70% deployment. The efficacy and safety of the FloWise were evaluated in the elastase-induced rabbit aneurysm model. The rate of technical success (full coverage of aneurysm neck) and assessment of aneurysm occlusion and stent patency was conducted by angiograms and histologic examinations at the 1-month, 3-month, and 6-month follow-up. The patency of small arterial branches (intercostal or lumbar arteries) covered by the FloWise were also assessed in the 5 subjects. RESULTS We attempted FloWise insertion in a total of 32 aneurysm models. FloWise placement was successful in 31 subjects (96.9%). Two stents (6.2%) were occluded at the 3-month follow-up, but there was no evidence of in-stent stenosis in other subjects. All stented aneurysms showed progressive occlusion: grade I (complete aneurysm occlusion) in 44.4% and grade II (aneurysm occlusion > 90%) in 55.6% at 1 month; grade I in 90% and II in 10% at 3 months; and grade I in 90% and II in 10% at 6 months. All small arterial branches covered by the FloWise remained patent.

147746,Incidence of inguinal hernia after radical prostatectomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2019,"BACKGROUND Patients undergoing major vascular surgery often develop postoperative pneumonia that impacts their outcomes. Conflicting data exist concerning the potential benefit of tapered-shaped cuffs on tracheal sealing. The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of a polyvinyl chloride tapered-cuff endotracheal tube at reducing the postoperative pneumonia rate after major vascular surgery. Secondary objectives were to determine its impact on microaspiration, ventilator-associated pneumonia rate, and inner cuff pressure. METHODS This prospective randomized controlled study included 109 patients who were randomly assigned to receive either spherical- (standard cuff) or taper-shaped (tapered cuff) endotracheal tubes inserted after anesthesia induction and then admitted to the intensive care unit after major vascular surgery. Cuff pressure was continuously recorded over 5 h. Pepsin and α-amylase concentrations in tracheal aspirates were quantified on postoperative days 1 and 2. The primary outcome was the early postoperative pneumonia frequency. RESULTS Comparing the tapered-cuff with standard-cuff group, respectively, postoperative pneumonia rates were comparable (42 vs. 44%, P = 0.87) and the percentage (interquartile range) of cuff-pressure time with overinflation was significantly higher (16.1% [1.5 to 50] vs. 0.6% [0 to 8.3], P = 0.01), with a 2.5-fold higher coefficient of variation (20.2 [10.6 to 29.4] vs. 7.6 [6.2 to 10.2], P < 0.001). Although microaspiration frequencies were high, they did not differ between groups. CONCLUSION For major vascular surgery patients, polyvinyl chloride tapered-cuff endotracheal tubes with intermittent cuff-pressure control did not lower the early postoperative pneumonia frequency and did not prevent microaspiration.","Monsel, Antoine; Lu, Qin; Le Corre, Marine; Brisson, Hélène; Arbelot, Charlotte; Vezinet, Corinne; Fléron, Marie-Hélène; Ibanez-Estève, Christina; Zerimech, Farid; Balduyck, Malika; Dexheimer, Felippe; Wang, Chunyao; Langeron, Olivier; Rouby, Jean-Jacques; Bodin, Liliane; Deransy, Romain; Garçon, Pierre; Douiri, Hatem; Khalifa, Ismael; Pons, Antoine; Gu, Wen-Jie; Koskas, Fabien; Gaudric, Julien",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000001053; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26872366/,185

METHOD Ecological study conducted with registers of babies born to teenage mothers between 2000 and 2015 from the Birth Information System (Sistema de Informação sobre Nascimento). Proportions were calculated year by year for a trend analysis of teenage pregnancy. Two series of three-year periods were collected for an odds ratio analysis of associated factors. RESULTS The following variables were associated to teenage pregnancy: not having a partner; less than eight years of schooling; primiparity; gestational age shorter than thirty-seven weeks; caesarean section; less than seven appointments; and Apgar below seven in the first minute. A decline trend was observed among pregnant teenagers who had partners; growing trend for teenage expectant mothers who had more than eight years of schooling and premature birth; decline/growing for normal birth; growing for number of prenatal appointments; decline for first and fifth minute Apgar score; growing for congenital anomalies.

Kidney transplantation is considered the definitive management of CKF. It has substantial benefits, including increased patient survival, improved skeletal growth, social adjustment, neuropsychological development, and better quality of life compared to chronic dialysis. METHODS This is a retrospective, clinical, observational study in 13 children ≤16 years old who underwent kidney transplantation at IALCH in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, from May 2015 to December 2019. RESULTS Over 4 years and 7 months, 13 kidney transplants were performed; 7 (53.8%) were males, and 6 (46.2%) were females. Eleven (84.6%) were Black African and 2 (15.4%) Indian children. The mean age ± (SD) of transplantation was 10.1 ± 2.8 years (range 5.8-15.8). Eight (61.5%) children were from a rural setting. The mean ± (SD) duration of follow-up was 29.5 ± 15.9 months. All kidney transplants done were from live related donors; 8 (61.5%) were parents of the recipients. None were pre-emptive transplants. Graft loss occurred in 2 (15.4%) children with 100% patient survival. Two (15.4%) children developed acute rejection. CONCLUSIONS The commissioning of transplant services in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, has improved access to this modality of treatment, particularly in our Black African patients. The significant limitations we experienced were a shortage of cadaveric donors and resource limitations with no dedicated transplant unit for pediatric patients together with staffing constraints. Enhancing patient and healthcare personal education will hopefully overcome cultural and religious barriers to organ donation.","Sinada, Nisreen Seed Ahmed; Naicker, Elaene; Tinarwo, Partson; Bhimma, Rajendra",Pediatric transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1111/petr.14016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33773014/,185

The latent form of this virus has shown to be resistant to antiviral drugs. Clustered Regularly Interspace Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR), an important tool in genome engineering composed of guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 nuclease that makes an RNA-protein complex to digest exclusive target sequences implementation of gRNA. Moreover, CRISPR-Cas9 system effectively suppresses HSV-1 infection by knockout of some viral genes. MATERIAL AND METHODS To survey the efficacy of Cas9 system on HSV-1 genome destruction, we designed several guide RNAs (gRNAs) that all packaged in one vector. Also, we performed a one-step restriction using BamHI and ESP3I enzymes. RESULTS CRISPR/Cas9 system targeted against the gD gene of HSV-1 was transfected into HEK-AD cells that moreover, revealed a significant reduction of HSV-1 infection by plaque assay and real-time PCR. CONCLUSION The pCas-Guide-EF1a-GFP CRISPR Vector can create a fast and efficient method for gRNA cloning by restriction enzymes (ESP3I (BsmBI) and BamHI). Therefore, the CRISPR/Cas9 system may be utilized for the screening of genes significant for the HSV1 infection and the development of new strategies for targeted therapy of viral infections caused by HSV-1.","Khodadad, Nastaran; Fani, Mona; Jamehdor, Saleh; Nahidsamiei, Rahil; Makvandi, Manoochehr; Kaboli, Saeed; Teimoori, Ali; Thekkiniath, Jose",Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,https://doi.org/10.5603/fhc.a2020.0020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937678/,185
151615,Epilepsy in children with Congenital Zika Syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-03-29,"OBJECTIVE We reviewed the literature to describe outcomes associated with abnormal neuroimaging findings among adult COVID-19 patients. METHODS We performed a systematic literature review using PubMed and Embase databases. We included all studies reporting abnormal neuroimaging findings among hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 and outcomes. Data elements including patient demographics, neuroimaging findings, acuity of neurological symptoms and/or imaging findings relative to COVID-19 onset (acute, subacute, chronic), and patient outcomes were recorded and summarized. RESULTS After review of 775 unique articles, a total of 39 studies comprising 884 COVID-19 patients ≥ 18 years of age with abnormal neuroimaging findings and reported outcomes were included in our analysis. Ischemic stroke was the most common neuroimaging finding reported (49.3%, 436/884) among patients with mortality outcomes data. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) had the highest all-cause mortality (49.7%, 71/143), followed by patients with imaging features consistent with leukoencephalopathy (38.5%, 5/13), and ischemic stroke (30%, 131/436). There was no mortality reported among COVID-19 patients with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis without necrosis (0%, 0/8) and leptomeningeal enhancement alone (0%, 0/12). Stroke was a common acute or subacute neuroimaging finding, while leukoencephalopathy was a common chronic finding. CONCLUSION Among hospitalized COVID-19 patients with abnormal neuroimaging findings, those with ICH had the highest all-cause mortality; however, high mortality rates were also seen among COVID-19 patients with ischemic stroke in the acute/subacute period and leukoencephalopathy in the chronic period.

The aim of the present study was to examine the risk factors for sarcopenia in elderly individuals with T2DM and the effects of metformin. Methods A total of 1732 elderly with T2DM were recruited to this cross-sectional observational study, and we analyzed the data using logistic regression analyses. Skeletal muscle mass, grip strength, and usual gait speed were measured to diagnose sarcopenia according to the criteria of the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia, combined with expert consensus on sarcopenia in China. Results The overall prevalence of sarcopenia was 10.37% of the participants. In the multivariate analysis, sex, age, educational level, and BMI were risk factors for sarcopenia, with women more likely to develop sarcopenia relative to men (OR = 2.539, 95% CI = 1.475-4.371; P < 0.05). We observed that sarcopenia increased with age and decreased with increasing BMI and educational level (P < 0.05). Participants who took metformin alone or combined with other drugs exhibited a lower risk for sarcopenia than those who took no medication (OR = 0.510, 95% CI = 0.288-0.904 and OR = 0.398, 95% CI = 0.225-0.702, respectively; P < 0.05). Conclusions We showed that being female and at an older age, lower educational level, and lower BMI were risk factors for sarcopenia in elderly T2DM and that metformin acted as a protective agent against sarcopenia in these patients.","Chen, Fenqin; Xu, Shuai; Wang, Yingfang; Chen, Feng; Cao, Lu; Liu, Tingting; Huang, Ting; Wei, Qian; Ma, Guojing; Zhao, Yuhong; Wang, Difei",Journal of diabetes research,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3950404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33083494/,185

Hydrophobic side chain functionality is effectively buried in the interior of the putative bilayer of these nanoribbons. This study investigates consequences on self-assembly of increasing the surface area of aromatic side chain groups that reside in the hydrophobic core of nanoribbons derived from Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides (X = hydrophobic residue). A series of Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides incorporating aromatic amino acids of increasing molecular volume and steric profile (X = phenylalanine [Phe], homophenylalanine [Hph], tryptophan [Trp], 1-naphthylalanine [1-Nal], 2-naphthylalanine [2-Nal], or biphenylalanine [Bip]) were assessed to determine substitution effects on self-assembly propensity and on morphology of the resulting nanoribbon structures. Additional studies were conducted to determine the effects of incorporating amino acids of differing steric profile in the hydrophobic core (Ac-X1 KFEFKFE-NH2 and Ac-(X1,5 KFE)-NH2 peptides, X = Trp or Bip). Spectroscopic analysis by circular dichroism (CD) and Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy indicated β-sheet formation for all variants. Self-assembly rate increased with peptide hydrophobicity; increased molecular volume of the hydrophobic side chain groups did not appear to induce kinetic penalties on self-assembly rates. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging indicated variation in fibril morphology as a function of amino acid in the X positions. This study confirms that hydrophobicity of amphipathic Ac-(XKXE)2 -NH2 peptides correlates to self-assembly propensity and that the hydrophobic core of the resulting nanoribbon bilayers has a significant capacity to accommodate sterically demanding functional groups. These findings provide insight that may be used to guide the exploitation of self-assembled amphipathic peptides as functional biomaterials.","Jones, Christopher W; Morales, Crystal G; Eltiste, Sharon L; Yanchik-Slade, Francine E; Lee, Naomi R; Nilsson, Bradley L",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/psc.3334; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34151480/,185

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,2016,"PURPOSE Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a highly effective approach in the treatment of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). There are no data on the primary use of CDT with argatroban and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in patients without heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combined administration of argatroban and tPA during CDT for massive DVT in patients without HIT. METHODS Thirty-three patients with massive symptomatic iliac and femoropopliteal DVT underwent CDT with tPA and argatroban within 28 ± 6 h of presentation. The dose of tPA was 0.75-1 mg/h through the infusion port and that of argatroban at 0.3-1 μg/kg/min through the side port of the sheath. The patients were evaluated for the efficacy and safety of CDT and recurrent symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) at a mean follow-up of 22 months. RESULTS There was no bleeding or iatrogenic pulmonary embolism with the CDT regimen we used. Grade III lysis (complete resolution of thrombus on venography) was achieved in 30 patients (91 %). In 3 patients with additional inferior vena cava filter thrombosis, further thrombectomy of the filter was required. No patient developed recurrent VTE.

Although this BBB permeation-aided stem cell therapy has been demonstrated in the acute stage of stroke, such BBB permeation in the chronic stage of the disease remains to be examined. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats initially received sham surgery or experimental stroke via the 1-h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model. At 1 month after the MCAo surgery, stroke animals were randomly assigned to receive human umbilical cord stem cells only (2 million viable cells), mannitol only (1.1 mol/L mannitol at 4°C), combined human umbilical cord stem cells (200,000 viable cells) and mannitol (1.1 mol/L mannitol at 4°C), and vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) only. Stroke animals that received human umbilical cord blood cells alone or combined human umbilical cord stem cells and mannitol exhibited significantly improved motor performance and significantly better brain cell survival in the peri-infarct area compared to stroke animals that received vehicle or mannitol alone, with mannitol treatment reducing the stem cell dose necessary to afford functional outcomes. Enhanced neurogenesis in the subventricular zone accompanied the combined treatment of human umbilical cord stem cells and mannitol. We showed that BBB permeation facilitates the therapeutic effects of a low dose of peripherally transplanted stem cells to effectively cause functional improvement and increase neurogenesis in chronic stroke.","Tajiri, Naoki; Lee, Jea Young; Acosta, Sandra; Sanberg, Paul R; Borlongan, Cesar V",Cell transplantation,https://doi.org/10.3727/096368916x690971; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26883984/,185

Few studies focus on the impact of aging among older LAC PWH. This systematic review aims to fill this information gap and understand the burden of aging with HIV in LAC. We identified peer-reviewed literature published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese from several databases to assess currently available evidence on the burden of aging with HIV in LAC and selected six common NCDs found in older PWH (cardiovascular disease [CVD], bone and musculoskeletal [MSK] disorders, cancer, renal disease, neurocognitive impairment [NCI], and depression). RECENT FINDINGS Of the 5942 publications reviewed, only 53 articles were found with populations 40 years and older or age-related findings (27 CVD, 13 NCI or depression, 6 MSK disorders, 4 renal disease, 3 cancer). Most (79%) publications were from Brazil with few longitudinal studies on aging with HIV. Prevalence of illnesses such as CVD, NCI, depression, or osteoporosis varied widely depending on the screening instrument utilized and geographic population surveyed. Age was a significant predictor of comorbidity in nearly all studies. Our results demonstrate the need for longitudinal studies and validated screening instruments appropriate for use among PWH in LAC. Understanding the mechanisms behind aging in HIV and the roles of sociocultural factors and genetic diversity specific to LAC is needed to appropriately manage chronic comorbidities as PWH age.","Cabrera, Diego M; Diaz, Monica M; Grimshaw, Alyssa; Salvatierra, Justina; Garcia, Patricia J; Hsieh, Evelyn",Current HIV/AIDS reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11904-020-00538-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33400168/,185

The proportion of detected environmental noise that exceeded 85 dB(A) is 69.6%, and the median of its noise level was 88.4 dB(A). The proportion of detected individual noise that exceeded 85 dB(A) was 52.6%, and the median of its noise level was 85.4 dB(A). The overall environmental noise exposure levels rose with the increase in the scales of coal-fired thermal power stations, while the individual noise exposure levels were contrary. What are the implications for public health practice? Workers in coal-fired thermal power stations are exposed to noise at a significantly high level, more than half of the environmental and individual exposure level were above 85 dB(A), which could impair workers' hearing capacity.

Despite high efficacy, PPI safety has been increasingly scrutinised. However, no comprehensive review summarising investigations of various adverse events is available. AIMS To perform an umbrella review to comprehensively assess associations between adverse events and PPI use. METHODS In accordance with PRISMA, an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses was conducted. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2015 to July 2019. AMSTAR 2 and GRADE were used to assess quality and certainty of evidence. Author-reported quality assessments were also reviewed. RESULTS Forty-two systematic reviews with meta-analyses, supported predominantly by observational evidence, were included. The most comprehensive studies reported statistically significant associations with PPI use for several outcomes, including: fractures (eg, hip; RR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.14-1.28; n = 2 103 800), kidney disease (eg, acute kidney injury; RR = 1.61; 95% CI = 1.16-2.22; n = 2 396 640), infections (eg, Clostridioides difficile; OR = 1.99; 95% CI = 1.73-2.30; n = 356 683), gastric cancer (OR = 2.50; 95% CI = 1.74-3.85; n = 943 070) and gastrointestinal events (eg, fundic gland polyps; OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.42-4.27; n = 40 218). No associations with non-gastric cancers, or neurological disease were concluded, with conflicting evidence for cardiovascular outcomes. Certainty based on GRADE was very low for most outcomes. CONCLUSIONS This review identified several published associations between PPIs and adverse outcomes, however, further investigation is needed to understand their clinical significance and the likelihood of causal relationship. If higher quality evidence is generated substantiating the potential risks, it may be necessary for clinicians to consider alternative treatment strategies, especially when PPI efficacy is suboptimal.","Salvo, Elizabeth M; Ferko, Nicole C; Cash, Sarah B; Gonzalez, Ailish; Kahrilas, Peter J",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16407; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34114655/,185
157013,Associations of hand washing frequency with the incidence of illness: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Studies have compared sealing effects of the newly developed tapered endotracheal tube cuff with the conventional cylindrical cuff. In this study, we compared the difference between cuffs with regard to the increase in intracuff pressure during nitrous oxide (N(2)O) exposure. METHODS Two types of cuffs were studied using a model trachea connected to a mechanical test lung: high-volume, low-pressure cuff (Mallinckrodt Hi-Lo(TM), Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) and tapered cuff (Mallinckrodt TaperGuardTM, Covidien). The intracuff pressure was set at 20 cm H(2)O, and the increase in pressure was measured during mechanical ventilation using 66% N(2)O. Intracuff pressures were recorded after 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes of exposure to N(2)O. RESULTS The intracuff pressure recorded during the first 15 minutes of N(2)O exposure in high-volume, low-pressure cuffs was significantly higher than tapered cuffs (2-way repeated-measures analysis of variance, P < 0.0001 for internal diameters [IDs] 7.0 and 7.5 mm, P = 0.0004 for ID 8.0 mm, P = 0.0013 for ID 8.5 mm), and there were also statistically significant differences regarding interaction of time and cuff type (P < 0.0001 for IDs 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, and 8.5 mm). The difference in mean cuff pressures among groups after 10 minutes of N(2)O exposure was -18.5 (SE, 1.4; 99% confidence interval, -22.8 to -14.2; P < 0.0001) for ID 7.5 mm. Tapered endotracheal tube cuffs sealed the trachea with fewer dimples on the carina side of the cuff. Dimples on the cuff surface probably increase the surface for N(2)O diffusion. Therefore, fewer dimples result in a smaller surface area through which N(2)O can diffuse. CONCLUSION During general anesthesia with N(2)O, the intracuff pressure of tapered endotracheal tube cuffs did not increase as rapidly as it did in conventional high-volume, low-pressure cuffs. The pressure in both types of cuffs increased rapidly when exposed to 66% N(2)O, and hence continuous or frequent monitoring is recommended.","Tsuboi, Sayaka; Miyashita, Tetsuya; Yamaguchi, Yoshikazu; Yamamoto, Yoshiko; Sakamaki, Kentaro; Goto, Takahisa",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0b013e318279b399; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23400983/,185

Few data are available on its clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and outcomes of those patients requiring ICU admission. This study was undertaken to describe the clinical pictures and ICU management of severe systemic capillary-leak syndrome episodes. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS This multicenter retrospective analysis concerned patients entered in the European Clarkson's disease (EurêClark) Registry and admitted to ICUs between May 1992 and February 2016. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Fifty-nine attacks occurring in 37 patients (male-to-female sex ratio, 1.05; mean ± SD age, 51 ± 11.4 yr) were included. Among 34 patients (91.9%) with monoclonal immunoglobulin G gammopathy, 20 (58.8%) had kappa light chains. ICU-admission hemoglobin and proteinemia were respectively median (interquartile range) 20.2 g/dL (17.9-22 g/dL) and 50 g/L (36.5-58.5 g/L). IV immunoglobulins were infused (IV immunoglobulin) during 15 episodes (25.4%). A compartment syndrome developed during 12 episodes (20.3%). Eleven (18.6%) in-ICU deaths occurred. Bivariable analyses (the 37 patients' last episodes) retained Sequential Organ-Failure Assessment score greater than 10 (odds ratio, 12.9 [95% CI, 1.2-140]; p = 0.04) and cumulated fluid-therapy volume greater than 10.7 L (odds ratio, 16.8 [1.6-180]; p = 0.02) as independent predictors of hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS We described the largest cohort of severe systemic capillary-leak syndrome flares requiring ICU admission. High-volume fluid therapy was independently associated with poorer outcomes. IV immunoglobulin use was not associated with improved survival; hence, their use should be considered prudently and needs further evaluation in future studies.","Pineton de Chambrun, Marc; Luyt, Charles-Edouard; Beloncle, François; Gousseff, Marie; Mauhin, Wladimir; Argaud, Laurent; Ledochowski, Stanislas; Moreau, Anne-Sophie; Sonneville, Romain; Verdière, Bruno; Merceron, Sybille; Zappella, Nathalie; Landais, Mickael; Contou, Damien; Demoule, Alexandre; Paulus, Sylvie; Souweine, Bertrand; Lecomte, Bernard; Vieillard-Baron, Antoine; Terzi, Nicolas; Azoulay, Elie; Friolet, Raymond; Puidupin, Marc; Devaquet, Jérôme; Mazou, Jean-Marc; Fedun, Yannick; Mira, Jean-Paul; Raphalen, Jean-Herlé; Combes, Alain; Amoura, Zahir",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0000000000002496; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28622216/,185
157867,Plasma tau protein in comatose patients after cardiac arrest treated with therapeutic hypothermia.,2011,"OBJECTIVE To assess the onset of efficacy of fesoterodine 4 mg versus placebo in subjects with overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Subjects who reported OAB symptoms for ≥ 3 months and recorded ≥ 8 micturitions and ≥ 1 urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) episode per 24 hours in 3-day baseline diaries were randomized to fesoterodine 4 mg, tolterodine extended release (ER) 4 mg, or placebo. This is an analysis of first week data from a 12-week, double-blind trial. ClinicalTrials.gov unique ID: NCT00444925. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Baseline to week 1 changes in 3-day bladder diary variables, Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and Urgency Perception Scale (UPS) scores reported by subjects receiving fesoterodine 4 mg or placebo. RESULTS By week 1, fesoterodine 4 mg (n = 679) was associated with significantly greater improvements compared with placebo (n = 334) in micturitions, urgency, severe urgency and UUI episodes, frequency-urgency sum, and MVV per 24 hours and 3-day diary-dry rate (all p < 0.05), but not nocturnal micturitions per 24 hours (p = 0.273). These differences were significant as early as day 5 of treatment (i.e., day 1 of the 3-day diary) for all diary endpoints except nocturnal micturitions and MVV. Changes in PPBC scores were significantly more favorable with fesoterodine 4 mg versus placebo (p = 0.0143); changes in UPS scores were not significantly different (p = 0.077). CONCLUSION The results provide evidence that patients receiving fesoterodine 4 mg for their OAB symptoms may expect to experience a response as early as 1 week after initiating treatment. One limitation is that, although 65% of subjects had received treatment with antimuscarinics before the study, whether subjects were dissatisfied with previous treatment and reasons for dissatisfaction were not collected. This might affect the magnitude of outcome improvements. Also, it is not known whether the UPS is sensitive enough to detect treatment differences as early as week 1.","Corcos, Jacques; Angulo, Javier C; Garely, Alan D; Carlsson, Martin; Gong, Jason; Guan, Zhonghong",Current medical research and opinion,https://doi.org/10.1185/03007995.2011.565044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21428726/,185

Written immediately following the suspension (due to the pandemic) of an ethnographic investigation of waiting in a general practice in London, it tracks the first signs that working definitions of time would struggle to survive the onset of a temporality of acute crisis in the NHS. The paper considers what it might mean for healthcare practitioners at this particular moment in the NHS's history to be living through an experience of 'the ordinary' breaking down. It also follows hints of new temporal modes of care appearing during this same period when one kind of crisis in the NHS has been put on hold, and another (the crisis of coronavirus) is just getting underway.","Davies, Stephanie",Wellcome open research,https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15964.2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32934994/,185
158097,Surveillance failure in ultrasound for hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-03-01,"INTRODUCTION When the first COVID-19 infections were reported in Germany, fear and anxiety spread faster than the pandemic itself. While moderate amounts of fear of a COVID-19 infection may be functional, generalized anxiety and the potentially resulting distress and psychopathology may possibly be detrimental to people's health. Authorities need to avoid a countrywide panic, on the one hand, but foster a realistic awareness of the actual threat, on the other hand. OBJECTIVES The current cross-sectional study aimed to investigate psychological reactions in response to the real or perceived infection threats. In particular, the analysis should reveal whether COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety in times of COVID-19 have distinct correlates. METHODS A nationwide study was conducted from March 10th to May 4th 2020 in Germany (n = 15,308; 10,824 women, 4433 men, 51 other). Generalized anxiety was assessed using the GAD-7, while COVID-19-related fear was measured using a self-generated item. Both outcome variables were entered into linear regression models. Demographic information, depressive symptoms, trust in governmental interventions, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 and media use were used to predict generalized anxiety and COVID-19-related fear. RESULTS The data revealed distinct correlates of COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety. Although COVID-19-related fear and generalized anxiety had overlapping predictors, such as neuroticism, they most prominently differed in age distribution and direction of an urban-rural disparity: generalized anxiety decreases with age, but COVID-19-related fear is most pronounced in elderly participants. Generalized anxiety is also more prevalent in rural communities, but COVID-19-related fear is elevated in metropoles. Furthermore, the presence of a risk disease increases COVID-19-related fear, but not generalized anxiety. CONCLUSION These results suggest that COVID-19-related fear is often justified considering the individual risk of infection or complication due to infection. Some of the characteristics that predict COVID-19-related fear leave generalized anxiety unaffected or show divergent predictive directions. The present findings hint toward two related, but discriminant constructs.","Schweda, Adam; Weismüller, Benjamin; Bäuerle, Alexander; Dörrie, Nora; Musche, Venja; Fink, Madeleine; Kohler, Hannah; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria",Comprehensive psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152218; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33232827/,185

Bacterial pathogens are recognized to be frequent causative agents, which makes antibacterial treatment crucial for the evolution of these patients. There are several antimicrobial options available in daily practice. However, bacterial resistance is a problem. The chemical, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamics, and safety characteristics of delafloxacin, a fluoroquinolone, are discussed. The data from one phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the use of delafloxacin in adults with community-acquired pneumonia is also discussed, along with findings from other meaningful studies. In vitro data have shown that delafloxacin has broad spectrum activity. Results from phase 2 and phase 3 studies have demonstrated that delafloxacin use is safe. International guidelines have recommended respiratory fluoroquinolones as second option for non-severe cases and must be considered in very severe patients not improving to a betalactam/macrolide combination. Delafloxacin was compared to moxifloxacin in the phase 3 community-acquired pneumonia trial. Serious and life-long adverse events due to fluoroquinolones use have been recently reported. Delafloxacin may possibly replace currently available fluoroquinolones, particularly in the treatment of resistant pathogens, such as ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates when other drugs are inefficient.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M",Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/14656566.2021.1957098; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34346823/,185
158276,Perspectives From COPD Subjects on Portable Long-Term Oxygen Therapy Devices.,2018,"Polysaccharide-based chiral stationary phases (CSPs) are the most used chiral selectors in HPLC. These CSPs can be used in normal, polar organic and aqueous-organic mobile phases. However, normal and polar organic mobile phases are not adequate for chiral separation of polar compounds, for the analysis of aqueous samples and for MS detection. In these situations, reversed phase conditions, without the usual non-volatile additives incompatible with MS detection, are preferable. Moreover, in most of the reported chiral chromatographic methods, retention is too large for routine work. In this paper, the chiral separation of 53 structurally unrelated compounds is studied using three commercial amylose-based CSPs -coated amylose tris(3,5-dimethylphenylcarbamate) (Am1), coated amylose tris(5-chloro-2-methylphenylcarbamate) (Am2), and immobilised amylose tris(3-chloro-5-methylphenylcarbamate) (Am3)-. Chiral separations are carried out using acetonitrile/ammonium bicarbonate (pH = 8.0) mixtures, reversed mobile phases compatible with MS detection. To provide realistic conditions for routine analysis, maximum retention factors are set to 15. Retention and enantioresolution behaviour of compounds in those CSPs are compared. On the other hand, to compare and describe the resolution ability of these CSPs, 58 structural variables of the compounds are tested to model for the first time a categorical enantioresolution (CRs) for Am1 and Am3 CSPs. Discriminant partial least squares, for one response categorical variable (DPLS1) is used for feature selection, modelling. The final DPLS1 models showed good descriptive ability.","Pérez-Baeza, Mireia; Escuder-Gilabert, Laura; Martín-Biosca, Yolanda; Sagrado, Salvador; Medina-Hernández, María José",Journal of chromatography.

159115,25-Hydroxyvitamin D concentrations in COVID-19 patients hospitalized in intensive care unit during the first wave and the second wave of the pandemic.,2021-03-02,"Abstract The Coronavirus Disease-19 (Covid-19) pandemic, in the last year, has resulted in a significant number of infections and deaths among nursing homes' residents. This phenomenon has set up the necessity to subject these patients, often suffering from mental disabilities to a vaccination against Covid-19. However, vaccination has long been the subject of public atten-tion, being regulated differently in many European countries. In Italy, the Ministry of Health has given priority, vaccination-wise, to health facilities' patients. The government has regulated through-law no. 1 of January 5, 2021, art. 5, the manifestation of consent to be Covid-19 vac-cinated in incapacitated subjects admitted to assisted health facilities. This rule arose from the need to protect fragile individuals as well as providing real dispositions for the involved health professionals. Nursing homes' elderly guests could be divided into four catego-ries: a) subjects capable to express their will (affected by physical problems); b) subjects who, due to varying degrees of incapacitation, have their own legal guardian, curator or support administrator, ap-pointed in accordance with the law; c) incapacitated subjects without legal representatives d) subjects who, pursuant to law no. 219/2017, have appointed their own trustee. This paper provides for a clear exemplification of all the possible scenarios identified by the Italian law no.1/2021.","di Fazio, N; Caporale, M; Fazio, V; Delogu, G; Frati, P",La Clinica terapeutica,https://doi.org/10.7417/ct.2021.2349; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34625770/,185

MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and clinicaltrials.gov were searched in July 2017. Analyses were conducted using Revman 5.3 and Stata 15.0. A total of 91 publications containing 104 studies were eligible (n = 9958 participants), including 47 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 57 observational studies. Forty-eight studies examined neuropathic pain, 7 studies examined fibromyalgia, 1 rheumatoid arthritis, and 48 other CNCP (13 multiple sclerosis-related pain, 6 visceral pain, and 29 samples with mixed or undefined CNCP). Across RCTs, pooled event rates (PERs) for 30% reduction in pain were 29.0% (cannabinoids) vs 25.9% (placebo); significant effect for cannabinoids was found; number needed to treat to benefit was 24 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15-61); for 50% reduction in pain, PERs were 18.2% vs 14.4%; no significant difference was observed. Pooled change in pain intensity (standardised mean difference: -0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.08) was equivalent to a 3 mm reduction on a 100 mm visual analogue scale greater than placebo groups. In RCTs, PERs for all-cause adverse events were 81.2% vs 66.2%; number needed to treat to harm: 6 (95% CI 5-8). There were no significant impacts on physical or emotional functioning, and low-quality evidence of improved sleep and patient global impression of change. Evidence for effectiveness of cannabinoids in CNCP is limited. Effects suggest that number needed to treat to benefit is high, and number needed to treat to harm is low, with limited impact on other domains. It seems unlikely that cannabinoids are highly effective medicines for CNCP.","Stockings, Emily; Campbell, Gabrielle; Hall, Wayne D; Nielsen, Suzanne; Zagic, Dino; Rahman, Rakin; Murnion, Bridin; Farrell, Michael; Weier, Megan; Degenhardt, Louisa",Pain,https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29847469/,185

SILS has been shown to be a safe and feasible alternative to traditional multiport cholecystectomy, appendectomy, colectomy, and many other laparoscopic procedures. The objective of this study is to provide an initial report of the feasibility of correcting intestinal malrotation via a single-incision laparoscopic transumbilical approach. CASE DESCRIPTION A 29-year-old woman presented with symptomatic congenital intestinal malrotation. She elected to undergo a Ladd's procedure using a single-incision laparoscopic approach with a SILS port and standard laparoscopic instruments. The procedure was accomplished without additional ports or conversion to laparotomy, and no intraoperative or postoperative complications were noted. Total operative time was 106 minutes. The patient had minimal postoperative pain and was satisfied with the cosmetic outcome. CONCLUSION When performed by a surgeon experienced in the SILS technique, single-incision laparoscopic Ladd's procedure for symptomatic intestinal malrotation in an adult is feasible and safe, with minimal postoperative pain and favorable cosmetic outcome.","Vassaur, John; Vassaur, Hannah; Buckley, F Paul",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680813x13654754534954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24680157/,185

RFA treats SRM with heat induced by the tissue impedance to radiofrequency current emitted from a needle probe within the SRM. Currently available RFA systems use either an impedance- or temperature-based treatment algorithm to reach treatment end point while minimizing risk of carbonization. Physical limitations, such as electrical property heterogeneity and convective heat loss due to blood flow, and technical considerations should be addressed when performing RFA. Nonetheless, investigations with intermediate follow-up have demonstrated single-treatment radiographic recurrence-free rates of >90%.

This virus has infected about 10.37 Crores and taken lives of 2.24 Crores people of 213 countries to date. To cope-up this emergency clinical trials are undergoing with some existing drugs like remdesivir, flavipiravir, lopinavir-ritonavir, nafamostat, doxycycline, hydroxy-chloroquine, dexamethasone, etc., despite their severe toxicity and health hazards among diabetics, hypertensive, cardiac patients or normal individuals. The lack of safe and approved treatment for COVID-19 has forced the scientific community to find novel and safe compounds with potential efficacy. This study evaluates a few selective herbal compounds like glucoraphanin, vitexin, niazinin, etc., as a potential inhibitor of the spike protein and 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro) or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-COV-2 through in-silico virtual studies such as molecular docking, target analysis, toxicity prediction and ADME prediction and supported by a Molecular-Dynamic simulation. Selective phytocompounds were docked successfully in the binding site of spike glycoprotein and 3CLpro (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2. In-silico approaches also predict this molecule to have good solubility, pharmacodynamic property and target accuracy through MD simulation and ADME studies. These hit molecules niazinin, vitexin, glucoraphanin also obey Lipinski's rule along with their stable binding towards target protein of the virus, which makes them suitable for further biochemical and cell-based assays followed by clinical investigations to highlight their potential use in COVID-19 treatment.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Recently, virologists can monitor the virus life cycle at the primary infection site in real-time using various virus tracking techniques. Herpesviruses, a class of large enveloped DNA viruses, are important pathogens threatening the health of humans and animals. This review discussed the applications of different virus tracking techniques in herpesvirus studies, to provide new insights into virus-cell interactions and replication mechanisms of herpesviruses. Though the techniques have widely been exploited, some issues need to be addressed, such as the selection of the optimal site to insert reporters and the inability to track the whole process of the virus life cycle. With the updated tracking techniques, hopefully, more complex replication mechanismsof herpesviruses will be revealed in detail.","Wang, Yalin; Qiu, Huaji; Sun, Yuan",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.13345/j.cjb.180057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30499268/,185

Like COVID-19, the rapid emergence of Ebola required new clinical and surgical approaches to understand its associated spectrum of ophthalmic complications and the potential for Ebola viral persistence within the eye and in tear film. Recent reports of ophthalmic findings associated with COVID-19 include conjunctivitis, retinopathy, and molecular evidence of virus within the tear film in a minority of cases. Yet, more rigorous approaches to understand ophthalmic disease and transmission risk associated with COVID-19 are needed. Gaps also remain in our understanding of eye disease associated with other high priority emerging infectious diseases including Nipah, Lassa fever, Marburg virus, and others. SUMMARY Thoroughly understanding the ophthalmic findings and transmission risk associated with COVID-19 is paramount during this pandemic, providing additional measures of safety while resuming ophthalmic care for all patients. Vision health systems preparedness measures developed during recent EVD outbreaks and the current pandemic provide models for ophthalmic clinical practice, research, and education, as we continue to address COVID-19 and future emerging infectious disease threats.","Bavinger, J Clay; Shantha, Jessica G; Yeh, Steven",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000683; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32740063/,185
162164,The antidepressive effects of exercise: a meta-analysis of randomized trials.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS The traditional endoscopic treatment for gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) is argon plasma coagulation, but results are not always positive. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a new endoscopic therapy that may be an attractive option for the treatment of GAVE. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of RFA for the treatment of GAVE. PATIENTS AND METHODS This was an open-label, retrospective, case series study. The main outcome measures were number of red blood cell (RBC) packs transfused (transfusion requirement) and hemoglobin concentrations (g/dL) in the 6 months prior to and after RFA. Success was defined as a decrease in transfusion requirement in the 6 months after RFA compared with before treatment. RESULTS A total of 24 patients underwent a mean of 1.8 ± 0.8 RFA sessions. No complications were reported. One patient was referred for additional argon plasma coagulation during follow-up. The mean number of RBC packs decreased in all 23 transfusion-dependent patients, from a mean of 10.6 ± 12.1 during the 6 months prior to RFA, to a mean of 2.5 ± 5.9 during the 6 months after RFA treatment (P < 0.001), and 15 patients (65.2 %) were weaned off transfusions completely. An increase in the hemoglobin concentration was reported in all patients after RFA (from 6.8 ± 1.4 g/dL to 9.8 ± 1.8 g/dL; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION RFA for the treatment of GAVE seems feasible and safe, and significantly reduced the need for RBC transfusion and increased the hemoglobin level in this retrospective case series.","Dray, Xavier; Repici, Alessandro; Gonzalez, Pedro; Fristrup, Claus; Lecleire, Stéphane; Kantsevoy, Sergey; Wengrower, Dov; Elbe, Peter; Camus, Marine; Carlino, Alessandra; Pérez-Roldán, Francisco; Adar, Tomer; Marteau, Philippe",Endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0034-1377695; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25111135/,185

As a large-scale group that is receiving higher education, college students also show greater mood swings. How to reduce the psychological harm of anxiety to college students is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Based on this, this paper proposes an evaluation model for the anxiety level of college students in different regions under the influence of COVID-19. First of all, the general influence index of college student’s anxiety level is obtained by correlation analysis. Secondly, the logical OR of the double quantization variable precision fuzzy set model and the degree fuzzy rough set model is used to establish the evaluation model of the anxiety level of college students under the influence of COVID-19. Finally, used big data, the idea of fuzzy upper and lower approximation, combined with the principle of maximum membership in fuzzy set theory, achieved the quantitative ranking of the anxiety levels of college students in different areas. The research shows that when the accuracy of decision-making is 45%, the anxiety level of the township college students group and the provincial capital or municipality college students group is higher. When the accuracy of decision-making is 65%, the anxiety level of the provincial capital or municipality college students group is higher than others.

Given the wide-spreading, steady diffusion of ear-worn wearables (Earables) as the new frontier of wearable devices, we investigate the feasibility of earable-based gait identification. Specifically, we look at gait-based identification from the sounds induced by walking and propagated through the musculoskeletal system in the body. Our system, EarGate, leverages an in-ear facing microphone which exploits the earable's occlusion effect to reliably detect the user's gait from inside the ear canal, without impairing the general usage of earphones. With data collected from 31 subjects, we show that EarGate achieves up to 97.26% Balanced Accuracy (BAC) with very low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) of 3.23% and 2.25%, respectively. Further, our measurement of power consumption and latency investigates how this gait identification model could live both as a stand-alone or cloud-coupled earable system.","Ferlini, Andrea; Ma, Dong; Harle, Robert; Mascolo, Cecilia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.12305v1.pdf,185

This article will challenge that perception and demonstrate that digital museums actually present a unique opportunity to develop interest in art and attracting people not only to art in general but to on-site cultural institutions as well. Digital museums can, among other roles, assume the role of interpreting cultural heritage, but are also the best way to attract a young au-dience to art. This article examines the opportunities provided by digital technology for museums in terms of communication and dissemination of knowledge. The particular emphasis will be on the use of digital collections as well as on connecting and interacting with the public, particularly with a young au-dience. If there was any doubt about the importance and influence of digital museums, the COVID-19 pandemic was a final proof that digital museums have a much greater value than is generally admitted, and that they have become an indispensable part of the overall museum experience in all museums that have been able to develop them as a part of overall museum strategy. © 2021, Logos Verlag Berlin GmbH.

172952,The association between socioeconomic status and pandemic influenza: systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-12-11,"During the past two decades, the world has confronted many pandemic disease outbreaks. Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and, recently, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) have had a massive global impact in terms of stress on local and global human health, economic destruction, and, above all, damage to usual human life. Analyzing past similar infections will help in drawing inferences such as maintaining social distancing, herd immunity, and vaccinating massively to go forward beyond this pandemic. The development of a forecasting model of COVID-19 infectious disease spreading rate plays a vital role in the future preparation of hospital facilities, such as setting up isolated wards, oxygen cylinders, and ventilators, etc., for future patients by the government. Also, the forecasting technique and model is in immediate need for us to understand and face the effect of this and future pandemics. The main objective of this work is to develop an intelligent model based on deep learning for forecasting or estimating COVID-19 future spreading rate in terms of confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases of 85 days in 4 states in India and India overall. Deep learning neural networks, a kind of machine learning technique, are a powerful tool to predict the future because of their nature of discovering complex nonlinear dependencies. A deep learning long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which is explicitly designed for learning long-term dependencies, is utilized in thiswork. Hence, one can predict 1 day ahead to any number of (up to 400) days ahead by using this model. To evaluate the performance of the deep learning forecasting model and to endorse its forecasting accuracy, the criteria of mean absolute error, mean square error, root mean square error, mean absolute percentage error, and Ro are used. The results of the proposed deep learning-based LSTM model are validated by statistical analysis and graphical analysis. Moreover, the proposed model exhibited superior forecasting accuracy. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved.","Pillai, P.

These immunological parameters in homologous or heterologous vaccination boosts have thus far been studied for mRNA and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines, but knowledge on individuals who received a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S is lacking. We studied Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated individuals (n=55) who were either primed with Ad26.COV2.S only (n=13), or boosted with a homologous (Ad26.COV2.S, n=28) or heterologous (BNT162b2, n=14) second dose. We compared our findings with the results found in individuals vaccinated with a single (n=16) or double (n=44) dose of BNT162b2. We observed that a strategy of heterologous vaccination enhanced the quantity and breadth of both, Spike-specific humoral and cellular immunity in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated. In contrast, the impact of homologous boost was quantitatively minimal in Ad26.COV2.S vaccinated and Spike-specific antibodies and T cells were narrowly focused to the S1 region. Although a direct association between quantity and quality of immunological parameters and in vivo protection has not been demonstrated, the immunological features of Spike-specific humoral and cellular immune responses support the utilization of a heterologous strategy of vaccine boost in individuals who received Ad26.COV2.S vaccination.","Khoo, N.

During the early course of the pandemic. The duration of infectious virus replication is an important factor for clinicians. There is a significant correlation between the duration of SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance and the prognosis of COVID-19. Aims and Objective: To study Duration of viral clearance in COVID 19 patients, admitted in an Indian setting. Materials and Methods: The prospective single-center study considered adults patients of both the gender, diagnosed with COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR technique. Necessary demographic and clinical data were collected and selected subjects were followed-up until discharge or death. Based on the number of days required for viral clearance, the subjects were classified as: group 1: = 14 days, group 2: 15-28 days, and group 3:>28 days. Results: The study included 536 patients it was found that mean duration required for viral clearance was around 8.98±3.54. Mean ages noted for group1, 2 and 3(based on viral clearance) were 37.57±13.65 years, 37.12±13.73 years and 49.50±23.56 years respectively. There was a significant difference between mean age of group 1 and 2, as well as group 1 and 3. Moreover, the distribution of patients across different age group was found to be statistically significant (P<0.05). Significant difference was noted between three groups with respect to the comorbidity status (P<0.0001). The COVID-related symptoms dyspnea and cough were more prominent in group 3 (P<0.05).

177728,Randomized controlled studies comparing traditional lectures versus online modules,2021-02-07,"With the growth and widespread availability of education technologies, English language teaching (ELT) needs to be shaped differently. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated a disruption of education systems all over the world on a scale and scope never seen before. This paper aims to explore the potential of online lessons subcategorized as open educational resources (OER) in enhancing university students' English language skills through the Moodle system. A total of 189 first-year humanities students from a medium sized university in Thailand participated in this study during a semester break. Prior to the OER exposure, the participants completed a questionnaire eliciting personal information, followed by a pre-test on five English language skills. Then, the students were encouraged to freely explore and exploit the online lessons for a period of 19 days. After the OER exposure, a parallel online post-test, a post OER exposure questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews were administered. The pre-test/post-test score comparison shows significant gain scores, suggesting the positive impact of the online lessons on the participants' English performance. However, the questionnaire and interview data reveal intriguing findings about the students' engagement and interaction with the online lessons, highlighting the notions of learner autonomy and self-regulated learning. This study, thus, represents a wake-up call for Thai ELT stakeholders to prepare to shift away from traditional teaching approaches, to modify teachers' behaviours, syllabus, and curriculum, and to empower learners to successfully cope with the changing educational environment. © 2021 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

Here, this study discusses the economic hardship of the FHWs during the pandemic time. Additionally, this study also identifies the various socio-economic factors responsible for the increasing mental stress level of FHWs in Odisha. Design/methodology/approach: The study is based on a telephonic survey method. Overall the study has collected 80 samples of FHWs from Odisha (India). Additionally, the study uses a logistic regression model to measure the impact of various socio-economic factors affecting the mental health status of FHWs during the pandemic time. Findings: The findings of this study depict that FHWs working as a Covid warrior during the pandemic time are facing severe economic vulnerability in their life. It is found that though the FHWs have worked tirelessly to save millions of human lives, but irregularity in salary payment and temporary jobs position have caused more mental distress to them. Moreover, the empirical findings have shown that factors such as joint family, social isolation, having an elderly member in their family, duty in Covid ward, staying in staff quarter and temporary job position are responsible for increasing the mental stress of FHWs in Odisha during the Covid-19 pandemic time.

178792,Platelet size as a predictor for severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-07-19,"Molecular data analysis is invaluable in understanding the overall behavior of a rapidly spreading virus population when epidemiological surveillance is problematic. It is also particularly beneficial in describing subgroups within the population, often identified as clades within a phylogenetic tree, that represent individuals connected via direct transmission or transmission via differing risk factors in viral spread. However, transmission patterns or viral dynamics within these smaller groups should not be expected to exhibit homogeneous behavior over time. As such, standard phylogenetic approaches that identify clusters based on summary statistics (e.g., median genetic distance over the clade) would not be expected to capture dynamic clusters of transmission. For this purpose, we have developed DYNAMITE (DYNAMic Identification of Transmission Epicenters), a cluster identification algorithm based on a branch-wise (rather than traditional clade-wise) search for cluster criteria, allowing partial clades to be recognized as clusters. Using simulated viral outbreaks with varying cluster types and dynamics, we show that DYNAMITE is consistently more sensitive than existing tools in detecting both static and dynamic transmission clusters. DYNAMITE has been implemented in R and released as open source at: github.com/ProsperiLab/DYNAMITE.","Magalis, Brittany Rife; Marini, Simone; Salemi, Marco; Prosperi, Mattia",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.21.427647,185

180622,Screening electrocardiogram in young athletes and military members: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-09-14,"BackgroundOpioid overdoses in Canada have shown dramatic increases over recent years, despite significant investments in harm reduction. Most community monitoring currently relies on emergency department and coroner data. Our team has previously shown that paramedic data can be a useful addition to the current metrics as paramedics regularly interact with opioid overdose patients. This study examines paramedic data to investigate the changes to community opioid overdoses in the era of COVID-19 to better support our strategic partners in their battle against the opioid crisis.MethodsThe electronic ambulance call report database of Peterborough Paramedics (Ontario, Canada) was examined. De-identified records for patients from 2017-2020 with documented problem codes of ‘Opioid Overdose’ were extracted. Patients receiving paramedic naloxone were also included. The data was cleaned and analysed, and incomplete records were removed. Statistical models including chi-squared tests of goodness-of-fit and post hoc pairwise t-tests were applied to the data. Ethics approval for this study was granted by the Trent University’s Research Ethics Board.Results788 opioid overdoses were identified out of 72,737 patients. There were 263 opioid overdoses found in 2020 representing 1.4% patients, a significant increase from 2017-2019 (p value: 0.006). The proportion of patients receiving paramedic naloxone was significantly increased from previous years (p value: 0.005) while bystander naloxone administration was significantly decreased (p value 0.002). Age, gender, and pick-up location types were not significantly different between 2020 and previous years.ConclusionDespite reduced overall call volumes in 2020, paramedics observed an increase in opioid overdoses. The increase in paramedic naloxone administration and decrease in bystander naloxone administration may indicate changes in usage practices of community opioid users or an instability in the drug supply.

However, details of the reliability and validity of these scales are unknown. The study aimed to evaluate some indicators of the reliability and validity of the Spanish version of the Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale. Methods: A validation study was carried out with 1,136 students of emerging age (18 and 29 years) from a Colombian university; 65.5% were female. Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were calculated for reliability, and exploratory and confirmatory factor analyzes for validity. Additionally, the gender differential item functioning (DIF) was estimated with Kendall's tau b. Results: The Spanish version of Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 and McDonald's omega of 0.95), a one-dimensional structure with acceptable goodness-of-fit indicators (CFI=0.94, TLI=0.91, and SRMR=0.04), and non-gender DIF (Kendall's tau b between 0.02 and 0.06). Conclusions: The Spanish version of the Attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccines Scale presents some appropriate reliability and validity indicators among university emerging adults. These findings should be explored in samples with other characteristics.","Campo-Arias, A.; Caamano-Rocha, L. E.; Pedrozo-Pupo, J.

The need has increased due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, as students must join online teaching and learning at home either they are at primary, secondary, or tertiary levels. Since the requirements are different according to the level of education, some educational applications are not suitable and complicated for lower education levels. Considering various users' needs, persona-based approach has been used in many studies to elicit users' requirements and derive diverse scenarios from user personas before moving to implementation stage. Thus, this case study proposes a persona-based approach to identify students' goals or needs, pains or challenges besides their satisfaction when using educational application prototypes. It involved eight prototypes for learning Computer Science topics and 29 secondary school students. The findings conclude how the persona-based approach can be used to investigate diverse users' needs, challenges, and scenarios as the inputs to design educational applications with digital contents or e-contents for specific topics or subjects. © 2021 IEEE.","Zanudin, N.

At the same time, available resources to aid impacted communities have not come close to matching need. To respond to this urgent need, the INSAN Psychosocial Support Centre in Istanbul, Turkey initiated the Safety Spark project as a capacity building project with 20 refugee gender-based violence survivors to be trained in Problem Management Plus. This is “a psychological intervention that aims to improve mental health, functioning and psychosocial wellbeing of adults” and thereafter to provide mental health and psychosocial support to other women survivors, thereby increasing the capacity of the community to heal itself. However, right after training, but 2 weeks before implementation sessions began, the onslaught of the coronavirus disease 2019 reached Turkey, making provision of traditional psychological support impossible. With the support of World Health Organization, an online training was added to the programme and survivors were taught to provide support remotely as well. The project is ongoing, and observed results appear to be promising. This field report provides an overview of the target population, procedures, settings and challenges faced during the training and implementation, solutions to overcome them and future recommendations.","Akbay-Safi, Sena Tabba Areej Laila Ragab Mahmoud",Intervention,https://doi.org/10.4103/intv.intv_21_21,185

The pandemic hit instruction with might, forcing schools and universities that were timidly experimenting with digital tools to reinvent themselves in days. The pandemic also offered incentives for creative solutions that, in normal times, would have been considered fit for submission to the committee for recursive committee submissions at best. This paper narrates a teaching experience of how we proposed and managed an at-distance remedial course in August that not only catered to more than twice the number of students expected by our best forecasts, but was a very good success once its effectiveness was compared to the outcomes predicted by the pre-enrollment test scores. We expose the design of the course and link its measured effectiveness with both its design and student engagement;in particular, we show that a different approach to the examination of cognitive load and to fostering student–teacher and student–student communication thanks to digital mediation could be effective in countermanding the math-induced drop-out phenomenon in STEM.","Rizzo, Ottavio G.",Education Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/educsci11070327,185

The SAU engulfed Surgical Ambulatory Clinic (SAC) which was a unit formerly run from 9am-5pm Monday-Friday by a surgical consultant, assessing patients referred to the unit by General Practitioners.Patients were triaged by ED and those without COVID-19 symptoms were referred to surgical specialty registrars before attending SAU. Data was collected retrospectively for attendances from 1st May- 31st May. Core trainees (CTs) from surgical specialties were redeployed from General Surgery (4), paediatric surgery (1), Urology (1), ENT (1), Plastics (2) to staff the Surgical Assessment Unit from 3rd May 2020.Seven-hundred and ninety-seven (797) patients attended SAU, with an average of 25 patients daily. Admission or discharge outcomes are unknown for fifteen percent (118) of patients. 50% (395) of attendances were General Surgical patients, 19% neurosurgical and 11% urology. One-third (238) of patients attended SAU were admitted to hospital. Mondays and Tuesdays were the busiest days with 9am and 12pm being most common presentation time.General Surgery accounted for the highest number of attendances, likely in part to its combination with SAC. High neurosurgical attendances are a result of the new ED pathways referring all head injuries to specialty, including very minor ones.","Griffin, Fiona",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.164,185
184644,[Video-laryngoscope (McGRATH MAC): a clinical assessment of its performance in consecutive 100 patients].,2014,"Introduction Several non-pharmaceutical interventions such as physical distancing, hand washing, self-isolation, and schools and business closures, were implemented in British Columbia (BC) following the first laboratory-confirmed case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on January 26, 2020, to minimize in-person contacts that could spread infections. The BC COVID-19 Population Mixing Patterns survey (BC-Mix) was established as a surveillance system to measure behaviour and contact patterns in BC over time to inform the timing of the easing/re-imposition of control measures. In this paper, we describe the BC-Mix survey design and the demographic characteristics of respondents. Methods The ongoing repeated online survey was launched in September 2020. Participants are mainly recruited through social media platforms (including Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, WhatsApp). A follow up survey is sent to participants two to four weeks after completing the baseline survey. Survey responses are weighted to BC population by age, sex, geography, and ethnicity to obtain generalizable estimates. Additional indices such as the material and social deprivation index, residential instability, economic dependency, and others are generated using census and location data. Results As of July 26, 2021, over 61,000 baseline survey responses were received of which 41,375 were eligible for analysis. Of the eligible participants, about 60% consented to follow up and about 27% provided their personal health numbers for linkage with healthcare databases. Approximately 50% of respondents were female, 39% were 55 years or older, 65% identified as white and 50% had at least a university degree. Conclusion The pandemic response is best informed by surveillance systems capable of timely assessment of behaviour patterns. BC-Mix survey respondents represent a large cohort of British Columbians providing near real-time information on behavioural and contact patterns in BC.

Automatic detecting of pulmonary infections based on computed tomography (CT) images has a huge potential for enhancing the traditional healthcare strategy for treating COVID-19. CT imaging is essential for diagnosis, the process of assessment, and the staging of COVID-19 infection. The detection in association with computed tomography faces many problems, including the high variability, and low density between the infection and normal tissues. Processing is used to solve a variety of diagnostic tasks, including highlighting and contrasting things of interest while taking color-coding into account. In addition, an evaluation is carried out using the relevant criteria for determining the alterations nature and improving a visibility of pathological changes and an accuracy of the X-ray diagnostic report. It is proposed that pre-processing methods for a series of dynamic images be used for these objectives. The lungs are segmented and parts of probable disease are identified using the wavelet transform and the Otsu threshold value. Delta maps and maps created with the Shearlet transform that have contrasting color coding are used to visualize and select features (markers). The efficiency of the suggested combination of approaches for investigating the variability of the internal geometric features (markers) of the object of interest in the photographs is demonstrated by analyzing the experimental and clinical material done in the work. The suggested system indicated that the total average coefficient obtained 97.64% regarding automatic and manual infection sectors, while the Jaccard similarity coefficient achieved 96.73% related to the segmentation of tumor and region infected by COVID-19. © 2021.

METHODS Sera samples were collected from SARS cases in the 5th, 20th and 35th month after onset of the illness. The SARS-CoV specific antibody was detected for all of them by ELISA and neutralized test simultaneously. The titer of neutralizing antibodies was calculated using Reed-Muench method, and the comparison between different time groups was analyzed regarding the variance of data on repeated measures after logarithm conversion. RESULTS 13, 17 and 13 sera samples were collected in the 5th, 20th and 35th month after onset. Results showed that despite the fact that the positive rates of ELISA antibody were 100%, 82.4% and 84.6% respectively,the neutralizing antibody was still positive for all the samples. The average neutralizing antibody titers were 1:43 (1:16-1:203), 1:36 (1:17-1:59) and 1:21 (1:10-1:39) on the 5th, 20th and 35th month after onset, and the differences were statistically significant (F = 60.419, P < 0.001). On the 35th month after the onset, 30.8% (4/13) of the patients were still having the neutralizing antibody level of above 1:36, but the neutralizing antibody level in another 30.8% (4/13) of the patients had decreased to as low as 1:10, when the cut-off level was set as 1:8. CONCLUSION Results of the study indicated that the neutralizing antibody of SARS cases could last for at least three years, but the sera specific antibody in SARS cases decreased gradually when time went by. However, neutralizing antibody in some of the cases decreased to a lower level on the 35th month. Further follow-up study was worthwhile to observe the long-lasting profile of antibody existence on SARS cases.","Xie, Shu-yun; Zeng, Guang; Xia, Shi-chang; Zhang, Pan-he; Yin, Wei-dong; Liu, Bi-yao; Yang, Shi-gui; Cao, Wu-chun",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17850700/,185

Expression of the reporter gene beta-glucuronidase (GUS) (2-8 microg per 10(6) cells) and the porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) ORF5 (1-2 microg per 10(6) cells) has been shown using a TGEV-derived minigenome. GUS expression levels increased about eightfold with the m.o.i. and were maintained for more than eight passages in cell culture. Nevertheless, instability of the GUS and ORF5 subgenomic mRNAs was observed from passages five and four, respectively. About a quarter of the cells in culture expressing the helper virus also produced the reporter gene as determined by studying GUS mRNA production by in situ hybridization or immunodetection to visualize the protein synthesized. Expression of GUS was detected in the lungs, but not in the gut, of swine immunized with the virus vector. Around a quarter of lung cells showing replication of the helper virus were also positive for the reporter gene. Interestingly, strong humoral immune responses to both GUS and PRRSV ORF5 were induced in swine with this virus vector. The large cloning capacity and the tissue specificity of the TGEV-derived minigenomes suggest that these virus vectors are very promising for vaccine development.","Alonso, Sara; Sola, Isabel; Teifke, Jens P; Reimann, Ilona; Izeta, Ander; Balasch, Mónica; Plana-Durán, Juan; Moormann, Rob J M; Enjuanes, Luis",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11842252/,185

DATA SOURCE PubMed (1966-2006), PubMed ""related articles,"" publications and Web sites of the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, personal files, abstract proceedings, and reference lists. STUDY SELECTION We reviewed English-language publications pertaining to clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of AI H5N1 and infection control expressly relating to the intensive care setting. DATA SYNTHESIS The majority of reported patients with AI H5N1 are critically ill and require intensive care management. These patients progress rapidly to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Multiorgan failure occurs in a large proportion. Because of the nonspecific clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is critical to seek a history of exposure to poultry or wild birds in suspected cases. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on nasopharyngeal aspirate is the most reliable method for the laboratory diagnosis of AI H5N1. Treatment includes starting neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir as early as possible in addition to the standard supportive management. Aerosol generating procedures should be minimized to avoid nosocomial transmission. Strict infection control procedures are paramount to staff safety, although human-to-human transmission is rare as of this time. CONCLUSIONS Many patients with AI H5N1 are critically ill either at presentation or shortly thereafter. Intensivists and intensive care units are therefore at the front line for this new cause of severe lung injury. Practitioners must be familiar with the nonspecific presentation of AI H5N1 and its diagnostic and therapeutic options. Although treating the infected patient with AI H5N1 is a priority, safeguarding healthcare workers and other patients must be considered of equal priority.","Arabi, Yaseen; Gomersall, Charles D; Ahmed, Qanta A; Boynton, Bruce R; Memish, Ziad A",Critical care medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17414089/,185
194390,Clinical characteristics of critically ill patients with COVID-19.,2021,"Long-term persistence of Ag-experienced CD8 cells, a class of T lymphocytes with cytotoxic function, contributes to immunological memory against intracellular pathogens. After Ag clearance, memory CD8 cells are maintained over time by a slow proliferation, primarily cytokine driven. In this article, we show that the bone marrow (BM) is the crucial organ where such basal division of memory CD8 cells occurs. BM memory CD8 cells contain a higher percentage of proliferating cells than their corresponding cells in either spleen or lymph nodes from C57BL/6 mice. This occurs both in the case of memory-phenotype CD44(high) CD8 cells and in the case of Ag-specific memory CD8 cells. Importantly, the absolute number of Ag-specific memory CD8 cells dividing in the BM largely exceeds that in spleen, lymph nodes, liver, and lung taken together. In the BM, Ag-specific memory CD8 cells express lower levels of CD127, i.e., the alpha-chain of IL-7R, than in either spleen or lymph nodes. We interpret these results as indirect evidence that Ag-specific memory CD8 cells receive proliferative signals by IL-7 and/or IL-15 in the BM and propose that the BM acts as a saturable ""niche"" for the Ag-independent proliferation of memory CD8 cells. Taken together, our novel findings indicate that the BM plays a relevant role in the maintenance of cytotoxic T cell memory, in addition to its previously described involvement in long-term Ab responses.","Parretta, Elisabetta; Cassese, Giuliana; Barba, Pasquale; Santoni, Angela; Guardiola, John; Di Rosa, Francesca",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15944266/,185

METHODS 24 patients managed with a standard corticosteroid protocol developed by Peking Union Medical College Hospital were followed up for 2 months and their clinical outcomes were documented. Plasma levels of interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 p70, interferon gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) were determined by quantitative ELISA during the course of disease respectively. 12 healthy blood donors were used as normal controls. RESULTS All SARS patients had remarkably increased plasma IL-8 concentrations (median 31.23 ng/L) at the onset of disease compared with those of normal controls (6.28 ng/L, P < 0.01). Along with the course of disease IL-8 concentration kept going up and 75% (18/24) patients reached a peak median concentration of 149.65 ng/L (P < 0.01) at the third and fourth weeks. IL-8 came back to normal control levels one month after discharged from hospital. Meanwhile, SARS patients also showed high a TNF alpha level (median 23.12 ng/L) (P < 0.01) at the second week and reached a peak median of 136.35 ng/L (P < 0.05) at the third an fourth weeks. One month after discharged from hospital the plasma TNF alpha concentration fell down to a median of 94.88 ng/L, but it was still much higher than normal controls (3.77 ng/L, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION The SARS-associated coronovirus infection may cause complex cytokine cascade. IL-8 and TNF alpha probably play important roles in mediating strong inflammatory response, which are thought to be responsible for lung injury in SARS patients.","Xie, Jing; Han, Yang; Li, Tai-sheng; Qiu, Zhi-feng; Ma, Xiao-jun; Fan, Hong-wei; Lü, Wei; Liu, Zheng-yin; Wang, Zhong; Wang, Huan-ling; Deng, Guo-hua",Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14514395/,185

There are a large number of complex factors driving the spread of pandemics, and, as a result, multiple modeling techniques play an increasingly important role in shaping public policy and decision-making. As different countries and regions go through phases of the pandemic, the questions and data availability also change. Especially of interest is aligning model development and data collection to support response efforts at each stage of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented in terms of real-time collection and dissemination of a number of diverse datasets, ranging from disease outcomes, to mobility, behaviors, and socio-economic factors. The data sets have been critical from the perspective of disease modeling and analytics to support policymakers in real time. In this overview article, we survey the data landscape around COVID-19, with a focus on how such datasets have aided modeling and response through different stages so far in the pandemic. We also discuss some of the current challenges and the needs that will arise as we plan our way out of the pandemic.","Adiga, Aniruddha; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Marathe, Madhav; Mortveit, Henning; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Vullikanti, Anil",J Indian Inst Sci,,185

However, its effectiveness hinges on adherence by individuals who face substantial burdens from the required behavioral restrictions. Here, we investigate sources of individual variation in adhering to social distancing guidelines. In a high-powered study (N = 895), we tested direct and indirect effects of boredom and self-control on adherence. The results showed that both traits were important predictors of adherence but the underlying mechanisms differed. Specifically, individuals high in boredom perceived social distancing as more difficult, which in turn reduced their adherence (i.e., a mediated effect). In contrast, individuals high in self-control adhered more to the guidelines without perceiving them as more or less difficult; however, self-control moderated the effect of difficulty on adherence. Our results are immediately relevant to improve the efficacy of social distancing guidelines in the COVID-19 response.","Wolff, Wanja; Martarelli, Corinna S; Schüler, Julia; Bieleke, Maik",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,185

From 'stay-at-home' orders to the progressive lifting of restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on consumer behaviours and waste disposal habits. The purpose of this short communication is to examine time series waste collection and disposal data in a mid-sized Canadian city to understand how behavioural changes have affected municipal waste management. The results suggest that private waste disposal increased during the pandemic. This may be due to people doing home renovations in order to accommodate working from home. Furthermore, it appears that changes in consumer habits destabilized the consistency of waste disposal tonnage when compared to the same time period in 2019. When considering curbside residential waste collection, there was also an increase in tonnage. This may be the result of more waste being generated at home due to changes in eating and cooking habits, and cleaning routine. Finally, the ratio of residential waste collection to total disposal is examined. More residential waste is being generated, which may have environmental and operational effects, especially related to collection and transportation. The results from this study are important from an operational perspective, and will help planners and policy makers to better prepare for changes in the waste stream due to pandemics or other emergencies.","Richter, Amy; Ng, Kelvin Tsun Wai; Vu, Hoang Lan; Kabir, Golam",J Environ Manage,,185

214770,Broad-Spectrum Anti-coronavirus Vaccines and Therapeutics to Combat the Current COVID-19 Pandemic and Future Coronavirus Disease Outbreaks,2021,"Suppressing infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will probably require the rapid identification and isolation of individuals infected with the virus on an ongoing basis. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are accurate but costly, which makes the regular testing of every individual expensive. These costs are a challenge for all countries around the world, but particularly for low-to-middle-income countries. Cost reductions can be achieved by pooling (or combining) subsamples and testing them in groups1-7. A balance must be struck between increasing the group size and retaining test sensitivity, as sample dilution increases the likelihood of false-negative test results for individuals with a low viral load in the sampled region at the time of the test8. Similarly, minimizing the number of tests to reduce costs must be balanced against minimizing the time that testing takes, to reduce the spread of the infection. Here we propose an algorithm for pooling subsamples based on the geometry of a hypercube that, at low prevalence, accurately identifies individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 in a small number of tests and few rounds of testing. We discuss the optimal group size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease, largely parallel searches are preferred. We report proof-of-concept experiments in which a positive subsample was detected even when diluted 100-fold with negative subsamples (compared with 30-48-fold dilutions described in previous studies9-11). We quantify the loss of sensitivity due to dilution and discuss how it may be mitigated by the frequent re-testing of groups, for example. With the use of these methods, the cost of mass testing could be reduced by a large factor. At low prevalence, the costs decrease in rough proportion to the prevalence. Field trials of our approach are under way in Rwanda and South Africa. The use of group testing on a massive scale to monitor infection rates closely and continually in a population, along with the rapid and effective isolation of people with SARS-CoV-2 infections, provides a promising pathway towards the long-term control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Mutesa, Leon; Ndishimye, Pacifique; Butera, Yvan; Souopgui, Jacob; Uwineza, Annette; Rutayisire, Robert; Ndoricimpaye, Ella Larissa; Musoni, Emile; Rujeni, Nadine; Nyatanyi, Thierry; Ntagwabira, Edouard; Semakula, Muhammed; Musanabaganwa, Clarisse; Nyamwasa, Daniel; Ndashimye, Maurice; Ujeneza, Eva; Mwikarago, Ivan Emile; Muvunyi, Claude Mambo; Mazarati, Jean Baptiste; Nsanzimana, Sabin; Turok, Neil; Ndifon, Wilfred",Nature (Lond.),,185

METHODS: The mental health status of respondents was assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. RESULTS: 5657 individuals participated in this study. History of chronic disease was a common risk factor for severe present depression (OR 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-2.66, p < 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.41, 95% CI, 1.97-2.95, p < 0.001), and insomnia (OR 2.33, 95% CI, 1.83-2.95, p < 0.001) in the survey population. Female respondents had a higher risk of depression (OR 1.61, 95% CI, 1.39-1.87, p < 0.001) and anxiety (OR 1.35, 95% CI, 1.15-1.57, p < 0.001) than males.

218884,Vt Storm Secondary to Coronavirus Disease (covid-19),2021,"The sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought drastic changes to people's daily lives, work, and the surrounding environment. Investigations into these changes are very important for decision makers to implement policies on economic loss assessments and stimulation packages, city reopening, resilience of the environment, and arrangement of medical resources. In order to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on people's lives, activities, and the natural environment, this paper investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of Nighttime Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI) before and during the pandemic in mainland China. The monthly mean NTL radiance, and daily and monthly mean AQI are calculated over mainland China and compared before and during the pandemic. Our results show that the monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area, transportation, and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 (nWcm -2. sr -1), respectively. We found that the Number of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior, while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness after the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for mainland China from January to March 2020, with cleaner air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of mainland China has improved with the reduction in non-essential industries and motor vehicle usage. This evidence demonstrates that the Chinese government has executed very stringent quarantine policies to deal with the pandemic. The decisive response to control the spread of COVID-19 provides a reference for other parts of the world.","Liu, Qian; Sha, Dexuan; Liu, Wei; Houser, Paul; Zhang, Luyao; Hou, Ruizhi; Lan, Hai; Flynn, Colin; Lu, Mingyue; Hu, Tao; Yang, Chaowei",Remote Sens.,,185

222294,COVID-19 pneumonia: ARDS or not?,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health crisis, but its effects on tobacco users remain ill-defined. This report aimed to assess the relationship between tobacco product-specific risk perceptions for COVID-19 and changes in tobacco use since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: A sample (n=776) of past-30 day exclusive smokers (n=238), exclusive e-cigarette users (n=143), and dual users (n=395) residing in the US and aged 18 or older was collected using Mechanical Turk from April 27 to June 8, 2020. Adjusted associations between tobacco product-specific COVID-19 risk perceptions (i.e. risk that smokers/vapers are at for COVID-19 relative to non-smokers/non-vapers) and changes in tobacco use since the pandemic began were assessed using partial proportional odds models. RESULTS: A majority of those who used cigarettes (63.7%) and e-cigarettes (56.1%) felt that the risk of COVID-19 was greater for users of their tobacco product than for non-users. Twenty-four percent of smokers had increased their cigarette use since the start of the pandemic and 28.0% had decreased. Similarly, 27.3% of e-cigarette users had increased their e-cigarette use since the start of the pandemic and 23.8% had decreased. Higher risk perceptions for COVID-19 were associated with reductions in tobacco use since the pandemic began for exclusive e-cigarette users and dual users. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide support that tobacco product-specific COVID-19 risk perceptions may be an important correlate of changes in tobacco use during the pandemic. Targeted information to inform tobacco users regarding their risks for COVID-19 is needed during this public health crisis.","White, Augustus M; Li, Dongmei; Snell, L Morgan; O039,; Connor, Richard; Hoetger, Cosima; Croft, Daniel; Lester, Rebecca C; McIntosh, Scott; Underwood, Megan; Schneller, Liane; Breland, Alison; Barnes, Andrew J; Cobb, Caroline O; Ossip, Deborah J",Nicotine tob. res,,185

Since the identification of critical patients is crucial for developing effective management strategies, we evaluated clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment provided, and oxygenation to identify potential predictors of mortality among critical COVID-19 pneumonia patients. We retrospectively utilized data from seven critical patients who were admitted to our hospital during April 2020 and required mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was to clarify potential predictor of mortality. All patients were older than 70 years, five were men, six had hypertension, and three ultimately died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors tended to be never smokers (0 pack-years vs. 30 pack-years, p = 0.08), to have higher body mass index (31.3 kg/m2 vs. 25.3 kg/m2, p = 0.06), to require earlier tracheal intubation after symptom onset (2.7 days vs. 5.5 days, p = 0.07), and had fewer lymphocytes on admission (339 /µL vs. 518 /µL, p = 0.05). During the first week after tracheal intubation, non-survivors displayed lower values for minimum ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration (P/F ratio) (44 mmHg vs. 122 mmHg, p < 0.01) and poor response to intensive therapy compared with survivors. In summary, we show that obesity and lymphopenia could predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and that the trend of lower P/F ratio during the first week of mechanical ventilation could provide useful prognostic information.","Kishaba, Tomoo; Maeda, Akiko; Nabeya, Daijiro; Nagano, Hiroaki",Tohoku J Exp Med,,185

The infrared thermography (IRT) represents a fast measurement in case of screening in public places. One of the limitations of IRT is the resolution of sensor, which has close connection with the distance between camera and ROI. To maximize the effectivity of resolution of the camera is to reduce the distance from the object. The aim of presented study showed the possibility how to protect the camera or medical staff that operates the device against potential infection or contamination from the person with infection. Two protective foils of different thickness (40 μm;9 μm) were tested as a barrier between the IRT and the ROI (black body model and human face). Even though the results have shown that the transparent foils decrease linearly the measured value of the temperature, it can be used as a protective barrier between IRT and the object if an appropriate recalculation is done during analysis of IRT images. Results are acceptable in the case of 9μm foil especially. The authors see this possibility as a minor concession from IRT standards but as a great help in health protection. The transparent foil can be used as protective barrier of the infrared camera.","Bernard, V.; Staffa, E.; Bourek, A.; Dostál, M.; Mornstein, V.; Jůza, T.; Pokorná, J.",Lekar a Technika,,185

Since a substantial proportion of the U.S. population report a non-English language as their primary language, it is critical that information is disseminated in multiple languages. OBJECTIVES: To examine the availability of language translations of visitation restrictions on adult National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers (CCCs) Web sites. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of visitation policies abstracted from public-facing Web sites of CCCs in June 2020. Using U.S. Census data, CCC's city and state proportions of self-identifying Hispanic/Latinx population were categorized into three cohorts: low (<10%), moderate (10%-20%), and high (>20%). RESULTS: As of June 2020, all 50 CCCs published a COVID-19 visitation policy on their Web site. Of these, 33 (66%) posted policies only in English, whereas 17 (34%) included one or more non-English translations. A minority of CCCs published Spanish language resources, which did not differ based on state or city demographics: for example, only 42% (8 of 19), 10% (1 of 10), and 38% (8 of 21) of CCCs published Spanish language resources in cities with low, moderate, and high Hispanic/Latinx populations, respectively. CONCLUSION: Most CCC's did not publish non-English language translations of their visitor policies. Even in cities and states with larger Hispanic/Latinx populations, most CCCs did not publish resources in Spanish. This study highlights a key opportunity to mitigate communication barriers and deliver culturally competent, patient-centered care.","Dhawan, Natasha; Subbiah, Ishwaria M; Yeh, Jonathan C; Thompson, Benjamin; Hildner, Zachary; Jawed, Areeba; Prommer, Eric; Sinclair, Christian",J. pain symptom manage,,185

231016,Lung ultrasonography versus chest CT in COVID-19 pneumonia: a two-centered retrospective comparison study from China,2020,"BACKGROUND: Obesity and steatosis are associated with COVID-19 severe pneumonia. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced immune response are typical of these patients. In particular, adipose tissue is the organ playing the crucial role. So, it is necessary to evaluate fat mass and not simpler body mass index (BMI), because BMI leaves a portion of the obese population unrecognized. The aim is to evaluate the relationship between Percentage of Fat Mass (FM%) and immune-inflammatory response, after 10 days in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: Prospective observational study of 22 adult patients, affected by COVID-19 pneumonia and admitted to the ICU and classified in two sets: (10) lean and (12) obese, according to FM% and age (De Lorenzo classification). Patients were analyzed at admission in ICU and at 10th day. RESULTS: Obese have steatosis, impaired hepatic function, compromise immune response and higher inflammation. In addition, they have a reduced prognostic nutritional index (PNI), nutritional survival index for ICU patients. CONCLUSION: This is the first study evaluating FM% in COVID-19 patient. We underlined obese characteristic with likely poorly prognosis and an important misclassification of obesity. A not negligible number of patients with normal BMI could actually have an excess of adipose tissue and therefore have an unfavorable outcome such as an obese. Is fundamental personalized patients nutrition basing on disease phases.","De Lorenzo, Antonino; Tarsitano, Maria Grazia; Falcone, Carmela; Di Renzo, Laura; Romano, Lorenzo; Macheda, Sebastiano; Ferrarelli, Anna; Labate, Demetrio; Tescione, Marco; Bilotta, Federico; Gualtieri, Paola",J Transl Med,,185

COVID-19 has spread to 46 countries internationally. Total fatality rate of COVID-19 is estimated at 3.46% by far based on published data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC). Average incubation period of COVID-19 is around 6.4 days, ranges from 0 to 24 days. The basic reproductive number (R0 ) of COVID-19 ranges from 2 to 3.5 at the early phase regardless of different prediction models, which is higher than SARS and MERS. A study from China CDC showed majority of patients (80.9%) were considered asymptomatic or mild pneumonia but released large amounts of viruses at the early phase of infection, which posed enormous challenges for containing the spread of COVID-19. Nosocomial transmission was another severe problem. A total of 3019 health workers were infected by 12 February 2020, which accounted for 3.83% of total number of infections, and extremely burdened the health system, especially in Wuhan.

An observational pilot study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: D-dimer levels are elevated in COVID 19 and they correlate to the levels of other inflammatory markers such us ferritin, fibrinogen and C-reactive protein. It may be possible to correct D-dimer value in function of inflammatory markers, thus identifying patients at higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Our objectives are estimating a corrected value of plasma D-dimer as a linear function of ferritin, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen and stablishing a cut-off point of high probability of VTE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Age and sex matched case-control study of all patients diagnosed with COVID 19 and VTE between March and May 2020 in a tertiary hospital in Madrid (Spain). Using linear regression, the best predictive model will be estimated and residual D-dimer values will be obtained and analyzed using ROC curves to determine its discriminative performance. RESULTS: Thirty-eight cases and seventy-six controls were included. There was 63.2% of men and mean age was 68.2. D-dimer was best predicted by a linear model including fibrinogen, ferritin and C-reactive protein. Using residual values, the optimal cutoff point was 2165ng/mL, with a sensitivity of 57.9% and specificity of 98.7%. CONCLUSION: It is possible to estimate a D-dimer corrected value in function of ferritin, C-reactive protein and fibrinogen. Using the observed and estimated value we can obtain a residual value that performs well as a screening method to detect patients who would benefit for further VTE diagnostic testing.","Rueda-Camino, José Antonio; Sendín-Martín, Vanesa; Joya-Seijo, María Dolores; Angelina-García, María; Zamarro-García, Celia; Gimena-Rodríguez, Francisco Javier; Barba-Martín, Raquel",Med. clin (Ed. impr.),,185

METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were recruited from a single COVID-19 hospital in Southern Switzerland. At three months patients underwent radiological and functional follow-up through CT scan, lung function tests, and 6 min walking test. Furthermore, quality of life was assessed through self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: Among 39 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 32 (82% of all participants) presented abnormalities in CT scan and 25 (64.1%) had lung function tests impairment at three months. Moreover, 31 patients (79.5%) reported a perception of poor health due to respiratory symptoms and all 39 patients showed an overall decreased quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Medium-term follow up at three months of patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia shows the persistence of abnormalities in CT scans, a significant functional impairment assessed by lung function tests and a decreased quality of life in affected patients. Further studies evaluating the long-term impact are warranted to guarantee an appropriate follow-up to patients recovering from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","Gianella, Pietro; Rigamonti, Elia; Marando, Marco; Tamburello, Adriana; Grazioli Gauthier, Lorenzo; Argentieri, Gianluca; Puligheddu, Carla; Pagnamenta, Alberto; Pons, Marco; Fusi-Schmidhauser, Tanja",BMC Pulm Med,,185

In this issue, we'd like to share our first-line treatment experience in treating COVID-19. Hemodynamics need be closely monitored and different types of shock should be distinguished. Vasoconstrictor drugs should be used rationally and alerting of complications is of the same importance. The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) needs to be assessed, and effective prevention should be carried out for high-risk patients. It is necessary to consider the possibility of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with sudden onset of oxygenation deterioration, respiratory distress, reduced blood pressure. However, comprehensive analysis of disease state should be taken into the interpretation of abnormally elevated D-Dimer. Nutritional support is the basis of treatment. It's important to establish individual therapy regimens and to evaluate, monitor and adjust dynamically. Under the current epidemic situation, convalescent plasma can only be used empirically, indications need to be strictly screened, the blood transfusion process should be closely monitored and the curative effect should be dynamically evaluated.","Li, X Y; Du, B; Wang, Y S; Kang, H Y J; Wang, F; Sun, B; Qiu, H B; Tong, Z H",Zhonghua Jie He He Hu Xi Za Zhi,,185

238251,The effect of RAAS inhibitors on acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and in-hospital mortality in the hypertensive Covid-19 patients,2021,"BACKGROUND: In infectious disease transmission dynamics, the high heterogeneity in individual infectiousness indicates that few index cases generate large numbers of secondary cases, which is commonly known as superspreading events. The heterogeneity in transmission can be measured by describing the distribution of the number of secondary cases as a negative binomial (NB) distribution with dispersion parameter, k. However, such inference framework usually neglects the under-ascertainment of sporadic cases, which are those without known epidemiological link and considered as independent clusters of size one, and this may potentially bias the estimates. METHODS: In this study, we adopt a zero-truncated likelihood-based framework to estimate k. We evaluate the estimation performance by using stochastic simulations, and compare it with the baseline non-truncated version. We exemplify the analytical framework with three contact tracing datasets of COVID-19. RESULTS: We demonstrate that the estimation bias exists when the under-ascertainment of index cases with 0 secondary case occurs, and the zero-truncated inference overcomes this problem and yields a less biased estimator of k. We find that the k of COVID-19 is inferred at 0.32 (95%CI: 0.15, 0.64), which appears slightly smaller than many previous estimates. We provide the simulation codes applying the inference framework in this study. CONCLUSIONS: The zero-truncated framework is recommended for less biased transmission heterogeneity estimates. These findings highlight the importance of individual-specific case management strategies to mitigate COVID-19 pandemic by lowering the transmission risks of potential super-spreaders with priority.","Zhao, Shi; Shen, Mingwang; Musa, Salihu S; Guo, Zihao; Ran, Jinjun; Peng, Zhihang; Zhao, Yu; Chong, Marc K C; He, Daihai; Wang, Maggie H",BMC Med Res Methodol,,185

METHODS: Four sample treatments in three-step procedure for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva, consisting in 1) heating at 95 °C during 5 minutes for sample inactivation, 2) sample treatment, and 3) analysis by RT-LAMP were evaluated using saliva samples with known amounts of added viral particles and saliva from infected individuals. RESULTS: Three treatments had a limit of detection of 500.000 viral particles per ml of saliva and could have a practical use for detecting those individuals that potentially could transmit the disease. The treatment consisting of a combination of phosphate buffer, dithiothreitol, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and proteinase K, and an additional 95 °C heating yielded the lower LOD 95 and the sensitivity ranged from 100% in patients with RT-PCRs NPS of Ct<20 to 47.8% in patients with Cts>30. CONCLUSIONS: This report highlights the importance for an adequate sample treatment in saliva for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and describes a cheap and flexible procedure that can be adapted to-point-of-care and, although its sensitivity is lower than RT-PCRs, can contribute to the Covid-19 control by the detection of individuals able to transmit the disease.","Rubio, Camila P; Franco-Martínez, Lorena; Resalt, Cristina Sánchez; Torres-Cantero, Alberto; Morata-Martínez, Irene; Bernal, Enrique; Alcaraz, María J; Vicente-Romero, María R; Martínez-Subiela, Silvia; Tvarijonaviciute, Asta; Cerón, José J",Int. j. infect. dis,,185

Shortly following the disease outbreak, like SARS-CoV virus, all affected countries are implementing various preventive and control measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. Optimizing public health system during COVID-19 pandemic requires not only advanced medical and biological sciences knowledge, but also all human sciences related to social, as well as nutritional behavior, and lifestyle practices. AIM: To investigate the effect of COVID-19- quarantine on healthy nutritional behavior and lifestyle practices among Jordanian population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study among Jordanian population was conducted using an online questionnaire between March and April 2020. Participants were kindly requested to answer a standardized and validated structured questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, place of residence, and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height); nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, snakes, water intake), and physical activity behavior were requested. RESULTS: A total of 4473 respondents were included in the study; obese (n = 1135), normal body weight (n = 1561), and underweight (n = 116). During COVID-19 quarantine, a significant increase in body weight (12.9% underweight, 28.5% normal body weight, 36.4% overweight' and 41.1% of obese (p < 0.001) was reported. Moreover, the number of snacks between meals (p < 0.001), number of main meals (p < 0.001), and the smoking rate was also increased significantly; however, there was no significant difference regarding physical activity among various weight status groups (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we have provided evidence, for the first time, that there were significant negative changes in healthy nutritional behavior among Jordanians during COVID-19 quarantine who encountered significantly increased body weight, appetite, and smoking. Hence, future larger cross-sectional studies are warranted.","Al-Domi, Hayder; Al-Dalaeen, Anfal; Al-Rosan, Sara; Batarseh, Nour; Nawaiseh, Hala",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,185

N plays key roles at different steps in the replication cycle and is used as a serological marker of infection. Here we characterize the biochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 N. We define the N domains important for oligomerization and RNA binding that are associated with spherical droplet formation and suggest that N accessibility and assembly may be regulated by phosphorylation. We also map the RNA binding interface using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. Finally, we find that the N protein C-terminal domain is the most immunogenic by sensitivity, based upon antibody binding to COVID-19 patient samples from the US and Hong Kong. Together, these findings uncover domain-specific insights into the significance of SARS-CoV-2 N and highlight the diagnostic value of using N domains as highly specific and sensitive markers of COVID-19.","Wu, Chao; Qavi, Abraham J; Hachim, Asamaa; Kavian, Niloufar; Cole, Aidan R; Moyle, Austin B; Wagner, Nicole D; Sweeney-Gibbons, Joyce; Rohrs, Henry W; Gross, Michael L; Peiris, J S Malik; Basler, Christopher F; Farnsworth, Christopher W; Valkenburg, Sophie A; Amarasinghe, Gaya K; Leung, Daisy W",,,185
242146,Challenges in Sedation Management in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19: a Brief Review,2021,"The health-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Coronavirus Pandemic (COVID-19) have recently increased awareness of the need for countries to increase fiscal space for health. Prior to these, many Low and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) had embraced the concept of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and have either commenced or are in the process of implementing various models of health insurance in order to provide financial access to health care to their populations. While evidence of a relationship between experimentation with UHC and increased access to and utilisation of health care in LMICs is common, there is inadequate research evidence on the specific health financing model that is most appropriate for pursuing the objectives of UHC in these settings. Drawing on a synthesis of empirical and theoretical discourses on the feasibility of UHC in LMICs, this paper argues that the journey towards UHC is not a ‘one size fits all’ process, but a long-term policy engagement that requires adaptation to the specific socio-cultural and political economy contexts of implementing countries. The study draws on the WHO’s framework for tracking progress towards UHC using the implementation of a mildly progressive pluralistic health financing model in Ghana and advocates a comprehensive discourse on the potential for LMICs to build resilient and responsive health systems to facilitate a gradual transition towards UHC.","Domapielle, Maximillian Kolbe",Heliyon,,185

242297,A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Examining the Effect of Exercise on Individuals With Intellectual Disability,2020,"Abstract COVID-19 restrictions required a transition of our Soil Science and Forest Soils courses to an online format. A pre-transition survey found that ?10% of students enrolled in our courses lacked high-speed internet capable of streaming videos and/or computers compatible with the applications in our Learning Management System (LMS). To ensure that students with limited internet or technology were not left behind, we adopted a low-tech/bandwidth delivery (slides + transcript with LMS-delivered assessments) of all lectures and recitation activities. Students could also complete either a low-tech/bandwidth (lab slides + transcripts) or high-tech/bandwidth lab option (delivered via video). Upon completion, students were surveyed to assess preferences and perceptions which are vital in understanding how our approach impacted student motivation, engagement with the material, and overall course satisfaction. Despite 90% of the students having access to high-speed internet, ?45% of the students used the low-tech solutions either exclusively or half the time, even when high-tech options (such as video) were available. Overall, students felt the low-tech/bandwidth delivery of the lecture (?87%) and recitation (?76%) material was effective. Students (?74%) also reported that online delivery of the lab material effectively supported their learning and was an effective replacement for the in-lab learning experience. Students preferred in-person to online delivery (63% vs. 17%) with 20% undecided. Noting the flexibility and organization of the course, 69% of the students felt the online delivery of our courses was more effective than their other courses despite, or perhaps because of, the lack of high-tech delivery. Our experience demonstrates one approach to adapting an in-person course to a virtual environment that considers inequities in broadband and technology access. Despite being perceived as effective by our students, low-tech options were less preferred than in-person instruction suggesting that, while effective, it was not viewed as equivalent.

This study examines how socially isolated individuals with a history of heavy drinking used alcohol during the pandemic. METHODS: Data for this study came from an add-on to the Managing Heavy Drinking (MHD) longitudinal study of drivers convicted of DWI that was conducted in Erie County, New York. Pre-COVID information (October 2019-March 2020) was augmented with a COVID-19 questionnaire collected between July and August 2020. A total of 92 participants completed the COVID-19 survey. RESULTS: The sample of problem drinkers showed a significant increase after the pandemic outbreak in the average number of drinking days from 1.99 to 2.49 per week (p = 0.047), but a significant decrease in the average number of drinks per drinking day, from 3.74 to 2.74 (p = 0.003). The proportion of individuals who drank more frequently was greater among those who, before the outbreak had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score <8 (26% increase) compared with those with an AUDIT score of >8 (13%). Alcohol treatment was also associated with the frequency of drinking, with individuals who were not in alcohol treatment showing a 16% increase in frequency compared with a 10% increase among those in treatment. Further, individuals who, after the outbreak worried about their health (30%) or finances (37%) reported greater increases in the frequency of drinking than those who did not worry about their health (17%) or finances (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the individuals in our sample showed small changes in the frequency andheaviness of drinking after the outbreak of COVID-19, effects that opposite in direction from one another and thus resulted in no overall change in drinks consumed. Nonetheless, we identified factors that influenced the effects of the pandemic ond rinking behavior among individuals convicted of DWI, which emphasizes the need to individualize these individuals' treatment, particularly in the context of dramatic environmental change.","Manning, Amy R; Romano, Eduardo; Diebold, Josal; Nochajski, Thomas H; Taylor, Eileen; Voas, Robert B; Scherer, Michael",Alcohol. clin. exp. res,,185
247192,"Case Volumes and Perioperative Coronavirus Disease 2019 Incidence in Neurosurgical Patients During a Pandemic: Experiences at Two Tertiary Care Centers in Washington, DC",2020,"The severe course of COVID-19 is characterized by a high level of inflammation which requires the use of additional diagnostic technologies to clarify the cause of it. The objective: To study the informational value of proadrenomedullin (PADM) in patients with the novel coronavirus infection of COVID-19. Subjects and methods. The retrospective study included 37 patients (n = 37) diagnosed with severe viral pneumonia (SARS-CoV2) who were treated in the intensive care unit of Pavlov First Saint Petersburg State Medical University. To assess the significance of PADM as a biomarker of bacterial infection, patients were divided into two groups: The group of patients with viral pneumonia without sepsis (n = 24) and the group of those who developed sepsis and septic shock complicating the course of the new coronavirus infection (n = 13). PADM was assessed as a criterion for the severity of the disease in the groups of deceased (n = 19) and survivors (n = 18). Data were statistically processed in the computer mathematics system R, version 3.6.2, the prognostic significance of PADM was assessed using linear regression. Results. The median PADM in the group without sepsis was higher than the reference value - 1.1 (0.5;4.3) nmol/L, in patients with sepsis that complicated the course of viral pneumonia - 2.8 (1.1;5.7) nmol/L (p = 0.0019). Significant differences were revealed between the baseline levels of PADM in patients with different outcomes: in the surviving group, the median was 0.99 (0.5;3.14) nmol/L, and in the group of deceased - 2.70 (0.94;5.86 ) nmol/L. In surviving patients, the changes in PADM levels had a linear distribution throughout the entire period of stay in the intensive care unit. In deceased patients, within 20 days before death, PADM tended to grow significantly and reached its maximum by the time of the outcome. Conclusion. The assessment of the PADM blood level can be used to clarify the addition of a bacterial infection in patients with pneumonia caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus. The study of changes in its level makes it possible to objectify the prediction of the course of COVID-19 - favorable or unfavorable. Data accumulation is required to clarify specific PADM values that predict the outcome in COVID-19 patients. © 2020 Messenger of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation. All rights reserved.","Malinina, D.

247597,Incidence and outcome of myocardial infarction treated with percutaneous coronary intervention during COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"PURPOSE: This paper aims to fill gaps in one's knowledge of the impact of organizational change on two outcomes relevant to hospital service quality (performance obstacles and physician job satisfaction) and in one's knowledge of the role of middle manager change-oriented leadership in relation to the same outcomes. Further, the authors aim to identify how physician participation in decision-making is impacted by organizational change and change-oriented leadership, as well as how it mediates the relationships between these two variables, performance obstacles and job satisfaction. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study adopted a cross-sectional survey design including data from Norwegian hospital physicians (N = 556). A hypothetical model was developed based on existing theory, confirmatory factor analysis was carried out in order to ensure the validity of measurement concepts, and the structural model was estimated using structural equation modelling. FINDINGS: The organizational changes in question were positively related to performance obstacles both directly and indirectly through participation in decision-making. Organizational change was also negatively related to job satisfaction, both directly and indirectly. Change-oriented leadership was negatively related to performance obstacles, but only indirectly through participation in decision-making, whereas it was positively related to job satisfaction both directly and indirectly. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The authors developed a theoretical model based on existing theory, but to their knowledge no other studies have tested these exact relationships within one model. These findings offer insights relevant to current and ongoing developments in the healthcare field and to the question of how hospitals may deal with continuous changes in ways that could contribute positively towards outcomes relevant to service quality.","Øygarden, Olaug; Olsen, Espen; Mikkelsen, Aslaug",J. health organ. manag,,185

252664,COVID-19 and the kidney: A retrospective analysis of 37 critically ill patients using machine learning,2021,"BACKGROUND: Advance care planning is the process of discussing health care treatment preferences based on patients' personal values, and it often involves the completion of advance directives. In the first months of 2020, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began circulating widely in the American state of Colorado, leading to widespread diagnosis of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), hospitalizations, and deaths. In this context, the importance of technology-based, non-face-to-face methods to conduct advance care planning via patient portals has increased. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the rates of use of a web-based advance care planning tool through a health system-based electronic patient portal both before and in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In 2017, we implemented web-based tools through the patient portal of UCHealth's electronic health record (EHR) for patients to learn about advance care planning and complete an electronically signed medical durable power of attorney (MDPOA) to legally appoint a medical decision maker. Patients accessing the portal can complete and submit a legally valid MDPOA, which becomes part of their medical record. We collected data on the patients' date of MDPOA completion, use of advance care planning messaging, age, sex, and geographic location during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (December 29, 2019, to May 30, 2020). RESULTS: Over a 5-month period that includes the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colorado, total monthly use of the advance care planning portal tool increased from 418 users in January to 1037 users in April and then decreased slightly to 815 users in May. The number of MDPOA forms submitted per week increased 2.4-fold after the stay-at-home order was issued in Colorado on March 26, 2020 (P<.001). The mean age of the advance care planning portal users was 47.7 years (SD 16.1), and 2206/3292 (67.0%) were female. Women were more likely than men to complete an MDPOA, particularly in younger age groups (P<.001). The primary use of the advance care planning portal tools was the completion of an MDPOA (3138/3292, 95.3%), compared to sending an electronic message (148/3292, 4.5%). Over 50% of patients who completed an MDPOA did not have a prior agent in the EHR. CONCLUSIONS: Use of a web-based patient portal to complete an MDPOA increased substantially during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Colorado. There was an increase in advance care planning that corresponded with state government shelter-in-place orders as well as public health reports of increased numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Patient portals are an important tool for providing advance care planning resources and documenting medical decision makers during the pandemic to ensure that medical treatment aligns with patient goals and values.","Portz, Jennifer D; Brungardt, Adreanne; Shanbhag, Prajakta; Staton, Elizabeth W; Bose-Brill, Seuli; Lin, Chen-Tan; Kutner, Jean S; Lum, Hillary D",J Med Internet Res,,185
253306,Nasopharyngeal Microbiota as an early severity biomarker in COVID-19 hospitalised patients: a retrospective cohort study in a Mediterranean area,2021,"Objective: To evaluate how public perceptions and trust in government communications affected the adoption of protective behaviour in Singapore during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: We launched our community-based cohort to assess public perceptions of infectious disease outbreaks in mid-2019. After the first case of COVID-19 was reported in Singapore on 23 January, we launched a series of seven COVID-19 surveys to both existing and regularly enrolled new participants every 2 weeks. As well as sociodemographic properties of the participants, we recorded changing responses to judge awareness of the situation, trust in various information sources and perceived risk. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate associations with perceptions of risk and self-reported adopted frequencies of protective behaviour. Findings: Our cohort of 633 participants provided 2857 unique responses during the seven COVID-19 surveys. Most agreed or strongly agreed that information from official government sources (99.1%; 528/533) and Singapore-based news agencies (97.9%; 522/533) was trustworthy. Trust in government communication was significantly associated with higher perceived threat (odds ratio, OR: 2.2; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.6-3.0), but inversely associated with perceived risk of infection (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.8) or risk of death if infected (OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.9). Trust in government communication was also associated with a greater likelihood of adopting protective behaviour. Conclusion: Our findings show that trust is a vital commodity when managing an evolving outbreak. Our repeated surveys provided real-time feedback, allowing an improved understanding of the interplay between perceptions, trust and behaviour.","Lim, Vanessa W; Lim, Rachel L; Tan, Yi Roe; Soh, Alexius Se; Tan, Mei Xuan; Othman, Norhudah Bte; Borame Dickens, Sue; Thein, Tun-Linn; Lwin, May O; Ong, Rick Twee-Hee; Leo, Yee-Sin; Lee, Vernon J; Chen, Mark Ic",Bull World Health Organ,,185
253795,Antirheumatic Disease Therapies for the Treatment of COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the different CT characteristics which may distinguish influenza from 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: A total of 13 confirmed patients with COVID-19 were enrolled from January 16, 2020, to February 25, 2020. Furthermore, 92 CT scans of confirmed patients with influenza pneumonia, including 76 with influenza A and 16 with influenza B, scanned between January 1, 2019, to February 25, 2020, were retrospectively reviewed. Pulmonary lesion distributions, number, attenuation, lobe predomination, margin, contour, ground-glass opacity involvement pattern, bronchial wall thickening, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, intralobular septal thickening, and pleural effusion were evaluated in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia cohorts. RESULTS: Peripheral and non-specific distributions in COVID-19 showed a markedly higher frequency compared with the influenza group (p < 0.05). Most lesions in COVID-19 showed balanced lobe localization, while in influenza pneumonia they were predominantly located in the inferior lobe (p < 0.05). COVID-19 presented a clear lesion margin and a shrinking contour compared with influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities, while a cluster-like pattern and bronchial wall thickening were more frequently seen in influenza pneumonia (p < 0.05). The lesion number and attenuation, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and intralobular septal thickening were not significantly different between the two groups (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Though viral pneumonias generally show similar imaging features, there are some characteristic CT findings which may help differentiating COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia. KEY POINTS: â¢ CT can play an early warning role in the diagnosis of COVID-19 in the case of no epidemic exposure. â¢ CT could be used for the differential diagnosis of influenza and COVID-19 with satisfactory accuracy. â¢ COVID-19 had a patchy or combination of GGO and consolidation opacities with peripheral distribution and balanced lobe predomination.","Wang, Hao; Wei, Ran; Rao, Guihua; Zhu, Jie; Song, Bin",Eur Radiol,,185

We conducted a lexicon-based thematic analysis using corpus tools, and LIWC and applied R language's stylo. The dominant themes that were closely related to coronavirus tweets included the outbreak of the pandemic, metaphysics responses, signs and symptoms in confirmed cases, and conspiracism. The psycholinguistic analysis also showed that tweeters maintained high levels of affective talk, which was loaded with negative emotions and sadness. Also, LIWC's psychological categories of religion and health dominated the Arabic tweets discussing the pandemic situation. In addition, the contaminated counties that captured most of the attention of Arabic tweeters were China, the USA, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan. At the same time, China and the USA were instrumental in evoking conspiracist ideation about spreading COVID-19 to the world.","Essam, Bacem A; Abdo, Muhammad S",J. psycholinguist res,,185

In order to contain the spread of the virus, a countrywide mass lockdown has been imposed in India. Although the lockdown has modified the epidemic trajectory, it has affected the lives of many non-COVID patients. Patients in need of care could not approach hospitals. Methods: This retrospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Onco-Anaesthesia and Palliative Medicine at a tertiary care center in India. The yearly data of patient flow for the year 2019 was compared with that during the lockdown. Results: The single-day average of out-patients, in-patients, and other department consultation requests requiring palliative care decreased drastically during the lockdown in comparison to the previous year. The single-day average of teleconsultations increased more than double during the lockdown. Conclusion: Although lockdown decreases the spread of the epidemic, it increases the suffering of other patients who require medical care. Various steps have to be adopted in the regular working pattern of hospitals to cater to the needs of the patients requiring care, without increasing the risk of contracting COVID-19.","Karthik, A.; Rustagi, Kanika; Mishra, Seema; Garg, Rakesh; Gupta, Nishkarsh; Bharati, Sachidanand; Kumar, Vinod; Bhatnagar, Sushma",Indian J.

DESIGN AND METHOD: We conducted two cross-sectional studies (Study 1 N = 762, Study 2 N = 229) on a French population, measuring conspiracy mentality, compliance with preventive health measures, and perceived risks related to COVID-19. We also measured motivations to comply with preventive measures in Study 2. RESULTS: We show that people high in conspiracy mentality are likely to engage in non-normative prevention behaviours (Study 1), but are less willing to comply with extreme preventive behaviours that are government-driven (Study 2). However, we demonstrate that a perceived risk to oneself (risk of death) and a motivation to protect oneself can act as a suppressor: Conspiracy mentality is linked with an increase in the perception of risk to oneself, which, in turn, is associated with normative compliance. We also find that perceived risk of death explains the relationship between conspiracy mentality and non-normative prevention behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies showcase how people high in conspiracy theorizing may (dis)engage with prevention behaviours, but that perceived risk and motivation to protect oneself could increase these individuals' compliance.","Marinthe, Gaëlle; Brown, Genavee; Delouvée, Sylvain; Jolley, Daniel",Br J Health Psychol,,185

It is usually investigated in simple scenarios, such as the removal of the system's units in random order, or sequentially ordered by specific topological descriptors. However, in the vast majority of empirical applications, it is required to dismantle the network following more sophisticated protocols, for instance, by combining topological properties and non-topological node metadata. We propose a novel mathematical framework to fill this gap: networks are enriched with features and their nodes are removed according to the importance in the feature space. We consider features of different nature, from ones related to the network construction to ones related to dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Our framework not only provides a natural generalization of percolation but, more importantly, offers an accurate way to test the robustness of networks in realistic scenarios.","Artime, Oriol; De Domenico, Manlio",Nat Commun,,185

This study aims to assess acceptability of patients and clinicians towards teleconsultation in oral and maxillofacial surgery compared with an expected face-to-face assessment. 340 telephone clinic patient episodes were surveyed over the initial 7-week period of pandemic-related service restriction. Appointment outcomes from a further 420 telephone consultations were additionally scrutinised. A total of 59.1% of patients expressed a strong preference for teleconsultation with only 13.1% stating a moderate or strong preference for face-to-face assessment. Diagnostic accuracy was highlighted as a concern for both clinicians and patients due to inherent inability to conduct a traditional clinical examination, notable in 43.5% of qualitative comments. Logistical concerns, communications needs and other individual circumstances formed the other emerging themes. The majority of remote consultations (59.5%) were outcomed as requiring further review. A total of 29.3% of patients were discharged. These findings suggest that the increasing use of remote follow-up in carefully selected subgroups can facilitate efficient and acceptable healthcare delivery. Although 'in-person' clinical appointments will continue to be regarded as the default safe and gold standard management modality, OMFS departments should consider significant upscaling of teleconsultation services.","Cronin, A J; Lopez, J T J; Pabla, R",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,,185

Kenya swiftly implemented mitigation policies; we assess the economic, social and health-related harm disproportionately impacting women. DESIGN: A prospective longitudinal cohort study with repeated mobile phone surveys in April, May and June 2020. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: 2009 households across five informal settlements in Nairobi, sampled from two previously interviewed cohorts. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes include food insecurity, risk of household violence and forgoing necessary health services due to the pandemic. Gender-stratified linear probability regression models were constructed to determine the factors associated with these outcomes. RESULTS: By May, more women than men reported adverse effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on their lives. Women were 6 percentage points more likely to skip a meal versus men (coefficient: 0.055; 95% CI 0.016 to 0.094), and those who had completely lost their income were 15 percentage points more likely versus those employed (coefficient: 0.154; 95% CI 0.125 to 0.184) to skip a meal. Compared with men, women were 8 percentage points more likely to report increased risk of household violence (coefficient: 0.079; 95% CI 0.028 to 0.130) and 6 percentage points more likely to forgo necessary healthcare (coefficient: 0.056; 95% CI 0.037 to 0.076).

263978,Neuroimaging findings of brain MRI and CT in patients with COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"Current in vitro models have significant limitations for new respiratory disease research and rapid drug repurposing. Lung on a chip (LOAC) technology offers a potential solution to these problems. However, these devices typically are fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which has small hydrophobic molecule absorption, which hinders the application of this technology in drug repurposing for respiratory diseases. Off-stoichiometry thiol–ene (OSTE) is a promising alternative material class to PDMS. Therefore, this study aimed to test OSTE as an alternative material for LOAC prototype development and compare it to PDMS. We tested OSTE material for light transmission, small molecule absorption, inhibition of enzymatic reactions, membrane particle, and fluorescent dye absorption. Next, we microfabricated LOAC devices from PDMS and OSTE, functionalized with human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) and A549 cell lines, and analyzed them with immunofluorescence. We demonstrated that compared to PDMS, OSTE has similar absorption of membrane particles and effect on enzymatic reactions, significantly lower small molecule absorption, and lower light transmission. Consequently, the immunofluorescence of OSTE LOAC was significantly impaired by OSTE optical properties. In conclusion, OSTE is a promising material for LOAC, but optical issues should be addressed in future LOAC prototypes to benefit from the material properties.","Roberts, Rimsa Artis Galvanovskis Plume Janis Rumnieks Felikss Grindulis Karlis Paidere Gunita Erentraute Sintija Mozolevskis Gatis Abols Arturs",Micromachines,,185
264002,Incidence and Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Covid-19-a Retrospective Cohort Study of 1000 Patients in a Community Hospital in Central New Jersey,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 causes high mortality risk in older patients. This study aims to characterize the clinical features of older and younger SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients were divided into the younger group (<60 years; n=181) and the older group (&#8805;60 years; n=58). In both groups, fever and cough were common symptoms. However, dyspnea was more frequent in older patients than younger patients (20.7% versus 9.9%, p=0.032). Compared with younger patients, older patients harbored more severe cases (37.9% versus 17.1%, p=0.001) and comorbidities (58.6% versus 21.0%, p<0.001) such as hypertension and diabetes. The baseline values of eosinophils and C-reactive protein were abnormal in older and younger groups. From baseline to day 14, significant decreases of three biomarkers (C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, albumin) and dramatic increases of three biomarkers (lymphocytes, platelets, blood urea nitrogen) were observed in older patients. CONCLUSION: Older and younger patients exhibited differences in dyspnea, comorbidities, and proportions of severe cases. Moreover, the disease progression of SARS-CoV-2 in older patients is observed with the dynamics of laboratory biomarkers, supporting their potential use in disease monitoring. METHODS: We retrieved clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, comorbidities, and hospitalization information of SARS-CoV-2 cases in Changsha.","Zhou, Zhiguo; Zhang, Min; Wang, Yali; Zheng, Fang; Huang, Yaxiong; Huang, Kang; Yu, Qizhi; Cai, Chunlin; Chen, Dong; Tian, Yi; Lei, Jianhua; Xiao, Xinqiang; Clercq, Erik De; Li, Guangdi; Xie, Yuanlin; Gong, Guozhong",Aging (Albany NY),,185
264003,Incidence and Diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Covid-19-a Retrospective Cohort Study of 1000 Patients in a Community Hospital in Central New Jersey,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is having a great impact on health services. Patients not receiving care due to closure of outpatient services suffer a collateral damage. Our aim was to provide first data on impact of COVID-19 on people experiencing disability in Europe. METHODS: We developed an estimation from a survey and publicly available data. Thirty-eight countries have been inquired through the European Bodies of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine - the rehabilitation medical specialty. The nine questions of the survey focused on March 31st, 2020. We used the following indicators: for inpatients, acute and rehabilitative hospital beds; for outpatients, missing uniform European data, we used information from Italy, Belgium and the UK, and estimated for Europe basing on population, number of rehabilitation physicians, physiotherapists, and people with self-reported limitations. RESULTS: Thirty-five countries (92%) including 99% of the population (809.9 million) answered. Stop of admissions to rehabilitation, early discharge and reduction of activities involved 194,800 inpatients in 10 countries. Outpatient activities stopped for 87%, involving 318,000 patients per day in Italy, Belgium and the UK, leading to an estimate range of 1.3-2.2 million in Europe. Seven countries reported experiences on rehabilitation for acute COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 emergency is having a huge impact on rehabilitation of people experiencing disability. This may lead to future cumulative effects due to reduced functional outcome and consequent increased burden of care. When the emergency will fade, rehabilitation demand will probably grow due to an expected return wave of these not well treated patients, but probably also of post-COVID-19 patients' needs.","Negrini, Stefano; Grabljevec, Klemen; Boldrini, Paolo; Kiekens, Carlotte; Moslavac, Sasa; Zampolini, Mauro; Christodoulou, Nicolas",Eur J Phys Rehabil Med,,185

264797,Use of antiplatelet drugs and the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Rapid and early severity-of-illness assessment appears to be important for critically ill patients with novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to evaluate the performance of the rapid scoring system on admission of these patients. METHODS: A total of 138 medical records of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics on admission used for calculating Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and outcomes (survival or death) were collected for each case and extracted for analysis. All patients were divided into two age subgroups (<65 years and &#8805;65 years). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed for overall patients and both subgroups. RESULTS: The median [25th quartile, 75th quartile] of MEWS of survivors versus nonsurvivors were 1 [1, 2] and 2 [1, 3] and those of REMS were 5 [2, 6] and 7 [6, 10], respectively. In overall analysis, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.833 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.737 to 0.928), higher than that of MEWS (0.677, 95% CI = 0.541 to 0.813). An optimal cutoff of REMS (&#8805;6) had a sensitivity of 89.5%, a specificity of 69.8%, a positive predictive value of 39.5%, and a negative predictive value of 96.8%. In the analysis of subgroup of patients aged <65 years, the area under the ROC curve for the REMS in predicting mortality was 0.863 (95% CI = 0.743 to 0.941), higher than that of MEWS (0.603, 95% CI = 0.462 to 0.732). CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this study was the first exploration on rapid scoring systems for critically ill patients with COVID-19. The REMS could provide emergency clinicians with an effective adjunct risk stratification tool for critically ill patients with COVID-19, especially for the patients aged <65 years. The effectiveness of REMS for screening these patients is attributed to its high negative predictive value.","Hu, Hai; Yao, Ni; Qiu, Yanru",Acad Emerg Med,,185
264798,Use of antiplatelet drugs and the risk of mortality in patients with COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021,"In December, 2019, reports emerged from Wuhan, China, of a severe acute respiratory disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). By the end of April, 2020, over 3 million people had been confirmed infected, with over 1 million in the USA alone, and over 215â000 deaths. The symptoms associated with COVID-19 are diverse, ranging from mild upper respiratory tract symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. The major risk factors for severe COVID-19 are shared with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), namely increasing age, male sex, and comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes. However, the role of antifibrotic therapy in patients with IPF who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the scientific rationale for their continuation or cessation, is poorly defined. Furthermore, several licensed and potential antifibrotic compounds have been assessed in models of acute lung injury and viral pneumonia. Data from previous coronavirus infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, as well as emerging data from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggest there could be substantial fibrotic consequences following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antifibrotic therapies that are available or in development could have value in preventing severe COVID-19 in patients with IPF, have the potential to treat severe COVID-19 in patients without IPF, and might have a role in preventing fibrosis after SARS-CoV-2 infection.","George, Peter M; Wells, Athol U; Jenkins, R Gisli",Lancet Respir Med,,185

To isolate and quantify organisms of the Bacillus cereus species in whole milk powder, 72 samples of the product were collected in stores located in the city of São Paulo in 1987 and 1988. After being reconstituted, 32 of these samples were maintained under inadequate storage temperatures (200 C for 24 hours) to determine the B. cereus counts, Two of the 72 samples of the study had results above the standards established by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (1987). The samples stored under inadequate temperatures showed leveis 91.6% higher than the standards. From the viewpoint of B. cereus presence, the results obtained show that 97.22% of the samples of this study were adequate for consumption. However, 91.67% of the samples could potentially result in food borne infections due to the high B. cereus levels detected after the storage conditions used in this study.","Regina Monteiro de Barros, Vera; César Panetta, José; Miguel, Omar",R.

265935,Assessment of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Safety Profiles: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Investigate the effect of a targeted wellness program on burnout in Otolaryngology residents. METHODS: Residents and faculty collaboratively developed a program aimed at improving resident wellness. Program implementation began in July of 2018 and after 1 year, residents evaluated the program's effects on burnout. We used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and a Likert scale to evaluate the effects of the program. RESULTS: After 1 year of the resident wellness program, the MBI results showed an increase in the number of residents in the ""engaged"" category and a decrease in those rated as ""burnout."" Residents rated favorably initiatives grouped into the following themes: time away from work, faculty engaging with residents outside of the hospital environment, efforts to enhance residents' self-efficacy, fostering a positive culture among residents, and providing easy access to physical activity. The majority of initiatives were targeted to the ""culture of wellness"" domain, as defined by the Stanford Well MD framework. Our program targeted to a lesser extent the other 2 domains, ""efficiency of practice"" and ""personal resilience."" CONCLUSION: After 1 year, the wellness program resulted in a trend toward improving burnout. Future efforts should be focused on targeting the multidimensional drivers of burnout as defined by established wellness frameworks. Realizing new stressors brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic will also be an area of active effort and research.","Acevedo, Joseph R; Schlacter, Jamie A; Chambers, Tamara N; Jacobson, Lia K; Yalamanchili, Ronica; Clark, Bhavishya; Pan, Dorothy; Kokot, Niels C; Johns, Michael M",Ear Nose Throat J,,185

274117,Correction: Impact of cardiovascular risk profile on COVID-19 outcome. A meta-analysis,2020,"On March 11, 2020, the WHO director general declared COVID-19 a pandemic. This pandemic evolves in successive phases, i.e., phase 1 (the start phase), phase 2 (""the storm""), and phase 3 (the recession). To date, oncology and surgery groups have only given instructions for addressing phases 1 and 2. To prevent excess cancer mortality, health care systems (HCS) need to be restructured. Our aim is to detail the specificities of each epidemic phase and discuss several methods of organization to optimize cancer patient flow during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly during phase 3. Hospitals must be reorganized in order to create a cancer hub that is free of infection, allowing for the safe treatment of patients. Hospital structures are different, but all allow for the creation of virus-free areas. Screening programs are critical and need to be applied to all people entering the virus-free zone, including health care workers. Some reorganization proposals are internal to a hospital, while others require interhospital collaboration. The heterogeneity and complexity of HCS will make interhospital management difficult. The ministry of health has an important role in managing the cancer crisis. Cancer management should be declared a priority. Oncological and surgical societies must coordinate their efforts to facilitate this prioritization. The anticipation of oncological management during phase 3 of the pandemic is necessary because it requires a complete readjustment of HCS. This adaptation should allow for the continuation of cancer care to prevent excess cancer mortality, as the virus will still be present for a currently undetermined period of time.","Tuech, Jean-Jacques; Gangloff, Alice; Di Fiore, Frederic; Benyoucef, Ahmed; Michel, Pierre; Schwarz, Lilian",Oncology,,185

A meta-analysis,2020,"Assessment of the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for monitoring the course and extent of the COVID-19 epidemic. Here, we report estimated seroprevalence in the French population and the proportion of infected individuals who developed neutralising antibodies at three points throughout the first epidemic wave. Testing 11,000 residual specimens for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and neutralising antibodies, we find nationwide seroprevalence of 0.41% (95% CI: 0.05-0.88) mid-March, 4.14% (95% CI: 3.31-4.99) mid-April and 4.93% (95% CI: 4.02-5.89) mid-May 2020. Approximately 70% of seropositive individuals have detectable neutralising antibodies. Infection fatality rate is 0.84% (95% CI: 0.70-1.03) and increases exponentially with age. These results confirm that the nationwide lockdown substantially curbed transmission and that the vast majority of the French population remained susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in May 2020. Our study shows the progression of the first epidemic wave and provides a framework to inform the ongoing public health response as viral transmission continues globally.","Le Vu, Stéphane; Jones, Gabrielle; Anna, François; Rose, Thierry; Richard, Jean-Baptiste; Bernard-Stoecklin, Sibylle; Goyard, Sophie; Demeret, Caroline; Helynck, Olivier; Escriou, Nicolas; Gransagne, Marion; Petres, Stéphane; Robin, Corinne; Monnet, Virgile; Perrin de Facci, Louise; Ungeheuer, Marie-Noelle; Léon, Lucie; Guillois, Yvonnick; Filleul, Laurent; Charneau, Pierre; Lévy-Bruhl, Daniel; van der Werf, Sylvie; Noel, Harold",Nat Commun,,185

Methods: The computation molecular docking screening was performed using Molegro Virtual Docker software (MVD) with grid resolution of 30 Å. Protein of COVID 19 virus was taken from protein data bank. Results: The standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide) identified from the protein inhibitor complex 6W63 from protein data bank was docked with COVID 19 protein 6W63 which showed MolDock score of -156.913, rerank Sore -121.296 and H Bond -5.7369, while the flavanoid narcissoside had showed MolDock score -180.739, Rerank Sore -137.092 and H Bond -18.6771. The narcissoside showed potent inhibitory effect which is greater than standard X77. The result showed that narcissoside have high affinity towards 6W63 as it showed thirteen hydrogen bonds with nine amino acids (Arg 188, Glu 166, His 164, Cys 145 (2 bonds), Asn 14 (2 bonds), Cys 44 (2 bonds), His 41 (2 bonds), Gln 192, Thr 190) while X777 showed four hydrogen bonds with amino acids (Gly 143, Cys 145, Glu 166, Ser 144). Conclusion: From computation approach it was concluded that narcissoside is a potent inhibitor of viral COVID 19 protein 6W63. The narcissoside have high affinity and inhibition potential than standard inhibitor X77 (N-(4-tert-butylphenyl)-N-[(1R)-2-(cyclohexylamino)-2-oxo-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole-4-carboxamide). The narcissoside predicted as more potent inhibitor which can be further optimize, pharmacologically and clinically evaluated for the treatment of novel coronavirus COVID-19.","Dubey, Kushagra; Dubey, Raghvendra",Biomed J,,185
276398,Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) for improving aphasia after stroke: a systematic review with network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials,2020,"PURPOSE: The physician voice is crucial to shaping health policy and public health guidelines, particularly during COVID-19. However, there are gaps in health policy and advocacy education within graduate medical education. This study sought to characterise the impact of a virtual COVID-19 focused advocacy day among medical trainees in Massachusetts. STUDY DESIGN: The half-day event featured speakers drawn from government relations experts, physician advocates, and state and federal legislators as well as breakout discussions among attendees. A 25-question Redcap survey and list of resources/opportunities for continued advocacy was administered to all participants at event's conclusion on 19 May 2020. RESULTS: There were 60 responses from 141 participants (43% response rate). One-third reported no prior formal health policy instruction, and over half reported getting information from news publications, social media and peers. 58% believed physician involvement in advocacy to be 'extremely important' prior to COVID-19; 83% believed the same after onset of COVID-19 (p<0.0001). The most common barriers to advocacy engagement were lack of time and knowledge. Most attendees felt participation increased their knowledge and likelihood to engage in the COVID-19 response, imparted useful skills/knowledge for continued advocacy, increased their interest in future similar events, and that such events should be available to all trainees. CONCLUSIONS: Trainees recognise the importance of health policy and advocacy and value opportunities to gain the necessary skills/knowledge to effect tangible change. Virtual advocacy days can be replicated nationwide to help trainees learn about advocacy efforts and find their legislative voices during COVID-19 and beyond.","Yu, Zizi; Moustafa, Danna; Kwak, Ruby; O039,; Connor, Daniel M; Cavanaugh-Hussey, Margaret W; Huang, Jennifer T; LaChance, Avery H",Postgrad. med. j,,185

Over the past few months, COVID-19 has developed into a worldwide pandemic, with over 400,000 documented cases globally as of March 24, 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, but has been shown to have effective human-to-human transmission. COVID-19 results in mild symptoms in the majority of infected patients, but can cause severe lung injury, cardiac injury, and death. Given the novel nature of COVID-19, no established treatment beyond supportive care exists currently, but extensive public-health measures to reduce person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 have been implemented globally to curb the spread of disease, reduce the burden on healthcare systems, and protect vulnerable populations, including the elderly and those with underlying medical comorbidities. Since this is an emerging infectious disease, there is, as of yet, limited data on the effects of this infection on patients with cardiovascular disease, particularly so for those with congenital heart disease. We summarize herewith the early experience with COVID-19 and consider the potential applicability to and implications for patients with cardiovascular disease in general and congenital heart disease in particular.","Tan, Weiyi; Aboulhosn, Jamil",Int J Cardiol,,185
277255,Should awake proning be used before continuous positive airway pressure therapy for respiratory support in COVID pneumonia,2020,"There is a marked variation in mortality risk associated with COVID-19 infection in the general population. Low socioeconomic status and other social determinants have been discussed as possible causes for the higher burden in African American communities compared with white communities. Beyond the social determinants, the biochemical mechanism that predisposes individual subjects or communities to the development of excess and serious complications associated with COVID-19 infection is not clear. Virus infection triggers massive ROS production and oxidative damage. Glutathione (GSH) is essential and protects the body from the harmful effects of oxidative damage from excess reactive oxygen radicals. GSH is also required to maintain the VD-metabolism genes and circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)VD). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is necessary to prevent the exhaustion and depletion of cellular GSH. X-linked genetic G6PD deficiency is common in the AA population and predominantly in males. Acquired deficiency of G6PD has been widely reported in subjects with conditions of obesity and diabetes. This suggests that individuals with G6PD deficiency are vulnerable to excess oxidative stress and at a higher risk for inadequacy or deficiency of 25(OH)VD, leaving the body unable to protect its 'oxidative immune-metabolic' physiological functions from the insults of COVID-19. An association between subclinical interstitial lung disease with 25(OH)VD deficiencies and GSH deficiencies has been previously reported. We hypothesize that the overproduction of ROS and excess oxidative damage is responsible for the impaired immunity, secretion of the cytokine storm, and onset of pulmonary dysfunction in response to the COVID-19 infection. The co-optimization of impaired glutathione redox status and excess 25(OH)VD deficiencies has the potential to reduce oxidative stress, boost immunity, and reduce the adverse clinical effects of COVID-19 infection in the AA population.","Jain, Sushil K; Parsanathan, Rajesh; Levine, Steve N; Bocchini, Joseph A; Holick, Michael F; Vanchiere, John A",Free Radic Biol Med,,185

Solutions to the world's problems are sought from technology and business innovations, not from considerations of equality and well-being for all. This is in stark contrast with the pandemic-time situation. Many governments, at least initially, listened to the recommendations of expert advisers, most notably public health authorities, who proceeded from considerations of equality and common good. I suggest that we should continue on this path when the immediate threat of the disease is over. Other crises are already ongoing-poverty, conflicts, climate change, financial bubbles, and so on-and it would be good to use expert knowledge rather than interests and ideologies in dealing with them. To assist in this, I outline the characteristics of a new kind of counsellor, impartial adviser, who is normatively motivated by a sense of copathy and who takes into account all views, nice and not-so-nice alike. I illustrate the nature and ideological orientation of copathic impartial advisers by placing them on a map of justice and examining their relationships with the main political moralities of our time.","Häyry, Matti",Camb Q Healthc Ethics,,185

Methods: Thirty patients who were diagnosed as Angle class â ¡ malocclusion, treated by using labial fixed orthodontic appliances and also diagnosed as periodontitis (orthodontic group) were recuited from January 2009 to June 2019 at the School and Hospital of Stomatology, China Medical University in the present study. They were aged (27.0±5.4) years old (ranged 18-41 years old). Another 60 periodontitis patients without a history of orthodontic treatment matched according to age, gender and severity of periodontitis were selected as control group (non-orthodontic group). They were aged (26.7±5.2) years old (ranged 18-41 years old). Cone-beam CT images were used to measure the heights of the alveolar bone defects at each tooth position of the patients. The difference in the heights of the alveolar bone defects between the orthodontic group and the non-orthodontic group at the same position of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones were compared. The specificities of the defect heights in different positions of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones and different sites of the same tooth position were analyzed among orthodontic group. The specificities of the different tooth positions of the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones of the different periodontitis stages among orthodontic group were compared. Results: The heights of the alveolar bone defects in the maxillary canine area and molar area, the mandibular incisor area, the canine area and the premolar area in the orthodontic group were higher than that in the non-orthodontic group, and the differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). In orthodontic group, the most severe teeth in the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bone defects were the canine areas [(3.75±1.00), (3.83±1.10) mm]. Secondly, the more severe tooth positions of the maxillary alveolar bone height defects were the molar area [(3.67±0.84) mm] and the incisor area [(3.39±0.83) mm] and the more severe tooth positions of the mandibular alveolar bone defects were the incisor area [(3.73±1.42) mm] and the molar area [(3.54±0.81) mm]. The height of the alveolar bone defect in the mandibular incisor area was greater than that in the maxillary (P<0.05). The bone defect in the maxillary molar area was severer than that of the mandibular area (P<0.05). The alveolar bone defects in the buccal and lingual sides were mostly larger than that of the mesial and distal sides both in maxillary and mandibular positions except for the maxillary incisor area(P<0.05). The most severe alveolar bone defect position changed with the periodontitis stage. The most severe tooth position of the maxillary in stage â periodontitis was in the molar area [(3.26±0.63) mm], whereas the incisor area was the most severe tooth of the mandible [(3.14±1.04) mm]. In addition, among maxillary incisor area, canine area, premolar area, molar area, the most severe alveolar bone defect height was the canine area in stage â ¡, â ¢, â £ mandibular (P<0.05). Conclusions: In periodontitis patients with a history of orthodontic treatment, the height of the alveolar bone defect was specific to the tooth positions and sites. With the periodontitis stage changing, the most severe defect position changed in both maxillary and mandibular alveolar bones. It is recommended to pay more attention to the alteration of alveolar bone in periodontitis patients with a history of orthodontic treatment and give timely targeted treatment plans.","Yin, R; Zhao, H J; Li, Y C; Pan, Y P",Zhonghua Kou Qiang Yi Xue Za Zhi,,185

Mathematical models can be used to evaluate the possible impact of programmatic delays on hepatitis disease burden. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the incremental change in HCV liver-related deaths and liver cancer, following a 3-month, 6-month, or 1-year hiatus in hepatitis elimination programs. METHODS: Previously developed models were adapted for 110 countries to include a status quo or 'no delay' scenario and a '1-year delay' scenario assuming significant disruption in interventions (screening, diagnosis, and treatment) in the year 2020. Annual country-level model outcomes were extracted, and weighted averages were used to calculate regional (WHO and World Bank Income Group) and global estimates from 2020 to 2030. The incremental annual change in outcomes was calculated by subtracting the 'no-delay' estimates from the '1-year delay' estimates. RESULTS: The '1-year delay' scenario resulted in 44,800 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 43,800-49,300) excess hepatocellular carcinoma cases and 72,300 (95% UI: 70,600-79,400) excess liver-related deaths, relative to the 'no-delay' scenario globally, from 2020 to 2030. Most missed treatments would be in lower-middle income countries, whereas most excess hepatocellular carcinoma and liver-related deaths would be among high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of COVID-19 extends beyond the direct morbidity and mortality associated with exposure and infection.

Mounting studies have shown that cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-histidine (CCCH) zinc-finger protein genes are involved in various plant growth and development processes. However, research on the involvement of these genes in male reproductive development is still in its infancy. Here, we identified 11 male fertility-related CCCH genes in Chinese cabbage. Among them, a pair of paralogs encoding novel non-tandem CCCH zinc-finger proteins, Brassica campestris Male Fertility 30a (BcMF30a) and BcMF30c, were further characterized. They were highly expressed in pollen during microgametogenesis and continued to express in germinated pollen. Further analyses demonstrated that both BcMF30a and BcMF30c may play a dual role as transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins in plant cells. Functional analysis showed that partial bcmf30a bcmf30c pollen grains were aborted due to the degradation of pollen inclusion at the microgametogenesis phase, and the germination rate of viable pollen was also greatly reduced, indicating that BcMF30a and BcMF30c are required for both pollen development and pollen germination. This research provided insights into the function of CCCH proteins in regulating male reproductive development and laid a theoretical basis for hybrid breeding of Chinese cabbage.","Xu, Liai; Xiong, Xingpeng; Liu, Weimiao; Liu, Tingting; Yu, Youjian; Cao, Jiashu",,,185

The lack of an effective treatment and the emergence of varied and complicated clinical courses in certain populations have rendered treatment of patients hospitalized for COVID-19 difficult. METHODS: Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, a public tertiary acute care center located in Tokyo, the epicenter of COVID-19 in Japan, has been admitting patients with COVID-19 since February 2020. The present, retrospective, case-series study aimed to investigate the clinical course and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the study institution. RESULTS: In total, 101 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to our hospital to receive inpatient care. Eleven patients (10.9%) received ECMO, and nine patients (8.9%) died during hospitalization after COVID-19 was diagnosed. A history of smoking and obesity were most commonly encountered among patients with a complicated clinical course. Most patients who died requested to be transferred to advanced palliative care in the early course of their hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Our experience of caring for these patients demonstrated a relatively lower mortality rate and higher survival rate in those with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation placement than previous reports from other countries and underscored the importance of proactive, advanced care planning in the early course of hospitalization.","Yao, Kenta; Hasegawa, Shinya; Tagashira, Yasuaki; Takamatsu, Akane; Uenoyama, Yuki; Shimizu, Keiki; Honda, Hitoshi",J Infect Chemother,,185

The Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and Harvard University have each released guidelines for management of axillary adenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination. While SBI recommends short term imaging 4-12 weeks following the second dose, a group of physicians from Harvard suggest clinical follow-up with sonographic imaging if clinical concern persists beyond six weeks. As a larger percentage of the general population becomes vaccinated, it is important for radiologists to be aware of potential vaccine-induced ipsilateral axillary adenopathy on screening and diagnostic breast imaging to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies performed in this patient population.","Duke, Heather; Posch, Liana; Green, Lauren",Clin Imaging,,185
283758,3rd Degree Heart Block in a Patient with Corona Virus,2021,"A comprehensive, hands-on hemodialysis curriculum during nephrology training is necessary for effective learning and optimal patient care. Traditional instructive approaches are unable to fully meet the needs of the digitally inclined learner and are limited by time constraints and increasing clinical workload. Internet based learning (E-learning) is becoming increasingly popular in medical education and nephrology and gaining even greater relevance in the COVID era. However, it presents technical challenges and may create an environment of social isolation. A 'blended learning approach' combines E-learning with traditional methods of teaching and offers advantages over either approach alone. We have designed and implemented a formalized hemodialysis curriculum at our institution that is based on blended learning, utilizing faculty-created E-learning tools combined with traditional pedagogical methods (bed-side and classroom). The web-based tools discuss hemodialysis adequacy, principles of urea transport, hemodialysis access examination and access complications. These tools are open access and structured around the science of cognitive learning using animation, interactivity, self-assessment and immediate feedback features. They have been viewed by a wide audience of nephrologists, dialysis nurses as well as medicine house-staff and have received strong validation in a post-test survey. The online tools have supported a 'flipped classroom' instructive model and our blended curriculum has been successfully used for nephrology fellow training at our institution.

Since ventilation is an important factor that influences airborne transmission, we proposed to study the impact of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) with a variable air volume (VAV) primary air system, on the dispersion of infectious aerosols, in a cardiac intensive care unit, using a transient simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), based on the finite element method (FEM). We analyzed three scenarios that followed the dispersion of pathogen carrying expiratory droplets particles from coughing, from patients possibly infected with COVID-19, depending on the location of the patients in the intensive care unit. Our study provides the mechanism for spread of infectious aerosols, and possibly of COVID-19 infection, by air conditioning systems and also highlights important recommendations for disease control and optimization of ventilation in intensive care units, by increasing the use of outdoor air and the rate of air change, decreasing the recirculation of air and using high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters. The CFD-FEM simulation approach that was applied in our study could also be extended to other targets, such as public transport, theaters, philharmonics and amphitheaters from educational units.","Anghel, Larisa; Popovici, Catalin-George; Statescu, Cristian; Sascau, Radu; VerdeÈ, Marina; Ciocan, Vasilica; Èerban, Ionela-Lacramioara; Maranduca, Minela Aida; HudiÈteanu, Sebastian-Valeriu; Èurcanu, Florin-Emilian",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,185

However, there is limited knowledge of the factors that influence public servants’ response (PSR) when facing pandemic prevention and control tasks. (2) Methods: Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), models were constructed and a regression method was employed with Chinese civil servant data to investigate how PSR is influenced by public service motivation (PSM), accountability pressure (AP), and emergency response capacity (ERC). (3) Results and discussion: PSM, AP, and ERC all have a positive effect on PSR, with AP having the greatest influence, followed by PSM and ERC. The effects of PSM, AP, and ERC on PSR have group heterogeneity, which had little effect on civil servants with very low levels of PSR and the greatest impact on civil servants with medium-level PSR. Job categories of civil servants also are a factor related to PSR;PSM and AP have the strongest effects on civil servants in professional technology, and ERC has the greatest influence on administrative law enforcement. Moreover, gender, administrative level, and leadership positions also have an impact on PSR. (4) Conclusions: Based on the factors of PSR, we found at least three important aspects that governments need to consider in encouraging PSR when facing a pandemic. © 2021 by the author.

285999,ABO phenotype and death in critically ill patients with COVID-19,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Proteases are central to the infection process of SARS-CoV-2. Cleavage of the spike protein on the virus's capsid causes the conformational change that leads to membrane fusion and viral entry into the target cell. Since inhibition of one protease, even the dominant protease like TMPRSS2, may not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells, other proteases that may play an activating role and hydrolyze the spike protein must be identified. We identified amino acid sequences in all regions of spike protein, including the S1/S2 region critical for activation and viral entry, that are susceptible to cleavage by furin and cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V using PACMANS, a computational platform that identifies and ranks preferred sites of proteolytic cleavage on substrates, and verified with molecular docking analysis and immunoblotting to determine if binding of these proteases can occur on the spike protein that were identified as possible cleavage sites. Together, this study highlights cathepsins B, K, L, S, and V for consideration in SARS-CoV-2 infection and presents methodologies by which other proteases can be screened to determine a role in viral entry. This highlights additional proteases to be considered in COVID-19 studies, particularly regarding exacerbated damage in inflammatory preconditions where these proteases are generally upregulated.","Bollavaram, Keval; Leeman, Tiffanie H; Lee, Maggie W; Kulkarni, Akhil; Upshaw, Sophia G; Yang, Jiabei; Song, Hannah; Platt, Manu O",Protein Sci,,185

286855,How to prepare a systematic review and meta-analysis: the methodological approach,2021,"The pathogenesis of viral infections involves an immune response by cytokines, causing a deleterious effect on organ function, in addition to tissue destruction due to viral replication. Clinical symptoms and laboratory findings of the human coronavirus disease COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS CoV-2, indicate cytokine involvement. Our laboratory showed that an experimental murine coronavirus (MHV-A59) can be transmitted into the brain by intranasal or intracerebral exposure and that neurovirulence is mediated by cytokine secretion. In this study we investigated which cells in the brain produce cytokines, thus functioning as the brain's innate immune system. Using tissue cultures of microglia, and clonal populations of astrocytes, we found that microglia and type I astrocytes (but not types II and III), produced pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to MHV-A59 infection. A molecularly closely related, non-encephalitic strain of the virus (MHV-2) caused in vitro infection, but without cytokine induction. Furthermore, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry revealed that type I astrocytes and microglia have perivascular foot processes necessary for the formation of the perivascular glymphatic system, the anatomical site of the brain's innate immune system. Cytokine secretion by type I astrocytes and microglia, as part of the brain's glymphatic and innate immune system, contributes to the pathogenesis of an encephalitic coronavirus infection, and indicates the rationale for anti-cytokine therapies for COVID-19.","Lavi, Ehud; Cong, Lin",Exp Mol Pathol,,185
287116,Prognostic factors associated with mortality risk and disease progression in 639 critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Europe: Initial report of the international RISC-19-ICU prospective observational cohort,2020,"This article investigates the lawfulness of isolating residents of care and group homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many residents are mobile, and their freedom to move is a central ethical tenet and human right. It is not however an absolute right and trade-offs between autonomy, liberty and health need to be made since COVID-19 is highly infectious and poses serious risks of critical illness and death. People living in care and group homes may be particularly vulnerable because recommended hygiene practices are difficult for them and many residents are elderly, and/or have co-morbidities. In some circumstances, the trade-offs can be made easily with the agreement of the resident and for short periods of time. However challenging cases arise, in particular for residents and occupants with dementia who 'wander', meaning they have a strong need to walk, sometimes due to agitation, as may also be the case for some people with developmental disability (e.g. autism), or as a consequence of mental illness. This article addresses three central questions: (1) in what circumstances is it lawful to isolate residents of social care homes to prevent transmission of COVID-19, in particular where the resident has a strong compulsion to walk and will not, or cannot, remain still and isolated? (2) what types of strategies are lawful to curtail walking and achieve isolation and social distancing? (3) is law reform required to ensure any action to restrict freedoms is lawful and not excessive? These questions emerged during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and are still relevant. Although focussed on COVID-19, the results are also relevant to other future outbreaks of infectious diseases in care and group homes. Likewise, while we concentrate on the law in England and Wales, the analysis and implications have international significance.","Liddell, Kathleen; Ruck Keene, Alexander; Holland, Anthony; Huppert, Julian; Underwood, Benjamin R; Clark, Orna; Barclay, Stephen I G",Int J Law Psychiatry,,185

It is widely accepted that healthcare workers should have high priority. However, questions have been raised about what we ought to do if members of priority groups refuse vaccination. Using the case of influenza vaccination as a comparison, we know that coercive approaches to vaccination uptake effectively increase vaccination rates among healthcare workers and reduce patient morbidity if properly implemented. Using the principle of least restrictive alternative, we have developed an intervention ladder for COVID-19 vaccination policies among healthcare workers. We argue that healthcare workers refusing vaccination without a medical reason should be temporarily redeployed and, if their refusal persists after the redeployment period, eventually suspended, in order to reduce the risk to their colleagues and patients. This 'conditional' policy is a compromise between entirely voluntary or entirely mandatory policies for healthcare workers, and is consistent with healthcare workers' established professional, legal and ethical obligations to their patients and to society at large.","Bradfield, Owen M; Giubilini, Alberto",J. med. ethics,,185

294907,Non-autoimmune diabetes mellitus and the risk of virus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis of case-control and cohort studies,2021,"Infection segmentation on chest CT plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. Developing automatic segmentation tools in a short period with limited labelled images has become an urgent need. Pseudo label-based semi-supervised method is a promising way to leverage unlabelled data to improve segmentation performance. Existing methods usually obtain pseudo labels by first training a network with limited labelled images and then inferring unlabelled images. However, these methods may generate obviously inaccurate labels and degrade the subsequent training process. To address these challenges, in this paper, an active contour regularized semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to automatically segment infections with few labelled images. The active contour regularization is realized by the region-scalable fitting (RSF) model which is embedded to the loss function of the network to regularize and refine the pseudo labels of the unlabelled images. We further design a splitting method to separately optimize the RSF regularization term and the segmentation loss term with convolution-thresholding method (ICTM) and stochastic gradient descent, respectively, which enable fast optimization of each term. Furthermore, we build a statistical atlas to show the infection spatial distribution. Extensive experiments on a small public dataset and a large scale dataset show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with up to 5% in DSC and NSD, 10% in RAVD and $8mm$ in 95% HD. Moreover, we observe that the infections tend to occur at the dorsal subpleural lung and posterior basal segments that are not mentioned in current radiology reports and are meaningful to advance our understanding of COVID-19.","Ma, Jun; Nie, Ziwei; Wang, Congcong; Dong, Guoqiang; Zhu, Qiongjie; He, Jian; Gui, Luying; Yang, Xiaoping",Phys. med. biol,,185

Many countries, including Indonesia, have applied lockdown policies to stop the spread of COVID-19. Lockdown policies have disrupted the supply of raw materials and the demand for finished goods. The manufacturing industry is one of the sectors that has suffered most in this situation, and they have struggled to reconfigure their internal and external supply chain network and partnership. This study examined the impact of internal integration, supply chain partnership, supply chain agility, and supply chain resilience on sustainable advantage. The participants of this study were from manufacturing companies in Indonesia. For data collection, a questionnaire was used, with a five-point Likert scale to obtain the respondents’ opinions. Using Google Form link, the questionnaire was distributed via email and the WhatsApp social media application to the predetermined set of manufacturing companies. Respondents filled out 672 questionnaires, and 456 respondents (corresponding to 67.86%) filled it out correctly and were considered valid for further analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to analyze the data using the SmartPLS software version 3.3. The results supported all nine hypotheses proposed. Internal integration through interdepartmental data sharing affects supply chain (SC) partnerships, SC agility, and SC resilience. Moreover, SC partnerships, through the on-time delivery of materials and by coping with changing demand, improve SC agility, SC resilience, and sustainable advantages. SC agility, in keeping the production process running normally and regulating the production capacity, affects SC resilience and sustainable advantage. SC resilience improves sustainable advantage by providing timely product delivery and reliable sales volumes in pandemic conditions. These results provide insights for managers into enhancing the sustainable advantage by improving supply chain agility, supply chain resilience, and supply chain partnerships.

The patients had a mean age of 80â¯± 5 years and 59% were male, with a predicted surgical risk of 2.2â¯± 0.9/3.1â¯± 2.4% (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality [STS-PROM] score/EuroSCORE II), depicting a contemporary, lower-risk population. The composite endpoint of device success (Valve Academic Research Consortium [VARC]-2) was reached in all patients. No patients showed more than mild paravalvular leakage (3/90, 3.3%). Overall, intravenous medication was sparsely used during the procedure, with 48 of the 90 (53%) patients receiving no unplanned intravenous medication. There was neither procedural nor in-hospital mortality. The performance of TF-TAVI using local analgesia only, managed by a dedicated nurse instead of an anaesthesiologist, was shown to be feasible and safe in a selected group of patients. This strategy may (temporarily) eliminate the need for an anaesthesiologist to be present in the cath lab and enables ongoing TAVI treatment amidst the global COVID-19 crisis.","Vendrik, J; de Boer, J; Zwiers, W; van Gilst, S A; Holierook, M; Chekanova, E V; Henriques, J S; Baan, J",Neth Heart J,,185
303052,Frailty as a predictor of mortality among patients with COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"Considering adolescents' developmentally driven stressors and social needs, they may be particularly vulnerable to the anxiety associated with the public health and economic crises due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, they may have difficulty following the mandated contagion prevention directives. The current study focused on the role of adolescents' positive personal resources (self-control, hope) and environmental resources (peer support) in two desired outcomes during the COVID-19 outbreak: wellbeing (i.e., maintaining/increasing positivity ratio) and contagion prevention behaviors (i.e., increasing handwashing). Path analysis was conducted using online survey data collected from a representative sample of 651 Israeli adolescents (ages 13-17). Positive resources were found to be both positively intercorrelated and negatively correlated with pandemic-related anxiety and positively with increased handwashing. Self-control correlated positively with social support, which, in turn, correlated positively with the positivity ratio (i.e., more positive than negative affects) and pandemic-related anxiety. Self-control and pandemic-related anxiety both correlated positively with increased prevention behavior. This study highlights the vital role of positive resources in achieving desired psychological and behavioral outcomes for adolescents during the anxiety-provoking pandemic. Beyond its theoretical innovation, this study offers practical value by focusing on malleable variables that could be the focus of dedicated interventions.","Bukchin-Peles, Shira; Ronen, Tammie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,185

This article presents a compartmental model that addresses the role of random viral testing, follow-up contact tracing, and subsequent isolation of infectious individuals to stabilize the spread of a disease. We propose and examine two different models -- a branching model and an individual-based model -- both of which capture the heterogeneous nature of interactions that occur within a community. The branching model is used to derive analytical results for the trade-offs between the different mitigation strategies. The most important and perhaps surprising result from this analytical exercise is that a community's stability to disease outbreaks is independent of its underlying network structure. This conclusion is then illustrated through simulation using both the branching model and the individual-based model.","Fay, Sarah C.; Jones, Dalton J.; Dahleh, Munther A.; Hosoi, A.

Our analysis, based on 333 genomes, revealed that the first variants detected in the state of Parana in March 2020 were the B.1.1.33 and B.1.1.28 variants. The variants B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 were predominant throughout 2020 until the introduction of the variant P.2 in August 2020 and a variant of concern (VOC), P.1, in January 2021. Phylogenetic analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes that were previously classified as the VOC P.1 lineage by PANGO showed that some genomes from February to April 2021 branched in a monophyletic clade and that these samples grouped together with genomes recently described with the lineage P.1-like-II. An extended phylogenetic analysis, including SARS-CoV-2 genomes from all over Brazil, showed that the P.1-like-II lineage appears at a high frequency in the southern region of the country. The P.1-like-II lineage genomes share some, but not all, defining mutations of the VOC P.1. For instance, it has the previously described ORF1a:D2980H and N:P383 L unique mutations and the newly detected ORF1a:P1213 L and ORF1b:K2340N mutations. Additionally, a new mutation (E661D) in the spike (S) protein has been identified in nearly 10% of the genomes classified as the VOC P.1 from Parana in March and April 2021. We also report the identification of the S:W152C mutation in one genome from Parana, classified as the N.10 variant. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the lineage and the P.1 variant frequency, age group (patients younger or older than 60 years old) and the clinical data of 86 cases from the state of Parana. This analysis does not support an association between the P.1 variant prevalence and COVID-19 severity or age strata. Our results provided a reliable picture of the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the state of Parana characterized by the dominance of the P.1 strain, as well as a high frequencies of the P.1-like-II lineage and the S:E661D mutations. Epidemiological and genomic surveillance efforts should be continued to unveil the biological relevance of the novel mutations detected in the VOC P.1 in Parana.","Oliveira, Mauro de Medeiros; Schemberger, Michelle Orane; Suzukawa, Andreia Akemi; Riediger, Irina Nastassja; Debur, Maria do Carmo; Becker, Guilherme; Resende, Paola Cristina de Medeiros; Gräf, Tiago; Balsanelli, Eduardo; Baura, Valter Antônio de; Souza, Emanuel M; Pedrosa, Fabio de Oliveira; Alves, Lysangela Ronalte; Blanes, Lucas; Nardeli, Sheila Cristina; Aguiar, Alessandra De Melo; Albrecht, Letusa; Zanette, Dalila; Ávila, Andréa; Morello, Luis Gustavo; Marchini, Fabricio Klerynton; Santos, Hellen Geremias dos; Passetti, Fabio; Dallagiovanna, Bruno; Faoro, Helisson",,,185

There has been a large interest in mathematical modeling to aid in the prediction of both the total infected population and virus-related deaths, as well as to aid government agencies in decision making. As the virus continues to spread, there are both economic and sociological incentives to minimize time spent with strict distancing mandates enforced, and/or to adopt periodically relaxed distancing protocols, which allow for scheduled economic activity. The main objective of this study is to reduce the disease burden in a population, here measured as the peak of the infected population, while simultaneously minimizing the length of time the population is socially distanced, utilizing both a single period of social distancing as well as periodic relaxation. We derive a linear relationship among the optimal start time and duration of a single interval of social distancing from an approximation of the classic epidemic SIR model. Furthermore, we see a sharp phase transition region in start times for a single pulse of distancing, where the peak of the infected population changes rapidly; notably, this transition occurs well before one would intuitively expect. By numerical investigation of more sophisticated epidemiological models designed specifically to describe the COVID-19 pandemic, we see that all share remarkably similar dynamic characteristics when contact rates are subject to periodic or one-shot changes, and hence lead us to conclude that these features are universal in epidemic models. On the other hand, the nonlinearity of epidemic models leads to non-monotone behavior of the peak of infected population under periodic relaxation of social distancing policies. This observation led us to hypothesize that an additional single interval social distancing at a proper time can significantly decrease the infected peak of periodic policies, and we verified this improvement numerically. While synchronous quarantine and social distancing mandates across populations effectively minimize the spread of an epidemic over the world, relaxation decisions should not be enacted at the same time for different populations.","Sadeghi, Mahdiar; Greene, James M; Sontag, Eduardo D",Annual reviews in control,,185

More precisely, it presents the basics of a theory of contextuality called Contextuality-by-Default (CbD). One of the main tenets of CbD is that the identity of a random variable is determined not only by its content (that which is measured or responded to) but also by contexts, systematically recorded conditions under which the variable is observed; and the variables in different contexts possess no joint distributions. I explain why this principle has no paradoxical consequences, and why it does not support the holistic""everything depends on everything else""view. Contextuality is defined as the difference between two differences: (1) the difference between content-sharing random variables when taken in isolation, and (2) the difference between the same random variables when taken within their contexts. Contextuality thus defined is a special form of context-dependence rather than a synonym for the latter. The theory applies to any empirical situation describable in terms of random variables. Deterministic situations are trivially noncontextual in CbD, but some of them can be described by systems of epistemic random variables, in which random variability is replaced with epistemic uncertainty. Mathematically, such systems are treated as if they were ordinary systems of random variables.","Dzhafarov, Ehtibar N.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.07954v1.pdf,185

Following from a longstanding critique of the decadence of modernity and, by extension, of an “official society” ordered and controlled by an out-of-touch and morbid elite, Maffesoli makes unequivocally clear that this global pandemic is a direct consequence of a globalized progressivist, economicist, and utilitarian civilizational paradigm.

322766,The Effect of Convalescent Plasma Therapy on COVID-19 Patient Mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that is used to treat a variety of cancers. It exerts its mechanism of action by blocking the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1). Toxicity concerns include immune-related toxicities, including colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, nephritis, endocrine toxicities and more rarely, myocarditis and other organ system toxicities. OBJECTIVE: To review a real-world case involving immunotherapy induced myocarditis after a patient received pembrolizumab and discuss how the current pandemic created complexity in toxicity management. DISCUSSION: An 83 year old male with metastatic lung cancer developed fatal myocarditis after receiving 2 doses of pembrolizumab. Applying the Naranjo score, the likelihood of pembrolizumab causing the myocarditis is probable, with a score of 6. Severe cardiac toxicities are rare with pembrolizumab, but can still occur. It is vital to be aware of these toxicities, and educate patients on signs and symptoms. Complicating the situation even further was the global pandemic, which created fear and hesitation in the patient and the patient's family to seek medical treatment out of fear of exposure. This pandemic adds another layer to the complexity of care for patients with cancer and management of toxicities. Pharmacists play a significant role in ensuring the safety and efficacy of medications, especially oncology agents. CONCLUSION: Proper education of patients regarding symptoms and when to report are paramount to assisting in early detection and intervention for immunotherapy-related adverse events. New management and treatment strategies will need to be discussed and implemented considering the changing landscape around the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Elder, Christopher T; Davis, Elizabeth C; Jaipal, Stephanie; Wight, Charles E",J Oncol Pharm Pract,,185

With this background in mind, we present an approach combining fewest-switches trajectory surface hopping and spin-flip (SF) time-dependent (TD) density-functional tight binding (DFTB), which is a simplified version of SF-TD density functional theory (DFT) with semiempirical parametrizations, for computationally efficient nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. The estimated computational time of the SF-TD-DFTB approach is several orders of magnitude lower than that of SF-TD-DFT. In addition, the proposed method reproduces the time scales and quantum yields in photoisomerization reactions of azobenzene at a level comparable with conventional ab initio approaches, demonstrating reasonable accuracy. Finally, we report a practical application of the developed technique to explore the nonradiative relaxation processes of tetraphenylethylene and its derivative with torsionally locked aromatic rings and discuss the effect of locking the rings on the excited-state lifetime.","Uratani, Hiroki; Morioka, Toshiki; Yoshikawa, Takeshi; Nakai, Hiromi",J. chem. theory comput.

From our catchment area in northern Germany, we have so far become aware of 22 deaths in connection with vaccination in a 5 week period (range: 0-28 days after vaccination). Three death cases after vaccination with Comirnaty®, which were autopsied at the Institute of Legal Medicine Hamburg, are presented in more detail. All three deceased had severe cardiovascular diseases, among other comorbidities, and died in the context of these pre-existing conditions, while one case developed a COVID-19 pneumonia as cause of death. Taking into account the results of the postmortem examination a causal relation between the vaccination and the death was not established in any case.

However, coinfection is far from a simple matter, and cannot be considered having more unfavorable outcomes as a direct consequence. In reality, the aftermath is powerfully nuanced by the presence of risk factors and specific molecular mechanisms. Our objective was to raise awareness around the unpredictable association between COVID-19 pandemics and the upcoming flu season, and make arguments about the need to develop new routine testing protocols for both viruses, at least during the period with an expected high incidence. Our reasoning is built around the various impacts that the whole range of risk groups, common immunological mechanisms, and complex interactions, such as influenza vaccination, will have on patients' prognosis. We show that the more flawed clinical course is due to managing only one of the infections (and, subsequently, neglecting the other condition).","Burlacu, Alexandru; Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Popa, Iolanda Valentina; Covic, Adrian",Medicina (Kaunas),,185

METHODS: Sixty-two cases receiving favipiravir treatment for at least five days due to COVID-19 infection were evaluated retrospectively. Parameters including age, gender, nasopharyngeal swab positivity, and chronic diseases were analyzed. Hematologic parameters were analyzed before and after the treatment. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients receiving treatment with favipiravir was 63.7±12.3 years. Nasopharyngeal swab positivity was detected in 67.7%. The most common comorbid conditions detected in patients were hypertension in 25 cases (40.3%) and diabetes in 16 cases (25.8%). In the statistical analysis of the hematological parameters before and after treatment with favipiravir, WBC, PT-PTT-INR levels were found to be unaffected; the mean RBC was found to have decreased from 4.33 ± 0.58 M/uL to 4.16 ± 0.54 M/uL (p:0.003); the median hemoglobin level was found to have decreased from 12.3 g/dl to 11.9 g/dl (p:0.041); the hematocrit level decreased from 38.1% ± 4.8 to 36.9% ± 4.2 (p:0.026); the median neutrophil count decreased from 4.57 K/uL to 3.85 K/uL (p:0.001); the mean lymphocyte count increased from 1.22 ± 0.53 K/uL to 1.84 ± 1.19 K/uL (p:0.000); and the mean platelet count increased from 244.1 ± 85.1 K/uL to 281.9 ± 103.3 K/uL (p:0.005). CONCLUSION: We concluded that the pathological effect of treatment with favipiravir on the hematologic system was the suppression in the erythrocyte series, and there were no adverse effects in other hematologic parameters.","Yaylaci, Selçuk; Dheir, Hamad; Senocak, Didar; Genc, Ahmed Bilal; Kocayigit, Havva; Çekiç, Deniz; Varim, Ceyhun; Aydin, Abdülkadir; Koroglu, Mehmet; Karabay, Oguz",Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),,185

333654,Relationship between the history of cerebrovascular disease and mortality in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has devastated families and communities and disrupted society and the economy. The prompt availability of effective and affordable vaccines offers the most promising path out of the pandemic. Global solidarity was reflected in the early publication of the genome sequence and the sharing of protocols for the PCR test. However, WHO’s proposed “solidarity vaccine trial” which would yield comparative data about vaccines and the proposal that vaccine technologies be shared to accelerate vaccine development and production were rejected by pharma. In March global cooperation around diagnostics, medicines and vaccines moved from WHO to the ‘Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator’, a new ‘multi-stakeholder public private partnership. The “vaccine arm” of the Accelerator was the Covax Facility which would mobilise donor funds to pay for vaccines for the 20% priority populations in low and lower middle income countries. By July however, it was clear that massive bilateral advanced purchase agreements by the high income countries would reserve most of the early supply of effective vaccines and jeopardise the fund-raising for Covax. The rise of ‘vaccine nationalism’ looks set to cause long delays in access to vaccination in many L&MICs, and significant morbidity and mortality as a consequence. We propose a policy platform to promote a more equitable roll out of vaccines in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic including: full funding of Covax and expansion of local production of vaccines supported by technology transfer and an immediate waiver of key provisions of the TRIPS Agreement. © 2021 The Author(s).

There are no definitive therapeutic rec-ommendations that give benefit results until recently. Recent studies suggest that coagulopa-thy is one of the complications of COVID-19 that increases the mortality rate regardless of the severity. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the association between systemic anticoagulant use and mortality in COVID-19 patients with various clinical condi-tions. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search from several databases. The anticoagu-lant used in this study comprises of systemic anticoagulants such as low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or others. The primary out-come was all-cause mortality related to anticoagulant use in COVID-19 patients. The meta-analysis was performed to see the significance of anticoagulants in decreasing the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients. Results: 7064 patients were analyzed from 7 studies. The meta-analysis showed that systemic anticoagulant use was related with lower mortality rate (RR 0.70 [0.51, 0.97], p&lt;0.03;I2: 87%, p&lt;0.00001). The systematic review reported that 4 of 7 studies favor decreasing the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients administered with systemic anticoagulants. Conclusion: Systemic use of anticoagulants was associated with a lower mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. Further studies are needed for better causation explanation. The implication of this study is to measure the mortality impact of systemic anticoagulant use in COVID-19 patients. © 2021, The Indonesian Foundation of Critical Care Medicine.

Assoc. 2020, 119 (6) 1123), and is relatively time-consuming. Fast and reliable complementary methods for detecting the viral infection would be of help in the current pandemic conditions. Mass spectrometry is one of such possibilities. We have developed a mass-spectrometry-based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein. Our approach shows confident identification of the N protein in patient samples, even those with the lowest viral loads, and a much simpler preparation procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and the addition of isopropanol and tryptic digestion of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected. The obtained results can further be used to create fast parallel mass-spectrometric approaches for the detection of the virus in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.","Nikolaev, Evgeny N; Indeykina, Maria I; Brzhozovskiy, Alexander G; Bugrova, Anna E; Kononikhin, Alexey S; Starodubtseva, Natalia L; Petrotchenko, Evgeny V; Kovalev, Grigoriy I; Borchers, Christoph H; Sukhikh, Gennady T",J Proteome Res,,185

Educational institutes all overthe world are faced with the unique challenge to keep running the education amidst the lockdowns and social distancing. This has resulted in an unprecedented shift to the alternate mode of instructional delivery. This is a temporary shift in the mode of delivery as a result of the crisis or emergency situation. The present paper discussed the implications of one of such crisis pedagogies of remote learning during the COVID-19 propelled closure of the tertiary institutions in Australia. The effectiveness of emergency remote learning (ERL) was assessed through the online survey. The participants were international students, the majority, at the time of the survey were in Australia and doing postgraduate course in project management. To assess the overall effectiveness, the solicited opinions were analyzed under five headings: students' perception, curriculum, feedback, quality, and technology & resource. The ERL model adopted in this study has two components: self-paced asynchronous learning and faculty-guided synchronous learning. The aim of the self-paced asynchronous learning was to provide the student access to learning and teaching materials which they could use safely, reliably and remotely, and later used those in their learning at their own pace. Similarly, the aim of the synchronous learning was to provide an interactive learning experience as in face-to-face teaching through faculty-guided live session. The result of the present study reveals that students perceived the ERL quite positively and are satisfied with the overall online learning and reported that transition to online learning from face-to-face was smooth and without much of the issue.","Khanal, Rakesh",Pedagogical Research,,185

We aimed to describe the impact of this screening on the local SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. METHODS: All high-risk contacts, as well as the individuals living in their households, were screened. We detailed the evolution of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Lot-et-Garonne department and the rest of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region. RESULTS: Among the 89 screened individuals, 10 new cases were confirmed, including 4 asymptomatic persons. In Lot-et-Garonne, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases immediately decreased after this screening and no epidemic peak occurred, contrary to what was observed in the rest of the region. CONCLUSION: The early screening of high-risk contacts of COVID-19 cases and members of their household implemented a few days before the first lockdown probably helped to prevent the spread of the virus in the department.","Gault, Gaëlle; Monpierre, Olivier; Carion, Gaetane; Rispal, Patrick; Royer, Hélène; Lafon, Marie-Edith; Habold, Daniel; Filleul, Laurent",Infect Dis Now,,185

Our aim was to develop and evaluate a machine learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 in the inpatient setting. The algorithm was based on basic demographic and laboratory features to serve as a screening tool at hospitals where testing is scarce or unavailable. We used retrospectively collected data from the UCLA Health System in Los Angeles, California. We included all emergency room or inpatient cases receiving SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing who also had a set of ancillary laboratory features (n = 1,455) between 1 March 2020 and 24 May 2020. We tested seven machine learning models and used a combination of those models for the final diagnostic classification. In the test set (n = 392), our combined model had an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.87-0.96). The model achieved a sensitivity of 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.98), specificity of 0.64 (95% CI 0.58-0.69). We found that our machine learning algorithm had excellent diagnostic metrics compared to SARS-CoV-2 PCR. This ensemble machine learning algorithm to diagnose COVID-19 has the potential to be used as a screening tool in hospital settings where PCR testing is scarce or unavailable.","Goodman-Meza, David; Rudas, Akos; Chiang, Jeffrey N; Adamson, Paul C; Ebinger, Joseph; Sun, Nancy; Botting, Patrick; Fulcher, Jennifer A; Saab, Faysal G; Brook, Rachel; Eskin, Eleazar; An, Ulzee; Kordi, Misagh; Jew, Brandon; Balliu, Brunilda; Chen, Zeyuan; Hill, Brian L; Rahmani, Elior; Halperin, Eran; Manuel, Vladimir",PLoS One,,185

In absence of official recommendations, implementing daily multidisciplinary team (MDT) COVID-19 meetings was urgently needed. Our aim was to describe our initial institutional standard operating procedures for implementing these meetings, and their impact on daily practice. METHODS: All consecutive patients who were hospitalized in our institution due to COVID 19, from March 31 to April 15, 2020, were included. Criteria to be presented at MDT meetings were defined as a proven COVID-19 by PCR or strongly suspected on CT scan, requiring hospitalization and treatment not included in the standard of care. Three investigators identified the patients who met the predefined criteria and compared the treatment and outcomes of patients with predefined criteria that were presented during MDT meeting with those not presented during MDT meeting. COVID-19 MDT meeting implementation and adhesion were also assessed by a hospital medical staff survey. RESULTS: In all, 318 patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 were examined in our hospital. Of these, 230 (87%) were hospitalized in a COVID-19 unit, 91 (40%) of whom met predefined MDT meeting criteria. Fifty (55%) patients were presented at a MDT meeting versus 41 (45%) were not. Complementary exploration and inclusion in the CorImmuno cohort were higher in MDT meeting group (respectively 35 vs. 15%, P=0.03 and 80 versus 49%, P=0.0007). Prescription of hydrocortisone hemisuccinate was higher in group of patients not presented during MDT meeting (24 vs. 51%, P=0.007). Almost half of the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were not presented at MDT meeting, which can be partly explained by technical software issues. CONCLUSIONS: Multidisciplinary COVID-19 meetings helped implementing a single standard of care, avoided using treatments that were untested or currently being tested, and facilitated the inclusion of patients in prospective cohorts and therapeutic trials.","Rolland-Debord, C; Canellas, A; Choinier, P; Milon, A; Debrix, I; Blin, E; Belaube, N; Mattioni, S; Millet, F; Nadal, M; Petit-Hoang, C; Rigaud, P; Rech, J S; Siguier, M; Sroussi, D; Denis, M; Amiel, C; Fartoukh, M; Georgin-Lavialle, S; Lassel, L; Parrot, A; Cadranel, J",Respir Med Res,,185

Our aim in this study is to produce new fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2, which can be the basis for developing new antiviral drugs. The fusion core comprising the heptad repeat domains (HR1 and HR2) of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) were used to design the peptides. A total of twelve peptides were generated, comprising a short or truncated 24-mer (peptide #1), a long 36-mer peptide (peptide #2), and ten peptide #2 analogs. In contrast to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion cannot be inhibited with a minimal length, 24-mer peptide. Peptide #2 demonstrated potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 S-mediated cell-cell fusion at 1 µM concentration. Three peptide #2 analogs showed IC50 values in the low micromolar range (4.7-9.8 µM). Peptide #2 inhibited the SARSCoV-2 pseudovirus assay at IC50=1.49 µM. Given their potent inhibition of viral activity and safety and lack of cytotoxicity, these peptides provide an attractive avenue for the development of new prophylactic and therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2.","Kandeel, Mahmoud; Yamamoto, Mizuki; Tani, Hideki; Kobayashi, Ayako; Gohda, Jin; Kawaguchi, Yasushi; Park, Byoung Kwon; Kwon, Hyung-Joo; Inoue, Jun-Ichiro; Alkattan, Abdallah",,,185

In this research, we focus on the religiosity of communities to examine whether religiosity helps or hinders adherence to mitigation policies such as shelter-in-place directives. Prior research has made opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies, whereas another has predicted lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasiexperiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people's movements. However, when the directive was imposed, higher religiosity resulted in less adherence to shelter-in-place directives.

350409,An open-label randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in severe COVID-19 patients,2021,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the morbidity and mortality are increasing daily. Effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed. We recently discovered four SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) inhibitors including boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 with potent antiviral activity against infectious SARS-CoV-2 in cell culture. In this study, we further characterized the mechanism of action of these four compounds using the SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus neutralization assay. It was found that GC-376 and calpain inhibitors II and XII have a dual mechanism of action by inhibiting both viral Mpro and host cathepsin L in Vero cells. To rule out the cell-type dependent effect, the antiviral activity of these four compounds against SARS-CoV-2 was also confirmed in type 2 transmembrane serine protease-expressing Caco-2 cells using the viral yield reduction assay. In addition, we found that these four compounds have broad-spectrum antiviral activity in inhibiting not only SARS-CoV-2 but also SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, as well as human coronaviruses (CoVs) 229E, OC43, and NL63. The mechanism of action is through targeting the viral Mpro, which was supported by the thermal shift-binding assay and enzymatic fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. We further showed that these four compounds have additive antiviral effect when combined with remdesivir. Altogether, these results suggest that boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II and XII, and GC-376 might be promising starting points for further development against existing human coronaviruses as well as future emerging CoVs.","Hu, Yanmei; Ma, Chunlong; Szeto, Tommy; Hurst, Brett; Tarbet, Bart; Wang, Jun",ACS Infect Dis,,185

It is hence no surprise that the retail sector is one of the hardest-hit sectors in the current pandemic. To understand the short- and longer-term impacts of COVID-19 on retail, we conducted two surveys to understand ongoing changes in the sector. By contrasting changing consumer behavior with the actions taken by local retailers, we assess whether the current pandemic is potentially a catalyst for e-commerce in Belgium. We do this based on a newly constructed framework of e-retail accessibility, as the differences between online and physical retail require a revision of the traditional economic geographical perspective on retail performance as introduced by Christaller (1933). We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic holds ample opportunities for an increase in the three components of e-retail accessibility, but that a lack of professionalism might prevent traditional local retailers to retain a share of the expanded online market. This could well mean the final blow for local brick and mortar shops if, as is predicted, the share of online shopping in total retail expenditure remains high after the pandemic.","Beckers, Joris Weekx Simon Beutels Philippe Verhetsel Ann",Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,,185

It was found that these higher radiant exposures may have increased the potential for SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation outdoors in April and May 2020. Assessment of the 6-year period 2015-2020 in the UK found that for 50-60% of the year, that is most of October to March, solar UV is unlikely to have a significant (at least 90% inactivation) impact on viral inactivation outdoors. Minimum times to reach 90% and 99% inactivation in the UK are of the order of tens of minutes and of the order of hours, respectively.

This review will outline technological responses to this need and the analytical considerations required for their translation to routine use. RECENT FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic solutions directly detect the virus or measure host-derived surrogate markers of infection. With pressure upon supply chains for the 'traditional' molecular approaches, a wide variety of analytical tools spanning the molecular, serology, imaging and chemistry space are being developed, including high throughput solutions and simplified near-patient formats. SUMMARY: The unique genetic nature of SARS-CoV-2 means high analytical specificity is achievable by most diagnostic formats. However, clinical sensitivity assessment is complicated by wide discrepancies in analytical range and challenges associated with standardising these differences. When coupled with the acute nature of SARS-CoV-2 infection, reported precise metrics of test performance must be questioned. The response to SARS-CoV-2 has delivered considerable diagnostic innovation, but for a technology to be maximised, it must be demonstrably reproducible and fit for purpose. If novel diagnostic solutions for SARS-CoV-2 are to succeed, equally innovative mechanisms are needed to ensure widespread clinical and surveillance application, enabling agreed standards and metrics to ensure comparability.","Huggett, Jim F; Moran-Gilad, Jacob; Lee, J Eugene",Curr Opin Pulm Med,,185

To understand these relationships, it integrates theories including epidemic prevention and control, government credibility, public morality, and social network systems. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with bootstrapping estimation was conducted using data calculated from 368 healthy citizens who are quarantining at home due to COVID-19 in Chinese cities that have launched a first-level primary public safety incident response. The results show that residents’ perception of the epidemic has a positive effect on their willingness to quarantine, and willingness to do outdoor activities has a negative effect. Moreover, government credibility and public morality have a mediating effect on the relationship between the perception of epidemic and willingness to quarantine. What is more, government credibility has a moderating effect on the relationship between willingness to do outdoor activities and willingness to quarantine. We discuss the implications of these results for beating future epidemics that may break out.","Xiang, Pengcheng; Guo, Jin; Liu, Qiqi",Anal. Soc. Issues Public Policy,,185

356389,"Asthma and risk of infection, hospitalization, ICU admission and mortality from COVID-19: Systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"BACKGROUND: Although several COVID-19 vaccines have been found to be effective in rigorous evaluation and have emerging availability in parts of the world, their supply will be inadequate to meet international needs for a considerable period of time. There also will be continued interest in vaccines that are more effective or have improved scalability to facilitate mass vaccination campaigns. Ongoing clinical testing of new vaccines also will be needed as variant strains continue to emerge that may elude some aspects of immunity induced by current vaccines. Randomized clinical trials meaningfully enhance the efficiency and reliability of such clinical testing. In clinical settings with limited or no access to known effective vaccines, placebo-controlled randomized trials of new vaccines remain a preferred approach to maximize the reliability, efficiency and interpretability of results. When emerging availability of licensed vaccines makes it no longer possible to use a placebo control, randomized active comparator non-inferiority trials may enable reliable insights. METHODS: In this article, ""hybrid"" methods are proposed to address settings where, during the conduct of a placebo-controlled trial, a judgment is made to replace the placebo arm by a licensed COVID-19 vaccine due to emerging availability of effective vaccines in regions participating in that trial. These hybrid methods are based on proposed statistics that aggregate evidence to formally test as well as to estimate the efficacy of the experimental vaccine, by combining placebo-controlled data during the first period of trial conduct with active-controlled data during the second period. RESULTS: Application of the proposed methods is illustrated in two important scenarios where the active control vaccine would become available in regions engaging in the experimental vaccine's placebo-controlled trial: in the first, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 50%-70% for the 4- to 6-month duration of follow-up of its placebo-controlled trial; in the second, the active comparator's vaccine efficacy would have been established to be 90%-95% during that duration. These two scenarios approximate what has been seen with adenovirus vaccines or mRNA vaccines, respectively, assuming the early estimates of vaccine efficacy for those vaccines would hold over longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSION: The proposed hybrid methods could readily play an important role in the near future in the design, conduct and analysis of randomized clinical trials performed to address the need for multiple additional vaccines reliably established to be safe and have worthwhile efficacy in reducing the risk of symptomatic disease from SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Fleming, Thomas R; Nason, Martha; Krause, Philip R; Longini, Ira M; Henao-Restrepo, Ana-Maria",Clin Trials,,185

We assessed the quality of 95 guidance documents published since 2000 that included recommendations about physical activity for the promotion of general health and prevention of cardiometabolic disease. We used three tools: AGREE II, the National Academy of Medicine's (NAM) Standards for Trustworthy Clinical Practice Guidelines, and the FITT score (Frequency, Intensity, Time and Type). Average AGREE II domain scores ranged from 38% - 84%, and the portion of criteria fulfilled per NAM domain ranged from 7% - 39%. The average FITT score for all recommendations was 2.48 out of 4. While guidelines improved according to both AGREE II and the NAM standards over time, their practicability as assessed by FITT score did not improve. Guidelines produced by governmental agencies or other non-profits, using the GRADE approach, or fulfilling a higher number of NAM criteria tended to be higher-quality. Organizations producing physical activity guidelines can improve their quality by establishing and reporting processes for public representation, external review, and conflict of interest management.

Autistic adults are at higher risk for co-occurring medical and psychiatric conditions and may be more prone to difficulties adapting to pandemic-related changes and social distancing mandates and coping with ongoing uncertainties. On the other hand, the pandemic may lead to greater understanding and acceptance of accommodations in the broader community that may facilitate supports for autistic adults beyond the pandemic. To learn more about their early pandemic experiences, online surveys were sent to independent adults enrolled in the Simons Powering Autism Research Knowledge (SPARK). The first survey was open from March 30 to April 19, 2020; a follow-up survey sent to original responders was open from May 27 to June 6, yielding 396 participants with data for both surveys. We found that adults who were female, younger, had prior diagnoses of a mental health condition, personal COVID-19 experience (i.e., knowing someone who had symptoms or tested positive) or less frequent hope for the future reported the greatest negative impacts. Decrease in feelings of hopefulness over time predicted greater psychological distress at T2, accounting for T1 impact and distress levels and increases in total COVID-19 impact. Less perceived benefit of online services also predicted later distress. Although there tends to be a focus on coping with negative effects of the pandemic, mental health providers may consider approaches that focus on positives, such as fostering hope and understanding factors that facilitate benefit from online services. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic adults may be at risk for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study suggests that autistic adults who were younger, female, had a mental health diagnosis before the pandemic and knew someone who showed symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19 reported more areas negatively impacted by COVID-19 and greater difficulty coping with those effects. Decreases in hope over time were associated with greater psychological distress. Less perceived benefit from online services also predicted distress 2 months later. These results suggest important areas to further explore as we develop supports for autistic adults during the pandemic.","Bal, Vanessa H; Wilkinson, Ellen; White, L Casey; Law, J Kiely; Feliciano, Pamela; Chung, Wendy K",Autism research (Online),,185

We also injected universal syntactic dependencies to improve the performance of the model further. The Natural Language Understanding (NLU) components of the voice assistants available today are heavily dependent on language models for various tasks. The generic language models such as BERT and RoBERTa are useful for domain-independent assistants but have limitations when they cater to a specific domain. For example, in the shopping domain, the token 'horizon' means a brand instead of its literal meaning. Generic models are not able to capture such subtleties. So, in this work, we retrained a distilled version of the BERT language model on retail domain-specific data for Walmart's voice shopping assistant. We also included universal dependency-based features in the retraining process further to improve the performance of the model on downstream tasks. We evaluated the performance of the retrained language model on four downstream tasks, including intent-entity detection, sentiment analysis, voice title shortening and proactive intent suggestion. We observed an increase in the performance of all the downstream tasks of up to 1.31% on average.","Jayarao, Pratik; Sharma, Arpit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15737v1.pdf,185

365917,Association between tuberculosis and COVID-19 severity and mortality: A rapid systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Mississippi recorded the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on March 11, 2020. This report describes the initial COVID-19 experience of the single healthcare system serving Jackson County, Mississippi. The intent of this retrospective review of COVID-19 hospitalized patients was to identify any characteristics or interventions amenable to improving care management and clinical outcomes for patients within our community hospital. METHODS: All hospitalized patients 18 years of age and older in our health system with positive tests for COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 [SARS CoV-2]) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction between March 15 and April 10, 2020 are included in this retrospective observational report. RESULTS: During the study period, 158 patients of the 1384 tested (11.4%) were positive for COVID-19 infection. Of the 158 patients, 41 (26%) were hospitalized, with 17 (41%) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The remaining 24 patients did not require ICU admission. The mean age of the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 55 years (range 2-103). Obesity was noted in 68% of the hospitalized patients, including 13 (54%) of the non-ICU patients and 15 (88%) of the ICU patients. All 9 deceased patients were obese. Twelve of 17 patients received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 3 patients received only high-flow nasal cannula oxygen. Only 25% (3 of 12) of the IMV patients were successfully extubated during the study period. The median duration on IMV was 17 days (range 4-35). The mortality in the 158 COVID-19-positive patients was 5.7% (9 of 158). None of the 24 non-ICU patients died. The ICU mortality rate was 53% (9 of 17). CONCLUSIONS: This report describes a community hospital experience with COVID-19. Patient outcome was comparable to that reported at larger centers. Obesity was a major comorbidity and correlated with adverse outcomes. Amidst the initial wave of COVID-19 with high demand for inpatient treatment, it is reassuring that appropriate care can be provided in a community health system.","Babar, Ijlal; Ekenna, Okechukwu; Clarkson, Maggie Ramsey; Boudreaux, Daralyn; Bennett, William; Roth, Randy",South Med J,,185
367492,Transforaminal Epidural Steroid Injections: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety,2021,"Contact tracing is an essential tool in containing infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Many countries and research groups have launched or announced mobile apps to facilitate contact tracing by recording contacts between users with some privacy considerations. Most of the focus has been on using random tokens, which are exchanged during encounters and stored locally on users' phones. Prior systems allow users to search over released tokens in order to learn if they have recently been in the proximity of a user that has since been diagnosed with the disease. However, prior approaches do not provide end-to-end privacy in the collection and querying of tokens. In particular, these approaches are vulnerable to either linkage attacks by users using token metadata, linkage attacks by the server, or false reporting by users. In this work, we introduce Epione, a lightweight system for contact tracing with strong privacy protections. Epione alerts users directly if any of their contacts have been diagnosed with the disease, while protecting the privacy of users' contacts from both central services and other users, and provides protection against false reporting. As a key building block, we present a new cryptographic tool for secure two-party private set intersection cardinality (PSI-CA), which allows two parties, each holding a set of items, to learn the intersection size of two private sets without revealing intersection items. We specifically tailor it to the case of large-scale contact tracing where clients have small input sets and the server's database of tokens is much larger.","Trieu, Ni; Shehata, Kareem; Saxena, Prateek; Shokri, Reza; Song, Dawn",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13293v3.pdf,185

Concerns were raised that the hot season may lead to additional problems as some typical interventions to prevent heat-related illness could potentially conflict with precautions to reduce coronavirus transmission. Therefore, an international research team organized by the Global Health Heat Information Network generated an inventory of the specific concerns about this nexus and began to address the issues. Three key thermal and covid-19 related topics were highlighted: 1) For the general public, going to public cool areas in the hot season interferes with the recommendation to stay at home to reduce the spread of the virus. Conflicting advice makes it necessary to revise national heat plans and alert policymakers of this forecasted issue. 2) For medical personnel working in hot conditions, heat strain is exacerbated due to a reduction in heat loss from wearing personal protective equipment to prevent contamination. To avoid heat-related injuries, medical personnel are recommended to precool and to minimize the increase in body core temperature using adopted work/rest schedules, specific clothing systems, and by drinking cold fluids. 3) Fever, one of the main symptoms of COVID-19, may be difficult to distinguish from heat-induced hyperthermia and a resting period may be necessary prior to measurement to avoid misinterpretation. In summary, heat in combination with the COVID-19 pandemic leads to additional problems; the impact of which can be reduced by revising heat plans and implementing special measures attentive to these compound risks.","Daanen, Hein; Bose-O’Reilly, Stephan; Brearley, Matt; Flouris, D.

369311,Vitamin D deficiency aggravates COVID-19: systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have shown a substantial impact of Rotavirus (RV) vaccination on the burden of RV and all-cause acute gastroenteritis (AGE). However, the results of most impact studies could be confused by a dynamic and complex space-time process. Therefore, there is a need to analyse the impact of RV vaccination on RV and AGE hospitalisations in a space-time framework to detect geographical-time patterns while avoiding the potential confusion caused by population inequalities in the impact estimations. METHODS: A retrospective population-based study using real-world data from the Valencia Region was performed among children aged less than 3 years old in the period 2005-2016. A Bayesian spatio-temporal model was constructed to analyse RV and AGE hospitalisations and to estimate the vaccination impact measured in averted hospitalisations. RESULTS: We found important spatio-temporal patterns in RV and AGE hospitalisations, RV vaccination coverage and in their associated adverted hospitalisations. Overall, ~ 1866 hospital admissions for RV were averted by RV vaccination during 2007-2016. Despite the low-medium vaccine coverage (~ 50%) in 2015-2016, relevant 36 and 20% reductions were estimated in RV and AGE hospitalisations respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of the RV vaccines has substantially reduced the number of RV hospitalisations, averting ~ 1866 admissions during 2007-2016 which were space and time dependent. This study improves the methodologies commonly used to estimate the RV vaccine impact and their interpretation.","López-Lacort, Mónica; Orrico-Sánchez, Alejandro; Martínez-Beneito, Miguel Ángel; Muñoz-Quiles, Cintia; Díez-Domingo, Javier",BMC Infect Dis,,185

With the world still gripped by the coronavirus, with devastating weather and climate disasters, and with attacks on science being spread through disinformation campaigns, there has never been a greater need for scientific engagement with public policy. Leaders in the scientific community are calling for better ways to incorporate science into decision-making during periods of crisis and beyond. Despite the challenges, these leaders are cautiously optimistic that science can have a meaningful seat at the table and that it can play an integral and balanced role in decision-making for government leaders and in informing the general public. Some of the optimism stems from the promises of the Biden administration to restore scientific integrity to federal policymaking. His early appointments on climate change, energy, and environmental policy have been encouraging.","Showstack, Randy",BioScience,,185

Almost from the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak several attempts were made to predict possible drugs capable of inhibiting the virus replication. In the present work a drug repurposing study is performed to identify potential SARS-CoV-2 protease inhibitors. We created a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model based on a machine learning strategy using hundreds of inhibitor molecules of the main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV coronavirus. The QSAR model was used for virtual screening of a large list of drugs from the DrugBank database. The best 20 candidates were then evaluated in-silico against the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 by using docking and molecular dynamics analyses. Docking was done by using the Gold software, and the free energies of binding were predicted with the MM-PBSA method as implemented in AMBER. Our results indicate that levothyroxine, amobarbital and ABP-700 are the best potential inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 virus through their binding to the Mpro enzyme.

374144,How severe COVID-19 infection is changing ARDS management,2020,"Visual analysis of complex fish habitats is an important step towards sustainable fisheries for human consumption and environmental protection. Deep Learning methods have shown great promise for scene analysis when trained on large-scale datasets. However, current datasets for fish analysis tend to focus on the classification task within constrained, plain environments which do not capture the complexity of underwater fish habitats. To address this limitation, we present DeepFish as a benchmark suite with a large-scale dataset to train and test methods for several computer vision tasks. The dataset consists of approximately 40 thousand images collected underwater from 20 habitats in the marine-environments of tropical Australia. The dataset originally contained only classification labels. Thus, we collected point-level and segmentation labels to have a more comprehensive fish analysis benchmark. These labels enable models to learn to automatically monitor fish count, identify their locations, and estimate their sizes. Our experiments provide an in-depth analysis of the dataset characteristics, and the performance evaluation of several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark. Although models pre-trained on ImageNet have successfully performed on this benchmark, there is still room for improvement. Therefore, this benchmark serves as a testbed to motivate further development in this challenging domain of underwater computer vision.","Saleh, Alzayat; Laradji, Issam H; Konovalov, Dmitry A; Bradley, Michael; Vazquez, David; Sheaves, Marcus",Sci Rep,,185

The cyanide-sensing species is a non-fluorescent fluorophore-polymer-Cu2+ complex; which forms as a result of the imidazole polymer's ability to bind both fluorophore and fluorescence quencher (Cu2+). Cyanide removes Cu2+ from these complexes; thereby ""turning-on"" sensor fluorescence. These sensors are water-soluble and have a detection limit of ~2.5 µM (CN-) in water. Our ternary complex-based sensing approach also enables facile emission tuning; we demonstrate the convenient, synthesis-free preparation of blue and green-emitting sensors using distyrylbiphenyl and fluorescein fluorophores, respectively. Furthermore; these ternary complexes are easily immobilized using agarose to create cyanide-sensing hydrogels; which are then used in a simple; novel microdiffusion apparatus to achieve interference-free cyanide analysis of aqueous media.

Therefore, we used cross-sectional regression analysis to examine the association between the presence of health care worker unions and COVID-19 mortality rates in 355 nursing homes in New York State. Health care worker unions were associated with a 1.29-percentage-point reduction in mortality, which represents a 30 percent relative decrease in the COVID-19 mortality rate compared with facilities without these unions.

It has created an unanticipated global public health crisis that is spreading rapidly in India as well, posing a serious threat to 1350 million persons. Among the factors, population density is foremost in posing a challenge in controlling the COVID-19 contagion. In such extraordinary times, evidence-based knowledge is the prime requisite for pacifying the effect. In this piece, we have studied the district wise transmissions of the novel coronavirus in five south Indian states until 20th July 2020 and its relationship with their respective population density. The five states are purposefully selected for their records in better healthcare infrastructure vis-à-vis other states in India. The study uses Pearson's correlation coefficient to account for the direct impact of population density on COVID-19 transmission rate. Response surface methodology approach is used to validate the correlation between density and transmission rate and spatiotemporal dynamics is highlighted using Thiessen polygon method. The analysis has found that COVID-19 transmission in four states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Telangana) strongly hinges upon the spatial distribution of population density. In addition, the results indicate that the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 crisis are likely to differ with demographic density.

In addition, we investigated whether knowledge about COVID-19 can reduce fear, prejudice, and anxiety. METHODS: We performed an anonymous online survey in 1,500 residents aged 19-65 years between April 24 and May 5 of 2020. Anxiety level was assessed using the generalized anxiety disorder-7 scale. We used a questionnaire to investigate COVID-19-related media use, knowledge about COVID-19, fear of infection, and prejudice towards infected people. We analyzed the relationships among the variables using the structural equation model. RESULTS: Media use had significant effects on fear of infection, prejudice against infected people, and anxiety. Knowledge about COVID-19 had a significant protective effect on fear of infection, prejudice against infected people, and anxiety. However, the effect of media use on knowledge about COVID-19 was not statistically significant. There was a partial mediating effect of prejudice against infected people and fear of infection on media usage and anxiety. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated significant effects of mass media coverage regarding COVID-19 on fear, prejudice, and anxiety. While knowledge about COVID-19 could decrease fear, prejudice, and anxiety, the use of mass media did not enhance this knowledge.

382319,"COVID-19 Clinical Characteristics, and Sex-Specific Risk of Mortality: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2020,"In December 2019 a new coronavirus (CoV) emerged as a human pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. There are few data on human coronavirus infections among individuals living with HIV. In this study we probed the role of pneumococcal coinfections with seasonal CoVs among children living with and without HIV hospitalized for pneumonia. We also described the prevalence and clinical manifestations of these infections. A total of 39,836 children who participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on the efficacy of a 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV9) were followed for lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations until 2 years of age. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected at the time of hospitalization and were screened by PCR for four seasonal CoVs. The frequency of CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in children living with HIV (19.9%) than in those without HIV (7.6%, P < 0.001). Serial CoV infections were detected in children living with HIV. The case fatality risk among children with CoV-associated pneumonia was higher in those living with HIV (30.4%) than without HIV (2.9%, P = 0.001). C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels were elevated in 36.8% (&#8805;40 mg/liter) and 64.7% (&#8805;0.5 ng/ml), respectively, of the fatal cases living with HIV. Among children without HIV, there was a 64.0% (95% CI: 22.9% to 83.2%) lower incidence of CoV-associated pneumonia hospitalizations among PCV9 recipients compared to placebo recipients. These data suggest that Streptococcus pneumoniae infections might have a role in the development of pneumonia associated with endemic CoVs, that PCV may prevent pediatric CoV-associated hospitalization, and that children living with HIV with CoV infections develop more severe outcomes.IMPORTANCE SARS-CoV-2 may cause severe hospitalization, but little is known about the role of secondary bacterial infection in these severe cases, beyond the observation of high levels of reported inflammatory markers, associated with bacterial infection, such as procalcitonin. We did a secondary analysis of a double-blind randomized trial of PCV to examine its impact on human CoV infections before the pandemic. We found that both children living with and without HIV randomized to receive PCV had evidence of less hospitalization due to seasonal CoV, suggesting that pneumococcal coinfection may play a role in severe hospitalized CoV infections.","Nunes, Marta C; Cutland, Clare L; Klugman, Keith P; Madhi, Shabir A",mBio (Online),,185

We defined PM2.5 long-term exposure as the 2014-2018 average of the estimated concentrations at municipalities obtained from the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service Reanalysis (CAMSRA) model. We fitted a logit-negative binomial hurdle model for the mortality rate adjusting for sociodemographic and health conditions. RESULTS: Estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) for long-term average PM2.5 were not statistically significant in either of the two components of the hurdle model (i.e., the likelihood of reporting at least one death or the count of fatal cases). We found that having 10% or more of the population over 65 years of age (MRR = 3.91 95%CI 2.24-6.81), the poverty index (MRR = 1.03 95%CI 1.01-1.05), and the prevalence of hypertension over 6% (MRR = 1.32 95%CI1.03-1.68) are the main factors associated with death rate at the municipality level. Having higher hospital beds capacity is inversely correlated to mortality. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of an association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and COVID-19 mortality rate at the municipality level in Colombia. Demographics, health system capacity, and social conditions did have evidence of an ecological effect on COVID-19 mortality. The use of model-based estimations of long-term PM2.5 exposure includes an undetermined level of uncertainty in the results, and therefore they should be interpreted as preliminary evidence.","Rodriguez-Villamizar, Laura A; Belalcázar-Ceron, Luis Carlos; Fernández-Niño, Julián Alfredo; Marín-Pineda, Diana Marcela; Rojas-Sánchez, Oscar Alberto; Acuña-Merchán, Lizbeth Alexandra; Ramírez-García, Nathaly; Mangones-Matos, Sonia Cecilia; Vargas-González, Jorge Mario; Herrera-Torres, Julián; Agudelo-Castañeda, Dayana Milena; Piñeros Jiménez, Juan Gabriel; Rojas-Roa, Néstor Y; Herrera-Galindo, Victor Mauricio",Sci Total Environ,,185

386714,"A comparison of mortality-related risk factors of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2020,"PURPOSE: Physical distancing measures to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus have presented challenges for the mental health and well-being of college students. As campus activities ceased, student-athletes abruptly became isolated from teammates and were no longer able to participate in sport activities that are often central to their identity as an athlete. However, student-athletes who have supportive social connections with teammates during this pandemic may maintain their athletic identity to a greater extent and report better mental health. The present study examined how student-athletes' mental health was associated with teammate social support, connectedness, and changes to athletic identity from before to during COVID-19. METHOD: A sample of 234 student-athletes completed surveys before COVID-19 physical distancing (February 2020), with 135 (63% female) participating in a follow-up in the month following school closures (April 2020). Path models estimated the effects of teammate social support and connectedness (during COVID-19), as well as changes in athletic identity on indices of mental health. RESULTS: Considering all path models tested, student-athletes who received more social support and reported more connectedness with teammates reported less dissolution of their athletic identity and-in most models-reported better mental health and well-being. Indirect effects indicated that student-athletes' change in athletic identity mediated the effects of teammate social support on psychological well-being and depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to advancing theory on how small groups relate to mental health, these findings demonstrate the value in remaining socially connected with peers and maintaining role identities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Graupensperger, Scott; Benson, Alex J; Kilmer, Jason R; Evans, M Blair",J Adolesc Health,,185

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical spectrum of musculoskeletal involvement and relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stage and CD4+ cells and other factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 75 patients of over 18 years of either sex with confirmed HIV status attending a tertiary care hospital in north India in one calendar year. Baseline demographic details, relevant history including duration of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), RM, joints involved, CD4 cell count, and biochemical parameters were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 75 patients, 54 were male and 21 were female (mean age 33.15 ± 5.00 years, range 21-48 years). Most common RM was arthralgia (26.67%), followed by myalgia (18.67%), and arthritis (13.33%). Keratoderma blennorrhagicum (1.33%), tendo-achilles tendinitis (2.67%), and plantar fasciitis (2.67%) were other manifestations. Spondyloarthritis (SpA) was seen in 8% patients (undifferentiated SpA 4%, reactive arthritis 2.67%, psoriatic arthritis 1.67%). HIV-associated arthritis was seen in 2.67% while septic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and diffuse infiltrative lymphocytic syndrome were seen in one patient (1.33%) each. The mean duration of disease in patients with RM was significantly less than patients without RM (p < 0.01). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients with RM was significantly higher than in patients without RM (p < 0.05). Mean CD4 + cells were also significantly lower in patients with RM as compared to patients without RM (p < 0.05). Significantly fewer patients on cART had RM in comparison to patients not on cART (p < 0.001). Of 35 patients with RM, 25 were in CDC stage IV. CONCLUSION: RM are common in HIV-infected patients. HIV arthralgia, myalgia, and undifferentiated SpA are the common manifestations. RM were associated with low CD4 counts. Most of the cases with RM were in CDC stage IV.","Saigal, Renu; Chakraborty, Avik; Yadav, Ram Narayan; Goyal, Laxmi Kant",Adv. ther,,185

The World Health Organization has played a pivotal technical, normative and coordinating role, but has been constrained by its lack of authority over sovereign member states. Many governments also mistakenly attempted to manage COVID-19 like influenza, resulting in repeated lockdowns, high excess morbidity and mortality, and poor economic recovery. Despite the incredible speed of the development and approval of effective and safe vaccines, the emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants means that all countries will have to rely on a globally coordinated public health effort for several years to defeat this pandemic.","Hassan, Ines; Mukaigawara, Mitsuru; King, Lois; Fernandes, Genevie; Sridhar, Devi",Nat Med,,185
386995,The effect of cardiovascular disease and acute cardiac injury on fatal COVID-19: a meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: There is a worldwide shortage of medical grade face masks. Donning masks can play an important role in curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2. AIM: To conclude if there is an effective mask for the population to wear in public that could easily be made during a medical face mask shortage using readily available materials. METHODS: We determined the effectiveness of readily available materials and models for making a face mask. The outcomes were compared with N95/FFP2/KN95 masks that entered the Netherlands in April-May 2020. Masks were tested to see if they filter a minimum of 35% of 0.3É¥m particles, are hydrophobic, seal on the face, are breathable, and can be washed. FINDINGS: Fourteen of the 25 (combinations of) materials filtered at least 35% of 0.3É¥m particles. Four of the materials proved hydrophobic, all commercially manufactured filters. Two models sealed the face. Twenty-two of the 25 materials were breathable at <0.7 mbar. None of the hydrophobic materials stayed intact after washing. CONCLUSIONS: It would be possible to reduce the reproduction rate of SARS CoV-2 from 2.4 to below one if 39% of the population would wear a mask made from ePM1 85% commercially manufactured filter fabric and in a duckbill form. This mask performs better than 80% of the imported N95/FFP2/KN95 masks and provides a better fit than a surgical mask. Two layers of quilt fabric with a household paper towel as filter is also a viable choice for protecting the user and the environment.","Teesing, G R; Straten, Bart van; Man, Peter de; Horeman, Tim",J. hosp. infect,,185

A theoretical framework is required in order to understand this impact and strategies to mitigate it. In this paper, individual and community responses to COVID-19 are discussed from the point of view of attachment theory, a psychological theory which examines the formation and disruption of attachment bonds across the life-span from an evolutionary perspective. The contributions of this perspective to individual psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as to social responses such as interpersonal violence and stigmatization, are discussed in the light of findings from attachment research. Proposals for incorporating the knowledge derived from attachment theory into therapeutic strategies, as well as in developing community resilience in the face of COVID-19, are discussed based on the available evidence. It is hoped that this information will be of value to clinicians and researchers, as well as to those involved in planning health services and social policy.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Psychiatr Danub,,185

In the present study, a retrospective analysis was performed in a cohort of 306 confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 10 to March 15, 2020. Whole blood levels of essential and/or toxic metal(loid)s were analyzed, including magnesium, calcium, chromium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, thallium, and lead according to the disease severity and outcome. Compared to the non-severe COVID-19 patients, severe cases showed significant higher levels of whole blood calcium, chromium, and copper, but lower levels of magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, arsenic, thallium, and lead. These differences were further found consistently across the clinical course since the disease onset by longitudinal analysis. Among the severe patients, chromium and cadmium were higher in the deceased group compared to the recovered group, while arsenic was lower. Whole blood iron, age, and sex were determined to be independent factors associated with the disease severity, while chromium, cadmium, and the comorbidity of cardiovascular disease were determined to be independent factors associated with the mortality. These results suggest that variations of whole blood metal(loid)s may be associated with the severe illness and fatal outcome of COVID-19, which could be persistently monitored and would be helpful in the evaluation of the dynamic changes in patients with COVID-19.","Zeng, Hao-Long; Yang, Qing; Yuan, Peihong; Wang, Xu; Cheng, Liming",FASEB J,,185

METHODS: We enrolled 35 confirmed index cases and their 148 household contacts, January 2020-February 2020, in Zhuhai, China. All participants were interviewed and asked to complete questionnaires. Household contacts were then prospectively followed active symptom monitoring through the 21-day period and nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs were collected at 3-7 days intervals. Epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data (when available) were collected. RESULTS: Assuming that all these secondary cases were infected by their index cases, the second infection rate in household context is 32.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22.4%-44.4%), with 10.4% of secondary cases being asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed that household contacts with underlying medical conditions, a history of direct exposure to Wuhan and its surrounding areas, and shared vehicle with an index patient were associated with higher susceptibility. Household members without protective measures after illness onset of the index patient seem to increase the risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The median incubation period and serial interval within household were estimated to be 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.4-5.3 days) and 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.3-6.2 days), respectively. CONCLUSION: Early isolation of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and prioritizing rapid contact investigation, followed by active symptom monitoring and periodic laboratory evaluation, should be initiated immediately after confirming patients to address the underlying determinants driving the continuing pandemic.","Wu, Jian; Huang, Yiying; Tu, Changli; Bi, Chunping; Chen, Zhigang; Luo, Liyun; Huang, Mingxing; Chen, Meizhu; Tan, Cuiyan; Wang, Zhenguo; Wang, Kongqiu; Liang, YingJian; Huang, Jin; Zheng, Xiaobin; Liu, Jing",Clin Infect Dis,,185

METHODS: Twenty-one institutions providing live online dental courses in China during COVID-19 epidemic enrolled in this study. Their online and/or offline course provision before and during the epidemic was retrospectively inquired. If live online education was provided, the number of courses, duration and number of participants per week were further investigated. Time distributions of live online dental courses were recorded and classified as within working time and out of working time. The test period of COVID-19 epidemic was for two weeks between 16 February and 29 February 2020. The control period of pre-COVID-19 epidemic was for ten weeks between 01 November 2019 and 09 January 2020. RESULTS: The percentages of offline and online courses provided by 21 dental continuing education institutions before COVID-19 epidemic were 95.2% (20 out of 21) and 28.6% (6 out of 21), respectively. All the institutions suspended offline courses whilst providing two live online courses, on average, per week with 188 minutes duration and 7290 participants during the epidemic. The total number of online courses for 10 weeks before the epidemic was 33, and that for two weeks during the epidemic was 119. The proportion of courses provided within working time raised from 6.1% (2 out of 33) of pre-COVID-19 to 46.2% (55 out of 119) during COVID-19. There were significant differences between before and during the epidemic (P < .001).

In this research article, the author describes the possibility of predicting the COVID-19 total, active cases, death and cured cases in India up to 25th June 2020 by applying linear regression and support vector machine. It is extremely tricky to manage the occurrence of corona virus since it is expanding exponentially day to day and is difficult to handle with a limited number of doctors and beds to treat the infected individuals with limited time. Hence, it is essential to develop a machine learning based computerized predicting model. The development effort in this article is based on publicly available data that is downloaded from KAGGLE to estimate the spread of the disease within a short period. We have calculated the RMSE, R2, MAE of LR and SVR models and concluded that the RMSE of linear regression is less than the SVR. Therefore, the LR will help doctors to forecast for the next few days.","Dharani, N P; Bojja, Polaiah; Raja Kumari, Pamula",,,185

DESIGN: An organizational case study with mixed methods evaluation from the first 8 weeks of converting a geriatrics clinic from in-person visits to video and telephone visits. SETTING: Veteran's Health Administration in Northern California Participants Community-dwelling older Veterans receiving care at VA Palo Alto Geriatrics clinic. Veterans had a mean age of 85.7 (SD = 6.8) and 72.1% had cognitive impairment. INTERVENTION: Veterans with face-to-face appointments were converted to video or telephone visits to mitigate exposure to community spread of COVID-19. MEASUREMENTS: Thirty-two patient evaluations and 80 clinician feedback evaluations were completed. This provided information on satisfaction, care access during pandemic, and travel and time savings. RESULTS: Of the 62 scheduled appointments, 43 virtual visits (69.4%) were conducted. Twenty-six (60.5%) visits were conducted via video, 17 (39.5%) by telephone. Virtual visits saved patients an average of 118.6 minutes each. Patients and providers had similar, positive perceptions about telehealth to in-person visit comparison, limiting exposure, and visit satisfaction. After the telehealth appointment, patients indicated greater comfort with using virtual visits in the future. Thirty-one evaluations included comments for qualitative analysis. We identified 3 main themes of technology set-up and usability, satisfaction with visit, and clinical assessment and communication. CONCLUSION: During a pandemic that has limited the ability to safely conduct inperson services, virtual formats offer a feasible and acceptable alternative for clinically-complex older patients. Despite potential barriers and additional effort required for telehealth visits, patients expressed willingness to utilize this format. Patients and providers reported high satisfaction, particularly with the ability to access care similar to in-person while staying safe. Investing in telehealth services during a pandemic ensures that vulnerable older patients can access care while maintaining social distancing, an important safety measure.","Iyer, Sowmya; Mehta, Priyanka; Weith, Joanne; Hoang-Gia, Dat; Moore, Janet; Carlson, Chalise; Choe, Philip; Sakai, Erin; Gould, Christine",J Prim Care Community Health,,185

Due to lack of knowledge about the cited issues, we aimed to investigate the clinical symptoms, case fatality rate, and some risk factors of COVID-19. Materials & Methods: This longitudinal study was started from the late February 2020 and lasted to the mid-July 2020 in Jiroft, Kerman province, Iran. The course of the disease, clinical signs and symptoms, underlying diseases, patients' exposure history, travel history, adherence to health instructions, and the fatality rate of the disease were evaluated in the patients. The descriptive statistics and frequency were analyzed in different groups using IBM SPSS statistics version 20. Results: In this study, 2977 definitive cases of COVID-19 were detected using RT-PCR test. The frequent clinical symptoms were fever (45.2%), body aches and bruises (38.8%), and cough (36.4%), respectively. The fatality rate of the disease was 4%. Evaluation of the patients’ exposure history showed that almost 50% of the cases had no exposure. Among the studied individuals, 33% had the history of exposure to a definite COVID-19 case. Conclusion: Personal hygiene, social distancing, and use of face mask are of great importance in reducing the disease morbidity and mortality. Public awareness about COVID-19 should also be increased, especially in the elderly individuals with the history of underlying and chronic diseases. © 2021, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences and Health Services.

Between 18 March and 18 April 2020, as illness and death escalated in the United States, we assessed acute stress, depressive symptoms, and direct, community, and media-based exposures to COVID-19 in three consecutive representative samples from the U.S. probability-based nationally representative NORC AmeriSpeak panel across three 10-day periods (total N = 6514). Acute stress and depressive symptoms increased significantly over time as COVID-19 deaths increased across the United States. Preexisting mental and physical health diagnoses, daily COVID-19-related media exposure, conflicting COVID-19 information in media, and secondary stressors were all associated with acute stress and depressive symptoms. Results have implications for targeting public health interventions and risk communication efforts to promote community resilience as the pandemic waxes and wanes over time.","Holman, E Alison; Thompson, Rebecca R; Garfin, Dana Rose; Silver, Roxane Cohen",Sci.

403638,Outcomes of Life-threatening Cardiovascular Complications and Coronavirus Disease 19- a Cohort Study,2021,"Interactions between proteins and small molecules play important roles in the inhibition of protein function. However, a lack of proper knowledge about non-covalent interactions can act as a barrier towards gaining a complete understanding of the factors that control these associations. To find effective molecules for COVID-19 inhibition, we have quantitatively investigated 143 X-ray crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro protein of coronavirus with covalently or non-covalently bound small molecules (SMs). Our present study is able to explain ordinary and perceptive aspects relating to protein inhibition. The active site of the protein consists of 21 amino acid residues, but only nine are actively involved in the ligand binding process. The H41, M49, and C145 residues have highest priority with respect to interactions with small molecules through hydrogen bond, CH-&#960;, and van der Waals interactions. At the active site, this ranking of amino acids is clear, based on different spatial orientations of ligands, and consistent with the electronic properties. SMs with aromatic moieties that bind to the active site of the protein play a distinct role in the determination of the following order of interaction frequency with the amino acids: CH-&#960; > H-bonding > polar interactions. This present study revealed that the G143 and C145 residues play crucial roles in the recognition of the carbonyl functionality of SMs through hydrogen bonding. With this knowledge in mind, an effective inhibitor small-molecule for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was designed: docking studies showed that the designed molecule has strong binding affinity towards the protein. The non-covalent interactions in the protein-ligand complex are in good agreement with the results obtained from X-ray crystallography. Moreover, the present study focused on weak forces and their influence on protein inhibition, henceforth shedding much light on the essential requirements for moieties that should be present in a good inhibitor and their orientations at the ligand binding site.","Sepay, Nayim; Saha, Pranab Chandra; Shahzadi, Zarrin; Chakraborty, Aratrika; Halder, Umesh Chandra",Phys Chem Chem Phys,,185

We describe clinical-radiological characteristics, the cytokine storm parameters, and the clinical evolution of a series of patients treated with dexamethasone in the disease's initial phase.Method: A study of 8 patients who received dexamethasone before the development of COVID-19. We evaluate clinical variables, imaging tests, cytokine release parameters, treatment used and patient evolution.Results: All patients received a 6 mg/day dose with a mean duration of 4.5 days before admission. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) revealed that most of them presented a severe extension; most patients had a slightly elevated level of cytokine release parameters. Three patients required high-flow oxygen therapy due to respiratory failure; none required orotracheal intubation or died.Conclusion: Dexamethasone in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be associated with severe COVID-19.","Callejas Rubio, J L; Aomar Millan, I; Moreno-Higueras, M; Martín Ripoll, L; Yuste Osorio, E; Ríos-Fernández, R",Rev. clin. esp.

405479,"On-admission anemia predicts mortality in COVID-19 patients: A single center, retrospective cohort study",2021,"Air pollution attributed to substantial anthropogenic emissions and significant secondary formation processes have been reported frequently in China, especially in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD). In order to investigate the aerosol evolution processes before, in, and after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown period of 2020, ambient monitoring data of six air pollutants were analyzed from Jan 1 to Apr 11 in both 2020 and 2019. Our results showed that the six ambient pollutants concentrations were much lower during the COVID-19 lockdown due to a great reduction of anthropogenic emissions. BTH suffered from air pollution more seriously in comparison of YRD, suggesting the differences in the industrial structures of these two regions. The significant difference between the normalized ratios of CO and NO2 during COVID-19 lockdown, along with the increasing PM2.5, indicated the oxidation of NO2 to form nitrate and the dominant contribution of secondary processes on PM2.5. In addition, the most health risk factor was PM2.5 and health-risked based air quality index (HAQI) values during the COVID-19 pandemic in YRD in 2020 were all lower than those in 2019. Our findings suggest that the reduction of anthropogenic emissions is essential to mitigate PM2.5 pollution, while O3 control may be more complicated.","Wang, Junfeng; Lei, Yali; Chen, Yi; Wu, Yangzhou; Ge, Xinlei; Shen, Fuzhen; Zhang, Jie; Ye, Jianhuai; Nie, Dongyang; Zhao, Xiuyong; Chen, Mindong",J Environ Manage,,185

407045,Assessment of the Publication Trends of COVID-19 Systematic Reviews and Randomized Controlled Trials,2021,"Vector control methods that mobilize and impact rapidly during dengue, Zika, and chikungunya outbreaks are urgently needed in urban contexts. We investigated whether one person using a handheld aerosolized insecticide could achieve efficacy levels comparable to targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS), using pyrethroid-resistant Aedes aegypti in a semi-field setting with experimental houses in Mexico. The insecticide product (H24, a carbamate and pyrethroid mixture), available over-the-counter locally, was sprayed only on known Ae. aegypti-resting surfaces, for example, walls less than 1.5 m and dark hidden areas. In six identical houses with paired bedrooms, one bedroom was treated, and the other remained an untreated control. Each week for 8 weeks, 100 female pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti were released in each bedroom and followed up daily. Mortality rates in treated bedrooms exceeded 90% for at least 2 weeks, and more than 80% (89.2; 95% CI: 79.98-98.35) for 3 weeks or more. Mortality rates in control houses were zero. Results demonstrate that the immediate impact of TIRS can be delivered by one person using existing products, at an estimated cost for the average household in Mexico of under US$3 per month. Triggered by early outbreak signs, dissemination via community hubs and mass/social media of instructions to treat the home immediately, with monthly re-treatment thereafter, provides a simple means to engage and empower householders. Compatible with integrated vector management strategies, it enables self-protection even if existing agencies falter, a situation exemplified by the potential impact on vector control of the restrictions imposed during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.","Dzib-Florez, Sergio; Ponce-García, Gustavo; Medina-Barreiro, Anuar; González-Olvera, Gabriela; Contreras-Perera, Yamili; Del Castillo-Centeno, Felipe; Ahmed, Ahmed M M; Che-Mendoza, Azael; McCall, Philip J; Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo; Manrique-Saide, Pablo",Am J Trop Med Hyg,,185
407261,"What's new in critical illness and injury science? In situ simulation for airway management during COVID-19 in the emergency department, KMC, Manipal",2020,"OBJECTIVES: In order for physical distancing directives to be effective at lowering and flattening the epidemic peak during a pandemic, individuals must adhere to confinement guidelines. Recent reviews highlight the paucity of research on empirical correlates of adherence to physical distancing and quarantine directives. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 1003 individuals were recruited using quota sampling to form a sample approximately representative of the population of Quebec (Canada) in terms of age, gender, and urbanicity. Participants completed an online survey on adherence to physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey evaluated socio-demographic, health, cognitive, emotional, and social factors related to physical distancing. RESULTS: Individuals aged 70 and older (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.04-2.67), women (OR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.02-1.79), and those who were not essential workers (OR = 3.28, 95% CI = 2.24-4.81) reported more physical distancing. Injunctive personal norms (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.23-2.31), perceived benefits of physical distancing to others (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.12-1.93), and descriptive social norms (OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.04-1.52) were independent predictors of adherence status. Individuals adhered more to physical distancing if they believed that it was their civic duty to do so and that physical distancing helped protect others, and if they perceived that most other people were following these directives. In contrast, perceived personal risk and emotional factors were not independently related to physical distancing. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of health beliefs and perceived social norms in shaping responses to physical distancing directives. These findings offer insights into ways to frame public health communications to promote physical distancing during a pandemic.","Gouin, Jean-Philippe; MacNeil, Sasha; Switzer, Andrew; Carrese-Chacra, Emily; Durif, Fabien; Knäuper, Bärbel",Can J Public Health,,185
407425,"In Reply to the Letter to the Editor Regarding ""Neurological Impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Practical Considerations for the Neuroscience Community""",2020,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected all healthcare systems. This study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number and severity of cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Japan. METHODS: Using claims data from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project (QIP) database, urgent cases of inpatients for CAP from 01 August 2018 to 30 July 2020 were included. The monthly ratios of inpatient cases were compared from August 2018 to July 2019 and August 2019 to July 2020 as a year-over-year comparison. These ratios were also compared according to the ""A-DROP"" severity score, and an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the monthly number of inpatient cases. RESULTS: This study included a total of 67,900 inpatient cases for CAP in 262 hospitals. During the COVID-19 pandemic (defined as the period between March and July 2020) the number of inpatient cases for CAP drastically decreased compared with the same period in the previous year (-48.1%), despite a temporary reduction in the number of other urgent admissions. The number of inpatient cases decreased according to the severity of pneumonia. Milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio than severe ones: mild -55.2%, moderate -45.8%, severe -39.4%, and extremely severe -33.2%. The ITS analysis showed that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly reduced the monthly number of inpatient cases for CAP (estimated decrease: -1233 cases; 95% CI -521 to -1955). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed a significant reduction in the number of inpatient cases for CAP during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The milder cases showed a greater decrease in the year-over-year ratio of the number of inpatient cases.","Nagano, Hiroyuki; Takada, Daisuke; Shin, Jung-Ho; Morishita, Tetsuji; Kunisawa, Susumu; Imanaka, Yuichi",Int J Infect Dis,,185
409150,Cytokines as a predictor of COVID-19 severity: evidence from meta-analysis,2020,"Biosensors represent one of the numerous promising technologies envisioned to extend healthcare delivery. In perioperative care, the healthcare delivery system can use biosensors to remotely supervise patients who would otherwise be admitted to a hospital. This novel technology has gained a foothold in healthcare with significant acceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have attempted to narrate, or systematically analyze, the process of their implementation. We performed an observational study of biosensor implementation. The data accuracy provided by the commercially available biosensors was compared to those offered by standard clinical monitoring on patients admitted to the intensive care unit/perioperative unit. Surveys were also conducted to examine the acceptance of technology by patients and medical staff. We demonstrated a significant difference in vital signs between sensors and standard monitoring which was very dependent on the measured variables. Sensors seemed to integrate into the workflow relatively quickly, with almost no reported problems. The acceptance of the biosensors was high by patients and slightly less by nurses directly involved in the patients' care. The staff forecast a broad implementation of biosensors in approximately three to five years, yet are eager to learn more about them. Reliability considerations proved particularly troublesome in our implementation trial. Careful evaluation of sensor readiness is most likely necessary prior to system-wide implementation by each hospital to assess for data accuracy and acceptance by the staff.","Restrepo, Mariana; Huffenberger, Ann Marie; Hanson, C William; Draugelis, Michael; Laudanski, Krzysztof",,,185

409906,Remote Monitoring of Patients in Quarantine in the Era of SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic,2020,"Background: The COVID-19 epidemic was declared a Global Pandemic by WHO on 11 March 2020. By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies.","Ainslie, Kylie E C; Walters, Caroline E; Fu, Han; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Wang, Haowei; Xi, Xiaoyue; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Boyd, Olivia; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cucunuba, Zulma; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Dorigatti, Ilaria; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Rich; Gaythorpe, Katy; Ghani, Azra C; Green, Will; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jorgensen, David; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy C; Siveroni, Igor; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Walker, Patrick G T; Wang, Yuanrong; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Winskill, Peter; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Riley, Steven",Wellcome Open Res,,185

For this purpose, a rapid alternative diagnostic choice to prevent COVID-19 spread among individuals must be implemented as an automatic detection method. In this article, the multi-objective optimization and deep learning-based technique for identifying infected patients with coronavirus using X-rays is proposed. J48 decision tree approach classifies the deep feature of corona affected X-ray images for the efficient detection of infected patients. In this study, 11 different convolutional neural network-based (CNN) models (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet) are developed for detection of infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images. The efficiency of the proposed model is tested using k-fold cross-validation method. Moreover, the parameters of CNN deep learning model are tuned using multi-objective spotted hyena optimizer (MOSHO). Extensive analysis shows that the proposed model can classify the X-ray images at a good accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and F1-score rates. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed model outperforms competitive models in terms of well-known performance metrics. Hence, the proposed model is useful for real-time COVID-19 disease classification from X-ray chest images. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

We developed both a dedicated airway team and coordinated education programme to facilitate ward management of tracheostomised COVID-19 patients. Here, we report outcomes in the first 100 COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at our institution. METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study of patients confirmed to have COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilation at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK. The primary outcome measure was 30-day survival, accounting for severe organ dysfunction (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health [APACHE]-II score>17). Secondary outcomes included duration of ventilation, ICU stay, and healthcare workers directly involved in tracheostomy care acquiring COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 164 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to the ICU between March 9, 2020 and April 21, 2020. A total of 100 patients (mean [standard deviation] age: 55 [12] yr; 29% female) underwent tracheostomy; 64 (age: 57 [14] yr; 25% female) did not undergo tracheostomy. Despite similar APACHE-II scores, 30-day survival was higher in 85/100 (85%) patients after tracheostomy, compared with 27/64 (42%) non-tracheostomised patients {relative risk: 3.9 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 2.3-6.4); P<0.0001}. In patients with APACHE-II scores &#8805;17, 68/100 (68%) tracheotomised patients survived, compared with 12/64 (19%) non-tracheotomised patients (P<0.001). Tracheostomy within 14 days of intubation was associated with shorter duration of ventilation (mean difference: 6.0 days [95% CI: 3.1-9.0]; P<0.0001) and ICU stay (mean difference: 6.7 days [95% CI: 3.7-9.6]; P<0.0001). No healthcare workers developed COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Independent of the severity of critical illness from COVID-19, 30-day survival was higher and ICU stay shorter in patients receiving tracheostomy.

A literature search for peer-reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID-19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID-19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID-19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human-environment issues; intersection of COVID-19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID-19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations' views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID-19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID-19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century.","Zang, Sheryl M; Benjenk, Ivy; Breakey, Suellen; Pusey-Reid, Eleonor; Nicholas, Patrice K",Public health nurs,,185

Methods: We conducted a pilot randomized, controlled trial in patients with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Eligible adult patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either CHM plus standard care or standard care alone for 7 days. The primary outcome was the change in the disease severity category of COVID-19 after treatment. Results: Between Jan 31, 2020, and Feb 19, 2020, 42 out of 100 screened patients were included in the trial: 28 in the CHM plus standard care group and 14 in the standard care alone group. Among 42 participants who were randomized (mean [SD] age 60.43 years [12.69 years]), 21 (21/42, 50%) were aged ≥65 years, 35 (35/42, 83%) were women, and 42 (42/42, 100%) had data available for the primary outcome. For the primary outcome, one patient from each group died during treatment; the odds of a shift toward death was lower in the CHM plus group than in the standard care alone group (common OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.148–2.352, P = 0.454). Three (two from the CHM plus group and one from the standard care alone group) patients progressed from severe to critical illness. After treatment, mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 disease accounted for 17.86% (5/28) vs. 14.29% (2/28), 71.43% (20/28) vs. 64.29% (9/28), and 0% (0) vs. 7.14% (1/28) of the patients treated with CHM plus standard care vs. standard care alone. Conclusions: For the first time, the G-CHAMPS trial provided valuable information for the national guideline-based CHM treatment of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. The effects of CHM in COVID-19 may be clinically important and warrant further consideration and studies. Clinical Trial Registration: http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.

412015,Clinical determinants of the severity of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"IntroductionPost-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS) is a physical, cognitive, emotional and functional condition resulting from prolonged stays in ICU (Intensive Care Unit). In pathologies with clinical characteristics similar to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, most patients showed cognitive deficits after discharge from ICU. In particular, previous studies describe impairment on verbal learning among PICS patients.ObjectivesTo analyse the immediate verbal-learning performance in patients with PICS after COVID-19 infection in a Functional Rehabilitation Unit in Madrid (Spain) using the Spanish version of the Screen for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP-S).MethodsThis study was conducted in the Hospital Central de la Cruz Roja, in Madrid (Spain). A sample of 17 PICS adult patients was included, with age ranging from 56 to 74 years old (mean = 68.35 years;13 males). Patients were assessed around three weeks after referral from their reference hospital. The Verbal Learning Test-Immediate (VLT-I) of the SCIP-S was used as outcome. Descriptive analyses were conducted (mean and standard deviation) on standardized scores (z) based on age-adjusted general population norms. Significant impairment was set at z &lt; -1.5.ResultsMean z-score on VLT-I was -1.08 (S.D. = .80) from the total sample, with 33.3% of cases with significant impairment (mean = -1.81;S.D. = .20).ConclusionsThese preliminary results show the probable presence of mild-moderate impairment on immediate verbal learning in a subgroup of patients, which was already observed in PICS patients with other medical conditions. Longitudinal studies, with larger samples, are needed where the premorbid cognitive level is considered.DisclosureNo significant relationships.","Maldonado-Belmonte, M.

412016,Clinical determinants of the severity of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has posed a huge challenge to healthcare systems and their personnel worldwide. The study of the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers (HCW), through prevalence studies, will let us know viral expansion, individuals at most risk and the most exposed areas in healthcare organizations. The aim of this study is to gauge the impact of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in our hospital workforce and identify groups and areas at increased risk. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This is a cross-sectional and incidence study carried out on healthcare workers based on molecular and serological diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of the 3013 HCW invited to participate, 2439 (80.9%) were recruited, including 674 (22.4%) who had previously consulted at the Occupational Health Service (OHS) for confirmed exposure and/or presenting symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. A total of 411 (16.9%) and 264 (10.8%) healthcare workers were SARS-CoV-2 IgG and rRT-PCR positive, respectively. The cumulative prevalence considering all studies (IgG positive HCW and/or rRT-PCR positive detection) was 485 (19.9%). SARS-CoV-2 IgG-positive patients in whom the virus was not detected were 221 (9.1%); up to 151 of them (68.3%) did not report any compatible symptoms nor consult at the OHS for this reason. Men became more infected than women (25% vs 18.5%, p = 0.0009), including when data were also classified by age. COVID-19 cumulative prevalence among the HCW assigned to medical departments was higher (25.2%) than others, as well as among medical staff (25.4%) compared with other professional categories (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HCW of our centre has been 19.9%. Doctors and medical services personnel have had the highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but many of them have not presented compatible symptoms. This emphasizes the performance of continuous surveillance methods of the most exposed health personnel and not only based on the appearance of symptoms.","Garralda Fernandez, Javier; Molero Vilches, Ignacio; Bermejo Rodríguez, Alfredo; Cano Torres, Isabel; Colino Romay, Elda Isabel; García Arata, Isabel; Jaqueti Aroca, Jerónimo; Lillo Rodríguez, Rosa; López Lacomba, Daniel; Mazón Cuadrado, Luis; Molina Esteban, Laura; Morales García, Luis Javier; Moratilla Monzo, Laura; Nieto-Borrajo, Elva; Pacheco Delgado, María; Prieto Menchero, Santiago; Sánchez Hernández, Cristina; Sánchez Testillano, Eva; García-Martínez, Jesús",PLoS One,,185
412943,The Heart That Won’t Go On: Sinus Bradycardia as the Presenting Sign of Worsening Covid-19 Infection,2021,"With a Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case count exceeding 10 million worldwide, there is an increased need for a diagnostic capability. The main variables in increasing diagnostic capability are reduced cost, turnaround or diagnosis time, and upfront equipment cost and accessibility. Two candidates for machine learning COVID-19 diagnosis are Computed Tomography (CT) scans and plain chest X-rays. While CT scans score higher in sensitivity, they have a higher cost, maintenance requirement, and turnaround time as compared to plain chest X-rays. The use of portable chest X-radiograph (CXR) is recommended by the American College of Radiology (ACR) since using CT places a massive burden on radiology services. Therefore, X-ray imagery paired with machine learning techniques is proposed a first-line triage tool for COVID-19 diagnostics. In this paper we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) to accurately classify chest X-ray scans of COVID-19 and normal subjects by fine-tuning several neural networks (ResNet18, ResNet50, DenseNet201) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. These neural networks are fused in a parallel architecture and the voting criteria are applied in the final classification decision between the candidate object classes where the output of each neural network is representing a single vote. Several experiments are conducted on the weakly labeled COVID-19-CT-CXR dataset consisting of 263 COVID-19 CXR images extracted from PubMed Central Open Access subsets combined with 25 normal classification CXR images. These experiments show an optimistic result and a capability of the proposed model to outperforming many state-of-the-art algorithms on several measures. Using k-fold cross-validation and a bagging classifier ensemble, we achieve an accuracy of 99.7% and a sensitivity of 100%.","Ragb, Hussin K.; Dover, Ian T.; Ali, Redha",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.08831v1.pdf,185

416105,Management of respiratory support,2020,"INTRODUCTION: It has been reported that microbiological diagnosis of Cutibacterium spp. infection requires a prolonged incubation time (up to 14 days). We present our experience with regard to incubation time for detection of Cutibacterium spp. in orthopaedic samples over a 10-year period. METHODS: One hundred and nineteen samples were included in this retrospective study. Fifty-three were implants (having previously undergone sonication), 64 were periprosthetic tissue biopsies and two were synovial fluids. Atkins's criteria were used for interpreting the isolates. Quantification and number of days until a culture became positive for Cutibacterium spp. were evaluated. RESULTS: The median number of days to detection of a clinically significant isolate and a contaminant was 4 days. No clinically significant isolates grew after day eight. CONCLUSION: Most clinically significant isolates of Cutibacterium spp. are detected in the first 7 days of incubation, although a recommendation of prolonged incubation (up to 14 days) appears to be necessary for detecting other organisms.","Salar-Vidal, Llanos; Martin-Garcia, Marta; Auñón, Alvaro; Esteban, Jaime",Enferm. infecc. microbiol. clin.

METHODS: COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital between January 18and March 27, 2020 were evaluated. Clinical features, laboratory data, complications and outcomes were compared between females and males. Risk factors for mortality in the whole population, females and males were determined respectively. RESULTS: There were 1667 (50.38%) females among the3309 patients included in this study. The mortality rate was only 5.9% in females but 12.7% in males. Compared with males, more females had no initial symptoms (11.1% vs 8.3%, p=0.008). Complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury, septic shock, cardiac injury and coagulation disorder were less common in females; critical illness was also significant less common in females (31.1% vs 39.4%, p<0.0001). Significantly fewer female patients received antibiotics treatment (p=0.001), antiviral therapy (p=0.025) glucocorticoids treatment (p<0.0001), mechanical ventilation (p<0.0001) and had Intensive Care Unit admission (p<0.0001). A lower risk of death was found in females (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.58) after adjusting for age and coexisting diseases. Among females, age, malignancy, chronic kidney disease and days from onset to admission were significant associated with mortality, while chronic kidney disease was not risk factor in males. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly more mild illness and fewer deaths were found in female COVID-19 inpatients and risk factors associated with mortality varied among male and female population.","Chen, Jing; Bai, Hualin; Liu, Jia; Chen, Ge; Liao, Qiuyue; Yang, Jie; Wu, Peng; Wei, Juncheng; Ma, Ding; Chen, Gang; Ai, Jihui; Li, Kezhen",Clin. infect. dis,,185
418336,Intravenous immunoglobulin-based adjuvant therapy for severe COVID-19: a single-center retrospective cohort study,2021,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19), which started from Wuhan, China, in late 2019, have spread worldwide. A total of 5,91,971 cases and 2,70,90 deaths were registered till 28th March, 2020. We aimed to predict the impact of duration of exposure to COVID-19 on the mortality rates increment. METHODS: In the present study, data on COVID-19 infected top seven countries viz., Germany, China, France, United Kingdom, Iran, Italy and Spain, and World as a whole, were used for modeling. The analytical procedure of generalized linear model followed by Gompertz link function was used to predict the impact lethal duration of exposure on the mortality rates. FINDINGS: Of the selected countries and World as whole, the projection based on 21st March, 2020 cases, suggest that a total (95% Cl) of 76 (65-151) days of exposure in Germany, mortality rate will increase by 5 times to 1%. In countries like France and United Kingdom, our projection suggests that additional exposure of 48 days and 7 days, respectively, will raise the mortality rates to10%. Regarding Iran, Italy and Spain, mortality rate will rise to 10% with an additional 3-10 days of exposure. World's mortality rates will continue increase by 1% in every three weeks. The predicted interval of lethal duration corresponding to each country has found to be consistent with the mortality rates observed on 28th March, 2020. CONCLUSION: The prediction of lethal duration was found to have apparently effective in predicting mortality, and shows concordance with prevailing rates. In absence of any vaccine against COVID-19 infection, the present study adds information about the quantum of the severity and time elapsed to death will help the Government to take necessary and appropriate steps to control this pandemic.","Verma, Vivek; Vishwakarma, Ramesh K; Verma, Anita; Nath, Dilip C; Khan, Hafiz T A",PLoS One,,185

Over the first three months of restrictions, 3,121 U.S. adults completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Despite relaxation of lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders over that time, loneliness scores increased significantly, particularly from April to May 2020, and appear to have plateaued by June. Loneliness was correlated with depression and suicidal ideation at all time points and was most prevalent among individuals who reported that they were still under community restrictions to socially isolate due to the novel coronavirus.

Our results show that during the study period COVID-19 cumulative incidence and mortality was lower in NI than the rest of the UK. Incidence and mortality were also lower than in the Republic of Ireland (ROI), although these observed differences are difficult to interpret given considerable differences in testing and surveillance between the two nations. SAR among household contacts was 15.9% (95% CI 6.6%-30.1%), over 6 times higher than the SAR among 'high-risk' contacts at 2.5% (95% CI 0.9%-5.4%). The results from logistic regression analysis of testing data on contacts of laboratory-confirmed cases show that household contacts had 11.0 times higher odds (aOR: 11.0, 95% CI 1.7-70.03, P-value: 0.011) of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to other categories of contacts. These results demonstrate the importance of the household as a locus of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and the urgency of identifying effective interventions to reduce household transmission.","Pett, J; McAleavey, P; McGurnaghan, P; Spiers, R; O039,; Doherty, M; Patterson, L; Johnston, J",Epidemiol Infect,,185

Given the rapidly growing evidence base, we implemented a living guideline model to provide guidance on the management of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. METHODS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Disease 2019 panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. We used the World Health Organization's definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials. When appropriate, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, then used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility. RESULTS: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued nine statements (three new and six updated) related to ICU patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. For severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the panel strongly recommends using systemic corticosteroids and venous thromboprophylaxis but strongly recommends against using hydroxychloroquine. In addition, the panel suggests using dexamethasone (compared with other corticosteroids) and suggests against using convalescent plasma and therapeutic anticoagulation outside clinical trials. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel suggests using remdesivir in nonventilated patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 and suggests against starting remdesivir in patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 outside clinical trials. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel did not issue a recommendation on the use of awake prone positioning. CONCLUSION: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Diease 2019 panel issued several recommendations to guide healthcare professionals caring for adults with critical or severe coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. Based on a living guideline model the recommendations will be updated as new evidence becomes available.","Alhazzani, Waleed; Evans, Laura; Alshamsi, Fayez; Møller, Morten Hylander; Ostermann, Marlies; Prescott, Hallie C; Arabi, Yaseen M; Loeb, Mark; Ng Gong, Michelle; Fan, Eddy; Oczkowski, Simon; Levy, Mitchell M; Derde, Lennie; Dzierba, Amy; Du, Bin; Machado, Flavia; Wunsch, Hannah; Crowther, Mark; Cecconi, Maurizio; Koh, Younsuck; Burry, Lisa; Chertow, Daniel S; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Belley-Cote, Emilie; Greco, Massimiliano; Bala, Malgorzata; Zarychanski, Ryan; Kesecioglu, Jozef; McGeer, Allison; Mermel, Leonard; Mammen, Manoj J; Nainan Myatra, Sheila; Arrington, Amy; Kleinpell, Ruth; Citerio, Giuseppe; Lewis, Kimberley; Bridges, Elizabeth; Memish, Ziad A; Hammond, Naomi; Hayden, Frederick G; Alshahrani, Muhammed; Al Duhailib, Zainab; Martin, Greg S; Kaplan, Lewis J; Coopersmith, Craig M; Antonelli, Massimo; Rhodes, Andrew",Crit Care Med,,185

METHODS: Analysis of validated self-administered questionnaires, radiological characteristics and treatment strategies of PA was performed. RESULTS: Of the 221 sent questionnaires, 146 could be used for statistical analysis, 50% of which were completed by women. Among responders, 58.9% had pain: 30.1% migraine, 15.7% pain with NC and 13.1% other types of pain. Migraine was more common in patients with PA than in the general population (30.1% vs. 21.3%, p = .010) and attacks received appropriate treatment for less than 20% of these patients. Furthermore, the prevalence of chronic migraine was much higher than in the general population (6.8% vs. 2.2%, p = .003). Neuropathic pain was also more frequent in PA patients than in the general population (15.8% vs. 6.9%, p < .001). Neuropathic pain was most often located in the extremities and was frequently described as an 'electric shock', 'numbness', or 'pins-and-needles'. Multivariate analyses linked migraine to younger age, anxiety, pain with NC, and a visible tumour on MRI, regardless of its invasiveness or secretory nature. CONCLUSIONS: Migraine headaches and neuropathic pain are more frequent and disabling in PA patients than in the general population. Both types of pain are comorbid in PA patients and are poorly treated. Migraine is associated with the presence of a tumour. Thus, biological mechanisms of this relationship need to be characterized to design optimal treatments for these individuals. SIGNIFICANCE: Migraine headaches and neuropathic pain are more common in PA patients than in the general population and are generally poorly treated. A systematic screening for migraine should be done by physicians in daily practice to provide adequate therapeutics.","Dallel, Sarah; Devoize, Laurent; Tauveron, Igor; Pereira, Bruno; Clavelou, Pierre; Maqdasy, Salwan; Moisset, Xavier; Dallel, Radhouane",Eur. j. pain (Lond.),,185

This cross-sectional online survey study evaluated the menstrual cycle characteristics of women in the reproductive phase of their lives during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020. Changes before and after COVID-19 were evaluated with a paired sample t-test and chi-square test. A Pearson correlation test was used to show the relationships between variables. The study was completed with 263 participants in total. The average age of the participants was 26.3 ± 6.9 (18-45). Participants' duration of period (p = .003) and pads used per day (p = .002) decreased compared to their experience before the COVID-19 outbreak. The mean total MSQ score was 3.1 ± 0.8 (0-4), mean STAI-1 score was 45.1 ± 9 (20-78) and mean STAI-II score was 43.3 ± 5.9 (30-69). It was found that STAI-I and STAI-II scores showed a positive correlation with MSQ-Somatic subgroup scores(r = 0.153, p = .013; 0.190, p = .002) and MSQ-Total scores (0.144, p = .020; 0.175, p = .004). With the COVID-19 pandemic, increased anxiety scores increased women's menstrual symptoms while the length of periods and the number of pads used decreased.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? The COVID 19 pandemic, has caused enormous psychological distress potentially resulting in the development of posttraumatic stress disorder. The menstrual cycle is a process that can be affected by psychological stress.What do the results of this study add? This is the first study to examine the relationship between stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the menstrual cycle. The increases in the degree of anxiety and stress as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak was found to be high enough to affect the characteristics of the menstrual cycle in the women surveyed.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? In a prospective study intended to be carried out after the outbreak ends in the future, it will be possible to evaluate whether the menstrual cycle parameters return to their former order and consequently this hypothesis will be able to be more definitively confirmed.","Demir, Omer; Sal, Hidayet; Comba, Cihan",J Obstet Gynaecol,,185
426789,Signals of Th2 immune response from COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become an increasingly severe public health emergency. Although traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has helped to combat COVID-19, public perception of TCM remains controversial. We used the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to identify factors that affect the intention to use TCM. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey of 10,824 individuals from the general public was conducted between March 16 and April 2, 2020. The participants were recruited using a snowball sampling method. Data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire, based on the TPB. The questionnaire consisted of demographic characteristics and TPB structures. Structural equation modeling was used to identify predictors of intention. RESULTS: The results indicated the model explained 77.5% and 71.9% of intention and attitude variance. Intention to use TCM had the strongest relationship with attitude (P < 0.001), followed by past behavior (P < 0.001), subjective norms (P < 0.001) and perceived behavioral control (P < 0.001). Attitudes toward TCM were significantly affected by perceived behavioral control (P < 0.001), subjective norms (P < 0.001) and cognition of TCM (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Attitude is a key factor in determining the intention to use TCM, followed by past behaviors, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Our results offer important implications for health policy makers to promote the use of TCM.","Xia, Yi; Shi, Lu-Shao-Bo; Chang, Jing-Hui; Miao, Hua-Zhang; Wang, Dong",J. Integra. Med. (Shanghai),,185
427927,Ocular transmission and manifestation for coronavirus disease: a systematic review,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronaviruses mainly affect the respiratory system; however, there are reports of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV causing neurological manifestations. We aimed at discussing the various neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to estimate the prevalence of each of them. METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases; PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, EBSCO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, WHO database, and ClinicalTrials.gov . Relevant MeSH terms for COVID-19 and neurological manifestations were used. Randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, case-control studies, cohort studies, cross-sectional studies, case series, and case reports were included in the study. To estimate the overall proportion of each neurological manifestations, the study employed meta-analysis of proportions using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Pooled prevalence of each neurological manifestations are, smell disturbances (35.8%; 95% CI 21.4-50.2), taste disturbances (38.5%; 95%CI 24.0-53.0), myalgia (19.3%; 95% CI 15.1-23.6), headache (14.7%; 95% CI 10.4-18.9), dizziness (6.1%; 95% CI 3.1-9.2), and syncope (1.8%; 95% CI 0.9-4.6). Pooled prevalence of acute cerebrovascular disease was (2.3%; 95%CI 1.0-3.6), of which majority were ischaemic stroke (2.1%; 95% CI 0.9-3.3), followed by haemorrhagic stroke (0.4%; 95% CI 0.2-0.6), and cerebral venous thrombosis (0.3%; 95% CI 0.1-0.6). CONCLUSIONS: Neurological symptoms are common in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and from the large number of cases reported from all over the world daily, the prevalence of neurological features might increase again. Identifying some neurological manifestations like smell and taste disturbances can be used to screen patients with COVID-19 so that early identification and isolation is possible.","Favas, T T; Dev, Priya; Chaurasia, Rameshwar Nath; Chakravarty, Kamlesh; Mishra, Rahul; Joshi, Deepika; Mishra, Vijay Nath; Kumar, Anand; Singh, Varun Kumar; Pandey, Manoj; Pathak, Abhishek",Neurol Sci,,185

METHODS: All consecutive patients with confirmed RT-PCR testing from April to June 2020 were invited to participate in this study for the assessment of long COVID. Demographic and clinical characteristics and self-reported acute and persistent symptoms were assessed using a standardized detailed questionnaire administered at enrollment and at repeated phone interviews in the period 22 th April to Aug 16 th. RESULTS: Of the 180 participants (96.3% of the 187 eligible COVID-19 patients), 53.1% reported persistence of at least one symptom after a mean of 125 days after symptoms onset, 33.3% reported one or two symptoms and 19.4% three or more symptoms. At the last follow-up, 46.7% were asymptomatic compared with 4.4 % during the acute phase. The most prevalent persistent symptoms were fatigue, loss of smell and taste, and arthralgias.

436384,Effect of antiplatelet treatments on patients with COVID-19 infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"CD8+ T cells responding to chronic infections or tumors acquire an 'exhausted' state associated with elevated expression of inhibitory receptors, including PD-1, and impaired cytokine production. Exhausted T cells are continuously replenished by T cells with precursor characteristics that self-renew and depend on the transcription factor TCF1; however, their developmental requirements are poorly understood. In the present study, we demonstrate that high antigen load promoted the differentiation of precursor T cells, which acquired hallmarks of exhaustion within days of infection, whereas early effector cells retained polyfunctional features. Early precursor T cells showed epigenetic imprinting characteristic of T cell receptor-dependent transcription factor binding and were restricted to the generation of cells displaying exhaustion characteristics. Transcription factors BACH2 and BATF were key regulators with opposing functions in the generation of early precursor T cells. Overall, we demonstrate that exhaustion manifests first in TCF1+ precursor T cells and is propagated subsequently to the pool of antigen-specific T cells.","Utzschneider, Daniel T; Gabriel, Sarah S; Chisanga, David; Gloury, Renee; Gubser, Patrick M; Vasanthakumar, Ajithkumar; Shi, Wei; Kallies, Axel",,,185

How can collectives be considered ""immune""? Over the course of more than a century of use of the term, scientists have developed many different understandings of the concept in response to this inherent tension. Originating among veterinary scientists in the United States in the late 19th century, the concept was adopted by British scientists researching human infectious disease by the early 1920s. It soon became a staple concept for epidemiologists interested in disease ecology, helping to articulate the population dynamics of diseases such as diphtheria and inï¬uenza. Finally, though more traditional understandings of the concept remained in scientiï¬c use, in the era after World War II, it increasingly came to signal the objective and outcome of mass vaccination. Recognizing the complexity of scientiï¬c efforts to resolve the paradox of herd immunity may help us consider the best distribution of immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).(Am J Public Health.

We focus on the spread of the infection in care homes for older people occured in the first wave (February-May 2020) of the pandemic and the consequent huge amount of deaths occurred in such structures. The aim is to investigate the different capacity of European governments to prevent these facts and provide the residents in these structures with adequate protection. The testing strategies adopted for care homes in five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Italy, Spain and England) are therefore compared. The main hypothesis is that countries have initially relied on very limited knowledge on the spread of the virus in care homes, and that only an accurate testing strategy could allow an effective protection strategy. Comparing the countries, we found out that in some countries (England, Italy and Spain) testing in care homes has been strongly delayed and limited, paving the way for a weakened capacity to protect the residents and to limit the death toll. The paper finally shows that levels of knowledge and information about the impact of the pandemic on care homes are associated with different degrees of institutionalization and public legitimation of the care home system across countries. © 2021 Societa Editrice il Mulino.

447212,Recovery of Left Ventricular Dysfunction in Hospitalized Patients with Covid-19,2021,"Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system for cardiovascular studies. Recently, optogenetic pacing tools have been developed to control Drosophila heart rhythm noninvasively with blue light, which has a limited penetration depth. Here we developed both a red-light sensitive opsin expressing Drosophila system and an integrated red-light stimulation and optical coherence microscopy (OCM) imaging system. We demonstrated noninvasive control of Drosophila cardiac rhythms using a single light source, including simulated tachycardia in ReaChR-expressing flies and bradycardia and cardiac arrest in halorhodopsin (NpHR)-expressing flies at multiple developmental stages. By using red excitation light, we were able to pace flies at higher efficiency and with lower power than with equivalent blue light excitation systems. The recovery dynamics after red-light stimulation of NpHR flies were observed and quantified. The combination of red-light stimulation, OCM imaging, and transgenic Drosophila systems provides a promising and easily manipulated research platform for noninvasive cardiac optogenetic studies.","Men, Jing; Li, Airong; Jerwick, Jason; Li, Zilong; Tanzi, Rudolph E; Zhou, Chao",Commun Biol,,185
447363,Association between right ventricular dysfunction and mortality in COVID-19 patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its health, economic and social aftermath has currently overshadowed every other health concern throughout the world. There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues. In this article we aim to examine and reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB) another scourge which has long been the world's leading infectious killer. There are potentially grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries like India where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped. TB control programmes are likely to be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus. This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, for instance symptoms like cough and fever. Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19. Women with TB in India are a vulnerable group as gender disparities play a significant role in how men and women access healthcare in the public and private sectors. They are especially likely to suffer as part of the ""collateral damage"" and also experience the impact of the double stigma disproportionately. In this paper the researchers examine the impact of Covid 19 on women seeking TB care in India.","Suresh, Rajani; Ruban, S; Kumar, Saurabh",Health Care Women Int,,185

METHODS: This study evaluated the MedMinder ""Jon"", an electronic and cellular-enabled pillbox that provides real-time monitoring to remotely manage take-home doses of methadone using a 12-week, within-subject, Phase II (NCT03254043) trial. We transitioned all participants from liquid to tablet methadone one week prior to randomization. Participants completed both treatment-as-usual and electronic pillbox conditions before choosing a condition in a final ""choice phase"". We assessed feasibility, satisfaction, and safety outcomes during the exit interview. RESULTS: Overall, we randomized 25 participants, 24 (96.0%) completed >1 study session, and 21 (84.0%) completed the exit interview. We dispensed 167.92 g (1,974 doses) of methadone. Participants would use the pillbox again (86.3%) and recommend it to others (95.4%). Overall, 52.4% selected the pillbox in the choice condition and those who did not cited issues related to study requirements. Less than 1% of pillbox alerts were for medication being consumed outside the dosing window and we observed no evidence of actual or attempted methadone diversion. DISCUSSION: We were able to adequately manage patients who would not otherwise qualify for large quantities of take-home methadone when we dispensed methadone tablets via a secure pillbox. The integration of a commercially available pillbox into routine clinic operations increases opportunity for dispensing medication. Our data support remote monitoring of methadone take-home doses and may inform clinic practices related to Covid-19.","Dunn, Kelly E; Brooner, Robert K; Stoller, Kenneth B",J Subst Abuse Treat,,185
449077,South west experience of continuous positive airway pressure non-invasive ventilation for covid-19,2021,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) management frequently comprises conservative treatment, including a combination of topical and oral corticosteroids (OCSs). However, in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, providers may have been reluctant to prescribe OCSs out of possible concern for an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing more severe COVID-19 symptoms. This study thus sought to explore the association between the use of OCSs and the development of COVID-19 in patients with CRS. We found no statistically significant difference in the rates of patients with a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 who underwent an OCS treatment regimen compared to those who did not, both within 28 days (P = .389) and 14 days (P = .676) prior to the COVID-19 test. Given OCSs are often a major component of medical management of CRS, this study proves helpful in counseling patients on risks of steroid use in CRS treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Miller, Lauren E; Bhattacharyya, Neil",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,,185

Prompting our advocacy should be the understanding that our collective ability to rebound from such crises may ultimately hinge on protecting and equipping our most vulnerable racial-ethnic minority groups and any susceptible individuals within those populations. If proven effective, recent historic firsts by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Office of Minority Health (OMH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in response to COVID-19 should be championed for permanency within policy, practice and funding. In addition, given the complex history of Black Americans in this country and persistent and substantial Black-white disparities on health and economic measures across the board, some kind of reparations for this group may serve as a logical starting point for further advocacy. Nevertheless, we remain supportive allies of all organizations concerned with communities who suffer the weight of this pandemic and any future world health disasters.

450905,Characteristics and Risk Factors Associated With Mortality in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2021,"Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may affect many organs and may be responsible for numerous complications including cardiovascular problems. Methods: We analysed consecutive patients (n = 51) admitted to the cardiology department between 1st October 2020 and 31st January 2021 due to symptoms which might have reflected cardiovascular complications following COVID-19. We collected data concerning clinical characteristics, results of laboratory tests, echocardiography and 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording. Results: The post-COVID-19 complications appeared 1–4 months after disease recovery. Severe cardiovascular complications were observed in 27.5% of hospitalized patients. In comparison to those with mild complications, patients with severe complications had significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (36 vs. 8%;p = 0.01), decrease in ejection fraction (36% vs. 0%, p &lt; 0.001), higher resting heart rate at admission (85 vs. 72 bpm;p &lt; 0.001), and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = 0.02) and troponin T (17.9 vs. 4.2 pg/ml;p = 0.01). Dyspnoea and exercise intolerance were also more frequent in patients with severe complications. Conclusions: Diabetes, elevated level of CRP and troponin, heart rate variability parameters and worsening of left ventricular ejection fraction are related to the severity of cardiovascular complications following COVID-19 infection.

Infectivity and outcome among cancer patients staying in large congregations are not known. We conducted this study to address this lacuna in literature. Methods This was a retrospective-prospective, observational study of hospitalized cancer patients with proven COVID-19 infection, conducted at tertiary care hospital in New Delhi after ethical approval. We analyzed clinical, laboratorial parameters, and outcomes in these patients. Results All 32 admitted male patients became COVID-19 positive and 10 (31%) patients were symptomatic. Median age was 37.5 years (range: 16-64). Sixteen health-care workers (HCWs) were working in the cancer ward (paramedical staff: 4, nurses: 6, residents: 4, and consultants: 2). Among HCWs, two nursing staff and three paramedical staff contracted asymptomatic COVID-19. Eighteen (56%) and 14 (44%) patients were on curative and palliative treatment, respectively. Leukopenia (total leukocyte count &lt;4,000/μL) was seen in 37.5% of cases. Grades 4, 3, 2, and 1 neutropenia were present in 12.5% of patents. Two (6.25%) patients had features of critical COVID-19. Eight (25%) patients received treatment with hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin. Five patients died. Three patients had features of progressive disease with poor performance status. One critical COVID patient survived and one succumbed to COVID-19. Patients shared a common dining room, sanitation area. Conclusion Seventy percent of cancer patients were asymptomatic. Cancer patients living in congregation areas are susceptible to COVID-19 with 3% mortality rate.

RESULTS: Following cesarean section, the neonate was kept in strict isolation. Molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 on respiratory samples, blood, and meconium were initially negative, but positive on a nasopharyngeal aspirate on the third day of life. On day 5, the neonate developed fever and coryza, which spontaneously resolved. Viral genomic analysis from the mother and neonate showed identical sequences except for 1 nucleotide.

Previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) have shown a harmful effect on endocrine function. Notably, the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor, which is the entry route of coronaviruses to the host cell, is widely expressed in the endocrine organs including testis, endocrine pancreas, thyroid, and adrenal, and pituitary glands. Clinical and biochemical manifestations have been recorded in COVID-19 patients resulting in changes in endocrine activities, which were also recorded during the SARS outbreak in 2003.

This paper aims to provide safe distance recommendations among individuals and minimize the spread of COVID-19, as well as examine the efficacy of face coverings as a tool to slow the spread of respiratory droplets. These studies are conducted using computational fluid dynamics analyses, where the infected person breathes, coughs, and sneezes at various distances and environmental wind conditions and while wearing a face-covering (mask or face shield). In cases where there were no wind conditions, the breathing and coughing simulations display 1-2 m physical distancing to be effective. However, when sneezing was introduced, the physical distancing recommendation of 2 m was deemed not effective;instead, a distance of 2.8 m and greater was found to be more effective in reducing the exposure to respiratory droplets. The evaluation of environmental wind conditions necessitated an increase in physical distancing measures in all cases. The case where breathing was measured with a gentle breeze resulted in a physical distancing recommendation of 1.1 m, while coughing caused a change from the previous recommendation of 2 m to a distance of 4.5 m or greater. Sneezing in the presence of a gentle breeze was deemed to be the most impactful, with a recommendation for physical distancing of 5.8 m or more. It was determined that face coverings can potentially provide protection to an uninfected person in static air conditions.

This study aimed to explore how COVID-19 is affecting the health-related quality of life (QoL) among Chinese adults. METHODS: The data of health-related behaviors and QoL were collected via online surveys from 2289 adults (mean age = 27.8 ± 12 years) who had been isolated at home for an average of 77 days. RESULTS: More than 50% of the respondents reported that their time engaged in daily physical activity (PA) decreased, while sedentary behavior (SB) time increased compared with that before the lockdown. Only 20% of the respondents reported engaging in moderate-to-vigorous PA, 23% of adults reported changed their diets to be healthier, and 30% reported consuming more vegetables, fruits, and milk products than before home-isolation. During home-isolation, 75.2% of the adults rated their sleep quality as very good, and 65% reported that they were satisfied with their QoL. Sleep quality mediated the relationship between PA and QoL. CONCLUSION: The two-to-three-month home-isolation has had mixed effects on adult health behaviors in China. The participants were found to have focused more on their eating quality and patterns, which had a positive influence on their QoL. However, people should be encouraged to exercise at home with limited space to maintain a generally healthy lifestyle during a prolonged quarantine.","Wang, Xiuqiang; Lei, Si Man; Le, Shenglong; Yang, Yanxiang; Zhang, Boyi; Yao, Wu; Gao, Zan; Cheng, Sulin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,185

467243,"Clinical characteristics, treatment and outcomes of paediatric COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2021,"Internet of Things (IoT) devices are becoming ubiquitous in our lives, with applications spanning from the consumer domain to commercial and industrial systems. The steep growth and vast adoption of IoT devices reinforce the importance of sound and robust cybersecurity practices during the device development life-cycles. IoT-related vulnerabilities, if successfully exploited can affect, not only the device itself, but also the application field in which the IoT device operates. Evidently, identifying and addressing every single vulnerability is an arduous, if not impossible, task. Attack taxonomies can assist in classifying attacks and their corresponding vulnerabilities. Security countermeasures and best practices can then be leveraged to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities before they emerge into catastrophic attacks and ensure overall secure IoT operation. Therefore, in this paper, we provide an attack taxonomy which takes into consideration the different layers of IoT stack, i.e., device, infrastructure, communication, and service, and each layer's designated characteristics which can be exploited by adversaries. Furthermore, using nine real-world cybersecurity incidents, that had targeted IoT devices deployed in the consumer, commercial, and industrial sectors, we describe the IoT-related vulnerabilities, exploitation procedures, attacks, impacts, and potential mitigation mechanisms and protection strategies. These (and many other) incidents highlight the underlying security concerns of IoT systems and demonstrate the potential attack impacts of such connected ecosystems, while the proposed taxonomy provides a systematic procedure to categorize attacks based on the affected layer and corresponding impact.","Xenofontos, Christos; Zografopoulos, Ioannis; Konstantinou, Charalambos; Jolfaei, Alireza; Khan, Muhammad Khurram; Choo, Kim-Kwang Raymond",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.06612v1.pdf,185

Adjuvants are critical components of both subunit and certain inactivated vaccines because they induce specific immune responses that are more robust and long-lasting. A review of the history of coronavirus vaccine development demonstrates that only a few adjuvants, including aluminum salts, emulsions, and TLR agonists, have been formulated for the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and currently the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in experimental and pre-clinical studies. However, there is still a lack of evidence regarding the effects of the adjuvants tested in coronavirus vaccines.

468456,"Development and validation of prediction models for mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy, and readmission in COVID-19 patients",2021,"CONTEXT: Training and assessment of the abdominal and trunk muscles are widely used in the clinical setting. However, it is unknown what types of exercises are most effective in activation of both the global and local stabilizers in these regions. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to establish the reliability of a novel clinical screening tool (sling screen) to assess the muscles of the abdomen and trunk. The second aim was to use the clinical screening tool and musculoskeletal ultrasound to compare the effects of a rotary-based exercise program that targets both the global and local muscles to the effects of a traditional exercise program on the activation of the abdominal and trunk muscles. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Sports medicine facility. PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Thirty-one healthy participants were randomly allocated to receive a single-session rotary-based or traditional ""core"" exercise program. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The participants were assessed at the baseline and immediately postintervention. The primary outcome measures were muscle thickness examined by musculoskeletal ultrasound and clinical examination of muscle activation using a screening tool. The data were collected by blind assessors. Reliability and validity of a clinical screening tool (sling screen) were also assessed. RESULTS: The analysis of the covariance tests showed a significant increase in oblique thickness for the rotary exercise group. All participants displayed a significant increase in multifidus thickness. The Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed a significant increase in clinical assessment scores in the rotary exercise group but not the traditional exercise group. Reliability of the sling screen ranged from moderate to good. CONCLUSION: This clinical trial provides evidence that a rotary-based exercise program may be more effective in producing increases in oblique muscle thickness than traditional ""core"" exercises in young, healthy adults. The sling screen tool was able to identify these muscle thickness changes. Future studies should investigate how these results correlate to injury risk, other populations, and also how to implement the sling screen into clinical practice.","Catania, Brian; Ross, Travis; Sandella, Bradley; Bley, Bradley; DiTrani Lobacz, Andrea",J Sport Rehabil,,185

471073,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: Furnishing experiences from India,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The potential impact of coronary atherosclerosis, as detected by coronary artery calcium, on clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients remains unsettled. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinical and subclinical coronary artery disease (CAD), as assessed by coronary artery calcium score (CAC), in a large, unselected population of hospitalized COVID-19 patients undergoing non-gated chest computed tomography (CT) for clinical practice. METHODS: SARS-CoV 2 positive patients from the multicenter (16 Italian hospitals), retrospective observational SCORE COVID-19 (calcium score for COVID-19 Risk Evaluation) registry were stratified in three groups: (a) ""clinical CAD"" (prior revascularization history), (b) ""subclinical CAD"" (CAC >0), (c) ""No CAD"" (CAC = 0). Primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the secondary endpoint was a composite of myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accident (MI/CVA). RESULTS: Amongst 1625 patients (male 67.2%, median age 69 [interquartile range 58-77] years), 31%, 57.8% and 11.1% had no, subclinical and clinical CAD, respectively. Increasing rates of in-hospital mortality (11.3% vs. 27.3% vs. 39.8%, p < 0.001) and MI/CVA events (2.3% vs. 3.8% vs. 11.9%, p < 0.001) were observed for patients with no CAD vs. subclinical CAD vs clinical CAD, respectively. The association with in-hospital mortality was independent of in-study outcome predictors (age, peripheral artery disease, active cancer, hemoglobin, C-reactive protein, LDH, aerated lung volume): subclinical CAD vs. No CAD: adjusted hazard ratio (adj-HR) 2.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-7.17, p=0.025); clinical CAD vs. No CAD: adj-HR 3.74 (95% CI 1.21-11.60, p=0.022). Among patients with subclinical CAD, increasing CAC burden was associated with higher rates of in-hospital mortality (20.5% vs. 27.9% vs. 38.7% for patients with CAC score thresholds&#8804;100, 101-400 and > 400, respectively, p < 0.001). The adj-HR per 50 points increase in CAC score 1.007 (95%CI 1.001-1.013, p=0.016). Cardiovascular risk factors were not independent predictors of in-hospital mortality when CAD presence and extent were taken into account. CONCLUSIONS: The presence and extent of CAD are associated with in-hospital mortality and MI/CVA among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease and they appear to be a better prognostic gauge as compared to a clinical cardiovascular risk assessment.","Scoccia, Alessandra; Gallone, Guglielmo; Cereda, Alberto; Palmisano, Anna; Vignale, Davide; Leone, Riccardo; Nicoletti, Valeria; Gnasso, Chiara; Monello, Alberto; Khokhar, Arif; Sticchi, Alessandro; Biagi, Andrea; Tacchetti, Carlo; Campo, Gianluca; Rapezzi, Claudio; Ponticelli, Francesco; Danzi, Gian Battista; Loffi, Marco; Pontone, Gianluca; Andreini, Daniele; Casella, Gianni; Iannopollo, Gianmarco; Ippolito, Davide; Bellani, Giacomo; Patelli, Gianluigi; Besana, Francesca; Costa, Claudia; Vignali, Luigi; Benatti, Giorgio; Iannaccone, Mario; Vaudano, Paolo Giacomo; Pacielli, Alberto; De Carlini, Caterina Chiara; Maggiolini, Stefano; Bonaffini, Pietro Andrea; Senni, Michele; Scarnecchia, Elisa; Anastasio, Fabio; Colombo, Antonio; Ferrari, Roberto; Esposito, Antonio; Giannini, Francesco; Toselli, Marco",Atherosclerosis,,185

Inspired by promising outcomes for convalescent plasma treatment, the development of antibody drugs (biologics) to block SARS-CoV-2 infection has been the focus of drug discovery, along with tremendous efforts in repurposing small-molecule drugs. In the past several months, experimentally, many human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were successfully extracted from plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients. Currently, several mAbs targeting the SARS-CoV-2's spike glycoprotein (S-protein) are in clinical trials. With known atomic structures of the mAb and S-protein complex, it becomes possible to investigate in silico the molecular mechanism of mAb's binding with S-protein and to design more potent mAbs through protein mutagenesis studies, complementary to existing experimental efforts. Leveraging today's superb computing power, we propose a fully automated in silico protocol for quickly identifying possible mutations in a mAb (e.g., CB6) to enhance its binding affinity for S-protein for the design of more efficacious therapeutic mAbs.","Luan, Binquan; Huynh, Tien",J Phys Chem Lett,,185

The focus is on the role of geographic spreaders defined here as a portion of the infected population ($\phi$) experiencing high mobility between identical communities. The spatial organization of the infected population and invasive front speeds ($c_{max}$) are determined when the infections are randomly initiated in space within multiple communities. For small but finite $\phi$, scaling analysis in 1-dimension and simulation results in 2-dimensions suggest that $c_{max}\sim (1-\phi) \gamma (R_o-1) \sigma$, where $\gamma$ is the inverse of the infectious duration, and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the spatial kernel describing mobility of long-distance spreaders across communities. Hence, $c_{max}$ is not significantly affected by the small $\phi$ though reductions in $\phi$ act as retardation factors to the attainment of $c_{max}$. The $\sigma$ determines the spatial organization of infections across communities. When $\sigma>5dr$ (long-distance mobility, where $dr$ is the minimum spatial extent defining adjacent communities), the infectious population will experience a transient but spatially coherent pattern with a wavelength that can be derived from the spreading kernel properties.","Li, Shuolin; Henriquez, Craig; Katul, Gabriel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10117v1.pdf,185
475645,Acute Covid-19 Pneumonia Unmasking a Large Left Atrial Myxoma,2021,"AIMS: Inhaled nebulised unfractionated heparin (UFH) has a strong scientific and biological rationale that warrants urgent investigation of its therapeutic potential in patients with COVID-19. UFH has antiviral effects and prevents the SARS-CoV-2 virus' entry into mammalian cells. In addition, UFH has significant anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant properties, which limit progression of lung injury and vascular pulmonary thrombosis. METHODS: The INHALEd nebulised unfractionated HEParin for the treatment of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (INHALE-HEP) metatrial is a prospective individual patient data analysis of on-going randomised controlled trials and early phase studies. Individual studies are being conducted in multiple countries. Participating studies randomise adult patients admitted to the hospital with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, who do not require immediate mechanical ventilation, to inhaled nebulised UFH or standard care. All studies collect a minimum core dataset. The primary outcome for the metatrial is intubation (or death, for patients who died before intubation) at day 28. The secondary outcomes are oxygenation, clinical worsening and mortality, assessed in time-to-event analyses. Individual studies may have additional outcomes. ANALYSIS: We use a Bayesian approach to monitoring, followed by analysing individual patient data, outcomes and adverse events. All analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle, considering all participants in the treatment group to which they were assigned, except for cases lost to follow-up or withdrawn. TRIAL REGISTRATION, ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The metatrial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT04635241. Each contributing study is individually registered and has received approval of the relevant ethics committee or institutional review board. Results of this study will be shared with the World Health Organisation, published in scientific journals and presented at scientific meetings.","van Haren, Frank M P; Richardson, Alice; Yoon, Hwan-Jin; Artigas, Antonio; Laffey, John G; Dixon, Barry; Smith, Roger; Vilaseca, Alicia B; Barbera, Ruben A; Ismail, Tarek I; Mahrous, Rabab S; Badr, Mohamed; De Nucci, Gilberto; Sverdloff, Carlos; van Loon, Lex M; Camprubi-Rimblas, Marta; Cosgrave, David W; Smoot, Thomas L; Staas, Sabrina; Sann, Khine; Sas, Caitlin; Belani, Anusha; Hillman, Christopher; Shute, Janis; Carroll, Mary; Wilkinson, Tom; Carroll, Miles; Singh, Dave; Page, Clive",,,185

The objective of this study was to describe characteristics, self-reported symptoms, and predictors of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in a community-based sample. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This was a cross-sectional nationwide survey of adults in the US conducted between April 24 through May 13, 2020. The survey targeted a representative sample of approximately 5,000 respondents. The rate of COVID-19 cases and testing, most frequently reported symptoms, symptom severity, treatment received, impact of COVID-19 on mental and physical health, and factors predictive of testing positive were assessed. Most of the 5,203 participants (85.6%) reported no COVID-19-like symptoms. Of the 747 (14.5%) participants reporting COVID-19-like symptoms, 367 (49.1%) obtained a diagnostic test. Eighty-nine participants (24.3%) reported a positive COVID-19 test result, representing 1.7% of the total sample. For those testing positive, the most common symptoms were dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing. Those who tested positive were more likely to report greater symptom severity versus those who tested negative. Severe dry cough, new loss of taste or smell, trouble waking up, living with someone experiencing symptoms, recent international travel, respiratory issues, and reporting ethnicity of Black or African American were predictive of testing positive. CONCLUSIONS: This study assessed the impact of COVID-19 using community-level self-reported data across the US during the peak of most stay at home' orders. Self-reported symptoms and risk factors identified in this study are consistent with the clinical profile emerging for COVID-19. In the absence of widespread testing, this study demonstrates the utility of a representative US community-based sample to provide direct-reported symptoms and outcomes to quickly identify high-risk individuals who are likely to test positive and should consider taking greater precautions.","Morlock, Robert; Morlock, Amy; Downen, Martha; Shah, Sonali N",PLoS One,,185

This study used longitudinal data to characterise effects on mental health and behaviour in a UK student sample, measuring sleep quality and diurnal preference, depression and anxiety symptoms, wellbeing and loneliness, and alcohol use. Self-report data was collected from 254 undergraduates (219 females) at a UK university at two-time points: autumn 2019 (baseline, pre-pandemic) and April/May 2020 (under 'lockdown' conditions). Longitudinal analyses showed a significant rise in depression symptoms and a reduction in wellbeing at lockdown. Over a third of the sample could be classed as clinically depressed at lockdown compared to 15% at baseline. Sleep quality was not affected across the sample as a whole. The increase in depression symptoms was highly correlated with worsened sleep quality. A reduction in alcohol use, and a significant shift towards an 'evening' diurnal preference, were also observed. Levels of worry surrounding contracting COVID-19 were high. Results highlight the urgent need for strategies to support young people's mental health: alleviating worries around contracting COVID, and supporting good sleep quality, could benefit young adults' mental health as the COVID-19 crisis unfolds.","Evans, Simon; Alkan, Erkan; Bhangoo, Jazmin K; Tenenbaum, Harriet; Ng-Knight, Terry",Psychiatry Res,,185

Despite the availability of different coronavirus vaccines, it is still recommended by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and local authorities to apply public safety measures including maintaining social distancing and wearing face masks. This includes individuals who have been fully vaccinated. Remarkable increase in scientific studies, along with manufacturing-related research and development investigations, have been performed in an attempt to provide better PPE solutions during the pandemic. Recent literature has estimated the filtration efficiency (FE) of face masks and respirators shedding the light on specific targeted parameters that investigators can measure, detect, evaluate, and provide reliable data with consistent results. This review showed the variability in testing protocols and FE evaluation methods of different face mask materials and/or brands. In addition to the safety requirements needed to perform aerosol viral filtration tests, one of the main challenges researchers currently face is the inability to simulate or mimic true aerosol filtration scenarios via laboratory experiments, field tests, and in vitro/in vivo investigations. Moreover, the FE through the mask can be influenced by different filtration mechanisms, environmental parameters, filtration material properties, number of layers used, packing density, fiber charge density, fiber diameter, aerosol type and particle size, aerosol face velocity and concentration loadings, and infectious concentrations generated due to different human activities. These parameters are not fully understood and constrain the design, production, efficacy, and efficiency of face masks.","Ogbuoji, Ebuka A.; Zaky, Amr M.; Escobar, Isabel C.",Polymers,,185

At the time of this study, the number of daily new cases in the United States was greater than that in any other country, and the trend was increasing in most states. Google Trends provides data regarding public interest in various topics during different periods. Analyzing these trends using data mining methods may provide useful insights and observations regarding the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to consider the predictive ability of different search terms not directly related to COVID-19 with regard to the increase of daily cases in the United States. In particular, we are concerned with searches related to dine-in restaurants and bars. Data were obtained from the Google Trends application programming interface and the COVID-19 Tracking Project. METHODS: To test the causation of one time series on another, we used the Granger causality test. We considered the causation of two different search query trends related to dine-in restaurants and bars on daily positive cases in the US states and territories with the 10 highest and 10 lowest numbers of daily new cases of COVID-19. In addition, we used Pearson correlations to measure the linear relationships between different trends. RESULTS: Our results showed that for states and territories with higher numbers of daily cases, the historical trends in search queries related to bars and restaurants, which mainly occurred after reopening, significantly affected the number of daily new cases on average. California, for example, showed the most searches for restaurants on June 7, 2020; this affected the number of new cases within two weeks after the peak, with a P value of .004 for the Granger causality test. CONCLUSIONS: Although a limited number of search queries were considered, Google search trends for restaurants and bars showed a significant effect on daily new cases in US states and territories with higher numbers of daily new cases. We showed that these influential search trends can be used to provide additional information for prediction tasks regarding new cases in each region.

GBM is characterized, in particular, by significant intratumor cell variability, high growth rates, and widespread invasiveness within the surrounding normal brain parenchyma. The present study aimed to examine the impact of the natural product Zerumbone, a promising sesquiterpenoid phytochemical from Zingiber zerumbet, on U-87 MG GBM cells and its underlying molecular mechanisms. At sub-lethal doses, Zerumbone exerted a concentration- and time-dependent suppression of cell migration ability utilizing scratch wound closure assay; it also inhibited GBM cells' invasion using Transwell invasion assay in a concentration-dependent fashion. The enzymatic activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/-9 and their protein expression has also been reduced by administration of Zerumbone. Furthermore, Zerumbone was revealed to downregulate the mRNA expression level of IL-1ß and MCP-1, two genes contributing to MMPs expression. We also found that Zerumbone exerted an inhibitory effect on the expression of Akt and total p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/Erk2) against U-87 MG cells. These findings collectively provide further proof for the possible molecular signaling basis of the antimetastatic effects of Zerumbone as a promising phytochemical, indicating a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of GBM through repression of migration, invasion, and metastasis.","Jalili-Nik, Mohammad; Afshari, Amir R; Sabri, Hamed; Bibak, Bahram; Mollazadeh, Hamid; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Biofactors,,185

To assess the impact of isolation measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output, we create a mathematical model to simulate the spread of COVID-19, incorporating effects of restrictive measures and segmenting the population based on health risk and economic vulnerability. Policymakers make isolation policy decisions based on current levels of disease spread and economic damage. For 76 weeks in a population of 330 million, we simulate a baseline scenario leaving strong isolation restrictions in place, rapidly reducing isolation restrictions for non-seniors shortly after outbreak containment, and gradually relaxing isolation restrictions for non-seniors. We use 76 weeks as an approximation of the time at which a vaccine will be available. In the baseline scenario, there are 235,724 deaths and the economy shrinks by 34.0%. With a rapid relaxation, a second outbreak takes place, with 525,558 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 32.3%. With a gradual relaxation, there are 262,917 deaths, and the economy shrinks by 29.8%. We also show that hospitalizations, deaths, and economic output are quite sensitive to disease spread by asymptomatic people. Strict restrictions on seniors with very gradual lifting of isolation for non-seniors results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. Therefore, we recommend this strategy and measures that reduce non-isolated disease spread to control the pandemic while making isolation economically viable.","Goldsztejn, Uri; Schwartzman, David; Nehorai, Arye",PLoS One,,185

This study evaluated whether chronic marijuana (MJ) use contributes to additional cognitive deficits or brain microstructural abnormalities that may reflect neuroinflammation or neuronal injury in HIV+. METHOD: Using a 2 × 2 design, 44 HIV+ participants [23 minimal/no MJ users (HIV+), 21 chronic active MJ users (HIV + MJ)] were compared to 46 seronegative participants [24 minimal/no MJ users (SN) and 22 chronic MJ users (SN + MJ)] on neuropsychological performance (7 cognitive domains) and diffusion tensor imaging metrics, using an automated atlas to assess fractional anisotropy (FA), axial (AD), radial (RD), and mean (MD) diffusivities, in 18 cortical and 4 subcortical brain regions. RESULTS: Compared to SN and regardless of MJ use, the HIV+ group had lower FA and higher diffusivities in multiple white matter and subcortical structures (p < 0.001-0.050), as well as poorer cognition in Fluency (p = 0.039), Attention/Working Memory (p = 0.009), Learning (p = 0.014), and Memory (p = 0.028). Regardless of HIV serostatus, MJ users had lower AD in uncinate fasciculus (p = 0.024) but similar cognition as nonusers. HIV serostatus and MJ use showed an interactive effect on mean diffusivity in the right globus pallidus but not on cognitive function. Furthermore, lower FA in left anterior internal capsule predicted poorer Fluency across all participants and worse Attention/Working Memory in all except SN subjects, while higher diffusivities in several white matter tracts also predicted lower cognitive domain Z-scores. Lastly, MJ users with or without HIV infection showed greater than normal age-dependent FA declines in superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and globus pallidus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that, except in the globus pallidus, chronic MJ use had no additional negative influence on brain microstructure or neurocognitive deficits in HIV+ individuals. However, lower AD in the uncinate fasciculus of MJ users suggests axonal loss in this white matter tract that connects to cannabinoid receptor rich brain regions that are involved in verbal memory and emotion. Furthermore, the greater than normal age-dependent FA declines in the white matter tracts and globus pallidus in MJ users suggest that older chronic MJ users may eventually have lesser neuronal integrity in these brain regions.","Wang, Hannah A; Liang, Hua-Jun; Ernst, Thomas M; Oishi, Kenichi; Chang, Linda",J Neuroinflammation,,185
487896,Cytokine adsorption during ECMO for COVID-19-related ARDS,2021,"BACKGROUND: The aim of this systematic review is to summarize the best available evidence regarding individual risk factors, simple risk scores, and multivariate models that use patient characteristics, vital signs, comorbidities, and laboratory tests relevant to outpatient and primary care settings. METHODS: Medline, WHO COVID-19, and MedRxIV databases were searched; studies meeting inclusion criteria were reviewed in parallel, and variables describing study characteristics, study quality, and risk factor data were abstracted. Study quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognostic Studies tool. Random effects meta-analysis of relative risks (categorical variables) and unstandardized mean differences (continuous variables) was performed; multivariate models and clinical prediction rules were summarized qualitatively. RESULTS: A total of 551 studies were identified and 22 studies were included. The median or mean age ranged from 38 to 68 years. All studies included only inpatients, and mortality rates ranged from 3.2% to 50.5%. Individual risk factors most strongly associated with mortality included increased age, c-reactive protein (CRP), d-dimer, heart rate, respiratory rate, lactate dehydrogenase, and procalcitonin as well as decreased oxygen saturation, the presence of dyspnea, and comorbid coronary heart and chronic kidney disease. Independent predictors of adverse outcomes reported most frequently by multivariate models include increasing age, increased CRP, decreased lymphocyte count, increased lactate dehydrogenase, elevated temperature, and the presence of any comorbidity. Simple risk scores and multivariate models have been proposed but are often complex, and most have not been validated. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review identifies several risk factors for adverse outcomes in COVID-19-infected inpatients that are often available in the outpatient and primary care settings: increasing age, increased CRP or procalcitonin, decreased lymphocyte count, decreased oxygen saturation, dyspnea on presentation, and the presence of comorbidities. Future research to develop clinical prediction models and rules should include these predictors as part of their core data set to develop and validate pragmatic outpatient risk scores.","Bentivegna, Michelle; Hulme, Cassie; Ebell, Mark H",J Am Board Fam Med,,185

DAAs can decrease the production of viral progeny of hepatitis B virus (HBV), breaking the viral dynamic equilibrium between: (1) virion production from hepatocytes and clearance from circulation; (2) replenishment and decay of covalently closed circular (ccc)DNA pool inside infected hepatocytes. Nucleos(t)ide analogues can potently shift the first balance to undetectable viremia in the blood, but have limited or no effect on the second one, thus making it imperative to develop new agents targeting additional step(s) of HBV life cycle. We herein briefly introduce the DAAs currently in development by classifying them as agents affecting the replenishment or the decay of cccDNA pool.","Huang, A L; Yuan, Z H; Nan, Y M; Yang, D L; Guo, J T; Li, W H",Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,,185

The potential dose-response effect of cardiac troponin (cTn) concentrations on adverse clinical outcomes has not been systematically studied. Hence, we will conduct a comprehensive dose-response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the relationship between elevated cTn concentrations and in-hospital adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We will search PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and ISI Knowledge via Web of Science databases, as well as preprint databases (medRxiv and bioRxiv), from inception to October 2021, to identify all retrospective and prospective cohorts and randomised controlled studies using related keywords. The primary outcome will be all-cause mortality during hospitalisation. The secondary outcome will be major adverse event (MAE). To conduct a dose-response meta-analysis of the potential linear or restricted cubic spline regression relationship between elevated cTn concentrations and all-cause mortality or MAE, studies with three or more categories of cTn concentrations will be included. Univariable or multivariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses will be conducted to compare elevated and non-elevated categories of cTn concentration. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the robustness of our results by removing each included study at one time to obtain and evaluate the remaining overall estimates of all-cause mortality or MAE. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: In accordance with the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee of Fuwai Hospital, ethical approval was waived for this systematic review protocol. This meta-analysis will be disseminated through a peer-reviewing process for journal publication and conference communication.

493955,Should we consider heparin prophylaxis in COVID-19 patients? a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND: Information about social mixing patterns under heavy social distancing is needed to model the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission. METHODS: We conducted a survey on daily person-to-person contacts during the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Finland, one month after strong social distancing measures had been introduced nationwide. We defined a contact as exchange of at least a few words in proximity of another person. We also considered physical (""skin-to-skin"") contacts separately. Based on 3,171 reported contacts by 1,320 participants of 1-79 years of age, we estimated age-stratified contact matrices essential in modeling virus transmission. RESULTS: Compared with contacts during prepandemic conditions, as learned from the Finnish part of the Polymod study, there was a 72% (95% credible interval, CI = 71, 74) reduction in the daily number of all contacts and a 69% (95% CI = 66, 73) reduction in the daily number of physical contacts in April 2020. The largest reduction, of almost 90%, occurred in physical contacts by individuals more than 70 years of age. The estimated reduction in the transmission potential of the virus attributable solely to reduced contact frequencies varied between 59% (whole population; physical contacts; 95% CI = 52, 68) and 77% (over 20-year olds; physical contacts; 95% CI = 70, 89). CONCLUSIONS: We surmise that the large reduction in the daily numbers of social contacts in the early part of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Finland was likely a major contributor to the steady decline of the epidemic in the country since early April.","Auranen, Kari; Shubin, Mikhail; Karhunen, Markku; Sivelä, Jonas; Leino, Tuija; Nurhonen, Markku",Epidemiology,,185

We aimed to define the risk of acute stroke in patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19. METHODS: We performed an observational, multicenter cohort study in four participating hospitals in Saxony, Germany to characterize consecutive patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who experienced acute stroke during hospitalization. Furthermore, we conducted a systematic review using PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and bibliographies of identified papers following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines including data from observational studies of acute stroke in COVID-19 patients. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers and pooled with multicenter data to calculate risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for acute stroke related to COVID-19 severity using a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews registration number: CRD42020187194. RESULTS: Of 165 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (49.1% males, median age = 67 years [57-79 years], 72.1% severe or critical) included in the multicenter study, overall stroke rate was 4.2% (95% CI: 1.9-8.7). Systematic literature search identified two observational studies involving 576 patients that were eligible for meta-analysis. Amongst 741 pooled COVID-19 patients, overall stroke rate was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.9-4.5). Risk of acute stroke was increased for patients with severe compared to non-severe COVID-19 (RR = 4.18, 95% CI: 1.7-10.25; P = 0.002) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Synthesized analysis of data from our multicenter study and previously published cohorts indicates that severity of COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of acute stroke.","Siepmann, T; Sedghi, A; Simon, E; Winzer, S; Barlinn, J; de With, K; Mirow, L; Wolz, M; Gruenewald, T; Schroettner, P; von Bonin, S; Pallesen, L-P; Rosengarten, B; Schubert, J; Lohmann, T; Machetanz, J; Spieth, P; Koch, T; Bornstein, S; Reichmann, H; Puetz, V; Barlinn, K",Eur. j. neurol,,185

AIMS: The objective of the study is to identify factors associated with dropout from a pediatric lifestyle modification weight control program at different phases. METHODS: Data on overweight and obese participants (n = 242) aged 11-18 years in the Intervention for Childhood and Adolescent Obesity via Activity and Nutrition (ICAAN) study were collected at baseline, 6-months, and 24-months through self-report and a laboratory test. Logistic regression analysis was performed for those who dropped out during the first 6-months, and multivariate generalized estimating equation analysis identified longitudinal factors associated with those who dropped out after 24 months. RESULTS: Lower family functioning (OR = 2.30, 95% CI [1.18-4.46]), exercise group (OR = 0.36, 95% CI [0.15-0.86]), lower initial attendance rate (OR = 6.09, 95% CI [2.94-12.6]), and non-self -referral pathways (OR = 2.35, 95% CI [1.05-5.27]) were significantly associated with 6-month dropouts. For late dropout, lower family functioning (OR = 1.71, 95% CI [1.06-2.77]) and lower initial attendance rates (OR = 2.06, 95% CI [1.12-3.81]) remained significant. CONCLUSION: Family function and initial attendance rate were associated with lower dropout rates. Developing a supportive family environment and focusing on the early-stage factors at the intervention's outset may reduce overall dropout rates in obesity prevention intervention.","Park, Jane; Woo, Sarah; Ju, Young-Su; Seo, Young-Gyun; Lim, Hyun-Jung; Kim, Yoon-Myung; Noh, Hye-Mi; Lee, Hye-Ja; Park, Sang Ick; Park, Kyung Hee",,,185

Nomadic theatre is described here as a situated practice, wherein nomadism is a kind of site-specific and even, one might add, site-sensitive practice, in the sense of performance and its spectatorship being attuned to the particularities of place.

METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted from February 20th to February 27, 2020 in China. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed by the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), respectively. RESULTS: In this study, 3,498 adolescents with depression were identified. Of them, the proportion of anxiety was 45.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=43.5%-46.8%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that being concerned about graduation (OR=1.25, P=0.002, 95% CI=1.09-1.43), sleep duration <6hr/day (OR=1.80, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.38-2.34), study duration >8hr/day (OR=1.21, P=0.02, 95% CI=1.03-1.42), and quantity of homework higher than before (OR=1.68, P<0.001, 95% CI=1.40-2.02) were positively associated with anxiety; the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at a provincial level of 100-999 (OR=0.70, P<0.001, 95% CI=0.59-0.83) and 1,000-9,999 (OR=0.69, P=0.001, 95% CI=0.55-0.87) were negatively related to anxiety in adolescents with depression. LIMITATIONS: Because this was a cross-sectional online study, the causality between variables and anxiety could not be examined among depressed adolescents. The use of self-reported scales may lead to an underestimation of the proportion of anxiety among adolescents with depression. CONCLUSIONS: The symptoms of anxiety were common in adolescents with depression during the COVID-19 outbreak. Timing screening and targeted interventions are necessary to mitigate the risks of mental illness of adolescents.","Liu, Rui; Chen, Xu; Qi, Han; Feng, Yuan; Xiao, Le; Yuan, Xiao-Fei; Li, Ya-Qiong; Huang, Huan-Huan; Pao, Christine; Zheng, Yi; Wang, Gang",J Affect Disord,,185

Brief Review",2020,"This study examined the social impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Bangkok slum residents and the initiatives of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to relieve negative impacts. A mixed-methods study was conducted based on the Social Impact framework. In June 2020, a cross-sectional survey was carried out among 900 participants from nine slums in different zones of Bangkok. In July 2020, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 slum residents and four CSOs to gain in-depth information on the social impact of COVID-19 and CSOs’ response. Out of 900 participants, 25.9% lost their jobs during the lockdown and 52.7% lost their income. The job and income loss increased the poverty rate within the participants from 51.6% to 91.7%. Participants limited their mobility and social activities during the lockdown. Stress was increased among 42.6% of all participants and the increased stress was associated with both income loss and self-quarantine. Due to financial constraints, a significant proportion of participants had to limit their food consumption and/or their consumption of nutritious but more expensive food. Almost one-tenth of the participants relied on donated food only. The majority of the participants (61.1%) could not access the income compensation scheme. COVID-19 forced Bangkok slums residents to live below the subsistence level in multiple ways with limited access to social protections. CSOs played an important role in relieving the suffering by providing food, survival kits, jobs, and access to COVID-19 test. Their agility, skills and knowledge about slums, and social capital enabled a rapid response to the crisis. Experienced local CSOs should be engaged as a bridge between urban slums and social protections. A holistic approach to combatting the COVID-19 crisis should be implemented. It is important to find the balance between preventing death from the virus and preventing suffering and death from an economic crisis.","Pongutta, Suladda Kantamaturapoj Kanang Phakdeesettakun Kannapon Phonsuk Payao",Heliyon,,185

This study sought to examine the gender and geographical representation of editors and editorial board members in medical education journals. METHODS: Information about individual editors and editorial board members of 10 medical education journals was retrieved from their websites in January 2021, including their gender and the country in which they were based. Countries were categorised according to World Bank Income Classification and World Bank Geographical Regions. We then calculated the Composite Editorial Board Diversity Score for each journal. FINDINGS: Of 488 editors and editorial board members, 283 (58.0%) were male, 452 (92.6%) were based in high-income countries and 322 (66.0%) were from the four countries with greatest representation (the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada). DISCUSSION: The composition of medical education journals' editorial leadership teams remains dominated by males and those from higher income and Western countries. Strikingly, little change has taken place since this was last examined 17 years ago despite the field becoming apparently more globalised. As medical education strives to become a more inclusive and diverse discipline, developing policies to create more globally representative editorial leadership teams should now be an urgent priority.","Yip, Sharon Wing Lam; Rashid, Mohammed Ahmed",Clin. teach,,185

In this retrospective study, COVID-19 patients treated in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 7 to Feb 8, 2020 with measurements of serum IL-6 levels within 1 week after admission were included. Data regarding demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory tests, complications and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Sixty-six patients included (31 females) were divided into normal group (serum IL-6 < 10pg/mL, n=35) and abnormal group (serum IL-6 &#8805; 10pg/mL, n=31). Compared with normal group, the incidences of critical cases (P<0.001), ARDS (P=0.001), acute cardiac injury (P=0.002), cardiac insufficiency (P=0.039), mechanical ventilation rate (P=0.002) and the mortality (P=0.021) were significantly increased in abnormal group. Serum IL-6 concentration was an independent predictor for a fatal outcome (P=0.04). The optimal cutoff value of serum IL-6 concentration for predicting fatal outcomes was 26.09 pg/mL (P < 0.001). In COVID-19, elevated serum IL-6 levels were associated with critical illness, usage of mechanical ventilation and complications including heart injury and ARDS, and could predict a fatal outcome. Early detection of serum IL-6 levels after admission would be necessary in COVID-19 patients.","Zhou, Jiali; He, Wenbo; Liang, Jingyu; Wang, Lang; Yu, Xiaomei; Bao, Mingwei; Liu, Huafen",Jpn. j. infect. dis,,185

505247,Clinical Course and Outcome of Critically Ill Clinical COVID-19 Pneumonia or Severe Acute Respiratory Illness,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Keeping Canadians safe requires a robust public health (PH) system. This is especially true when there is a PH emergency, like the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media, like Twitter and Facebook, is an important information channel because most people use the internet for their health information. The PH sector can use social media during emergency events for (1) PH messaging, (2) monitoring misinformation, and (3) responding to questions and concerns raised by the public. In this study, we ask: what is the Canadian PH risk communication response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of social media? METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will conduct a case study using content and sentiment analysis to examine how provinces and provincial PH leaders, and the Public Health Agency of Canada and national public heath leaders, engage with the public using social media during the first wave of the pandemic (1 January-3 September 2020). We will focus specifically on Twitter and Facebook. We will compare findings to a gold standard during the emergency with respect to message content. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Western University's research ethics boards confirmed that this study does not require research ethics board review as we are using social media data in the public domain.

506458,The association between subjective impact and the willingness to adopt healthy dietary habits after experiencing the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a cross-sectional study in China,2020,"Both coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and maternal mortality disproportionately affect minorities. However, direct viral infection is not the only way that the former can affect the latter. Most adverse maternal events that end in hospitals have their genesis upstream in communities. Hospitals often represent a last opportunity to reverse a process that begins at a remove in space and time. The COVID-19 pandemic did not create these upstream injuries, but it has brought them to national attention, exacerbated them, and highlighted the need for health care providers to move out of the footprint of their institutions. The breach between community events that seed morbidity and hospitals that attempt rescues has grown in recent years, as the gap between rich and poor has grown and as maternity services in minority communities have closed. COVID-19 has become yet another barrier. For example, professional organizations have recommended a reduced number of prenatal visits, and the platforms hospitals use to substitute for some of these visits are not helpful to people who either lack the technology or the safe space in which to have confidential conversations with providers. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities for departments of obstetrics and gynecology. Community-based organizations including legal professionals, health-home coordinators, and advocacy groups, surround almost every hospital, and can be willing partners with interested departments. COVID-19 has made it clearer than ever that it is time to step out of the footprint of our institutions, and to recognize that the need to find upstream opportunities to prevent downstream tragedies. KEY POINTS: · COVID-19 will exacerbate disparities in perinatal outcomes.. · The virus, per se, is not the pandemic's biggest threat to the health of minority women.. · The solution to maternal mortality cannot be found within the walls of hospitals..","Minkoff, Howard",Am. j. perinatol,,185

507029,Cardiac Injury and COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020,"BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The NASS spine fellowship directory is an established resource that provides applicants with access to important information about different fellowship programs. Additionally, some programs have created websites to provide information about their fellowship program. There has been limited research on the amount and breadth of information provided by these different resources. PURPOSE: To assess and compare the scope of information provided by the North American Spine Society (NASS) fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Web Content Accessibility Study PATIENT SAMPLE: There were no patient data used in this study. All reported data were accessed from public websites and the NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships). OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures were reported as the presence or lack thereof of 22 topics pertaining to the specifics of each individual spine fellowship program on both the NASS fellowship directory and individual fellowship program websites. METHODS: The NASS fellowship directory (August 2022 fellowships) and individual program websites were evaluated by two independent reviewers. Program websites were identified via Google search with a systematic protocol. Within each platform, the availability of various data were recorded. Twenty-four different data points were assessed for each program and were categorized into four main categories - general program information, fellow profiles, clinical roles, and non-clinical roles of the fellow. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences in the availability of specific data provided by the NASS fellowship directory and individual program websites. RESULTS: Seventy-four fellowship programs were identified. The NASS fellowship directory was more likely to provide information about the application process, a description of the program, fellow salary, faculty members, case descriptions, and research requirements (p<0.05). The program websites were more likely to provide information about current and previous fellows - including a list of current fellow(s), their education/training, and a list of the previous fellows and their job choice (p<0.05). Program websites were also more likely to discuss rotation schedules, clinic expectations, research opportunities, journal club, institutional meetings, sponsored national meetings, and current/previous research (p<0.05). However, certain information, including specific clinical responsibilities (e.g. rotation schedule, call expectations, clinic expectations) and the profiles of current and previous fellows, were not well represented on either platform. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in the type of information provided by the NASS fellowship directory and program websites. Furthermore, there were key pieces of information that were not well represented on either platform.","Gerlach, Erik B; Plantz, Mark A; Swiatek, Peter R; Arpey, Nicholas C; Cantrell, Colin K; Divi, Srikanth N; Patel, Alpesh A",Spine j,,185

SARS-CoV-2 is genetically similar to the bat beta-coronavirus genus, but the novel specie of this genus can infect humans. The most common clinical features of COVID-19 are fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue, expectoration, and dyspnea. The primary reported mortality rate was about 2-3% in China; however, it reached up to 10% among patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases. The primary epidemiological investigations showed a high prevalence of underlying cardiovascular diseases in more than 40% of infected patients. A high prevalence of hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes were reported among deceased patients in Italy. Previous experiments in different pandemic situations showed that the cardiovascular system has been affected in many ways. Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV reported that cardiovascular co-morbidities had a direct correlation with the risk of infection, the severity of disease, and the mortality rate. Therefore, brief and available protocols for controlling the negative effects of this novel respiratory infection on the cardiovascular system, especially in a high-risk populations with underlying cardiovascular conditions, is one of the most serious concerns among healthcare providers. Herein, we aimed to review the available data on the cardiac manifestation of COVID-19. Besides, we described useful maps for the better treatment of COVID-19 infection in patients with underlying cardiovascular conditions, as a high-risk group of patients.","Eslami, Pegah; Tabary, Mohammadreza; Dooghaie-Moghadam, Arash; Khaheshi, Isa",Acta Biomed,,185

The present study surveyed top problems experienced by adolescents and young adults (A/YAs) with ADHD during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify possible reasons for symptom escalation and potential targets for intervention. We also explored perceived benefits of the pandemic for A/YAs with ADHD. METHOD: At the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (April-June 2020), we administered self and parent ratings about current and pre-pandemic top problem severity and benefits of the pandemic to a sample of convenience (N = 134 A/YAs with ADHD participating in a prospective longitudinal study). RESULTS: The most common top problems reported in the sample were social isolation (parent-report: 26.7%; self-report: 41.5%), difficulties engaging in online learning (parent-report: 23.3%, self-report: 20.3%), motivation problems (parent-report: 27.9%), and boredom (self-report: 21.3%). According to parent (d = 0.98) and self-report (d = 1.33), these top problems were more severe during the pandemic than in prior months. Contrary to previous speculation, there was no evidence that pandemic-related changes mitigated ADHD severity. Multi-level models indicated that A/YAs with higher IQs experienced severer top problems exacerbations at the transition to the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: For A/YAs with ADHD, several risk factors for depression and school dropout were incurred during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. A/YAs with ADHD should be monitored for school disengagement and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommended interventions attend to reducing risk factors such as increasing social interaction, academic motivation, and behavioral activation among A/YAs with ADHD.","Sibley, Margaret H; Ortiz, Mercedes; Gaias, Larissa M; Reyes, Rosemary; Joshi, Mahima; Alexander, Dana; Graziano, Paulo",J Psychiatr Res,,185

Records and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of patients who had undergone isolated bilateral sagittal split osteotomy setback between January 1, 2013 and March 16, 2020 at a single institution were reviewed retrospectively. The primary outcome variable was upper airway volume dimension change, and the predictor variable was the magnitude of mandibular setback as measured by six different methods. Thirty-one patients were included in the study, with a mean mandibular setback ranging from 1.41 mm to 6.11 mm. None of the predictor variables showed an association with oropharyngeal (P = 0.54) or hypopharyngeal (P = 0.33) volume. Stepwise regression analysis failed to show any significant relationships. Similarly, there was no statistically significant association between any of the predictor variables and oropharyngeal (P = 0.44) or hypopharyngeal (P = 0.74) minimum axial area. The results showed that no correlation exists between the magnitude of mandibular setback and the amount of static airway dimensional changes; therefore, it may not be possible to predict whether obstructive sleep apnea will develop following mild to moderate mandibular setback based upon CBCT measurements.","Han, M D; Antonini, F; Borba, A M; Miloro, M",Int. j. oral maxillofac. surg,,185

517057,An interdisciplinary approach to the management of critically ill patients during covid-19 pandemic;an experience of a university hospital in England,2020,"BACKGROUND: Among older adults, poorer cognitive functioning has been associated with impairments in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). However, IADL impairments among older Hispanics/Latinos is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the relationships between cognition and risk for IADL impairment among diverse Hispanics/Latinos. METHODS: Participants included 6,292 community-dwelling adults from the Study of Latinos - Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging, an ancillary study of 45+ year-olds in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Cognitive data (learning, memory, executive functioning, processing speed, and a Global cognitive composite) were collected at Visit 1. IADL functioning was self-reported 7 years later, and treated as a categorical (i.e., risk) and continuous (i.e., degree) measures of impairment. Survey two-part models (mixture of logit and generalized linear model with Gaussian distribution) and ordered logistic regression tested the associations of cognitive performance (individual tests and composite z-score) with IADL impairment. Additionally, we investigated the moderating role of age, sex, and Hispanic/Latino background on the association between cognition and IADL impairment. RESULTS: Across all cognitive measures, poorer performance was associated with higher odds of IADL impairment 7 years later. Associations were generally stronger for the oldest group (70+ years) relative to the youngest group (50-59 years). Sex and Hispanic/Latino background did not modify the associations. Across the full sample, lower scores on learning, memory, and the Global cognitive composite were also associated with higher degree of IADL impairment. CONCLUSION: Across diverse Hispanics/Latinos, cognitive health is an important predictor of everyday functioning 7 years later, especially in older adulthood.","Stickel, Ariana M; Tarraf, Wassim; Wu, Benson; Marquine, Maria J; Vásquez, Priscilla M; Daviglus, Martha; Estrella, Mayra L; Perreira, Krista M; Gallo, Linda C; Lipton, Richard B; Isasi, Carmen R; Kaplan, Robert; Zeng, Donglin; Schneiderman, Neil; González, Hector M",J. alzheimers dis,,185

Our results are robust to individual characteristics including vaccinations, health insurance and individual fixed effects. Within the employed, we find significant differences in flu incidence by occupation (e.g., sales occupations show 40.5% higher probability of infection than farmers) and by industry (e.g., education, health and social services show 52.2% higher probability of infection than mining). Further, we show that the interaction between occupations and industries is important to understand contagion. Indeed, cross-industry differences in flu incidence cannot be fully explained by differences in the within-industry occupation structure. As a potential mechanism for contagion, we study how flu incidence varies with the extent of human contact interaction at work—with an occupation-industry-specific score that we construct based on O’NET occupational characteristics. We find that the higher the human contact at work, the greater are the odds of infection. Our results are larger in years of high aggregate flu incidence and robust to firm size, a number of jobs and hours worked.","Houštecká, Anna Koh Dongya Santaeulàlia-Llopis Raül",Journal of Public Economics,,185

Although most patients have mild symptoms such as fever, headache, cough, myalgia and anosmia, some develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to death in many cases. Human coronavirus (CoVs) were responsible for two previ-ous worldwide outbreaks: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). Several reports of these outbreaks demonstrated that these diseases affected the central nervous system (CNS).[1] Thus, for the current COVID-19 pandemic, a crucial question arises: does CNS affection at least partially explain the respiratory distress commonly found in these patients?","Machado-Curbelo, Calixto",MEDICC Rev,,185

We propose PhyMask, an all-textile sleep monitoring solution that is practical and comfortable for continuous use and that acquires all signals of interest to sleep solely using comfortable textile sensors placed on the head. We show that PhyMask can be used to accurately measure sleep stages and advanced sleep markers such as spindles and k-complexes robustly in the real-world setting. We validate PhyMask against polysomnography and show that it significantly outperforms two commercially-available sleep tracking wearables, Fitbit and Oura Ring.","Rostaminia, Soha; Homayounfar, S.

The quick and specific detection of the nucleic acid of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) remains a challenge within healthcare providers. Currently, quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the widely used method to detect the SARS-CoV-2 from the human clinical samples. RT-qPCR is expensive equipment and needs skilled personnel as well as lengthy detection time. RT-qPCR limitation needed an alternative healthcare technique to overcome with a fast and cheaper detection method. By applying the principles of CRISPR technology, several promising detection methods giving hope to the healthcare community. CRISPR-based detection methods include SHERLOCK-Covid, STOP-Covid, AIOD-CRISPR, and DETECTR platform. These methods have comparative advantages and drawbacks. Among these methods, AIOD-CRISPR and DETECTR are reasonably better diagnostic methods than the others if we compare the time taken for the test, the cost associated with each test, and their capability of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in the clinical samples. It may expect that the promising CRISPR-based methods would facilitate point-of-care (POC) applications in the CRISPR-built next-generation novel coronavirus diagnostics.","Rahman, Md Rashidur; Hossain, Md Amjad; Mozibullah, Md; Mujib, Fateh Al; Afrose, Afrina; Shahed-Al-Mahmud, Md; Apu, Md Aminul Islam",Biomed Pharmacother,,185

METHODS: Only confirmed COVID-19 cases who are Vietnamese and locally infected with available data on date of symptom onset and clearly defined window of possible SARS-CoV-2 exposure were included. We used three parametric forms with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method for Bayesian Inference to estimate incubation period for Vietnamese COVID-19 cases. Leave-one-out Information Criterion was used to assess the performance of three models. RESULTS: A total of 19 cases identified from 23 Jan 2020 to 13 April 2020 was included in our analysis. Average incubation periods estimated using different distribution model ranged from 6.0 days to 6.4 days with the Weibull distribution demonstrated the best fit to the data. The estimated mean of incubation period using Weibull distribution model was 6.4 days (95% credible interval (CrI): 4.89–8.5), standard deviation (SD) was 3.05 (95%CrI 3.05–5.30), median was 5.6, ranges from 1.35 to 13.04 days (2.5th to 97.5th percentiles). Extreme estimation of incubation periods is within 14 days from possible infection. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence for an average incubation period for COVID-19 of approximately 6.4 days. Our findings support existing guidelines for 14 days of quarantine of persons potentially exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Although for extreme cases, the quarantine period should be extended up to three weeks.","Bui, Long V.; Nguyen, Ha T.; Levine, Hagai; Nguyen, Ha N.; Nguyen, Thu-Anh; Nguyen, Thuy P.; Nguyen, Truong T.; Do, Toan T.

Numerous trials have demonstrated both the effectiveness as well as the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation in improving exercise capacity and quality of life, and in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, the current COVID-19 pandemic has led to closure of many cardiac rehabilitation centres in Europe resulting in many eligible patients unable to participate in the optimisation of secondary prevention and physical performance. This elicits an even louder call for alternatives such as cardiac telerehabilitation to maintain the delivery of the core components of cardiac rehabilitation to cardiovascular disease patients. The present call for action paper gives an update of recent cardiac telerehabilitation studies and provides a practical guide for the setup of a comprehensive cardiac telerehabilitation intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic. This set up could also be relevant to any cardiovascular disease patient not able to visit cardiac rehabilitation centres regularly after the COVID-19 pandemic ceases.","Scherrenberg, Martijn; Wilhelm, Matthias; Hansen, Dominique; Völler, Heinz; Cornelissen, Véronique; Frederix, Ines; Kemps, Hareld; Dendale, Paul",Eur J Prev Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1177/2047487320939671; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32615796/,185

However, the contribution of immigration to the diversity of the US health care professional (HCP) work force and its contribution to health care are poorly documented. OBJECTIVE: To examine the sociodemographic characteristics and workforce outcomes of non–US-born and US-born HCPs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used national US Census Bureau data on US-born and non–US-born HCPs from the American Community Survey between 2010 and 2018. Demographic characteristics and occupational data for physicians, advanced practice registered nurses, physician assistants, registered nurses, licensed practical nurses or licensed vocational nurses, and other HCPs were included for analysis. Data were analyzed between December 2020 and February 2021. EXPOSURES: Nativity status, defined as US-born HCP vs non–US-born HCP (further stratified by <10 years or ≥10 years of stay in the US). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Annual hours worked, proportion of work done at night, residence in medically underserved areas and populations, and work in skilled nursing/home health settings. Inverse probability weighting of 3 nativity status groups was carried out using logistic regression. F test statistics were used to test across-group differences. Data were weighted using American Community Survey sampling weights. RESULTS: Of a total of 657 455 HCPs analyzed (497 180 [75.5%] women; mean [SD] age, 43.7 [13.0] years; 518 317 [75.6%] White, 54 233 [10.8%] Black, and 60 680 [9.6%] Asian), non–US-born HCPs (105 331 in total) represented 17.3% (95% CI, 17.2%-17.4%) of HCPs between 2010 and 2018. They were older (mean [SD] age, 44.7 [11.6] years) and had more education (75 227 [70.1%] HCPs completed college) compared with US-born HCPs (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [13.3] years; 304 601 [55.2%] completed college). Nearly half of non–US-born HCPs (47 735 [43.0%]) were Asian. In major metropolitan areas, non–US-born HCPs represented 40% or more of all HCPs. Compared with US-born HCPs, non–US-born HCPs with less than 10 years and 10 or more years of stay worked 32.3 hours (95% CI, 19.2 to 45.4 hours) and 71.6 hours (95% CI, 65.1 to 78.2 hours) more per year, respectively. Compared with US-born HCPs, non–US-born HCPs were more likely to reside in areas with shortages of health care professionals (estimated percentage: <10 years, 75.3%; ≥10 years, 62.8% vs US-born, 8.3%) and work in home health settings (estimated percentage: <10 years, 17.5%; ≥10 years, 13.1% vs US-born, 12.8%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The contributions of non–US-born HCPs to US health care are substantial and vary by profession. Greater efforts should be made to streamline their immigration process and to harmonize training and licensure requirements.","Commodore-Mensah, Yvonne; DePriest, Kelli; Samuel, Laura J.; Hanson, Ginger; D’Aoust, Rita; Slade, Eric P.",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33914048/; https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.8396,185

The Ministry of Health decided to introduce Influenza to the list of diseases with epidemic potential. By April 2010, Togo was actively involved in influenza surveillance. This study aims to describe the implementation of ILI surveillance and results obtained from April 2010 to December 2012. METHODS: Two sites were selected based on their accessibility and affordability to patients, their adequate specimen storage capacity and transportation system. Patients with ILI presenting at sentinel sites were enrolled by trained medical staff based on the World Health Organization (WHO) case definitions. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples were collected and they were tested at the National Influenza Reference Laboratory using a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) validated real time RT-PCR protocol. Laboratory results and epidemiological data were reported weekly and shared with all sentinel sites, Ministry of Health, Division of Epidemiology, WHO and CDC/NAMRU-3. RESULTS: From April 2010 to December 2012, a total of 955 samples were collected with 52% of the study population aged between 0 and 4 years. Of the 955 samples, 236 (24.7%) tested positive for influenza viruses; with 136 (14.2%) positive for influenza A and 100 (10.5%) positive for influenza B. The highest influenza positive percentage (30%) was observed in 5–14 years old and patients aged 0–4 and >60 years had the lowest percentage (20%). Clinical symptoms such as cough and rhinorrhea were associated more with ILI patients who were positive for influenza type A than influenza type B. Influenza viruses circulated throughout the year with the positivity rate peaking around the months of January, May and again in October; corresponding respectively to the dry-dusty harmattan season and the long and then the short raining season. The pandemic A (H1N1) pdm09 was the predominantly circulating strain in 2010 while influenza B was the predominantly circulating strain in 2011. The seasonal A/H3N2 was observed throughout 2012 year.

The right eye had a large posterior AGV bleb with hypertropia and limitation of extraocular movement on downward gaze and uncontrolled intraocular pressure (IOP). An inferonasal AADI was performed uneventfully. At the 1-month postoperative visit, a small conjunctival erosion was noted over the ligature (6-0 vicryl) suture knot. However, there was no leak. Two weeks later, there was hypotony and a leak was noted at the site of the absorbed ligature. Immediate surgical repair was performed by re-ligature of the AADI tube with 8-0 vicryl and the ligature knot was placed under the scleral patch graft and the conjunctival defect was sutured. Early intervention helped in successfully healing the conjunctival erosion, reversal of the hypotony and well-controlled IOP.

596781,The add-on effect of Chinese herbal medicine on COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-07-11,"Background: The use of a touchless automated hand sanitizer dispenser may play a key role to reduce contagious diseases. The key problem of the conventional ultrasonic and infra-red-based dispensers is their malfunctioning due to the interference of sunlight, vehicle sound, etc. when deployed in busy public places. To overcome such limitations, this study introduced a laser-based sensing device to dispense sanitizer in an automated touchless process. Method: The dispensing system is based on an Arduino circuit breadboard where an ATmega328p microcontroller was pre-installed. To sense the proximity, a light-dependent resistor (LDR) is used where the laser light is to be blocked after the placement of human hands, hence produced a sharp decrease in the LDR sensor value. Once the LDR sensor value exceeds the lower threshold, the pump is actuated by the microcontroller, and the sanitizer dispenses through the nozzle. Results and discussion: A novel design and subsequent fabrication of a low-cost, touchless, automated sanitizer dispenser to be used in public places, was demonstrated. The overall performance of the manufactured device was analyzed based on the cost and power consumption, and environmental factors by deploying it in busy public places as well as in indoor environment in major cities in Bangladesh, and found to be more efficient and cost-effective compared to other dispensers available in the market. A comprehensive discussion on this unique design compared to the conventional ultrasonic and infra-red based dispensers, is presented to show its suitability over the commercial ones. The guidelines of the World Health Organization are followed for the preparation of sanitizer liquid. A clear demonstration of the circuitry connections is presented herein, which facilitates the interested individual to manufacture a cost-effective dispenser device in a relatively short time and use it accordingly. Conclusion: This study reveals that the LDR-based automated hand sanitizer dispenser system is a novel concept, and it is cost-effective compared to the conventional ones. The presented device is expected to play a key role in contactless hand disinfection in public places, and reduce the spread of infectious diseases in society.","Das, Arnab; Barua, Adittya; Mohimin, Md.

METHODS: A questionnaire was developed in four languages (English, Dutch, Italian, and Spanish). The questionnaire queried whether patients had been infected with COVID-19 and outcome of the infection. Risk factors for COVID-19 infection were collected. RESULTS: A total of 5200 sarcoidosis patients completed the questionnaire with 116 (2.23%) reporting infection and 18 (15.8%) required hospitalization. Increased hazard ratio (HR) for COVID-19 infection were seen for those with a COVID-19 infected roommate (HR=27.44, p<0.0001), health care provider (HR=2.4, p=0.0001), pulmonary sarcoidosis (HR=2.48, p=0.001), neurosarcoidosis (HR=2.02, p<0.01), or rituximab treatment (HR=5.40, p<0.0001). A higher rate of hospitalization was found for those with underlying heart disease (HR=3.19 (1.297-7.855), p<0.02). No other feature including race, other immunosuppressive agent, age, or underlying condition was associated with a significant increased risk for infection or more severe disease. CONCLUSION: The overall rate of COVID-19 was 2.23%, suggesting an increased rate of COVID-19 infection. However, when an analysis of the questionnaires of sarcoidosis and non-sarcoidosis patients was performed in one localized area over this time period, the rate of COVID-19 infection was similar in both groups. Sarcoidosis patients who cohabitated with COVID-19 infected individuals, worked in health care, had pulmonary or neurologic sarcoidosis, or were treated with rituximab had an increased risk for COVID-19 infection. No significant increased risk for hospitalization could be identified based on age, race, gender or any specific immunosuppressive treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The field study was carried out in the six Sherpa communities of Chenthang Township from September 2019 to August 2020. The WEPs and related local knowledge were collected through semistructured interviews and direct observations. The field work was performed with the assistance of local guides. During the field survey, we collected plant specimens based on the principle of one plant with one vernacular name. In this study, we utilised a use report (UR) and cultural importance index (CI) to evaluate the comprehensive utilization value of WEPs in the daily diet of Sherpa people. RESULTS: We interviewed 78 people individually who provided us with 1199 use reports. In total, we collected 84 WEPs belonging to 65 genera in 41 families. These species were identified as 78 distinct ethno-species by local people, and the vernacular name of each ethno-species was recorded. Then, these use reports were classified into six use categories. All these plants were native wild plants. In these plants, Arisaema utile, Sorbus cuspidata and Elaeagnus umbellata have been introduced into home gardens by local people. Following the description of the Sherpa people, we articulated a collection calendar for WEPs. The Sherpa collect WEPs throughout nearly the entire year, January and February being the exceptions. CONCLUSION: The collection calendar of wild edible plants reflects the wisdom of the Sherpa in terms of survival. The Sherpa cleverly survive the food shortage periods by harnessing the phenology of different species. In general, WEPs can provide the Sherpa with seasonal carbohydrates, nutrition, healthcare supplements and other products and services necessary for survival, which is likely why the Sherpa choose these plants.

Distrust in government and a lessened authority of science to determine facts have both been exacerbated by the polarization and disinformation enhanced by social media. These have impaired society’s willingness to comply with and persevere with social distancing, which has been the most powerful initial response to mitigate the pandemic. These preexisting weaknesses also threaten the future acceptance of vaccination and contact tracing, two other tools needed to combat epidemics. Medical ethicists might best help in this situation by promoting truth-telling, encouraging the rational adjudication of facts, providing transparent decision-making and advocating the virtue of cooperation to maximize the common good. Those interventions should be aimed at the social level. The same elements of emphasizing cooperation and beneficence also apply to the design of triage protocols for when resources are overwhelmed. A life-stages approach increases beneficence and reduces harms. Triage should be kept as simple and straightforward as reasonably possible to avoid unwieldly application during a pandemic.","Powell, Kevin; Meyers, Christopher",HEC Forum,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33587216/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10730-021-09445-9,185

S., and the political affiliation of state leaders may contribute to policies affecting the spread of the disease. This study examines the differences in COVID-19 infection, death, and testing by governor party affiliation across the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was conducted in December 2020 examining COVID-19 incidence, death, testing, and test positivity rates from March 15, 2020 through December 15, 2020. A Bayesian negative binomial model was fit to estimate the daily risk ratios and posterior intervals comparing rates by gubernatorial party affiliation. The analyses adjusted for state population density, rurality, Census region, age, race, ethnicity, poverty, number of physicians, obesity, cardiovascular disease, asthma, smoking, and presidential voting in 2020. RESULTS: From March 2020 to early June 2020, Republican-led states had lower COVID-19 incidence rates than Democratic-led states. On June 3, 2020, the association reversed, and Republican-led states had a higher incidence (risk ratio=1.10, 95% posterior interval=1.01, 1.18). This trend persisted through early December 2020. For death rates, Republican-led states had lower rates early in the pandemic but higher rates from July 4, 2020 (risk ratio=1.18, 95% posterior interval=1.02, 1.31) through mid-December 2020. Republican-led states had higher test positivity rates starting on May 30, 2020 (risk ratio=1.70, 95% posterior interval=1.66, 1.73) and lower testing rates by September 30, 2020 (risk ratio=0.95, 95% posterior interval=0.90, 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Gubernatorial party affiliation may drive policy decisions that impact COVID-19 infections and deaths across the U.S. Future policy decisions should be guided by public health considerations rather than by political ideology.","Neelon, Brian; Mutiso, Fedelis; Mueller, Noel T.; Pearce, John L.; Benjamin-Neelon, Sara E.",Am J Prev Med,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amepre.2021.01.034; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33775513/,185

Our results show that a small stem-loop structure adjacent to the cap-independent translation element in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of RCNMV RNA1 is required for − 1 PRF. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggested that this stem-loop regulates − 1 PRF via base-pairing with complementary sequences in a bulged stem-loop adjacent to the shifty site.

This study describes patient experiences with telemedicine for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. STUDY DESIGN: This is a mixed-methods study which includes a web-based or phone survey and in-depth phone interviews with patients who had telemedicine visits for contraception. RESULTS: A total of 169 patients had eligible telemedicine visits between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Of these, 86 (51%) responded to the survey, and 23 (14%) participated in the interviews. We found that 86% of survey respondents were very satisfied with the telemedicine visit, and 63% said it completely met their needs. A majority (73%) strongly agreed that these visits should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic, and half (51%) would be very likely to choose them over in-person visits. In-depth interviews highlighted the convenience of telemedicine, especially for those with work or parenting responsibilities. Although some patients had in-person visits after telehealth, many appreciated the counseling they received remotely, and found the subsequent in-person visits more efficient. Patients identified visits that do not require physical exams as ideal visits for telehealth, and some hoped that all or most of their future visits would be telehealth visits. Many patients (43%) expressed a preference for phone over video visits. CONCLUSIONS: Patients reported an overall positive experience with telemedicine visits for contraceptive counseling during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cytokines have become valuable diagnostic tools in many medical fields. The role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytokines is of unknown value to diagnose ACR and distinguish rejection from infection. We hypothesized that distinct cytokine patterns obtained by surveillance bronchoscopies during the first year after transplantation are associated with ACR and microbiologic findings. We retrospectively analyzed data from 319 patients undergoing lung transplantation at University Hospital Zurich from 1998 to 2016. We compared levels of IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ and TNF-α in 747 BAL samples with transbronchial biopsies (TBB) and microbiologic results from surveillance bronchoscopies. We aimed to define reference values that would allow distinction between four specific groups “ACR”, “infection”, “combined ACR and infection” and “no pathologic process”. No definitive pattern was identified. Given the overlap between groups, these four cytokines are not suitable diagnostic markers for ACR or infection after lung transplantation.","Speck, Nicole E.; Probst-Müller, Elisabeth; Haile, Sarah R.; Benden, Christian; Kohler, Malcolm; Huber, Lars C.; Robinson, Cécile A.",Cytokine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400641/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2019.154794; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043466619302236; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1043466619302236,185

The number of pediatric LT done during the lockdown period in 2020 was similar to that done in corresponding pre‐COVID period in 2019. The outcomes were of 100% survival, and none of recipients developed COVID. One potential donor was asymptomatic positive for COVID, responded well to conservative treatment, and was later accepted as a donor.

Evaluation of occupational hazard control use for COVID-19 prevention can identify inadequately protected workers and opportunities to improve use. CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health used data from the June 2020 SummerStyles survey to characterize required and voluntary use of COVID-19-related occupational hazard controls among U.S. non-health care workers. A survey-weighted regression model was used to estimate the association between employer provision of hazard controls and voluntary use, and stratum-specific adjusted risk differences (aRDs) among workers reporting household incomes <250% and ≥250% of national poverty thresholds were estimated to assess effect modification by income. Approximately one half (45.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 41.0%-50.3%) of non-health care workers reported use of hazard controls in the workplace, 55.5% (95% CI = 48.8%-62.2%) of whom reported employer requirements to use them. After adjustment for occupational group and proximity to others at work, voluntary use was approximately double, or 22.3 absolute percentage points higher, among workers who were provided hazard controls than among those who were not. This effect was more apparent among lower-income (aRD = 31.0%) than among higher-income workers (aRD = 16.3%).

609100,COVID-19 pneumonia: ARDS or not?,2020-04-16,"BACKGROUND: Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with a second-generation macrolide, are being widely used for treatment of COVID-19, despite no conclusive evidence of their benefit. Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19. METHODS: We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded. The main outcomes of interest were in-hospital mortality and the occurrence of de-novo ventricular arrhythmias (non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation). FINDINGS: 96 032 patients (mean age 53·8 years, 46·3% women) with COVID-19 were hospitalised during the study period and met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 888 patients were in the treatment groups (1868 received chloroquine, 3783 received chloroquine with a macrolide, 3016 received hydroxychloroquine, and 6221 received hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide) and 81 144 patients were in the control group. 10 698 (11·1%) patients died in hospital. After controlling for multiple confounding factors (age, sex, race or ethnicity, body-mass index, underlying cardiovascular disease and its risk factors, diabetes, underlying lung disease, smoking, immunosuppressed condition, and baseline disease severity), when compared with mortality in the control group (9·3%), hydroxychloroquine (18·0%; hazard ratio 1·335, 95% CI 1·223–1·457), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (23·8%; 1·447, 1·368–1·531), chloroquine (16·4%; 1·365, 1·218–1·531), and chloroquine with a macrolide (22·2%; 1·368, 1·273–1·469) were each independently associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Compared with the control group (0·3%), hydroxychloroquine (6·1%; 2·369, 1·935–2·900), hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide (8·1%; 5·106, 4·106–5·983), chloroquine (4·3%; 3·561, 2·760–4·596), and chloroquine with a macrolide (6·5%; 4·011, 3·344–4·812) were independently associated with an increased risk of de-novo ventricular arrhythmia during hospitalisation. INTERPRETATION: We were unable to confirm a benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, when used alone or with a macrolide, on in-hospital outcomes for COVID-19. Each of these drug regimens was associated with decreased in-hospital survival and an increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias when used for treatment of COVID-19.

At age 16 years, a booster dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) is recommended. Persons aged 16-23 years can receive serogroup B meningococcal vaccine (MenB), if determined to be appropriate through shared clinical decision-making. CDC analyzed data from the 2019 National Immunization Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen) to estimate vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 13-17 years in the United States.* Coverage with ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine increased from 68.1% in 2018 to 71.5% in 2019, and the percentage of adolescents who were up to date† with the HPV vaccination series (HPV UTD) increased from 51.1% in 2018 to 54.2% in 2019. Both HPV vaccination coverage measures improved among females and males. An increase in adolescent coverage with ≥1 dose of MenACWY (from 86.6% in 2018 to 88.9% in 2019) also was observed. Among adolescents aged 17 years, 53.7% received the booster dose of MenACWY in 2019, not statistically different from 50.8% in 2018; 21.8% received ≥1 dose of MenB, a 4.6 percentage point increase from 17.2% in 2018. Among adolescents living at or above the poverty level,§ those living outside a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)¶ had lower coverage with ≥1 dose of MenACWY and with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose, and a lower percentage were HPV UTD, compared with those living in MSA principal cities. In early 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic changed the way health care providers operate and provide routine and essential services. An examination of Vaccines for Children (VFC) provider ordering data showed that vaccine orders for HPV vaccine; tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap); and MenACWY decreased in mid-March when COVID-19 was declared a national emergency (Supplementary Figure 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/91795).

Using an online ethnographic approach and thematic analysis of video comments, the nature of audience engagement with music performances broadcast via YouTube during COVID-19 lockdown of 2020 is explored through the lens of ritual engagement with media events and models of social capital. The eight case studies featured virtual choirs, orchestras and music collaborations of various genres, including classical, pop and fusion styles drawing from European, Asia Minor, South African, West African, North African, Arabic, South Asian, and East Asian cultural origins. Five overarching themes resulted from thematic analysis of video comments, including Interaction, Unity, Resilience, Identity, and Emotion. The paper contributes important theorisation that ritual engagement and social learning fosters intercultural understanding through engaging with music both cognitively and emotionally, which can in turn shape both individual and collective identity. Online platforms provide scope for both bonding and bridging opportunities. Community resilience is supported through the sharing of knowledge, sustaining music practice during social distancing, as well as emotional support shared among audience participants, with potential wellbeing outcomes.","Fraser, Trisnasari; Crooke, Alexander Hew Dale; Davidson, Jane W.",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643893; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305714/,185
612665,An Actual Natural Setting Improves Mood Better Than Its Virtual Counterpart: A Meta-Analysis of Experimental Data,2020-09-30,"Introduction Current treatments for COVID-19 lung disease have limited efficacy. Low dose radiotherapy (LDRT) has received both interest and criticism as a potential treatment for this condition. In this qualitative study we explored clinicians’ perspectives in order to identify barriers to testing LDRT in clinical trials and implementing it in clinical practice. Methods Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with six clinicians from three medical disciplines. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically, using a framework approach. Common themes regarding barriers to using LDRT for COVID-19 lung disease were identified from the data. Results Three categories of barriers emerged: i) the potential to do harm to the patient, including difficulty in predicting harm and lack of existing data to inform quantification of risks; ii) the feasibility of trialling this novel treatment strategy in the clinical setting, in particular patient selection and buy-in from relevant clinician groups; and iii) the logistics of delivering the treatment, in particular risks of transmission to other patients and resources required for patient transfer. Conclusions This study identified several barriers that may impede the evaluation and subsequent implementation of LDRT as a treatment for COVID-19 lung disease, from the perspectives of clinicians in three relevant specialties. By documenting and articulating these concerns, we hope to enhance discussion of why these barriers exist, and enable them to be addressed in a proactive manner in order to facilitate research into the potential benefits of radiation treatment for patients with COVID-19 lung disease.","Hanna, Catherine R.; Robb, Kathryn A.; Blyth, Kevin G.; Jones, Robert J.; Chalmers, Anthony J.",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360301620346496; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301620346496?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33309910/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2020.12.003,185

Here we explore the possibility that subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent Covid-19 in individuals at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 by close exposure in a household with a documented SARS-CoV-2–infected individual. METHODS: Individuals ≥12 years were enrolled within 96 hours of a household contact being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and randomized 1:1 to receive 1200 mg REGEN-COV or placebo via subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants without evidence of infection (SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR–negative) or prior immunity (seronegative) who subsequently developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 28-day efficacy assessment period. RESULTS: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV significantly prevented symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with placebo (81.4% risk reduction; 11/753 [1.5%] vs. 59/752 [7.8%], respectively; P<0.0001), with 92.6% risk reduction after the first week (2/753 [0.3%] vs. 27/752 [3.6%], respectively). REGEN-COV also prevented overall infections, either symptomatic or asymptomatic (66.4% risk reduction). Among infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 2 weeks shorter with REGEN-COV vs. placebo (1.2 vs. 3.2 weeks, respectively), and the duration of time with high viral load (>10(4) copies/mL) was lower (0.4 vs. 1.3 weeks, respectively). REGEN-COV was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevented symptomatic Covid-19 and asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in uninfected household contacts of infected individuals. Among individuals who became infected, REGEN-COV reduced the duration of symptomatic disease, decreased maximal viral load, and reduced the duration of detectable virus.

As a first step toward a diagnostic revolution, glycemia self-monitoring represents a solid base to start exploring new diagnostic strategies. Glucose self-monitoring is improving people’s life quality in recent years; however, current approaches still present vast room for improvement. In most cases, they still involve invasive sampling processes (i.e., finger-prick), quite discomforting for frequent measurements, or implantable devices which are costly and commonly dedicated to selected chronic patients, thus precluding large-scale monitoring. Thanks to their unique physicochemical properties, nanoparticles hold great promises for the development of rapid colorimetric devices.

Design: Cross sectional study Setting: Sweden Participants: 9,624,428 individuals living in Sweden on 31st December 2014 and alive on 1st January 2016 Main outcome measures: Burden and prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 based on the guidelines from the World Health Organization and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, which are age 70 years and older, cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe asthma, and diabetes. Prognostic factors were identified based on records for three years before 1st January 2016 from the Swedish National Inpatient and Outpatient Specialist Care Register, Prescribed Drug Register, and Cancer Register. Results: 22.1% of the study population had at least one prognostic factor for severe COVID-19 (2,131,319 individuals), and 1.6% had at least three factors (154,746 individuals). The prevalence of underlying medical conditions in the whole study population ranged from 0.8% with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (78,516 individuals) to 7.4% with cardiovascular disease (708,090 individuals), and the county specific prevalence of at least one prognostic factor ranged from 19.2% in Stockholm (416,988 individuals) to 25.9% in Kalmar (60,005 individuals). Conclusions: The prevalence of prognostic factors for severe COVID-19 disease will aid authorities in optimally planning healthcare resources during the ongoing pandemic. Results can also be applied to underlying assumptions of disease burden in modelling efforts to support COVID-19 planning.

However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has demonstrated the ability to mutate and develop variants, which can modify epidemiological properties and potentially also the effectiveness of vaccines. The widespread deployment of highly effective vaccines may rapidly exert selection pressure on the SARS-CoV-2 virus directed towards mutations that escape the vaccine-induced immune response. This is particularly concerning while infection is widespread. By developing and analysing a mathematical model of two population groupings with differing vulnerability and contact rates, we explore the impact of the deployment of vaccines among the population on the reproduction ratio, cases, disease abundance and vaccine escape pressure. The results from this model illustrate two insights: (i) vaccination aimed at reducing prevalence could be more effective at reducing disease than directly vaccinating the vulnerable; (ii) the highest risk for vaccine escape can occur at intermediate levels of vaccination. This work demonstrates a key principle: the careful targeting of vaccines towards particular population groups could reduce disease as much as possible while limiting the risk of vaccine escape.","Gog, Julia R.; Hill, Edward M.; Danon, Leon; Thompson, Robin N.",Royal Society Open Science,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34277027/,185

Many of the features of the human disease are duplicated in BALB/c mice infected with a mouse-adapted version of the virus (MA15), which develop respiratory disease with high morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that severe disease is correlated with slow kinetics of virus clearance and delayed activation and transit of respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) to the draining lymph nodes (DLN) with a consequent deficient virus-specific T cell response. All of these defects are corrected when mice are treated with liposomes containing clodronate, which deplete alveolar macrophages (AM). Inhibitory AMs are believed to prevent the development of immune responses to environmental antigens and allergic responses by interacting with lung dendritic cells and T cells. The inhibitory effects of AM can also be nullified if mice or AMs are pretreated with poly I:C, which directly activate AMs and rDCs through toll-like receptors 3 (TLR3). Further, adoptive transfer of activated but not resting bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (BMDC) protect mice from lethal MA15 infection. These results may be relevant for SARS in humans, which is also characterized by prolonged virus persistence and delayed development of a SARS-CoV-specific immune response in individuals with severe disease.","Zhao, Jincun; Zhao, Jingxian; Van Rooijen, Nico; Perlman, Stanley",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19851468/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1000636,185

618826,Critically ill COVID-19 patients attended by anesthesiologists in northwestern Spain: A multicenter prospective observational study,2020-12-28,"Jamming attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) scenarios are detrimental to the performance of these networks and affect the security and stability of the service perceived by users. Therefore, the evaluation of the effectiveness of smart environment platforms based on WSNs has to consider the system performance when data collection is executed under jamming attacks. In this work, we propose an experimental testbed to analyze the performance of a WSN using the IEEE 802.15.4 CSMA/CA unslotted mode under jamming attacks in terms of goodput, packet receive rate (PRR), and energy consumption to assess the risk for users and the network in the smart scenario. The experimental results show that constant and reactive jamming strategies severely impact the evaluated performance metrics and the variance’ of the received signal strength (RSS) for some signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) ranges. The measurements obtained using the experimental testbed were correlated with analytical models. The results show that in the presence of one interferer, for SINR values higher than [Formula: see text] dB, the PRR is almost [Formula: see text] , and the goodput [Formula: see text] Kbps, but the system performance is significantly degraded when the amount of interferers increases. Additionally, the energy efficiency associated with reactive strategies is superior to the constant attack strategy. Finally, based on the evaluated metrics and with the proposed experimental testbed, our findings offer a better understanding of jamming attacks on the sensor devices in real smart scenarios.","López-Vilos, Nicolás; Valencia-Cordero, Claudio; Azurdia-Meza, Cesar; Montejo-Sánchez, Samuel; Mafra, Samuel Baraldi",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199300/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21124079,185

619568,Efficacy and safety of arbidol (umifenovir) in patients with COVID‐19: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,2021-08-04,"Inflammation is an essential component of several respiratory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is central to lung cancer, the leading cancer in terms of associated mortality that has affected millions of individuals worldwide. Inflammation and pulmonary manifestations are also the major causes of COVID-19 related deaths. Acute hyperinflammation plays an important role in the COVID-19 disease progression and severity, and development of protective immunity against the virus is greatly sought. Further, the severity of COVID-19 is greatly enhanced in lung cancer patients, probably due to the genes such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, PAI-1 and furin that are commonly involved in cancer progression as well as SAR-CoV-2 infection. The importance of inflammation in pulmonary manifestations, cancer and COVID-19 calls for a closer look at the underlying processes, particularly the associated increase in IL-6 and other cytokines, the dysregulation of immune cells and the coagulation pathway. Towards this end, several reports have identified epigenetic regulation of inflammation at different levels. Expression of several key inflammation-related cytokines, chemokines and other genes is affected by methylation and acetylation while non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs as well as long non-coding RNAs, also affect the overall inflammatory responses. Select miRNAs can regulate inflammation in COVID-19 infection, lung cancer as well as other inflammatory lung diseases, and can serve as epigenetic links that can be therapeutically targeted. Furthermore, epigenetic changes also mediate the environmental factors-induced inflammation. Therefore, a better understanding of epigenetic regulation of inflammation can potentially help develop novel strategies to prevent, diagnose and treat chronic pulmonary diseases, lung cancer and COVID-19.","Ahmad, Shama; Manzoor, Shajer; Siddiqui, Simmone; Mariappan, Nithya; Zafar, Iram; Ahmad, Aamir; Ahmad, Aftab",Semin Cancer Biol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.semcancer.2021.01.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1044579X21000080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33484868/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044579X21000080,185

Cancerous tissues are incredibly tiny in various scenarios. Therefore, for automatic classification, the characteristics of cancer patches in the X-ray image are of critical importance. Due to the slight variation between the textures, using just one feature or using a few features contributes to inaccurate classification outcomes. The present study focuses on five different algorithms for extracting features that can extract further different features. The algorithms are GLCM, LBGLCM, LBP, GLRLM, and SFTA from 8 image groups, and then, the extracted feature spaces are combined. The dataset used for classification is most probably imbalanced. Additionally, another focal point is to eradicate the unbalanced data problem by creating more samples using the ADASYN algorithm so that the error rate is minimized and the accuracy is increased. By using the ReliefF algorithm, it skips less contributing features that relieve the burden on the process. Finally, the feedforward neural network is used for the classification of data. The proposed method showed 99.5% micro, 99.5% macro, 0.5% misclassification, 99.5% recall rats, specificity 99.4%, precision 99.5%, and accuracy 99.5%, showing its robustness in these results.

621673,Perspective: US Documentation and Regulation of Human Nutrition Randomized Controlled Trials,2020-11-17,"BACKGROUND: Preliminary reports suggest that during the COVID-19 pandemic, telecounseling could be an effective model of psychological intervention for the frontline healthcare workers (fHCW) with psychological problems. Literature is sparse in this area, particularly from low- and middle-income countries, including India. We aimed to investigate the feasibility and the effectiveness of telecounseling (vs. general education) on the psychological problems of the fHCW over three time-points (baseline vs. end-of-session and at two and four weeks after the intervention). METHODS: The study followed a single-blind, active arm versus general education, parallel-group randomized control design, with participant allocation in 1:1. Active healthcare workers (HCWs) with mild- to-severe or clinically concerning scores on any of the sub-scales of Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) or Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; represented by higher scores) were included, while those with known psychiatric illness were excluded. Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test and linear-mixed effect model (group-, time, and group by time-effect) were used for analysis. RESULTS: There were no baseline group differences (telecounseling group, active arm, n = 9; general education group, control arm, n = 10). A significant time-effect (P = 0.044 to <.001) was found on DASS-21 on intention-to-treat analysis. Per-protocol analysis, additionally, found a significant group effect on Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R; P = 0.036). A significant random effect of the participants was also found (P <.001). CONCLUSION: Telecounseling could be a feasible and scalable model of psychological interventions for the fHCW with psychological problems, albeit with some feasibility challenges.","Gupta, Snehil; Kumar, Mohit; Rozatkar, Abhijit R.; Basera, Devendra; Purwar, Shashank; Gautam, Disha; Jahan, Rahat",Indian J Psychol Med,https://doi.org/10.1177/02537176211024537; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385729/,185

We aimed to identify a parsimonious set of symptoms that jointly predict COVID-19 and investigated whether predictive symptoms differ between the B.1.1.7 (Alpha) lineage (predominating as of April 2021 in the US, UK, and elsewhere) and wild type. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We obtained throat and nose swabs with valid SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results from 1,147,370 volunteers aged 5 years and above (6,450 positive cases) in the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. This study involved repeated community-based random surveys of prevalence in England (study rounds 2 to 8, June 2020 to January 2021, response rates 22%–27%). Participants were asked about symptoms occurring in the week prior to testing. Viral genome sequencing was carried out for PCR-positive samples with N-gene cycle threshold value < 34 (N = 1,079) in round 8 (January 2021). In univariate analysis, all 26 surveyed symptoms were associated with PCR positivity compared with non-symptomatic people. Stability selection (1,000 penalized logistic regression models with 50% subsampling) among people reporting at least 1 symptom identified 7 symptoms as jointly and positively predictive of PCR positivity in rounds 2–7 (June to December 2020): loss or change of sense of smell, loss or change of sense of taste, fever, new persistent cough, chills, appetite loss, and muscle aches. The resulting model (rounds 2–7) predicted PCR positivity in round 8 with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.77. The same 7 symptoms were selected as jointly predictive of B.1.1.7 infection in round 8, although when comparing B.1.1.7 with wild type, new persistent cough and sore throat were more predictive of B.1.1.7 infection while loss or change of sense of smell was more predictive of the wild type. The main limitations of our study are (i) potential participation bias despite random sampling of named individuals from the National Health Service register and weighting designed to achieve a representative sample of the population of England and (ii) the necessary reliance on self-reported symptoms, which may be prone to recall bias and may therefore lead to biased estimates of symptom prevalence in England. CONCLUSIONS: Where testing capacity is limited, it is important to use tests in the most efficient way possible. We identified a set of 7 symptoms that, when considered together, maximize detection of COVID-19 in the community, including infection with the B.1.1.7 lineage.","Elliott, Joshua; Whitaker, Matthew; Bodinier, Barbara; Eales, Oliver; Riley, Steven; Ward, Helen; Cooke, Graham; Darzi, Ara; Chadeau-Hyam, Marc; Elliott, Paul",PLoS Med,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1003777; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34582457/,185

The hypothesis that immunity to bee venom could have a preventive effect was expressed and the authors of the Chinese survey suggested that the next step should be animal experiments on monkeys. We believed that before starting such studies, a second independent survey should verify the findings and define the hypothesis more clearly. Thus we asked all German beekeepers to complete an assessment form which would summarize their experiences with COVID-19. In contrast to the Chinese study we found that two beekeepers had died from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and forty-five were affected. The reaction to bee stings (none; mild swelling; severe swelling) correlated with the perceived severity of the SARS-CoV-2-infection-associated symptoms - exhaustion and sore throat. Beekeepers comorbidity correlated with problems with breathing at rest, fever, and diarrhea. Our results did not confirm the findings of the Chinese study. However, since the antiviral effects of bee venom have been found in several studies, we cannot exclude that there could be a direct preventive or alleviating effect when bee venom is administered during the infection.","Männle, Heidrun; Hübner, Jutta; Münstedt, Karsten",Toxicon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33035564/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041010120304086?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxicon.2020.10.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041010120304086,185
622486,Effects of surgical masks on droplet dispersion under various oxygen delivery modalities,2021-02-27,"Innate lymphoid type-2 cells (ILC2) are a population of innate cells of lymphoid origin that are known to drive strong Type 2 immunity. ILC2 play a key role in lung homeostasis, repair/remodeling of lung structures following injury, and initiation of inflammation as well as more complex roles during the immune response, including the transition from innate to adaptive immunity. Remarkably, dysregulation of this single population has been linked with chronic lung pathologies, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrotic diseases (IPF). Furthermore, ILC2 have been shown to increase following early-life respiratory viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and rhinovirus (RV), that may lead to long-term alterations of the lung environment. The detrimental roles of increased ILC2 following these infections may include pathogenic chronic inflammation and/or alterations of the structural, repair, and even developmental processes of the lung. Respiratory viral infections in older adults and patients with established chronic pulmonary diseases often lead to exacerbated responses, likely due to previous exposures that leave the lung in a dysregulated functional and structural state. This review will focus on the role of ILC2 during respiratory viral exposures and their effects on the induction and regulation of lung pathogenesis. We aim to provide insight into ILC2-driven mechanisms that may enhance lung-associated diseases throughout life. Understanding these mechanisms will help identify better treatment options to limit not only viral infection severity but also protect against the development and/or exacerbation of other lung pathologies linked to severe respiratory viral infections.","Fonseca, Wendy; Lukacs, Nicholas W.; Elesela, Srikanth; Malinczak, Carrie-Anne",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33953732/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.675169,185

It is unknown whether COVID-19 incidence is associated with vitamin D deficiency and treatment. Objective: To examine whether vitamin D deficiency and treatment are associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: University of Chicago Medicine Participants: Patients tested for COVID-19 from 3/3/2020-4/10/2020. Vitamin D deficiency was defined by the most recent 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20ng/ml or 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol <18pg/ml within 1 year before COVID-19 testing. Treatment was defined by the most recent vitamin D type and dose, and treatment changes between the time of the most recent vitamin D level and time of COVID-19 testing. Vitamin D deficiency and treatment changes were combined to categorize vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing as likely deficient(last-level-deficient/treatment-not-increased), likely sufficient(last-level-not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), or uncertain deficiency(last-level-deficient/treatment-increased or last-level-not-deficient/treatment-decreased). Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was testing positive for COVID-19. Multivariable analysis tested whether the most recent vitamin D level and treatment changes after that level were associated with testing positive for COVID-19 controlling for demographic and comorbidity indicators. Bivariate analyses of associations of treatment with vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 were performed. Results: Among 4,314 patients tested for COVID-19, 499 had a vitamin D level in the year before testing. Vitamin D status at the time of COVID-19 testing was categorized as likely deficient for 127(25%) patients, likely sufficient for 291(58%) patients, and uncertain for 81(16%) patients. In multivariate analysis, testing positive for COVID-19 was associated with increasing age(RR(age<50)=1.05,p<0.021;RR(age[≥]50)=1.02,p<0.064)), non-white race(RR=2.54,p<0.01) and being likely vitamin D deficient (deficient/treatment-not-increased:RR=1.77,p<0.02) as compared to likely vitamin D sufficient(not-deficient/treatment-not-decreased), with predicted COVID-19 rates in the vitamin D deficient group of 21.6%(95%CI[14.0%-29.2%] ) versus 12.2%(95%CI[8.9%-15.4%]) in the vitamin D sufficient group. Vitamin D deficiency declined with increasing vitamin D dose, especially of vitamin D3. Vitamin D dose was not significantly associated with testing positive for COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Vitamin D deficiency that is not sufficiently treated is associated with COVID-19 risk. Testing and treatment for vitamin D deficiency to address COVID-19 warrant aggressive pursuit and study.","Meltzer, D. O.; Best, T.

La gestione di una disidratazione da gastroenterite ha due componenti: la sua correzione e il rapido ripristino della normale perfusione tissutale e il mantenimento dei fabbisogni di acqua e di nutrienti, per limitare al massimo il deficit energetico. La valutazione della gravità della disidratazione è l’elemento chiave che guiderà la terapia. La perdita di peso, espressa in percentuale di peso corporeo prima dell’episodio di disidratazione, è il metodo di riferimento, ma è spesso difficile o impossibile da ottenere. Inoltre, i segni clinici, come l’alterazione dell’aspetto generale, l’allungamento del tempo di riempimento capillare, il riconoscimento di una plica cutanea persistente, gli occhi infossati, una secchezza delle mucose e la mancanza di lacrime, sono i principali elementi che permettono di valutare la gravità della disidratazione.

Addressing these challenges will require fundamental changes to public health data systems. For example, one of the core data systems for immunization campaigns is the immunization information system (IIS); however, IISs were designed for tracking the vaccinated, not finding the patients who are high risk and need to be vaccinated. Health systems have this data in their electronic health records (EHR) systems and often have a greater capacity for outreach. Clearly, a partnership is needed. However, successful collaborations will require public health to change from its historical hierarchical information supply chain model to an ecosystem model with a peer-to-peer exchange with population health providers.

In our hospital we decided to maintain adjuvant and early line treatments for metastatic disease in patients under 65 and without specific comorbidities and to apply a shared decision approach in other patients while following closely the safety of these treatments. Method(s): Real time safety monitoring was proposed to all patients treated for solid tumours in our day-care unit starting March 1st, 2020. After signing informed consent patients were asked questions concerning protective measures at home, signs of SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalisation. Patients' charts were reviewed for outcome, including death, after suspected or proven SARS-CoV-2 infection. Minimum follow-up was 5 weeks after day care unit attendance. Result(s): 387 patients were included in our registry between March 1st and March 31st, 2020. Median age was 64 years-old (range 27-90). Most patients suffered from lung (n=96), breast (n=93), gastrointestinal (n=87), gynaecological (n=38) or urological (n=33) cancers. 131 patients received (neo)adjuvant treatments, 256 patients were treated for metastatic disease. Patients received chemotherapy (n=170), immunotherapy (n=103), targeted therapy (n=68) or other combinations (n=46). Although Belgium had one of the highest infection rates in the world, safety data concerning risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes were rather reassuring.

Conclusion(s): Analysis of our data for patients treated in March 2020 in the day-care unit are reassuring and suggest higher risk related to under-treatment compared to risk related to continuation of systemic therapy at time of COVID-19 outbreak. Patients' follow-up will be updated and additional analyses and data in particular for April 2020, when the infection rate was still extremely high in Belgium, will be presented.

METHODS: The investigation analyzed pre- and post-COVID-19 characteristics in 191 opioid use disorder (OUD) buprenorphine outpatients who completed an 18-question survey in late 2020 related to COVID testing, OUD relapses, obstacles to maintaining abstinence, and treatment resources. RESULTS: The study revealed no statistically significant changes in drug use before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic despite monthly volume increases. Results further demonstrated statistically significant barriers to treatment, including loss of housing and transportation, food insecurity, and onset of depression. No patients required hospitalization or succumbed to OUD or COVID-19. Potentially effective resource utilization findings included clinic transportation and 24/7 crisis intervention. Respondents rated telehealth as helpful when used in an individualized hybrid model matching patient's need to available resources based on COVID-19 safety guidelines. CONCLUSION: This report yields key clinical insights into providing outpatient MOUD care during the COVID-19 pandemic, validating in-person care as both safe and effective. Patients' experiences proved helpful in identifying and quantifying obstacles to abstinence in conjunction with facilitating continued patient access to essential clinical resources. Notably, telehealth can supplement rather than replace in-person treatment.","Cales, Richard H.; Cales, Shannon C.; Shreffler, Jacob; Huecker, Martin R.",J Subst Abuse Treat,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0740547221002695?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210567/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0740547221002695; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2021.108543,185

We aimed to assess whether measuring lymphocyte subpopulations added clinical value to the total lymphocyte counting regarding mortality when they were simultaneously tested at hospital admission. Peripheral blood was analysed in 701 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐confirmed consecutive patients by lysed–no washed flow cytometry. Demographic and clinical features were registered in electronic medical records. Statistical analysis was performed after a 3‐month follow‐up. The 112 patients who died were older and had significantly higher frequencies of known co‐morbidities than survivor COVID‐19 patients. A significant reduction in total lymphocytes, CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD19(+) counts and CD3(+) percentage was found in the group of deceased patients (P < 0·001), while the percentage of CD56(+)/CD16(+) natural killer (NK) cells was significantly higher (P < 0·001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed a significantly increased risk of in‐hospital death associated to age [odds ratio (OR) = 2·36, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1·9–3·0 P < 0·001]; CD4(+) T counts ≤ 500 cells/μl, (OR = 2·79, 95% CI = 1·1–6·7, P = 0·021); CD8(+) T counts ≤ 100 cells/μl, (OR = 1·98, 95% CI = 1·2–3·3) P = 0·009) and CD56(+)/CD16(+) NK ≥ 30%, (OR = 1·97, 95% CI = 1·1–3·1, P = 0·002) at admission, independent of total lymphocyte numbers and co‐morbidities, with area under the curve 0·85 (95% CI = 0·81–0·88). Reduced counts of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells with proportional expansion of NK lymphocytes at admission were prognostic factors of death in this Spanish series. In COVID‐19 patients with normal levels of lymphocytes or mild lymphopenia, imbalanced lymphocyte subpopulations were early markers of in‐hospital mortality.","Cantenys‐Molina, S.; Fernández‐Cruz, E.; Francos, P.; Lopez Bernaldo de Quirós, J.

Though all ADAMs contain metalloproteinase domains, in humans only 13 of the 21 genes in the family encode functional proteases, indicating that at least for the other eight members, protein–protein interactions are critical aspects of their biological functions. The functional ADAM metalloproteinases are involved in “ectodomain shedding” of diverse growth factors, cytokines, receptors and adhesion molecules. The archetypal activity is shown by ADAM-17 (tumour necrosis factor-α convertase, TACE), which is the principal protease involved in the activation of pro-TNF-α, but whose sheddase functions cover a broad range of cell surface molecules. In particular, ADAM-17 is required for generation of the active forms of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) ligands, and its function is essential for the development of epithelial tissues. Several other ADAMs have important sheddase functions in particular tissue contexts. Another major family member, ADAM-10, is a principal player in signalling via the Notch and Eph/ephrin pathways. For a growing number of substrates, foremost among them being Notch, cleavage by ADAM sheddases is essential for their subsequent “regulated intramembrane proteolysis” (RIP), which generates cleaved intracellular domains that translocate to the nucleus and regulate gene transcription. Several ADAMs play roles in spermatogenesis and sperm function, potentially by effecting maturation of sperm and their adhesion and migration in the uterus. Other non-catalytic ADAMs function in the CNS via effects on guidance mechanisms. The ADAM family are thus fundamental to many control processes in development and homeostasis, and unsurprisingly they are also linked to pathological states when their functions are dysregulated, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, asthma, Alzheimer’s disease. This review will provide an overview of current knowledge of the human ADAMs, discussing their structure, function, regulation and disease involvement.","Edwards, Dylan R.; Handsley, Madeleine M.; Pennington, Caroline J.",Mol Aspects Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18762209/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098299708000551; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mam.2008.08.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0098299708000551,185

Hence, we examined their levels in upper respiratory samples of CF patients (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 45). Moreover, we sought to understand the interplay of type I interferon (IFN-I) with ACE2, furin and TMPRSS2 by evaluating their gene expression with respect to ISG15, a well-known marker of IFN activation, in upper respiratory samples and after ex vivo IFNβ exposure. Lower ACE2 levels and trends toward the reduction of furin and TMPRSS2 were found in CF patients compared with the healthy controls; decreased ACE2 amounts were also detected in CF individuals with pancreatic insufficiency and in those receiving inhaled antibiotics. Moreover, there was a strong positive correlation between ISG15 and ACE2 levels. However, after ex vivo IFNβ stimulation of nasopharyngeal cells, the truncated isoform (dACE2), recently demonstrated as the IFN stimulated one with respect to the full-length isoform (flACE2), slightly augmented in cells from CF patients whereas in those from healthy donors, dACE2 levels showed variable levels of upregulation. An altered expression of SARS-COV-2 entry genes and a poor responsiveness of dACE2 to IFN-I stimulation might be crucial in the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in CF.","Bitossi, Camilla; Frasca, Federica; Viscido, Agnese; Oliveto, Giuseppe; Scordio, Mirko; Belloni, Laura; Cimino, Giuseppe; Pietropaolo, Valeria; Gentile, Massimo; d’Ettorre, Gabriella; Midulla, Fabio; Trancassini, Maria; Antonelli, Guido; Pierangeli, Alessandra; Scagnolari, Carolina",Microorganisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33401565/; https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9010093,185

631991,Gastrointestinal Complications in Critically Ill Patients With COVID-19,2020-05-01,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe with alarming speed, morbidity and mortality. Immediate triage of suspected patients with chest infections caused by COVID-19 using chest CT may be of assistance when results from definitive viral testing are delayed. PURPOSE: To develop and validate an artificial intelligence (AI) system to score the likelihood and extent of pulmonary COVID-19 on chest CT scans using the CO-RADS and CT severity scoring systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CORADS-AI consists of three deep learning algorithms that automatically segment the five pulmonary lobes, assign a CO-RADS score for the suspicion of COVID-19 and assign a CT severity score for the degree of parenchymal involvement per lobe. This study retrospectively included patients who received an unenhanced chest CT scan due to clinical suspicion of COVID-19 at two medical centers. The system was trained, validated, and tested with data from one of the centers. Data from the second center served as an external test set. Diagnostic performance and agreement with scores assigned by eight independent observers were measured using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, linearly-weighted kappa and classification accuracy. RESULTS: 105 patients (62 ± 16 years, 61 men) and 262 patients (64 ± 16 years, 154 men) were evaluated in the internal and the external test set, respectively. The system discriminated between COVID-19 positive and negative patients with areas under the ROC curve of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.91-0.98) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93). Agreement with the eight human observers was moderate to substantial with a mean linearly-weighted kappa of 0.60 ± 0.01 for CO-RADS scores and 0.54 ± 0.01 for CT severity scores. CONCLUSION: CORADS-AI correctly identified COVID-19 positive patients with high diagnostic performance from chest CT exams, assigned standardized CO-RADS and CT severity scores in good agreement with eight independent observers and generalized well to external data.","Lessmann, Nikolas; Sánchez, Clara I.; Beenen, Ludo; Boulogne, Luuk H.; Brink, Monique; Calli, Erdi; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; Dofferhoff, Ton; van Everdingen, Wouter M.; Gerke, Paul K.; Geurts, Bram; Gietema, Hester A.; Groeneveld, Miriam; van Harten, Louis; Hendrix, Nils; Hendrix, Ward; Huisman, Henkjan J.; Išgum, Ivana; Jacobs, Colin; Kluge, Ruben; Kok, Michel; Krdzalic, Jasenko; Lassen-Schmidt, Bianca; van Leeuwen, Kicky; Meakin, James; Overkamp, Mike; van Rees Vellinga, Tjalco; van Rikxoort, Eva M.; Samperna, Riccardo; Schaefer-Prokop, Cornelia; Schalekamp, Steven; Scholten, Ernst Th.; Sital, Cheryl; Stöger, Lauran; Teuwen, Jonas; Vaidhya Venkadesh, Kiran; de Vente, Coen; Vermaat, Marieke; Xie, Weiyi; de Wilde, Bram; Prokop, Mathias; van Ginneken, Bram",Radiology,https://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2020202439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32729810/,185

DESIGN: A retrospective review of cohort who underwent percutaneous tracheostomy with modified protocol. SETTINGS: Medical, surgical, and neurologic ICUs. SUBJECTS: Patients admitted in medical, surgical, and neurologic units with prolonged need of mechanical ventilation or inability to liberate from the ventilator. INTERVENTIONS: A detailed protocol was written. Steps were defined to be performed before apnea and during apnea. A feasibility study of 28 patients was conducted. The key aerosol-generating portions of the procedure were performed with the ventilator switched to standby mode with the patient apneic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Data including patient demographics, primary diagnosis, age, body mass index, and duration of apnea time during the tracheostomy were collected. Average ventilator standby time (apnea) during the procedure was 238 seconds (3.96 min) with range 149 seconds (2.48 min) to 340 seconds (5.66 min). Single-use (disposable) bronchoscopes (Ambu A/S [Ballerup, Denmark] or Glidescope [Verathon, Inc., Bothell, WA]) were used during all procedures except in nine. No desaturation events occurred during any procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous tracheostomy performed with apnea protocol may help minimize aerosolization, reducing risk of exposure of coronavirus disease 2019 to staff. It can be safely performed with portable bronchoscopes to limit staff and minimize the surfaces requiring disinfection post procedure.","Niroula, Abesh; Van Nostrand, Keriann M.; Khullar, Onkar V.; Force, Seth; Jaber, Wissam S.; Sardi, Alejandro H.; Berkowitz, David M.",Crit Care Explor,https://doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000134; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32671354/,185

METHOD: The data of 16 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients with CML receiving TKI and age, gender, and comorbid disease matched COVID-19 patients without cancer at a 3/1 ratio (n = 48), diagnosed between March 11, 2020 and May 22, 2020 and included in the Republic of Turkey, Ministry of Health database, were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and mechanical ventilation (MV) support were lower in CML patients compared to the control group, however, these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.1, and p = 0.2, respectively). The length of hospital stay was shorter in CML patients compared with the control group; however, it was not statistically significant (p = 0.8). The case fatality rate (CFR) in COVID-19 patients with CML was 6.3%, and it was 12.8% in the control group. Although the CFR in CML patients with COVID-19 was lower compared to the control group, this difference did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.5). When CML patients were divided into 3 groups according to the TKI, no significant difference was observed regarding the rate of ICU admission, MV support, CFR, the length of stay in both hospital and ICU (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study highlights that large scale prospective and randomized studies should be conducted in order to investigate the role of TKIs in the treatment of COVID-19.","Başcı, Semih; Ata, Naim; Altuntaş, Fevzi; Yiğenoğlu, Tuğçe Nur; Dal, Mehmet Sinan; Korkmaz, Serdal; Namdaroğlu, Sinem; Baştürk, Abdülkadir; Hacıbekiroğlu, Tuba; Doğu, Mehmet Hilmi; Berber, İlhami; Dal, Kürşat; Erkurt, Mehmet Ali; Turgut, Burhan; Çağlayan, Murat; Ayvalı, Mustafa Okan; Çelik, Osman; Ülgü, Mustafa Mahir; Birinci, Şuayip",J Oncol Pharm Pract,https://doi.org/10.1177/1078155220953198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32854573/,185
634119,The Cardiac Toxicity of Chloroquine or Hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-regression Analysis,2020-06-18,"Currently the TRPV1 (transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1) channel is considered to be one of the main targets for pro-inflammatory mediators including TNF-α. Similarly, the inhibition of TRPV1 activity in the peripheral nervous system affects pro-inflammatory mediator production and enhances analgesia in total. In this study, the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of HCRG21, the first peptide blocker of TRPV1, were demonstrated in a mice model of carrageenan-induced paw edema. HCRG21 in doses of 0.1 and 1 mg/kg inhibited edema formation compared to the control, demonstrated complete edema disappearance in 24 h in a dose of 1 mg/kg, and effectively reduced the productionof TNF-α in both doses examined. ELISA analysis of blood taken 24 h after carrageenan administration showed a dramatic cytokine value decrease to 25 pg/mL by HCRG21 versus 100 pg/mL in the negative control group, which was less than the TNF-α level in the intact group (40 pg/mL). The HCRG21 demonstrated potent analgesic effects on the models of mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia in carrageenan-induced paw edema. The HCRG21 relief effect was comparable to that of indomethacin taken orally in a dose of 5 mg/kg, but was superior to this nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in duration (which lasted 24 h) in the mechanical sensitivity experiment. The results confirm the existence of a close relationship between TRPV1 activity and TNF-α production once again, and prove the superior pharmacological potential of TRPV1 blockers and the HCRG21 peptide in particular.","Sintsova, Oksana; Gladkikh, Irina; Klimovich, Anna; Palikova, Yulia; Palikov, Viktor; Styshova, Olga; Monastyrnaya, Margarita; Dyachenko, Igor; Kozlov, Sergey; Leychenko, Elena",Biomedicines,https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines9070716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34201624/,185

No guidelines exist to inform patients or physicians what meets these criteria. The purpose of this multi-institutional study was to describe the differences in perceptions of urgency for musculoskeletal complaints between patients and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous survey was distributed to patients who visited the authors' orthopedic clinics in January and February 2020 and practicing orthopedic surgeons. The surveys were administered in May 2020 after COVID-19 was officially labeled a pandemic and included questions regarding demographic information and perceptions of orthopedic urgency. A total of 1491 patients and 128 physicians completed the surveys. A significantly higher percentage of physicians considered the following diagnoses an appropriate indication for an urgent visit compared with patients: fracture (P<.001), acute dislocation (P<.001), infection (P<.001), neurologic compromise (P<.001), tumor (P<.001), acute tendon injury (P<.001), weakness (P<.001), inability to bear weight (P<.001), post-surgical problem (P<.001), and painful joint effusion (P<.001). There were no significant differences in the perception of urgency for the following conditions: bursitis/tendonitis (P=1.00), joint/extremity deformity without pain (P=.113), and loss of range of motion of a joint (P=.467). Younger patients and those with higher levels of education were significantly more likely to consider their conditions urgent. Patients may require additional education to prevent delay in treatment of urgent conditions-especially time-sensitive conditions such as neurologic compromise, tumors, and infections-when access to physicians is limited.

636165,COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis: Case report with literature review,2021-07-10,PURPOSE: To describe the favorable procedural profile of CT colonography (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: Postponement of cancer screening due to COVID-19 has resulted in a backlog of individuals needing to undergo structural examination of the colon. The experience during the initial COVID-19 surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner as compared to other structural examinations. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance.

Dentistry students are at a higher risk of contracting infections, specifically COVID-19, due to direct contact with patients. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, perception and attitude regarding COVID-19 among dentistry students in Austria. METHODS: During the first lockdown in Austria, an online survey was distributed among 165 dentistry students in their clinical term at the Medical University of Vienna. The survey contained elaborative questions on the general knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. A special focus of the questionnaire was set on the modification of the student’s curriculum regarding infection control. RESULTS: In total, 77 (47%) students replied; 68 questionnaires were included in the analysis. Dentistry students were found to have good general knowledge of COVID-19 during the early phase of the pandemic. Most students (89.6%) got their information regarding the COVID-19 infection from official sources; however, 58% would like to attend further lectures on COVID-19 to expand their knowledge. DISCUSSION: The current study finds good general knowledge on COVID-19 among dental students, but some gaps regarding hygienic protocols and infection control. Students’ preferences regarding modification in the curriculum suggest practical courses and lectures as a way to close COVID-19 related knowledge gaps.","Boukhobza, Sarra; Ritschl, Valentin; Stamm, Tanja; Bekes, Katrin",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s311535; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34163169/,185

However, when a particles-laden droplet on a solid surface is vaporized, a cluster-ring deposit is often yielded which makes particles counting difficult or impractical. Nevertheless, in this study, we present an approach, i.e., on-cantilever particles imprinting, which effectively defies such odds to sample and deposit countable single particles on a sensing surface. Initially, we designed and fabricated a triangular microcantilever sensor whose mass m(0), total beam-length L, and clamped-end beam-width w are equivalent to that of a rectangular/normal cantilever but with a higher resonant frequency (271 kHz), enhanced sensitivity (0.13 Hz/pg), and quality factor (~3000). To imprint particles on these cantilever sensors, various calibrated stainless steel dispensing tips were utilized to pioneer this study by dipping and retracting each tip from a small particle-laden droplet (resting on a hydrophobic n-type silicon substrate), followed by tip-sensor-contact (at a target point on the sensing area) to detach the solution (from the tip) and adsorb the particles, and ultimately determine the particles mass concentration. Upon imprinting/adsorbing the particles on the sensor, resonant frequency response measurements were made to determine the mass (or number of particles). A minimum detectable mass of ~0.05 pg was demonstrated. To further validate and compare such results, cantilever samples (containing adsorbed particles) were imaged by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the number of particles through counting (from which, the lowest count of about 11 magnetic polystyrene particles was obtained). The practicality of particle counting was essentially due to monolayer particle arrangement on the sensing surface. Moreover, in this work, the main measurement process influences are also explicitly examined.","Nyang’au, Wilson Ombati; Setiono, Andi; Schmidt, Angelika; Bosse, Harald; Peiner, Erwin",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32354176/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s20092508,185

The notion of phage therapy against bacteria has been around for more than a century and, although its implementation was abandoned after the introduction of drugs, it is now making a comeback and gaining renewed interest in Western medicine as an alternative to treat drug-resistant pathogens. Mycobacteriophages are genetically diverse viruses that specifically infect mycobacterial hosts, including members of the M. tuberculosis complex. This review describes general features of mycobacteriophages and their mechanisms of killing M. tuberculosis, as well as their advantages and limitations as therapeutic and prophylactic agents against drug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains. This review also discusses the role of human lung micro-environments in shaping the availability of mycobacteriophage receptors on the M. tuberculosis cell envelope surface, the risk of potential development of bacterial resistance to mycobacteriophages, and the interactions with the mammalian host immune system. Finally, it summarizes the knowledge gaps and defines key questions to be addressed regarding the clinical application of phage therapy for the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis.","Allué-Guardia, Anna; Saranathan, Rajagopalan; Chan, John; Torrelles, Jordi B.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450990/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22020735,185

At present there are few proven effective treatments. This early phase experimental medicine protocol describes an overarching and adaptive trial designed to provide safety, pharmacokinetic (PK)/ pharmacodynamic (PD) information and exploratory biological surrogates of efficacy, which may support further development and deployment of candidate therapies in larger scale trials of COVID-19 positive patients. Methods and analysis; DEFINE is an ongoing exploratory multicentre platform, open label, randomised study. COVID-19 positive patients will be recruited from the following cohorts; a) community cases b) hospitalised patients with new changes on a chest x-ray (CXR) or a computed tomography (CT) scan or requiring supplemental oxygen and c) hospitalised patients requiring assisted ventilation. Participants may be recruited from all three of these cohorts, depending on the experimental therapy, its route of administration and mechanism of action. The primary statistical analyses are concerned with the safety of candidate agents as add-on therapy to standard of care in patients with COVID-19. Safety will be assessed using: - Haematological and biochemical safety laboratory investigations. - Physical examination - Vital signs (blood pressure/heart rate/temperature and respiratory rate) - Daily electrocardiogram (ECG) readings - Adverse events The analysis population will consist of (i) all patients randomised to a treatment arm who receive any dose of the study drug and (ii) all patients randomised to the control arm who would also have been eligible to receive a study drug. Secondary analysis will assess the following variables during treatment period 1) the response of key exploratory biomarkers 2) change in WHO ordinal scale and NEWS2 score 3) oxygen requirements 4) viral load 5) duration of hospital stay 6) PK/PD and 7) changes in key coagulation pathways. Ethics and dissemination; The DEFINE trial platform and its initial two treatment and standard of care arms have received full ethical approval from Scotland A REC (20/SS/0066), the MHRA (EudraCT 2020-002230-32) and NHS Lothian and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The results of each study arm will be published as soon as the treatment arm has finished recruitment, data input is complete and any outstanding patient safety follow-ups have been completed. Depending on the results of these or future arms, data will be shared with larger clinical trial networks, including RECOVERY, and to other partners for rapid roll out in larger patient cohorts.","Gaughan, E.; Quinn, T.

The current study applied a contextual behavioral science lens to the spillover hypothesis of Family Systems Theory to develop a multi-stage mechanistic model for how COVID-19 stress could impact family and child functioning and how parents’ psychological flexibility could shape those processes. METHODS: A total of 742 coparents (71% female; 84% Caucasian, 85% married, M = 41 years old) of children (ages 5-18, M = 9.4 years old, 50% male) completed an online survey from March 27(th) to the end of April, 2014. RESULTS: Path analyses highlighted robust links from parent inflexibility to all components of the model, predicting: greater COVID-19 stress, greater coparenting discord and family discord, greater caustic parenting, and greater parent and child distress. Parent flexibility was associated with greater family cohesion, lower family discord and greater use of constructive parenting strategies (inductive, democratic/autonomy supportive, positive). Results further suggested that COVID-19 stressors predicted greater family and coparent discord, which in turn predicted greater use of caustic parenting (reactive, inconsistent, aggressive), which in turn predicted greater child and parent distress. Conclusions: The current results highlight parental flexibility and inflexibility as key points of intervention for helping families navigate the current global health crisis, highlighting the crucial role they play in the lives of families.","Daks, Jennifer S.; Peltz, Jack S.; Rogge, Ronald D.",J Contextual Behav Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834972/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.08.003; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212144720301691?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2212144720301691,185

Guided by the Resilience Model of Family Stress, Adjustment, and Adaptation, this study examines relationships between material hardship, parenting stress, social support, resilience and psychological distress of grandparent kinship caregivers during the COVID‐19 pandemic, as well as the moderating role of kinship license status on these relationships. Kinship care licensing is a prerequisite to receiving financial assistance and other supporting services from the government. We administered a cross‐sectional survey of grandparent kinship caregivers (N = 362) in the United States. Logistic regression results indicated that material hardship was associated with higher odds of experiencing psychological distress, whereas resilience and social support were associated with lower odds. Kinship license status moderated the relationships of social support and resilience with psychological distress. Results suggest that additional emergency funds and more tailored financial services should be provided to meet material needs, and interventions with a focus on resilience and social support are particularly needed. The moderating effects of license status indicate that some interventions should be specifically implemented among licensed kinship caregivers, whereas parallel services should be provided to kinship caregivers regardless of their license status.","Xu, Yanfeng; Jedwab, Merav; Wu, Qi; Levkoff, Sue E.; Xu, Ling",Child Fam Soc Work,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548838/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cfs.12864,185

In the pandemic situation, these patients are considered highly vulnerable to infectious complications due to their immunocompromised state. MATERIAL & METHODS: In this retrospective case series, the documents of solid cancer patients infected by SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized in Shariati hospital between 20 February and 20 April 2020, were evaluated. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and/or features of chest CT scan highly suggestive for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 33 COVID-19-infected cancer patients were included. Mean age was 63.9 years, and 54.5% of the patients were male. LDH level was significantly higher (1487.5 ± 1392.8 vs. 932.3 ± 324.7 U/L, P-value=0.016) and also serum albumin was significantly lower in non-survivors (3.6 ± 0.5 vs. 2.9 ± 0.6 g/dL, p-value=0.03).

The necessity of rapid diagnosis calls for alternative methods to predict the condition of the patient, for which disease severity estimation on the basis of Lung Ultrasound (LUS) can be a safe, radiation-free, flexible, and favorable option. In this paper, a frame-based 4-score disease severity prediction architecture is proposed with the integration of deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks to consider both spatial and temporal features of the LUS frames. The proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture implements an autoencoder network and separable convolutional branches fused with a modified DenseNet-201 network to build a vigorous, noise-free classification model. A five-fold cross-validation scheme is performed to affirm the efficacy of the proposed network. In-depth result analysis shows a promising improvement in the classification performance by introducing the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers after the proposed CNN architecture by an average of [Formula: see text] , which is approximately [Formula: see text] more than the traditional DenseNet architecture alone.

Through metagenomic analysis of the above two groups and a healthy group from the public data, there are 6502 species identified in the samples. Specifically, the Pielou index indicated a lower evenness of the microbiota in the COVID-19 group than that in the Non-COVID-19 group. Combined with the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and the generalized linear model, eighty-one bacterial species were found with increased abundance in the COVID-19 group, where 51 species were enriched more than 8 folds.

We report a case of severe pneumonia causing acute respiratory distress syndrome due to a coinfection with SARS-CoV-2 and Mycobacterium abscessus in an elderly patient with multiple myeloma in Florida, USA. Case Presentation. An 84-year-old male with a medical history significant for multiple myeloma not in remission was sent to the emergency department to rule out COVID-19 infection prior to continuing his chemotherapy sessions. At presentation, he had nonspecific mild symptoms and an unremarkable physical examination. He had significant blood test findings including serum lactate dehydrogenase 373 U/L, high sensitive C-reactive protein 17.40 mg/l, and ferritin 415 ng/ml. Xpert-SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Chest radiograph revealed patchy areas of interstitial infiltrates in mid to lower lung zones. During his hospitalization course, his oxygenation deteriorated, requiring mechanical intubation. Repeat chest radiograph showed worsening bilateral infiltrates. He was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and eventually weaned off mechanical intubation and extubated. On the 11(th) day of admission, he was found to be bradycardic and in shock, and he was reintubated. His labs showed worsening inflammatory markers along with kidney dysfunction to the point of requiring renal replacement therapy. He received both convalescent plasma and remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. Eventually, repeat blood cultures came back positive for the growth of acid-fast beaded bacilli. While awaiting final culture and sensitivity reports, his antibiotics were upgraded to cover possible nocardia infection. Repeat blood and sputum cultures resulted in growth of AFB bacilli Mycobacterium abscessus 1 week after.

To do this, it calls for the fortification of the traditional course of study that introduces students to the analysis of literary texts. However, a traditional approach to school-based literary analysis that attends exclusively to a text’s formal properties in order to determine its meaning is insufficient to get ahead of the world risk curve. Instead, the article turns to the concept of allegory as theorized in curriculum theory and to a theory of preventative foresight to interpret a famous dream (of a world-shattering contagion) in a famous work of literature (Dostoevsky’s Crime and Punishment) that provides a novel opportunity to understand the significance of sense in the time of plagues.","Spector, Hannah",Prospects (Paris),https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-021-09550-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814637/,185

Our mixed effects model consists of country‐varying coefficients, as well as ‘fixed’ (pooled) coefficients. This allows us to fully explore variation between countries. The model provides estimates for losses in total employment and women's employment, from which we infer income losses. We find that roughly half of estimated SADC countries have total employment losses below or approaching 25% of all jobs, while the other half have total losses exceeding 25%. Around one‐third of all jobs for women risk being lost during 2020 for Madagascar, Comoros, Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and South Africa. Our model implies that most SADC countries will experience an equivalent loss of wage income in excess of 10% of GDP (whether through pure job losses and/or reductions in wages and working hours).

649042,"Effectiveness of Tocilizumab, Sarilumab, and Anakinra for critically ill patients with COVID-19 The REMAP-CAP COVID-19 Immune Modulation Therapy Domain Randomized Clinical Trial",2021-06-22,"Abstract With the multiplication of COVID-19 severe acute respiratory syndrome cases due to SARS COV2, some concerns about angiotensin-converting enzyme 1 (ACE1) inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) have emerged. Because the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) enzyme is the receptor that allows SARS COV2 entry into cells, the fear was that pre-existing treatment with ACEi or ARB might increase the risk of developing severe or fatal severe acute respiratory syndrome in case of COVID-19 infection. The present article discusses these concerns. ACE2 is a membrane-bound enzyme (carboxypeptidase) that contributes to the inactivation of angiotensin II and therefore physiologically counters angiotensin II effects. ACEis do not inhibit ACE2. Although ARBs have been shown to upregulate ACE2 tissue expression in experimental animals, evidence was not always consistent in human studies. Moreover, to date there is no evidence that ACEi or ARB administration facilitates SARS COV2 cell entry by increasing ACE2 tissue expression in either animal or human studies. Finally, some studies support the hypothesis that elevated ACE2 membrane expression and tissue activity by administration of ARB and/or infusion of soluble ACE2 could confer protective properties against inflammatory tissue damage in COVID-19 infection. In summary, based on the currently available evidence and as advocated by many medical societies, ACEi or ARB should not be discontinued because of concerns with COVID-19 infection, except when the hemodynamic situation is precarious and case-by-case adjustment is required.","Alexandre, J; Cracowski, JL; Richard, V; Bouhanick, B",Ann Endocrinol (Paris),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32370986/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0003426620300627; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003426620300627?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ando.2020.04.005,185

However, data on outcomes and mortality rates are inconsistent between studies. METHODS: A literature search and meta-analysis were performed on studies reporting the mortality of patients with STEMI admitted before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Additionally, prehospital and intrahospital delay times were evaluated. RESULTS: Outcomes of a total of 50 123 patients from 10 studies were assessed. Our study revealed that, despite a significant reduction in overall admission rates of patients with STEMI during the COVID-19 pandemic (incidence rate ratio=0.789, 95% CI 0.730 to 0.852, I(2)=77%, p<0.01), there was no significant difference in hospital mortality (OR=1.178, 95% CI 0.926 to 1.498, I(2)=57%, p=0.01) compared with patients with STEMI admitted before the outbreak. Time from the onset of symptoms to first medical contact was similar (mean difference (MD)=33.4 min, 95% CI −10.2 to 77.1, I(2)=88%, p<0.01) while door-to-balloon time was significantly prolonged in those presenting during the pandemic (MD=7.3 min, 95% CI 3.0 to 11.7, I(2)=95%, p<0.01). CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in admission of patients with STEMI was not associated with a significant increase of hospital mortality rates. The causes for reduced incidence rates remain speculative. However, the analysed data indicate that acute and timely medical care of these patients has been maintained during the pandemic in most countries. Long-term data on mortality have yet to be determined.","Rattka, Manuel; Dreyhaupt, Jens; Winsauer, Claudia; Stuhler, Lina; Baumhardt, Michael; Thiessen, Kevin; Rottbauer, Wolfgang; Imhof, Armin",Heart,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33334863/; https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2020-318360,185

The actual coronavirus disease (COVID-19) situation, especially in regions that are less affected, has not yet been determined. This study aimed to assess the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs working in a frontline hospital in Tokyo, Japan. In this cross-sectional observational study, screening was performed on consented HCWs, including medical, nursing, and other workers, as part of a mandatory health checkup. The screening test results and clinical characteristics of the participants were recorded. The antibody seroprevalence rate among the 4147 participants screened between July 6 and August 21, 2020, was 0.34% (14/4147). There was no significant difference in the seroprevalence rate between frontline HCWs with a high exposure risk and HCWs working in other settings with a low exposure risk. Of those seropositive for SARS-CoV-2, 64% (9/14) were not aware of any symptoms and had not previously been diagnosed with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study provides insights into the extent of infection and immune status in HCWs in Japan, which has a relatively low prevalence of COVID-19.

650643,Remaining Challenges With Transcatheter Left Atrial Appendage Closure,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND: The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance cooperation (MBDS) is one of several sub-regional disease surveillance networks that have emerged in recent years as an approach to transnational cooperation for infectious disease prevention and control. Since 2003 MBDS has pioneered a unique model for local cross-border cooperation. This study examines stakeholders’ perspectives of these MBDS experiences, based on a survey of local managers and semi-structured interviews with MBDS leaders and the central coordinator. RESULTS: Fifteen managers from 12 of 20 paired cross-border sites completed a written survey. They all monitor most or all of the 17 diseases agreed upon for MBDS surveillance information sharing. Fourteen agreed or strongly agreed with statements about the core MBDS values of cooperation, mutual trust, and transparency, and their own contributions to national and regional disease control (average score of 4.4 of 5.0). Respondents felt they implemented well to very well activities related to surveillance reporting (average scores 3.4 to 3.9 of 4.0), using computers for their work (3.9/4.0), and using surveillance data for action (3.8/4.0). Respondents reported that they did worst in implementing research (2.1/4.0) and somewhat poorly for local laboratory testing (2.9/4.0) and local coordination with cross-border counterparts (2.9/4.0), although all 15 maintain a list with contact information for these counterparts and many know their counterparts. Implementation of specified activities within their collective regional action plan was uneven across the cross-border sites. Most respondents reported positive lessons learned about local cooperation, information sharing and joint problem solving, based on trusting relationships with their cross-border counterparts. They recommend expansion of cross-border sites within MBDS and consideration of the cross-border cooperation model by other sub-regional networks. CONCLUSIONS: MBDS has over a decade of experience with its model of local cross-border cooperation in disease surveillance and control. Frontline managers have documented success with this model, strongly support it and recommend its expansion within and beyond the MBDS network. The MBDS cross-border cooperation model is standing the test of time as a solid approach to building and sustaining the public health capabilities needed for disease surveillance and control from the local to national and global levels.

Minimally invasive methods and upgraded surgical instruments maximize the benefits of surgery also in complex cardiac revision cases with substantial perioperative risk. CASE PRESENTATION: A 68 y.o. patient, 10 years after previous sternotomy for OPCAB was referred to cardiac surgery on the 10th postoperative day after neurosurgical intervention for intracerebral bleeding with suspected mitral valve endocarditis. Mitral valve vegetation, tricuspid valve insufficiency and coronary stenosis were diagnosed and treated by minimally invasive revision cardiac surgery on the 14th postoperative day after neurosurgery. CONCLUSION: The present clinical case demonstrates for the first time that the minimally invasive approach via right anterior mini-thoracotomy can be safely used for concomitant complex mitral valve reconstruction, tricuspid valve repair and aorto-coronary bypass surgery, even as a revision procedure in the presence of florid endocarditis after recent neurosurgical intervention. The Covid-19 pandemic and prophylactic patient isolation slow down the efficacy of pulmonary weaning and mobilisation and prolong the need for ICU treatment, without adversely affecting long-term outcome.","Andrási, Terézia B.; Abudureheman, Nunijiati; Glück, Alannah; Vondran, Maximilian; Dinges, Gerhard; Talipov, Ildar; Rastan, Ardawan J.",J Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34167559/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13019-021-01517-8,185

As medical students use the Internet extensively for work, we asked how researchers control for work-related Internet activity, and the extent to which this influences interpretations of “addiction” rates. A search of PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar was conducted on the search phrase of “medical students” and “internet addiction” in March 2020. In total, 98 studies met our criteria, 88 (90%) used Young’s Internet Addiction Test, and the studies’ IA rates ranged widely. Little note was taken of work-related activity, and, when discussed, had little to no impact on the interpretation of Internet “addiction”. Studies seldom accounted for work-related activities, researcher bias appears to influence their position, “usage” appears conflated with “addiction”, and correlations between “addiction” and negative behaviours are frequently confused with one-way causation. In spite of IA’s not being officially recognised, few researchers questioned its validity. While IA may exist among medical students, its measurement is flawed; given the use of the Internet as a crucial medical education tool, there is the risk that conscientious students will be labelled “addicted”, and poor academic performance may be attributed to this “addiction”.","Masters, Ken; Loda, Teresa; Tervooren, Finja; Herrmann-Werner, Anne",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34300132/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18147681,185

Since the beginning of the pandemic, there has been a global campaign on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to curtail the spread of the virus. However, the number of cases, mortality, and hospitalization continue to rise globally, including in the United States. We developed a mathematical model to assess the impact of a public health education program on the coronavirus outbreak in the US. Our simulation showed the prospect of an effective public health education program in reducing both the cumulative and daily mortality of the novel coronavirus.

Harnessing an underutilized resource, 4th-year advanced pharmacy practice experience (APPE) students, allows for expanded ASP involvement and scope of practice. We aim to outline and provide insight on how 4th-year APPE students serve as an asset to an ASP. Through our novel longitudinal rotation experience, APPE students complete penicillin allergy assessments, patient education, and work alongside a clinical pharmacist to refer patients for penicillin skin testing if appropriate. Students also achieve many of the education standards required by the Accreditation Counsel for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) for graduation within the Doctor of Pharmacy degree while developing a strong foundation in antimicrobial stewardship and gaining invaluable knowledge for their future. The addition of APPE pharmacy students to our ASP has also enabled our program to achieve its goals and expand involvement and reach within our facility.","Ward, Tiffany; Fredenrich, Jaela",Pharmacy (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmacy9030135; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449701/,185

There is currently limited support to help individuals conduct these behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report current household infection control behaviors in the United Kingdom and examine how they might be improved. METHODS: This was a pragmatic cross-sectional observational study of anonymous participant data from Germ Defence between May 6-24, 2020. Germ Defence is an open-access fully automated website providing behavioral advice for infection control within households. A total of 28,285 users sought advice from four website pathways based on household status (advice to protect themselves generally, to protect others if the user was showing symptoms, to protect themselves if household members were showing symptoms, and to protect a household member who is at high risk). Users reported current infection control behaviors within the home and intentions to change these behaviors. RESULTS: Current behaviors varied across all infection control measures but were between sometimes (face covering: mean 1.61, SD 1.19; social distancing: mean 2.40, SD 1.22; isolating: mean 2.78, SD 1.29; putting packages and shopping aside: mean 2.75, SD 1.55) and quite often (cleaning and disinfecting: mean 3.17, SD 1.18), except for handwashing (very often: mean 4.00, SD 1.03). Behaviors were similar regardless of the website pathway used. After using Germ Defence, users recorded intentions to improve infection control behavior across all website pathways and for all behaviors (overall average infection control score mean difference 0.30, 95% CI 0.29-0.31). CONCLUSIONS: Self-reported infection control behaviors other than handwashing are lower than is optimal for infection prevention, although handwashing is much higher.

IgA and IgG were detected in 55.71% (95% CI 49.89-61.54) and 60.71% (95% CI 54.98-66.45) of the individuals tested, respectively. From the total number (n=280), 80.11% of positive individuals (95%; CI 74.24-85.98) were positive for both IgA and IgG Abs. All individuals with COVID-19-related symptoms on the day of blood collection (n=11) were positive for IgG, while IgA was detected in 84.61% (n=55) of individuals who had presented symptoms several weeks before the blood collection. Individuals aged 30-39 were more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (prevalence ratio [PR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.58-1.03; p=0.033). People whose main source of information on COVID-19 was religious leaders or friends showed higher susceptibility to infection (PR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00-1.49; p=0.040). In addition, individuals who left home more frequently were at higher risk of infection (PR 1.22; 95% CI 1.00-1.49; p=0.048). Five or more individuals per household increased almost 5-fold the risk of virus transmission (Odds ratio [OR] 2.56; 95% CI; 1.09-6.01; p=0.019). Over 95% of the study population had no access to clean water and/or sanitation. Conclusions: The disproportionate dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 infection observed in the Parque das Tribos urban indigenous community might be driven by typical cultural behavior and socioeconomic inequalities. Despite the pandemic threat, this population is not being targeted by public policies and appears to be chronically invisible to the Brazilian authorities.","Soares Pontes, G.; de Melo Silva, J.; Pinheiro-Silva, R.; Nogueira Barbosa, A.; Cardenes Santos, L.; de Padua Quirino Ramalho, A.; de Castro Alves, C.

658620,"Association between pre-existing respiratory disease and its treatment, and severe COVID-19: a population cohort study",2021-04-01,"BACKGROUND: During their studies, future physicians are often taught that while evaluating a patient they should first consider a common diagnosis and not a rare one. Consequently, although most physicians will face the diagnosis or treatment of a rare disease (RD) at some point in their professional lives, many assume that they might never meet a patient with a specific RD. Moreover, many physicians lack knowledge about RDs and are not prepared for caring for RD patients. Thus, the aim of this paper was to assess the awareness of RDs among Polish physicians. METHODS: The study was conducted among 165 medical doctors taking their specialization courses at the Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland. The questionnaire assessed physicians’ knowledge about the number, examples, etiology and estimated frequency of RDs. It also checked the self-assessment of physicians competence in RDs, as well as their opinions about university curricula in this respect. RESULTS: The study shows that while most physicians lacked basic knowledge about the etiology, epidemiology and prevalence of RDs, many had also problems with separating RDs from more common disorders. Moreover, 94.6% of physicians perceived their knowledge on RDs as insufficient or very poor and less than 5% feel prepared for caring for patients with RDs. Simultaneously, while over 83% of physicians believed that RDs constitute a serious public health issue, 17% were of the opinion that mandatory courses on RDs are not necessary in medical curricula and 6.7% were not interested in broadening their knowledge of such diseases. Most respondents derived their knowledge on RDs from university courses, scientific literature and research, as well as from the Internet. CONCLUSION: Since the study shows that there is a urgent need to fill the gap in physicians’ knowledge on RDs, it seems advisable that extra courses on these diseases should be added to medical curricula and physicians’ postgraduate training. Furthermore, as the Internet is the main source of information on RDs, e-learning programs and courses for all medical professionals should be organized.","Walkowiak, Dariusz; Domaradzki, Jan",Orphanet J Rare Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13023-021-02023-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34583737/,185

Here, we assessed the replicative ability and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Syrian hamsters. SARS-CoV-2 isolates replicated efficiently in the lungs of hamsters, causing severe pathological lung lesions following intranasal infection. In addition, microcomputed tomographic imaging revealed severe lung injury that shared characteristics with SARS-CoV-2−infected human lung, including severe, bilateral, peripherally distributed, multilobular ground glass opacity, and regions of lung consolidation. SARS-CoV-2−infected hamsters mounted neutralizing antibody responses and were protected against subsequent rechallenge with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, passive transfer of convalescent serum to naïve hamsters efficiently suppressed the replication of the virus in the lungs even when the serum was administrated 2 d postinfection of the serum-treated hamsters. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that this Syrian hamster model will be useful for understanding SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and testing vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Imai, Masaki; Iwatsuki-Horimoto, Kiyoko; Hatta, Masato; Loeber, Samantha; Halfmann, Peter J.; Nakajima, Noriko; Watanabe, Tokiko; Ujie, Michiko; Takahashi, Kenta; Ito, Mutsumi; Yamada, Shinya; Fan, Shufang; Chiba, Shiho; Kuroda, Makoto; Guan, Lizheng; Takada, Kosuke; Armbrust, Tammy; Balogh, Aaron; Furusawa, Yuri; Okuda, Moe; Ueki, Hiroshi; Yasuhara, Atsuhiro; Sakai-Tagawa, Yuko; Lopes, Tiago J.

Respiratory infectious viruses may be released in the air, resulting in cross-infection between patients and medical workers. Indoor ventilation systems can be adjusted to affect fine particles containing viruses. This study was aimed at performing a series of experiments to evaluate the ventilation performance and assess the exposure of healthcare workers (HW) to virus-laden particles released by patients in a confined experimental chamber. In a typical ward setting, four categories (top supply and exhaust, side supply and exhaust) were evaluated, encompassing 16 different air distribution patterns. The maximum reduction in the cumulative exposure level for HW was 70.8% in ventilation strategy D (upper diffusers on the sidewall supply and lower diffusers on the same sidewall return). The minimum value of the cumulative exposure level for a patient close to the source of the contamination pertained to Strategy E (upper diffusers on the sidewall supply and lower diffusers on the opposite sidewall return). Lateral ventilation strategies can provide significant guidance for ward operation to minimizing the airborne virus contamination.

METHODS: We retrospectively analysed 276 patients admitted to the Siirt Training and Research Hospital Urology outpatients clinic between 15 March 2020 and 9 August 2020 with a complaint of flank pain and undergoing non-contrast abdominal CT. A total of 10 patients with COVID-19 compatible findings in CT were defined as the study group. A control group was formed from 10 patients with only urological pathologies (kidney stones, ureteral stones, and hydronephrosis) without a COVID-19 compatible appearance on CT. RESULTS: Ten (3.6 %) patients were identified with COVID-19 and pneumonic infiltrations in the basal regions of the lungs; diagnosis was made by cross-sectional abdominal CT. The visual analog scale (VAS) score of flank pain was significantly higher in the control group (p<0.001); these subjects had urological pathology and no evidence of COVID-19 in the basal regions of the lungs on abdominal CT. There were no signs of COVID-19 disease detected during the admissions procedure in the urology outpatient clinic, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath.

The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARS-CoV-2. However, previous studies only characterized short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7-10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identified that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detectable. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of 2.5 × 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.","Hao, Siyuan; Ning, Kang; Kuz, Cagla Aksu; Vorhies, Kai; Yan, Ziying; Qiu, Jianming",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.271130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869024/,185

In our region, the police bureau delivers critical incident training to public schools, offering instruction in responding to violent or dangerous situations. Until now, widespread training in hemorrhage control has been lacking. Our group developed, implemented and evaluated a novel program integrating hemorrhage control into critical incident training for school staff in order to blunt the impact of mass casualty events on children. METHODS: The staff of 25 elementary and middle schools attended a 90-minute course incorporating Stop the Bleed into the critical incident training curriculum, delivered on-site by police officers, nurses and doctors over a three-day period. The joint program was named Protect Our Kids. At the conclusion of the course, hemorrhage control kits and educational materials were provided and a four-question survey to assess the quality of training using a ten-point Likert scale was completed by participants and trainers. RESULTS: One thousand eighteen educators underwent training. A majority were teachers (78.2%), followed by para-educators (5.8%), counselors (4.4%) and principals (2%).

Current treatments are limited in both availability and efficacy, such that improving our understanding of the factors that facilitate infection is urgently needed to more effectively treat infected individuals and to curb the pandemic. We and others have previously demonstrated the significance of interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, integrin α5β1, and human ACE2 to facilitate viral entry into host cells in vitro. We previously found that inhibition of integrin α5β1 by the clinically validated small peptide ATN-161 inhibits these spike protein interactions and cell infection in vitro. In continuation with our previous findings, here we have further evaluated the therapeutic potential of ATN-161 on SARS-CoV-2 infection in k18-hACE2 transgenic (SARS-CoV-2 susceptible) mice in vivo. We discovered that treatment with single- or repeated intravenous doses of ATN-161 (1 mg/kg) within 48 hours after intranasal inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 lead to a reduction of lung viral load, viral immunofluorescence and improved lung histology in a majority of mice 72 hours post-infection. Furthermore, ATN-161 reduced SARS-CoV-2-induced increased expression of lung integrin α5 and αv (an α5-related integrin that has also been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 interactions) as well as the C–X–C motif chemokine ligand 10 (Cxcl10), further supporting the potential involvement of these integrins, and the anti-inflammatory potential of ATN-161, respectively, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting integrin α5β1 in SARS-CoV-2 infection in vivo and supports the development of ATN-161 as a novel SARS-CoV-2 therapy.","Amruta, Narayanappa; Engler-Chiurazzi, Elizabeth B.; Murray-Brown, Isabel C.; Gressett, Timothy E.; Biose, Ifechukwude J.; Chastain, Wesley H.; Bix, Gregory",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.08.443275,185

METHODS: We studied 572 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, confirmed using polymerase chain reaction for whom a chest CT was performed at hospital admission. Visual quantification was used to classify patients as per the percentage of lung parenchyma affected by COVID-19 lesions: normal CT, 0%–10%, 11%–25%, 26%–50%, 51%–75%, and >75%.

The Netherlands started with containment yet shifted to mitigation when a ‘mild’ lockdown was implemented. The initial focus was to obtain herd immunity while preventing Intensive Care Units from getting overwhelmed. METHODS: An in-depth analysis of available national and international COVID-19 data sources was conducted. Due to regional variation in COVID-19 hospitalization rates, this paper focuses on three distinct regions; the initial epicenter; the most northern provinces which – contrary to national policy – decided not to switch to mitigation; and the Bible Belt, as congregations of religious groups were initially excluded from the ban on group formation. RESULTS: On August 11(th), 6,159 COVID-19 deaths were reported with excess mortality rates about 70% higher. As a result of the pandemic, the economy took a severe hit and is predicted to reduce by 6.5% compared to prognosis. The hospitalization rates in the northern regions are over 70% lower as compared to the rest of the country (18 vs 66 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively). Differences between the Bible Belt and the rest of the country were hardly detectable. CONCLUSION: the Dutch have shown a way to effectively slow down transmission while allowing more personal and economic freedom than most other countries. Furthermore, the regional differences suggest that containment with testing and tracing reduced the virus dissemination.

Mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) can be utilized as part of the telehealth encounter to monitor patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and enhance patient-provider communication. METHODS: A systematic review was performed of mHealth apps that include symptom trackers. We searched the iOS App Store and Andriod Google Play using the words “cancer,” “oncology,” and “symptom tracker.” Apps were included if they incorporated a symptom tracking function that could allow cancer patients to record symptoms and PROs. Apps were evaluated using the Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS), which includes engagement, functionality, aesthetics, information, and app subjective quality. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 1189 apps, with 101 apps eligible after title and description screening. A total of 41 apps met eligibility criteria and were included in this study. The majority of apps (73%, n=30) were general health/pain symptom trackers, while 27% (n=11) were cancer-specific. The app quality mean scores assessed using MARS ranged from 2.43 to 4.23 (out of 5.00). Only one app has been trialed for usability among cancer patients.

METHODS: A convenience sample of 6 US living liver donor programs evaluated 398 consecutive donor candidates in 2018, ending with the March 12, 2020, COVID-19 emergency. RESULTS: For 333/398 (83.7%), the donor or program decided whether to donate; 166/333 (49.8%) were approved, and 167/333 (50.2%) were not or opted out. Approval rates varied by program, from 27.0% to 63.3% (median, 46%; intraquartile range, 37.3-51.1%). Of those approved, 90.4% were white, 57.2% were women, 83.1% were < 50 years, and 85.5% had more than a high school education. Of 167 candidates, 131 (78.4%) were not approved or opted out because of: medical risk (10.7%); chronic liver disease risk (11.5%); psychosocial reasons (5.3%); candidate declined (6.1%); anatomical reasons increasing recipient risk (26.0%); recipient-related reasons (33.6%); finances (1.5%); or other (5.3%). CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive national registry is feasible and necessary to better understand candidate selection and long-term outcomes. As a result, the US Health Resources and Services Administration asked SRTR to expand the pilot to include all US living donor programs.","Kasiske, Bertram L; Ahn, Yoon Son; Conboy, Michael; Dew, Mary Amanda; Folken, Christian; Levan, Macey L; Humar, Abhi; Israni, Ajay K; Rudow, Dianne LaPointe; Trotter, James F; Massie, Allan B; Musgrove, Donald",Clin. transplant,https://doi.org/10.1111/ctr.14394; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34342054/,185

667430,Critical Complications of COVID-19: A systematic Review and Meta-Analysis study,2020-06-16,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic illuminated the benefits of telemedicine. Self-collected specimens are a promising alternative to clinician-collected specimens when in-person testing is not feasible. In this study, we assessed the adequacy of self-collected pharyngeal and rectal specimens for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae among individuals undergoing chlamydia and gonorrhea screening. METHODS: We used data from a large cohort study that included male and female adolescents between the ages of 12–24 years. We considered self-collected specimens adequate for clinical use if the human synthase gene (a control target of the assay) was detected in the specimen. RESULTS: In total, 2,458 specimens were included in the analysis. The human synthase gene was detected in 99.2% (2,439/2,458) of all self-collected specimens, 99.5% (1,108/1,114) of the pharyngeal specimens, and 99.0% (1,331/1,344) of the rectal specimens. CONCLUSION: Self-collected pharyngeal and rectal specimens demonstrated a very high proportion of human gene presence, suggesting that self-collection was accurate. A limitation of this study is that the sample adequacy control detects the presence or absence of the human hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene, but it does not indicate the specific anatomic origin of the human hydroxymethylbilane synthase gene. Self-collected specimens may be an appropriate alternative to clinician-collected specimens.","Vavala, Gabriella; Goldbeck, Cameron; Bristow, Claire C.; Stafylis, Chrysovalantis; Adamson, Paul C.; Polanco, Dianna; Ocasio, Manuel A.; Fournier, Jasmine; Romero-Espinoza, Adriana; Flynn, Risa; Bolan, Robert; Fernandez, M.

668053,The association between socioeconomic status and pandemic influenza: Systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-09-07,"Background: Mental health burden has been massively reported during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Aiming to summarise these data, we present a meta-review of meta-analyses that evaluated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety, depressive and stress symptoms, psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder/symptoms (PTSD), and sleep disturbance, reporting its prevalence on general public (GP) and health care workers (HCW). Methods: A search was performed in the PubMed, EMBASE, and the Web of Science. Sleep disturbances, psychological distress, stress, and burnout were grouped as “Psychophysiological stress,” and anxiety, depression, and PTSD were grouped as “Psychopathology.” A random-effects model, calculating the pooled prevalence together with 95% confidence interval was performed for each domain. Subgroup analyses were performed for each population type (GP and HCW) and for each mental health outcome. For anxiety and depression, subgroup analysis for population type was performed. Heterogeneity is reported as I(2). Publication bias was assessed through visual inspection of the funnel plot, and further tested by Egger's test and trim and fill analyses. Results: A total of 18 meta-analyses were included. The prevalence of psychophysiological stress was 31.99% (CI: 26.88–37.58, I(2) = 99.9%). HCW showed a higher prevalence (37.74%, CI: 33.26–42.45, I(2) = 99.7%) than the GP (20.67%, 15.07–27.66, I(2) = 99.9%). The overall prevalence of insomnia, psychological distress, and stress were, respectively, 32.34% (CI: 25.65–39.84), 28.25% (CI: 18.12–41.20), and 36% (CI: 29.31–43.54). Psychopathology was present at 26.45% (CI: 24.22–28.79, I(2) = 99.9%) of the sample, with similar estimates for population (HCW 26.14%, CI: 23.37–29.12, I(2) = 99.9%; GP: 26.99%, CI: 23.41–30.9, I(2) = 99.9%). The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and PTSD was 27.77% (CI: 24.47–31.32), 26.93% (CI: 23.92–30.17), and 20% (CI: 15.54–24.37), respectively. Similar proportions between populations were found for anxiety (HCW = 27.5%, CI: 23.78–31.55; GP = 28.33%, CI: 22.1–35.5) and depression (HCW = 27.05%, CI: 23.14–31.36; GP = 26.7%, CI: 22.32–31.59). Asymmetry in the funnel plot was found, and a slight increase in the estimate of overall psychopathology (29.08%, CI: 26.42–31.89) was found after the trim and fill analysis.

The aim of this study is to examine the incidence and outcomes of all COVID-19 patients with rheumatologic conditions in Hong Kong. METHODS: This is a population-based retrospective study. All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR with a previous diagnosis of rheumatologic diseases were reviewed. The incidence of COVID-19 in patients with rheumatologic conditions was calculated and compared to the general population in Hong Kong. Descriptive data of those rheumatologic patients with COVID-19 and the clinical course of the index infection were presented. RESULTS: Up till 27 May 2020, there were 1067 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Hong Kong which had a population of 7.5 million. Out of the 39,835 patients with underlying rheumatologic diseases, we identified 5 PCR confirmed COVID-19 cases. The estimated incidence of COVID-19 was 1.26 cases per 100,000 patients with rheumatologic diseases, compared to 1.42 per 100,000 in the general population. All 5 patients had inflammatory arthropathies. One patient was on hydroxychloroquine and sulphasalazine, and one was on methotrexate. None of the 3534 patients on b/tsDMARDs was infected. Four patients had leucopenia/lymphopenia and stool viral PCR was positive in 3 patients. All patients made uneventful recovery without complications or flare of underlying diseases.

668739,In Reply - Lack of Significant Association Between Gastrointestinal Symptoms and COVID-19 Mortality: An Updated Meta-Analysis Based on Adjusted Effect Estimates,2021-04-21,"BACKGROUND: In resource-limited settings, acute respiratory infections continue to be the leading cause of death in young children. We conducted postmortem investigations in children <5 years hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of respiratory disease at Kenya’s largest referral hospital. METHODS: We collected respiratory and other tissues postmortem to examine pathologic processes using histology, molecular and immunohistochemistry assays. Nasopharyngeal, trachea, bronchi and lung specimens were tested using 21-target respiratory pathogen real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays deployed on Taqman Array Cards. Expert panels reviewed all findings to determine causes of death and associated pathogens. RESULTS: From 2014 to 2015, we investigated 64 pediatric deaths (median age 7 months). Pneumonia was determined as cause of death in 70% (42/52) of cases where death was associated with an infectious disease process. The main etiologies of pneumonia deaths were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (n=7, 19%), Pneumocystis jirovecii (n=7, 19%), influenza A (n=5, 14%) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=5, 14%)—10% of cases had multi-pathogen involvement. Among the other 10 deaths associated with a nonpneumonia infectious process, 4 did not have an etiology assigned, the others were associated with miliary tuberculosis (2), cerebral thrombosis due to HIV (1), Enterobacteriaceae (1), rotavirus (1), and 1 case of respiratory infection with severe hypokalemia associated with RSV. CONCLUSIONS: In spite of well-established vaccination programs in Kenya, some deaths were still vaccine preventable. Accelerated development of RSV monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, introduction of seasonal influenza vaccination, and maintenance or improved uptake of existing vaccines can contribute to further reductions in childhood mortality.","Njuguna, Henry N.; Zaki, Sherif R.; Roberts, Drucilla J.; Rogena, Emily A.; Walong, Edwin; Fligner, Corinne L.; Keating, M.

However, it is not clear yet, how this new technology should be integrated into current and established clinical practice and a consensus should be found about recommended indications, stereotactic targets, patient selection, and outcome measurements. Objective: To sum up and unify current knowledge and clinical experience of Swiss neurological and neurosurgical communities regarding MRgHiFUS interventions for brain disorders to be published as a national consensus paper. Methods: Eighteen experienced neurosurgeons and neurologists practicing in Switzerland in the field of movement disorders and one health physicist representing 15 departments of 12 Swiss clinical centers and 5 medical societies participated in the workshop and contributed to the consensus paper. All experts have experience with current treatment modalities or with MRgHiFUS. They were invited to participate in two workshops and consensus meetings and one online meeting. As part of workshop preparations, a thorough literature review was undertaken and distributed among participants together with a list of relevant discussion topics. Special emphasis was put on current experience and practice, and areas of controversy regarding clinical application of MRgHiFUS for functional neurosurgery. Results: The recommendations addressed lesioning for treatment of brain disorders in general, and with respect to MRgHiFUS indications, stereotactic targets, treatment alternatives, patient selection and management, standardization of reporting and follow-up, and initialization of a national registry for interventional therapies of movement disorders. Good clinical evidence is presently only available for unilateral thalamic lesioning in treating essential tremor or tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease and, to a minor extent, for unilateral subthalamotomy for Parkinson's disease motor features. However, the workgroup unequivocally recommends further exploration and adaptation of MRgHiFUS-based functional lesioning interventions and confirms the need for outcome-based evaluation of these approaches based on a unified registry. MRgHiFUS and DBS should be evaluated by experts familiar with both methods, as they are mutually complementing therapy options to be appreciated for their distinct advantages and potential. Conclusion: This multidisciplinary consensus paper is a representative current recommendation for safe implementation and standardized practice of MRgHiFUS treatments for functional neurosurgery in Switzerland.","Stieglitz, Lennart H.; Oertel, Markus F.; Accolla, Ettore A.; Bally, Julien; Bauer, Roland; Baumann, Christian R.; Benninger, David; Bohlhalter, Stephan; Büchele, Fabian; Hägele-Link, Stefan; Kägi, Georg; Krack, Paul; Krüger, Marie T.; Mahendran, Sujitha; Möller, J.

671263,Cardiovascular complications in COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND: Understanding the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is urgently required given its policy implications in relation to the reopening of schools and intergenerational contacts. METHODS: We conducted a rapid review of studies that investigated the role of children in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We synthesized evidence for four categories: 1) studies reporting documented cases of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by infected children; 2) studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by (both symptomatic and asymptomatic) children; 3) studies reporting cluster outbreaks of COVID-19 in schools; 4) studies estimating the proportions of children infected by SARS-CoV-2, and reported results narratively. RESULTS: A total of 16 unique studies were included for narrative synthesis. There is limited evidence detailing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from infected children. We found two studies that reported a 3-month-old whose parents developed symptomatic COVID-19 seven days after caring for the infant and two children who may have contracted COVID-19 from the initial cases at a school in New South Wales. In addition, we identified six studies presenting indirect evidence on the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission by children, three of which found prolonged virus shedding in stools. There is little data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. We identified only two studies reporting outbreaks of COVID-19 in school settings and one case report of a child attending classes but not infecting any other pupils or staff. Lastly, we identified six studies estimating the proportion of children infected; data from population-based studies in Iceland, Italy, South Korea, Netherlands, California and a hospital-based study in the UK suggest children may be less likely to be infected. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results from population-based and school-based studies suggest that children may be less frequently infected or infect others, however current evidence is limited. Prolonged faecal shedding observed in studies highlights the potentially increased risk of faeco-oral transmission in children. Further seroprevalence studies (powered adequately for the paediatric population) are urgently required to establish whether children are in fact less likely to be infected compared to adults.

OBJECTIVES: To measure the self-perceived impact of oral health on the quality of life of Brazilian women in detention. Methodology. A survey was carried out conducted in the penitentiary at Juiz de Fora (Minas Gerais, Brazil) using an instrument with semistructured questions and validated scales, including the Oral Health Impact Profile-14. 99 women were interviewed. The analysis was based on a theoretical model of determination, with hierarchical blocks of variables. Bivariate analysis was done using the Mann–Whitney, test and multivariate analysis was used using linear regression. The significance level was set at 5%. RESULTS: 33% experienced tooth loss after incarceration, (3.70 ± 3.26 lost teeth). 65.6% rated the dental service as fair/poor. The highest prevalence of oral health impact was for the domains of psychological discomfort (50.5%) and physical pain (40.4%). There is a negative impact on psychological discomfort: the number of dental consultations in the past year and self-perceived general health. There is an impact on physical pain: self-declared color and anxiety. Self-perceived general health had an impact on the domains of psychological disability and social disadvantage.

The efficacy of veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) for COVID-19 on longer term outcomes, unlike in other viral pneumonias, is unknown. In this study we aimed to compare the 6-month mortality of patients receiving VV-ECMO support for COVID-19 with a historical viral ARDS cohort. Fifty-three consecutive patients with COVID-19 ARDS admitted for VV-ECMO to the Royal Brompton Hospital between 17/03/2020 and 30/05/2020 were identified.

672594,Efficacy of tocilizumab treatment in severely ill COVID-19 patients,2020-08-27,"OBJECTIVES: As global vaccination campaigns against COVID-19 disease commence, vaccine safety needs to be closely assessed. The safety profile of mRNA-based vaccines in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases (AIIRD) is unknown. The objective of this report is to raise awareness to reactivation of herpes zoster (HZ) following the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in patients with AIIRD. METHODS: The safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination was assessed in an observational study monitoring post-vaccination adverse effects in patients with AIIRD (n = 491) and controls (n = 99), conducted in two Rheumatology Departments in Israel. RESULTS: The prevalence of HZ was 1.2% (n = 6) in patients with AIIRD compared with none in controls. Six female patients aged 49 ± 11 years with stable AIIRD: rheumatoid arthritis (n = 4), Sjogren’s syndrome (n = 1), and undifferentiated connective disease (n = 1), developed the first in a lifetime event of HZ within a short time after the first vaccine dose in 5 cases and after the second vaccine dose in one case. In the majority of cases, HZ infection was mild, except a case of HZ ophthalmicus, without corneal involvement, in RA patient treated with tofacitinib. There were no cases of disseminated HZ disease or postherpetic neuralgia. All but one patient received antiviral treatment with a resolution of HZ-related symptoms up to 6 weeks. Five patients completed the second vaccine dose without other adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Epidemiologic studies on the safety of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines in patients with AIIRD are needed to clarify the association between the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination and reactivation of zoster.","Furer, Victoria; Zisman, Devy; Kibari, Adi; Rimar, Doron; Paran, Yael; Elkayam, Ori",Rheumatology (Oxford),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33848321/; https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab345,185

The thermal flow of human body was imitated using a 3D thermal manikin with real body features, while a recent developed multi-component Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was used to address the effects of inhomogeneous temperature and humidity fields on droplet evaporation. By comparing the results yielded without and with the human body heat, the outcomes demonstrated strong impact of human body heat on the droplets mass fraction and local air velocity distributions. Inspirable droplets could potentially drop into respirable droplets by evaporation, although the evaporation rate was not significantly affected by body heat. The thermal effect of human body revealed its vital impacts on the time-dependent droplets dispersion. Due to the buoyancy driven thermal flow, both the vertical velocity and displacement of small droplets (≤20 μm) were completely reversed from descending to ascending, while the deposition time of large droplets (≥50 μm) were significantly delayed. With the reduced droplet size by evaporation and droplets lifted into breathing zone by human thermal effect, the inhalability and infection risks of cough droplets would be much higher in real occupied indoor spaces.","Yan, Yihuan; Li, Xiangdong; Tu, Jiyuan",Build Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2018.10.039; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132318306644; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132318306644; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287988/,185

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This paper included three studies. The observational study reported the trends of blood collection during the epidemic in Guangzhou, China. The cross‐sectional survey investigated factors influencing blood donation during the COVID‐19 epidemic, and a self‐administered questionnaire was given to 1,584 street whole blood donors (SWBDs) who donated during the epidemic. The randomized controlled trial involved 19,491 SWBDs who donated in 2019 but did not donate during the epidemic. Trial participants were randomly assigned to two intervention groups: group 1 completed Questionnaire 1, which contained precautionary measures in response to COVID‐19 and other messages about blood donation during the epidemic; and group 2 completed Questionnaire 2, which did not include this information. A control group did not receive any questionnaire. RESULTS: As measures implemented, the number of blood donors increased accordingly. Both first‐time and repeat SWBDs perceived the same level of blood need and donated blood because it would save lives. SWBDs who completed Questionnaire 1 expressed a greater intention to donate during the epidemic. Enabling blood donors to perceive a higher level of blood need and a lower level of COVID‐19 infection risk related to blood donation mobilized experienced SWBDs to donate within three weeks. Intention‐to‐treat analyses and average‐treatment‐effect‐on‐the‐treated estimations confirmed that Questionnaire 1 could motivate SWBDs to actually donate blood. CONCLUSION: Various measures could ease blood shortage during the COVID‐19 epidemic. Administration of Questionnaire 1 could increase blood donations during the epidemic.

A shortage of effective control measures has led to the virus becoming endemic in domestic pig populations. This study aimed to describe how our intervention measures were implemented for PEDV elimination in an enzootically infected farm. We operated a risk assessment model of PEDV recurrence to obtain information about the virus itself, herd immunity, virus circulation, and biosecurity at the farm. Next, we conducted a four-pillar-based two-track strategy to heighten sow immunity and eradicate the virus, with longitudinal monitoring of immunity and virus circulation, involving strict biosecurity, prime-boost pre-farrow L/K/K immunization, all-in-all-out and disinfection practices in farrowing houses, and disinfection and gilt management in wean-to-finish barns. In particular, we observed a high prevalence and long-term survival of PEDV in slurries, posing a critical challenge to PED eradication and highlighting the necessity for consecutive testing of barn slurry samples and for the management of infected manure to control PEDV. Genetic analysis of PEDVs in this farm indicated that genetic drift continued in the spike gene, with a substitution rate of 1.683 × 10(−4) substitutions/site/year. Our study underlines the need for active monitoring and surveillance of PEDV in herds and their environments, along with the coordinated means, to eliminate the virus and maintain a negative herd. The tools described in this study will serve as a framework for regional and national PED eradication programs.","Jang, Guehwan; Park, Jonghyun; Lee, Changhee",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34357980/; https://doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10070830,185

Particularly, since the end of 2020, several variants of concern have been identified around the world, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2). However, the existing mechanism of detecting important mutations are not always effective enough, since only a relatively small part of all pathogen samples can be examined by whole genome sequencing due to its high cost. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, we have designed special primer panel and used it for targeted highthroughput sequencing of several significant S-gene (spike) regions of SARS-CoV-2. The Illumina platform averaged approximately 50,000 paired-end reads with a length of ≥150 bp per sample. This method was used to examine 579 random samples obtained from COVID-19 patients in Moscow and the Moscow region from February to June 2021. RESULTS: This study demonstrated the dynamics of distribution of several SARS-CoV-2 strains and its some single mutations. It was found that the Delta strain appeared in the region in May 2021, and became prevalent in June, partially displacing other strains. DISCUSSION: The obtained results provide an opportunity to assign the viral samples to one of the strains, including the previously mentioned in time- and cost-effective manner. The approach can be used for standardization of the procedure of searching for mutations in individual regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome. It allows to get a more detailed data about the epidemiological situation in a region.","Borisova, N I; Kotov, I A; Kolesnikov, A A; Kaptelova, V V; Speranskaya, A S; Kondrasheva, L Yu; Tivanova, E V; Khafizov, K F; Akimkin, V G",Vopr Virusol,https://doi.org/10.36233/0507-4088-72; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34545719/,185

The aim was to provide a snapshot of current apps, instant messaging, and smartphone photography use in paediatric emergency care. A web-based self-report questionnaire was performed. Individual physicians working in paediatric emergency care recorded their personal practice. One hundred ninety-eight medical doctors completed the survey. Eight percent of respondents had access to institutional mobile devices to run medical apps. Eighty-six percent of respondents used medical apps on their personal mobile device, with 78% using Apple iOS devices. Forty-seven percent of respondents used formulary apps daily. Forty-nine percent of respondents had between 1–5 medical apps on their personal mobile device. Respondents who used medical apps had a total of 845 medical apps installed on their personal device, accounted for by 56 specific apps. The British National Formulary (BNF/BNFc) app was installed on the personal mobile device of 96% of respondents that use medical apps. Forty percent of respondents had patient confidentiality concerns when using medical apps. Thirty-eight percent of respondents have used consumer instant messaging services, 6% secure specialist messaging services, and 29% smartphone photography when seeking patient management advice. CONCLUSION: App use on the personal mobile devices, in the absence of access to institutional devices, was widespread, especially the use of a national formulary app. Instant messaging and smartphone photography were less common. A strategic decision has to be made to either provide staff with institutional devices or use software solutions to address data governance concerns when using personal devices.

We implemented management protocols based on the best available evidence and consensus among multidisciplinary teams. The current study reports our experience and outcomes using this protocol-based management strategy. METHODS: We included single or bilateral LT patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab between March 1, 2020, to December 15, 2020 (n=25; median age: 60, range 20-73 years; M: F 17:8). A group of patients with Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) infection during 2016-18 were included to serve as a comparator group (n=36). RESULTS: As compared to RSV, patients with COVID-19 were more likely to present with constitutional symptoms, spirometric decline, pulmonary opacities, new or worsening respiratory failure, and need for ventilator support. Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were less likely to receive a multimodality treatment strategy, and they experienced worse post-infection lung function loss, functional decline, and three-month survival. A significant proportion of patients with COVID-19 needed readmission for worsening allograft function (36.4%), and chronic kidney disease at initial presentation was associated with this complication. Lower pre-morbid FEV(1) appeared to increase the risk of new or worsening respiratory failure, which was associated with worse outcomes. Overall hospital survival was 88% (n=22). Follow-up data was available for all discharged patients (median: 43.5 days, range 15-287 days).

However, data about the consistent performance of RT-PCR assay on throat and anal swabs remain limited in paediatric patients. Here, we retrospectively reviewed RT-PCR-testing results of 212 paediatric patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at Wuhan Children’s Hospital. The diagnostic potential of these two types of specimens showed significant difference (positive rate: 78.2% on throat swabs vs. 52.6% on anal swabs, McNemar Test P = 0.0091) and exhibited a weak positive consistency (Kappa value was 0.311, P < 0.0001) in paediatric patients. Furthermore, viral loads detected on both throat and anal swabs also showed no significant difference (P = 0.9511) and correlation (Pearson r = 0.0434, P = 0.8406), and exhibited an inconsistent kinetic change through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Besides, viral loads in the throat and anal swabs were correlated with different types of immune states, immune-reactive phase, and the resolution phase/immunologic tolerance, respectively. These findings revealed that RT-PCR-testing on throat and anal swabs showed significant difference for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 infection and correlated with different immune state in paediatric patients.","Yuan, Chunhui; Zhu, Hongmin; Yang, Yuan; Cai, Xiaonan; Xiang, Feiyan; Wu, Huan; Yao, Cong; Xiang, Yun; Xiao, Han",Emerging microbes & infections,https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1771219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419639/,185
680660,Editorial: Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19): Psychological Reactions to the Pandemic,2021-08-30,"OBJECTIVES: Complications related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) may lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which has been reported to be among the known causes of mortality in such patients. This study aims to analyse the incidence of DIC in COVID-19 non-survivors and to assess the association between DIC and its comorbidities. METHODS: The medical records of 154 non-survivors of COVID-19, hospitalised between April 2020 and July 2020, were retrospectively analysed. The International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) criteria for DIC were applied to identify the occurrence of coagulopathy. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the association between DIC and its comorbidities. RESULTS: Out of 154 non-survivors, non-overt DIC was observed in 94.8% of the patients, whereas only 5.2% fulfilled the overt criteria of DIC with a mean age 64.6 years. The mortality rate was 4.5 times higher among men than women. The D-dimer level was >250 ng/ml in 68.8% of the patients including 88.9% of the non-overt and 100% of the overt DIC patients. Prothrombin time (PT) in non-overt and overt DIC cases was 17.3 s and 24.4 s, respectively. Thrombotic event and chronic kidney disease were found to be the main predictors of DIC (p < 0.0001 and 0.03, respectively) followed by diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (statistically insignificant). CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that the ISTH DIC score cannot predict mortality as the COVID-19 related DIC differs from the sepsis-induced DIC. Among the seriously ill, older patients with comorbidities, increased levels of D-dimer and prolonged PT are more reliable parameters among COVID-19 non-survivors.","Anwar, Nimra; Tashfeen, Sunila; Akhtar, Fahim; Noor, Afshan; Khan, Saleem Ahmed; Omair, Ahmad",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33850513/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1658361221000664; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1658361221000664; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtumed.2021.03.002,185

We report that the cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5 was required for type I and III IFN induction in the lung cancer cell line Calu-3 upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Type I and III IFN induction further required MAVS and IRF3. In contrast, induction of IL6 and TNF was independent of the MDA5-MAVS-IRF3 axis in this setting. We further found that SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibited the ability of cells to respond to IFNs.

Some key human‐borne pathogens that have been shown to infect animals and cause morbidity and mortality include measles virus (paramyxoviruses), influenza A virus (orthomyxoviruses), herpes simplex 1 virus (herpesviruses), protozoal and helminthic parasites, and bacteria such as methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, zooanthroponotic pathogens are most commonly reported in captive animals or domestic livestock with close human contact; there, the potential for economic loss and human reinfection is most apparent. There is also the potential for infection in wild animal populations, which may threaten endangered species and decrease biodiversity. The emergence and reemergence of human‐borne pathogens in wildlife may also have negative consequences for human health if these pathogens cycle back into humans. Many of the anthropogenic drivers of zoonotic disease emergence also facilitate zooanthroponotic transmission. Increasing research to better understand the occurrence of and the potential for bidirectional pathogen transmission between humans and animals is essential for improving global health.

Drawing on a survey of 166 Egyptian agri‐food SMEs, this study investigates differences in‐ and determinants of COVID‐19 business risk perception among these enterprises. The empirical results showed that risk perception was highly asymmetric across geographical regions. Enterprises with longer cash flow coverage periods and higher values of total assets perceived significantly lower risk levels, as cash and assets functioned as a buffer against the impact of COVID‐19. The findings of the study imply that the “just‐in‐time” approach and the absence of a proactive and preventative stance to risk management reduced the resilience of agri‐food SMEs to the risks presented by the pandemic. Generally, enterprises that operate both in domestic and export markets perceived lower COVID‐19 risks. Finally, the main export destination to which the surveyed enterprises export was a significant determinant of their risk perception. These findings could be useful to managers of agri‐food businesses in terms of better understanding of risks and promotion of risk management practices. More so, they can help design effective policy interventions to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on Egyptian agri‐food SMEs and build up their resilience to future pandemics and shocks.","Abu Hatab, Assem; Lagerkvist, Carl‐Johan; Esmat, Abourehab",Agribusiness (N Y N Y),https://doi.org/10.1002/agr.21676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362335/,185

Many novel technologies and methodologies have been developed to increase the efficiency of the drug discovery process, and computational methodologies have become a crucial component of many drug discovery programs. From hit identification to lead optimization, techniques such as ligand- or structure-based virtual screening are widely used in many discovery efforts. It is the case for designing potential anticancer drugs and drug candidates, where these computational approaches have had a major impact over the years and have provided fruitful insights into the field of cancer.

Voice therapy faces a double challenge, interventions using telepractice, and delivering rehabilitation services to a growing population of patients at risk of functional impairment related to the COVID-19 disease. Moreover, as COVID-19 is transmitted through droplets, it is critical to understand how to mitigate these risks during assessment and treatment. OBJECTIVE: to promote safety, and effective clinical practice to voice assessment and rehabilitation in the pandemic COVID-19 context for SLPs. METHODS: A group of 11 experts in voice and swallowing disorders from 5 different countries conducted a consensus recommendation following the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery rules building a clinical guide for SLPs during this pandemic context. RESULTS: The clinical guide provides 79 recommendations for clinicians in the management of voice disorders during the pandemic and includes advice from assessment, direct treatment, telepractice, and teamwork. The consensus was reached 95% for all topics. CONCLUSION: This guideline should be taken only as recommendations; each clinician must attempt to mitigate the risk of infection and achieve the best therapeutic results taking into account the patient's particular reality.","Castillo-Allendes, Adrián; Contreras-Ruston, Francisco; Cantor, Lady; Codino, Juliana; Guzman, Marco; Malebran, Celina; Manzano, Carlos; Pavez, Axel; Vaiano, Thays; Wilder, Fabiana; Behlau, Mara",J Voice,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32917457/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvoice.2020.08.018; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0892199720303167; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0892199720303167?v=s5,185

METHODS: Eight databases were searched until April 10, 2021, for studies on cardiac markers, including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)/N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP), troponin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), in MIS-C patients. RESULTS: Of the 2583 participants enrolled in 24 studies, 1613 patients were diagnosed with MIS-C. MIS-C patients exhibited higher BNP levels than patients with non-severe COVID-19 [SMD (95% CI): 1.13 (0.48, 1.77), p < 0.05]. No significant differences in BNP levels were observed between patients with MIS-C and severe COVID-19 [SMD (95% CI): 0.29 (−0.07, 0.65), p = 0.117]. Comparisons of MIS-C patients to all COVID-19 patients revealed no significant differences in levels of troponin [SMD (95% CI): 0.13 (−0.07, 0.32), p = 0.212] or AST [SMD (95% CI): 0.10 (−0.11, 0.31), p = 0.336]. Compared to patients with non-severe MIS-C, those with severe MIS-C exhibited higher levels of BNP [SMD (95% CI): 0.26 (0.04, 0.48), p < 0.05], but no differences in troponin [SMD (95% CI): 0.05 (−0.06, 0.16) p = 0.387] or AST [SMD (95% CI): 0.19 (−0.34, 0.71), p = 0.483] were observed. Moreover, there was no significant difference in BNP [SMD (95% CI): −0.21 (−1.07, 0.64), p = 0.624] or troponin [SMD (95% CI): −0.07 (−0.45, 0.31), p = 0.710] between MIS-C with and without coronary artery abnormality. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess stability. No publication bias was detected based on Begg's test. CONCLUSIONS: The key cardiac marker that showed differences between patients with MIS-C/non-severe COVID-19 and between patients with severe/non-severe MIS-C was BNP.

Here, we examined the possible association between BCG vaccination with prevalence and mortality by COVID-19 by using publicly available data of COVID-19 in 199 countries/regions and the BCG World Atlas. By using linear regression modeling, we found that the number of total cases and deaths per one million population were significantly associated with the country's policy concerning BCG vaccine administration. The amount of variance in cases and deaths explained by BCG vaccination policy ranged between 12.5% and 38%. Importantly, this effect remained significant after controlling for the country's life expectancy and the average temperature in February and March 2020, which themselves are significantly correlated with the cases and deaths indices, respectively. By contrast, the ratio between deaths and cases was weakly affected. This latter outcome suggested that BCG vaccination may have hindered the overall spread of the virus or progression of the disease rather than reducing mortality rates (i.e., deaths/cases ratio). Finally, by roughly dividing countries into three categories showing high, middle, or low growth rate of the cases, we found a highly significant difference between the slope categories among the BCG groups, suggesting that the time since the onset of the spread of the virus was not a major confounding factor. While this study potentially suffers from a number of unknown confounding factors, these associations support the idea that BCG vaccination may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2, which, together with its proven safety, encourages consideration of further detailed epidemiological studies, large-scale clinical trials on the efficacy of this vaccine on COVID-19, and/or re-introduction of BCG vaccination practice in the countries which are currently devoid of the practice.","Sala, Giovanni; Miyakawa, Tsuyoshi",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.30.20048165,185

However, a diverse range of factors are involved in CPSP development, which complicates efforts to predict and treat this disease. To advance research in this field, our study aimed to use bibliometric analysis to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate CPSP research and predict research hot spots over the last 10 years. METHODS: Relevant publications between 2011 and 2020 were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection database. CiteSpace software (v5.7.R2) and the Online Analysis Platform of Literature Metrology were used to analyze research attributes including countries and authors, keywords and co-occurrence, and burst detection to predict trends and hot spots. RESULTS: A total of 2493 publications were collected with the number of annual publications showing nearly threefold increase over the past decade. Articles were the primary publication type with the United States as the leading country and the center of national collaboration. Johns Hopkins University provided the leading influence within the CPSP field. Postoperative pain, multimodal analgesia, quality of life, opioid, microglia, cesarean delivery, inguinal hernia, chronification, genetic polymorphism, and lidocaine were the top 10 clusters in co-occurrence cluster analysis. Moreover, burst detection was shown that epidural analgesia, nerve injury, total hip arthroplasty were the new hot spots within the CPSP field. CONCLUSION: Bibliometric mapping not only defined the overall structure of CPSP-related research but its collective information provides crucial assistance to direct ongoing research efforts. The prominent keywords including ”risk factor” and “multimodal analgesia” indicate that CPSP prevention and new treatment methods remain hot spots. Nonetheless, the recognition that CPSP is complex and changeable, proposes comprehensive biopsychosocial approaches are needed, and these will be essential to improve CPSP interventions and outcomes.","Li, Qi; Dai, Wanbing; Chen, Xuemei; Su, Diansan; Yu, Weifeng; Gu, Xiyao",J Pain Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s300744; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34321922/,185

IFIT1 can detect viral RNA lacking 2’-O methylation on their cap structures or displaying a 5’-triphosphate moiety and inhibit their translation or sequester them from active replication. Because of these inhibitory actions, many viruses have evolved unique mechanisms to evade IFIT1 to facilitate replication, spread of infection, and disease pathogenesis.","Diamond, Michael S.",Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24909568/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1359610114000446; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cytogfr.2014.05.002; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359610114000446; http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4234691?pdf=render,185

Among the numerous enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems present in mitochondria, mitochondrial glutathione (mGSH) emerges as the main line of defense for maintaining the appropriate mitochondrial redox environment. mGSH’s ability to act directly or as a co-factor in reactions catalyzed by other mitochondrial enzymes makes its presence essential to avoid or to repair oxidative modifications that can lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequently to cell death. Since mitochondrial redox disorders play a central part in many diseases, harboring optimal levels of mGSH is vitally important. In this review, we will highlight the participation of mGSH as a contributor to disease progression in pathologies as diverse as Alzheimer’s disease, alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, the involvement of mitochondrial ROS in the signaling of new prescribed drugs and in other pathologies (or in other unmet medical needs, such as gender differences or coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) treatment) is still being revealed; guaranteeing that research on mGSH will be an interesting topic for years to come.","Marí, Montserrat; de Gregorio, Estefanía; de Dios, Cristina; Roca-Agujetas, Vicente; Cucarull, Blanca; Tutusaus, Anna; Morales, Albert; Colell, Anna",Antioxidants (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32987701/; https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox9100909,185
690600,Incubation period of COVID-19: A systematic review and meta-analysis(),2020-11-28,"Outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have caused high mortality of piglets and significant economic losses to the Chinese swine industry. In the current study, 184 specimens from pigs with or without signs of diarrhea were collected from 39 farms across eight provinces, mainly around Hunan, People's Republic of China, in 2017 to 2018 in order to obtain epidemiological information on PEDV infections in these regions. The results indicated an average PEDV-positive rate of 38.04% (70/184) and more-pronounced disease severity in diarrheic pigs (48.76%; 59/121) than in non-diarrheic pigs (17.46%; 11/63). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis demonstrated that 14 representative PEDV strains from 14 swine farms belonged to the G2 group (G2-a and G2-b subgroups) and displayed a high degree of genetic variation. In particular, two out of the 14 PEDV strains were found to have unique indels in the S1 gene. The strain HN-SY-2017-Oct had a 9-nucleotide (T(1152)GAAGCCAAT(1160)T) insertion, and the strain ZJ-2018-May had a 3-nucleotide (AAA) deletion at position 1126 in the S1 gene. A three-dimensional structural prediction revealed that these unique insertions might lengthen the loop on the surface or increase the likelihood of the surface protein being phosphorylated at (388)Y, thereby affecting the virulence or pathogenicity of PEDV. Collectively, the data show that PED remains a severe threat to the pig industry and that variant PEDV stains are circulating in China. The updated PEDV epidemiological data will facilitate the design of PEDV vaccines and the application of effective measures for PED prevention.","Tan, Lei; Li, Yalan; He, Jiayi; Hu, Yi; Cai, Xiong; Liu, Wei; Liu, Tanbing; Wang, Jiaoshun; Li, Zhoumian; Yuan, Xiaoming; Zhan, Yang; Yang, Lingchen; Deng, Zhibang; Wang, Naidong; Yang, Yi; Wang, Aibing",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32056002/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-020-04532-7,185
