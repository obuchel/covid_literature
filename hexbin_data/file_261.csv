1054,"Integrating Genome-based Informatics to Modernize Global Disease Monitoring, Information Sharing, and Response",2012-11-11,"The rapid advancement of genome technologies holds great promise for improving the quality and speed of clinical and public health laboratory investigations and for decreasing their cost. The latest generation of genome DNA sequencers can provide highly detailed and robust information on disease-causing microbes, and in the near future these technologies will be suitable for routine use in national, regional, and global public health laboratories. With additional improvements in instrumentation, these next- or third-generation sequencers are likely to replace conventional culture-based and molecular typing methods to provide point-of-care clinical diagnosis and other essential information for quicker and better treatment of patients. Provided there is free-sharing of information by all clinical and public health laboratories, these genomic tools could spawn a global system of linked databases of pathogen genomes that would ensure more efficient detection, prevention, and control of endemic, emerging, and other infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.","Aarestrup, Frank M.; Brown, Eric W.; Detter, Chris; Gerner-Smidt, Peter; Gilmour, Matthew W.; Harmsen, Dag; Hendriksen, Rene S.; Hewson, Roger; Heymann, David L.; Johansson, Karin; Ijaz, Kashef; Keim, Paul S.; Koopmans, Marion; Kroneman, Annelies; Wong, Danilo Lo Fo; Lund, Ole; Palm, Daniel; Sawanpanyalert, Pathom; Sobel, Jeremy; Schlundt, Jørgen",Emerg Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3559169/,261
7199,In-flight transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): A Case Report,2006-03-08,"Data on features of Pneumocystis primary infection in infancy are still fragmented. To study Pneumocystis primary infection, 192 infants who were monitored for acute pulmonary disease or fever over a 40-month period were retrospectively investigated. P. jirovecii detection on archival nasopharyngeal aspirates was performed using a qPCR assay. Factors associated with P. jirovecii were assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses. P. jirovecii genotypes in infants and a control group of adults contemporaneously diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia were identified using unilocus, bilocus, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). P. jirovecii was detected in 35 infants (18.2%). The univariate analysis pointed out four factors: viral infection (P = .035, OR [IC 95], 2.2 [1.1–4.7]), lower respiratory tract infection (P = .032, OR [IC 95], 2.5 [1.1–5.9]), absence of hospital discharge after birth (P = .003, OR (IC 95), 0.1 (0.02–0.5]), and the 63–189-day group (P < .001, OR [IC 95], 42.2 [5.4–332]). The multivariate analysis confirmed these two latter factors (P = .02, OR [IC 95], 0.1 [0.02–0.72]; P = .005, OR [IC 95], 11.5 [2.1–63.5]). Thus, P. jirovecii acquisition mostly takes place in the community. A comparison of these data with those of previously published studies showed that median and interquartile range of positive-infant ages were close to those observed in Chile, Denmark, and Peru, highlighting similar characteristics. Common unilocus or bilocus genotypes were identified in infants and adults, whereas no MLST genotypes were shared. Therefore, a common reservoir made up of infected infants and adults is still hypothetical. Finally, primary infection is a worldwide phenomenon occurring at the same time in childhood regardless of geographical location, rather than an incidental event.","Nevez, Gilles; Guillaud-Saumur, Thibaud; Cros, Pierrick; Papon, Nicolas; Vallet, Sophie; Quinio, Dorothée; Minoui-Tran, Adissa; Pilorgé, Léa; de Parscau, Loïc; Sizun, Jacques; Ochoa, Theresa J; Bustamante, Beatriz; Ponce, Carolina; Vargas, Sergio L; Le Gal, Solène",Med Mycol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107579/,261

Accurate identification of causative agents is critical to case management and to prioritization in vaccine development. Sensitive multiplex diagnostics provide us with an opportunity to investigate the relative contributions of individual agents andmayalso facilitate the discovery of new pathogens. Recently, application of MassTag polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to undiagnosed infuenza-like illness in New York State led to the discovery of a novel rhinovirus genotype. Here we report the investigation, by MassTag PCR, of pediatric respiratory-tract infections in Germany, studying 97 cases for which no pathogen was identified through routine laboratory evaluation. Respiratory viruses were identified in 49 cases (51%); of the 55 identified viruses, 41 (75%) were rhinoviruses. The novel genotype represented 73% of rhinoviruses and 55% of all identified viruses. Infections with the novel genotype were associated with upper-respiratory-tract symptoms but, more frequently, with bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia.","Renwick, Neil; Schweiger, Brunhilde; Kapoor, Vishal; Liu, Zhiqiang; Villari, Joseph; Bullmann, Reinhard; Miething, Robert; Briese, Thomas; Lipkin, W.

17433,SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) : A BOLT FROM THE BLUE,2021-05-11,"A key function of morality is to regulate social behavior. Research suggests moral values may be divided into two types: binding values, which govern behavior in groups, and individualizing values, which promote personal rights and freedoms. Because people tend to mentally activate concepts in situations in which they may prove useful, the importance they afford moral values may vary according to whom they are with in the moment. In particular, because binding values help regulate communal behavior, people may afford these values more importance when in the presence of close (versus distant) others. Five studies test and support this hypothesis. First, we use a custom smartphone application to repeatedly record participants’ (n = 1166) current social context and the importance they afforded moral values. Results show people rate moral values as more important when in the presence of close others, and this effect is stronger for binding than individualizing values—an effect that replicates in a large preregistered online sample (n = 2016). A lab study (n = 390) and two preregistered online experiments (n = 580 and n = 752) provide convergent evidence that people afford binding, but not individualizing, values more importance when in the real or imagined presence of close others. Our results suggest people selectively activate different moral values according to the demands of the situation, and show how the mere presence of others can affect moral thinking.","Yudkin, Daniel A.; Gantman, Ana P.; Hofmann, Wilhelm; Quoidbach, Jordi",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113481/,261

The only difference is the circumstances under which the methods are employed. The challenges of conducting epidemiologic studies during a disaster are many—limited access to study sites and populations; access to reliable electricity, connectivity, and communication systems; and typically a short time frame in which to gather, analyze, and report data to decision-makers so that it can be utilized to prevent morbidity and mortality. However, many innovations have been developed by disaster epidemiologists to meet these challenges. Rapid needs assessments, innovative surveillance and tracking systems, and adapted epidemiologic study designs are some of the innovations that will be discussed in this chapter.","Horney, Jennifer A.",Disaster Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7158186/,261

In press. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2020.03.025",2020-05-13,"Automatic tumor segmentation has been used as a diagnostic aid in the identification of diseases such as tumors from liver CT scans, and their treatment. Owing to their success in computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) or U-Net based models have often been employed in many recent studies for automatic tumor segmentation to learn numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels and extract various semantic features. However, the correlation between different tumor regions in feature maps cannot be easily captured due to the lack of contextual dependencies, which in turn limits the representative capability of the adopted models and thus affects the accuracy of tumor segmentation results. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework for segmentation of tumors in liver CT scans, which can explicitly extract multi-scale fine-grained contextual information by adaptively aggregating local features with their global dependencies. The proposed multi-scale framework features a light model with a very few additional parameters, and also its visualization capability significantly boosts networks’ interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world liver tumor CT dataset illustrate that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of a number of widely used evaluation criteria for the hepatic tumor segmentation task.","Pang, Shuchao; Du, Anan; Yu, Zhenmei; Orgun, Mehmet A.",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7206311/,261
35450,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) vaccines,2020-06-22,"BACKGROUND: Lung atelectasis are nonventilated parts of lung tissue and occur as a result of the collapse of the pulmonary parenchyma (alveoli). Various therapeutic procedures for inflating the collapsed pulmonary parenchyma, such as bronchial aspiration and/or standard recruitment maneuvers, are not always successful. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 23-year-old Croatian man with a parapharyngeal abscess on the left side of the neck with spreading of infection in the mediastinum and left side of the thorax and consequent major atelectasis of the left lung. The patient was mechanically ventilated. We decided to apply a new method in which a pulmonary artery catheter was placed (guided by bronchoscope) on the entrance to the lower left bronchus. The pulmonary artery catheter balloon was inflated to achieve bronchial closure. Using another respirator, we ventilated the affected lobe separately with continuously high pressure of 30 cmH(2)O. After 30 minutes, we removed the pulmonary artery catheter from the lower left bronchus and placed it in the upper left bronchus and repeated the procedure. Our method allowed a significantly longer duration (30 minutes) of continuously high pressure of 30 cmH(2)O separately to only one of the total of five lobes of the lungs while the other four lobes were simultaneously ventilated continuously with protective ventilation mode. CONCLUSION: Use of a pulmonary artery catheter and two respirators in our patient’s case proved to be a successful method for recruiting the atelectatic lung while maintaining protective ventilation of the lung segments without atelectasis.","Protić, Alen; Bura, Matej; Juričić, Kazimir",J Med Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7311183/,261

Current studies require a sensitive pointer on the heap to hijack the control flow and pay little attention to vulnerabilities with limited capabilities. In this paper, we propose HAEPG, an automatic exploit framework that can utilize known exploitation techniques to guide exploit generation. We implemented a prototype of HAEPG based on the symbolic execution engine S2E [15] and provided four exploitation techniques for it as prior knowledge. HAEPG takes crashing inputs, programs, and prior knowledge as input, and generates exploits for vulnerabilities with limited capabilities by abusing heap allocator’s internal functionalities. We evaluated HAEPG with 24 CTF programs, and the results show that HAEPG is able to accurately reason about the type of vulnerability for 21 (87.5%) of them, and generate exploits that spawn a shell for 16 (66.7%) of them.

However, PEEP can potentially decrease cardiac output through cardiopulmonary interactions. The effect of PEEP on cardiac output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is not known. METHODS: This was a preclinical randomized, controlled, animal study conducted in an animal research facility on 25 Landrace-Yorkshire pigs. After inducing cardiac arrest, CPR was performed with LUCAS 3. During CPR, pigs were ventilated at a PEEP of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 cmH(2)O (randomly determined via lottery) for 9 min. Cardiac output, obtained via ultrasound dilution, and PaO(2) were measured, and oxygen delivery calculated for each PEEP. RESULTS: A mixed-effects repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to compare the baseline value adjusted mean cardiac output, PaO(2), and oxygen delivery between PEEP groups. Least significant difference test was used to conduct pairwise comparisons between PEEP groups. To determine optimum PEEP, Gaussian mixture model was applied to the adjusted means of cardiac output and oxygen delivery. Increasing PEEP to 10 and higher resulted in significant declines in cardiac output. A PEEP of 15 and higher resulted in significant declines in oxygen delivery. As PEEP was increased from 0 to 20, PaO(2) increased significantly. Gaussian mixture model identified the 0–5 PEEP group as providing optimal cardiac output and oxygen delivery, with PEEP of 5 providing the highest oxygen delivery. CONCLUSIONS: A PEEP of 0–5 resulted in the optimal oxygen delivery and cardiac output during CPR, with PEEP of 5 resulting in higher oxygen delivery, and a slightly lower, statistically insignificant cardiac output than PEEP of 0.","Levenbrown, Yosef; Hossain, Md Jobayer; Keith, James P.; Burr, Katlyn; Hesek, Anne; Shaffer, Thomas",Intensive Care Med Exp,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7382317/,261

37949,Susceptibility of the Iranian population to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection based on variants of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2,2020-08-17,"Smart contracts can be regarded as one of the most popular blockchain-based applications. The decentralized nature of the blockchain introduces vulnerabilities absent in other programs. Furthermore, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to patch a smart contract after it has been deployed. Therefore, smart contracts must be formally verified before they are deployed on the blockchain to avoid attacks exploiting these vulnerabilities. There is a recent surge of interest in analyzing and verifying smart contracts. While most of the existing works either focus on EVM bytecode or translate Solidity contracts into programs in intermediate languages for analysis and verification, we believe that a direct executable formal semantics of the high-level programming language of smart contracts is necessary to guarantee the validity of the verification. In this work, we propose a generalized formal semantic framework based on a general semantic model of smart contracts. Furthermore, this framework can directly handle smart contracts written in different high-level programming languages through semantic extensions and facilitates the formal verification of security properties with the generated semantics.","Jiao, Jiao; Lin, Shang-Wei; Sun, Jun",Fundamental Approaches to Software Engineering,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7418134/,261

Temporal, Spatial, and Demographic Relationships of SARS-COV-2 Gene Target Cycle Thresholds",2020-12-31,"PURPOSE: The incidence of bloodstream infection (BSI) is more common in patients with hematological malignancy. It is important to distinguish infectious episodes from noninfectious episodes. The present study was aimed to describe the epidemiology, clinical indexes, and antibiotic use for in-hospital bloodstream infections of hematological malignancy patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Single-center retrospective research was performed on hematological malignancy patients admitted to our hospital from July 2015 to March 2018. Laboratory and clinical information from 322 febrile patients were acquired. These episodes were divided by blood culture results into two groups: 1) blood culture positive-group, 2) blood culture negative-group. RESULTS: In the 322 febrile cases, 81 (25.2%) patients were blood culture positive, and among them, Gram-negative (G-) bacteria (51.9%) were more isolated than Gram-positive (G+) bacteria (32.1%) and fungi (7.4%). Gram-negative bacteria were more likely to have drug resistance than G+ bacteria. Independent risk factors revealed that patients with complications, high levels of procalcitonin (PCT), glucose, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and d-dimer (D-D), and low concentration of albumin were correlated with the occurrence of BSI. PCT, IL-6 and D-D performed well in differentiating the positive group from the negative group. Moreover, IL-6 and D-D showed excellent performance in differentiating G- and G+ groups, with the areas under the curve all above 0.8. CONCLUSION: We analyzed the risk factors for BSI in patients with hematological malignancy, the distribution of bacteria, antibiotic resistance, and the changes in clinical parameters. This single-center retrospective study may provide clinicians insight into the diagnosis and treatment of BSI.","Ma, Yating; Wang, Shijian; Yang, Ming; Bao, Jinfeng; Wang, Chengbin",Cancer Manag Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7780855/,261

44671,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and pregnancy,2003-06-25,"ABSTRACT: Acrylic polymers (AP) are a diverse group of materials with broad applications, frequent use, and increasing demand. Some of the most used AP are polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid, polymethyl methacrylates, and polyacrylonitrile. Although no information for the production of all AP types is published, data for the most used AP is around 9 MT/year, which gives an idea of the amount of waste that can be generated after products’ lifecycles. After its lifecycle ends, the fate of an AP product will depend on its chemical structure, the environmental setting where it was used, and the regulations for plastic waste management existing in the different countries. Even though recycling is the best fate for plastic polymer wastes, few AP can be recycled, and most of them end up in landfills. Because of the pollution crisis the planet is immersed, setting regulations and developing technological strategies for plastic waste management are urgent. In this regard, biotechnological approaches, where microbial activity is involved, could be attractive eco-friendly strategies. This mini-review describes the broad AP diversity, their properties and uses, and the factors affecting their biodegradability, underlining the importance of standardizing biodegradation quantification techniques. We also describe the enzymes and metabolic pathways that microorganisms display to attack AP chemical structure and predict some biochemical reactions that could account for quaternary carbon-containing AP biodegradation. Finally, we analyze strategies to increase AP biodegradability and stress the need for more studies on AP biodegradation and developing stricter legislation for AP use and waste control. KEY POINTS: • Acrylic polymers (AP) are a diverse and extensively used group of compounds. • The environmental fates and health effects of AP waste are not completely known. • Microorganisms and enzymes involved in AP degradation have been identified. • More biodegradation studies are needed to develop AP biotechnological treatments.

Then, we propose the DRS algorithm to solve the DM problem. To provide the robust and real-time service, we further formulate the Charging driven Drone assisted Management (CDM) problem and present the CDRS algorithm to solve the CDM problem.

The organs most frequently affected by TB are the lungs; despite this, it has been reported that TB patients suffer from depression and anxiety, which have been attributed to social factors. In previous experimental work, we observed that the extensive pulmonary inflammation characteristic of TB with high cytokine production induces neuroinflammation, neuronal death and behavioral abnormalities in the absence of brain infection. The objective of the present work was to reduce this neuroinflammation and avoid the psycho-affective disorders showed during pulmonary TB. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the first-line treatment for neuroinflammation; however, their systemic administration generates various side effects, mostly aggravating pulmonary TB due to immunosuppression of cellular immunity. Intranasal administration is a route that allows drugs to be released directly in the brain through the olfactory nerve, reducing their doses and side effects. In the present work, dexamethasone’s (DEX) intranasal administration was evaluated in TB BALB /c mice comparing three different doses (0.05, 0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg BW) on lung disease evolution, neuroinflammation and behavioral alterations. Low doses of dexamethasone significantly decreased neuroinflammation, improving behavioral status without aggravating lung disease.","Lara-Espinosa, Jacqueline V.; Arce-Aceves, María Fernanda; Mata-Espinosa, Dulce; Barrios-Payán, Jorge; Marquina-Castillo, Brenda; Hernández-Pando, Rogelio",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8199538/,261
61964,"BCG vaccine, a ray of hope in treating Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).",2020-10-16,"The radioulnar ligament of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC), especially the deep fibers inserted at the ulnar fovea, is the key component for the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) stability. Traumatic injuries to the TFCC foveal insertion would cause DRUJ instability. Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques of the TFCC repair are suturing the ulnar-sided disruption peripherally to the dorsal or ulnar capsule instead of suturing the TFCC to the fovea and thus fail to restore the DRUJ stability if the TFCC is detached from the fovea. Recently, some arthroscopic foveal repair techniques have been reported using a suture anchor or transosseous sutures to address the foveal tear. This technical note describes an arthroscopic transosseous technique to reattach the foveal-disrupted TFCC. A 1.6-mm small osseous tunnel is created on the radial border of the fovea and 4 sutures are passed into the tunnel by using a 16-gauge needle. The TFCC could be sutured arthroscopically with these 4 sutures and be compressed against the fovea. Our technique provides not only a good suture construct for TFCC foveal reattachment but also an anatomic contact surface between the torn TFCC and its foveal footprint for healing. We recommend this technique as an alternative for repairing TFCC foveal tear.","Chen, Wei-Jen",Arthroscopy techniques,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eats.2016.09.004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28373941/,261
66172,Universities of Applied Sciences.,2021-03-31,"Despite significant advances in cancer precision medicine, a significant hurdle to its broader adoption remains the multitude of variants of unknown significance identified by clinical tumor sequencing and the lack of biologically validated methods to distinguish between functional and benign variants. Here we used functional data on MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutations generated in real-time within a co-clinical trial framework to benchmark the predictive value of a three-part in silico methodology. Our computational approach to variant classification incorporated hotspot analysis, three-dimensional molecular dynamics simulation, and sequence paralogy. In silico prediction accurately distinguished functional from benign MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 mutants, yet drug sensitivity varied widely among activating mutant alleles. These results suggest that multifaceted in silico modeling can inform patient accrual to MEK/ERK inhibitor clinical trials, but computational methods need to be paired with laboratory- and clinic-based efforts designed to unravel variabilities in drug response.","Hanrahan, Aphrothiti J; Sylvester, Brooke E; Chang, Matthew T; Elzein, Arijh; Gao, JianJiong; Han, Weiwei; Liu, Ye; Xu, Dong; Gao, Sizhi P; Gorelick, Alexander N; Jones, Alexis M; Kiliti, Amber J; Nissan, Moriah H; Nimura, Clare A; Poteshman, Abigail N; Yao, Zhan; Gao, Yijun; Hu, Wenhuo; Wise, Hannah C; Gavrila, Elena I; Shoushtari, Alexander N; Tiwari, Shakuntala; Viale, Agnes; Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Merghoub, Taha; Berger, Michael F; Rosen, Neal; Taylor, Barry S; Solit, David B",Cancer research,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-20-0865; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32641410/,261

This study conducted exploratory analyses of the relationship between COVID-19-related life changes and COVID-19-related perceived stress and associations between COVID-19-related perceived stress and dysregulated maternal eating behaviors, child feeding practices, and body mass index (BMI) in Los Angeles mothers. Mothers (Mage=37.6±6.9) of children aged 5-11 (N=197, response rate 92.5%) completed an online questionnaire assessing COVID-19-related life changes, COVID-19-related perceived stress, mechanisms used to cope with COVID-19, child feeding practices, their own eating behavior, demographics, and height and weight. The highest proportion of participants reported changes to work, disruptions due to childcare challenges, and increased home responsibilities. Higher COVID-19-related perceived stress was experienced by those who reported loss of work hours (29%), loss of job (15.2%), reduced ability to afford childcare (18.8%), and reduced ability to afford rent/mortgage (19.8%) (ps<0.05) than those who did not. The most common strategy that mothers indicated using to cope with COVID-19 related stress was eating comfort foods (e.g., candy and chips) (58.7%). COVID-19-related perceived stress was positively associated with mother's BMI and emotional eating (ps<0.05). Rewarding their child's eating and behavior with food were both positively associated with the number of COVID-19 related life changes (ps<0.05). This study yields new knowledge of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers' dysregulated eating behaviors and child feeding practices. The results highlight the importance of conducting further research to confirm these findings and understand the nature of associations between COVID-19-related perceived stress and health. This is crucial in order to explore ways in which lasting impacts of the pandemic on mental and physical health can be prevented.","Wang, Shirlene D; Devjani, Shivali; Chillakanti, Mahima; Dunton, Genevieve F; Mason, Tyler B",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105209; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737212/,261
73132,Proteasome inhibition in vivo promotes survival in a lethal murine model of severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2010,"OBJECTIVES We sought to identify angiographic predictors of 2-year stent thrombosis (ST) in the ADAPT-DES study. BACKGROUND A strong relationship between platelet reactivity and ST after implantation of drug-eluting stents (DES) was recently confirmed in the prospective, multicenter ADAPT-DES study. METHODS In a pre-specified analysis of patients enrolled in ADAPT-DES, an independent angiographic core laboratory performed detailed angiographic analyses for all cases of ST. Patients with Academic Research Consortium definite/probable target-lesion ST were matched with controls in a 1:2 ratio, and multivariable Cox regression models identified angiographic predictors of 2-year ST. RESULTS Among 8,582 patients who had successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and were included in the ADAPT-DES study, 92 (1.1%) patients had ST at 2-year follow-up. Target lesion-related ST was identified in 77 patients (82 lesions) who were clinically matched with 153 patients (196 lesions) without ST. Patients with ST were more likely to have longer target lesions, thrombus, moderate/severe calcification, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) type C lesions, and saphenous vein grafts. After adjustment for clinical covariates the angiographic variables that predicted ST were lesion complexity (ACC/AHA type C lesion, adjusted HR: 1.97, 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.26, P = 0.01) and presence of thrombus on index PCI (HR: 2.25, 95% CI: 1.40 to 3.59, P < 0.01).

STUDY DESIGN Experimental. SAMPLE POPULATION Cadaveric canine lung lobes. METHODS Lungs were inflated to 10 cmH2 O. After collecting biopsies 3 cm from the edge of lung lobes, leak pressures were recorded as inflation pressure was increased to 40 cmH2 O. Pre-tied loop ligature, square knot (SQ), modified 4S Roeder knot (M4SR) with glycomer 631 and polyglactin 910 size 0 and 2-0 were used in addition to EndoGIA 45-2.5 mm (Covidien, Norwalk, CT) and a vessel sealant device (VSDS single and VSDD double seal). Six biopsies were performed with each of these modalities. RESULTS Median airway pressure at which leakage occurred was 28 (20-34)cmH2 O for EndoGIA 45; 33 (14-40) for VSDD; and 33 (10-40) for VSDS while other groups reached a median pressure of 40 cmH2 O (P < .0001). Leakage occurred at 20 cmH2 O in 1 sample with the EndoGIA and the VSDS, and in 2 with the VSDD while leakage did not occur in any other group (P = .36).

However, anastomotic leakage following low anterior resection still is a significant problem. Based on animal experimental data of improved healing of compression anastomosis, we hypothesized that a compression anastomotic device might improve healing rates of the highest-risk anastomoses. METHODS All low anterior resections for rectal cancer performed or directly supervised by the senior author between January 2004 and June 2012 were analyzed. Only patients with a stapled or compression anastomosis located within 6 cm from the anal verge were included. Until December 2008, circular staplers were employed, while since January 2009, a novel compression anastomotic device was used for rectal reconstruction exclusively. RESULTS Out of 197 patients operated for rectal cancer, a total of 96 (34 females, 35.4 %) fulfilled inclusion criteria. Fifty-eight (60.4 %) were reconstructed with circular staplers and 38 (39.6 %) using a compression anastomotic device. Significantly, more laparoscopic procedures were recorded in the compression anastomosis group, but distribution of gender, age, body mass index, American Society of Anaesthesiologists score, rate of preoperative radiotherapy, tumor staging, or stoma diversion rate were similar. Anastomotic leakage was observed in seven cases (7/58, 12.1 %) in the stapled and twice (2/38, 5.3 %) in the compression anastomosis group (p = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS In this series, rectal reconstruction following low anterior resection using a novel compression anastomotic device was safe and (at least) equally effective compared to traditional circular staplers concerning leak rate.","Dauser, Bernhard; Braunschmid, Tamara; Ghaffari, Shahbaz; Riss, Stefan; Stift, Anton; Herbst, Friedrich",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00423-013-1103-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23943311/,261
90124,The single-cell landscape of immunological responses of CD4+ T cells in HIV versus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.,2020-11-05,"The glycome constitutes the entire complement of free carbohydrates and glycoconjugates expressed on whole cells or tissues. 'Systems Glycobiology' is an emerging discipline that aims to quantitatively describe and analyse the glycome. Here, instead of developing a detailed understanding of single biochemical processes, a combination of computational and experimental tools are used to seek an integrated or 'systems-level' view. This can explain how multiple biochemical reactions and transport processes interact with each other to control glycome biosynthesis and function. Computational methods in this field commonly build in silico reaction network models to describe experimental data derived from structural studies that measure cell-surface glycan distribution. While considerable progress has been made, several challenges remain due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of this post-translational modification. First, for the in silico models to be standardized and shared among laboratories, it is necessary to integrate glycan structure information and glycosylation-related enzyme definitions into the mathematical models. Second, as glycoinformatics resources grow, it would be attractive to utilize 'Big Data' stored in these repositories for model construction and validation. Third, while the technology for profiling the glycome at the whole-cell level has been standardized, there is a need to integrate mass spectrometry derived site-specific glycosylation data into the models. The current review discusses progress that is being made to resolve the above bottlenecks. The focus is on how computational models can bridge the gap between 'data' generated in wet-laboratory studies with 'knowledge' that can enhance our understanding of the glycome.","Liu, Gang; Neelamegham, Sriram",Wiley interdisciplinary reviews.

Traditionally, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy requires 5-6 skin incisions to allow for placement of multiple trocars. With the introduction of single-incision laparoscopic surgery, multiple abdominal procedures have been performed using a sole umbilical incision, with good cosmetic outcomes. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of laparoscopic single incision sleeve gastrectomy for morbid obesity. METHODS A total of 8 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic single-incision sleeve gastrectomy at the Operative Unit of Bariatric Surgery of the University of Rome Tor Vergata from March 2009 to June 2009. RESULTS Of the 8 patients, 5 were women and 3 were men, with a mean age of 44.4 years. The mean preoperative body mass index was 56.2 kg/m(2). The mean operative time was 128 minutes. The mean postoperative stay was 2.4 days. The mean postoperative body mass index was 49.3 kg/m(2) at a mean follow-up period of 3.6 months. The mean percentage of excess weight loss was 33% for the same period. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic single-incision sleeve gastrectomy seems to be safe, technically feasible, and reproducible. A randomized trial comparing single-incision sleeve gastrectomy and conventional sleeve gastrectomy might be needed to evaluate the postoperative results in relation to the development of abdominal wall complications.","Gentileschi, Paolo; Camperchioli, Ida; Benavoli, Domenico; Di Lorenzo, Nicola; Sica, Giuseppe; Gaspari, Achille L",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2010.01.011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20627712/,261

While much is known about HIV self-testing (HIVST), less is known about syphilis self-testing, particularly in low-income settings. The objective of this study is to determine context-specific facilitators and barriers for self-testing and to assess the usability of syphilis self-testing in Zimbabwe among men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS This mixed methods study was conducted in Harare as part of a larger syphilis self-testing trial. The study included in-depth interviews (phase I) followed by usability testing and a second interview (phase II). In-depth interviews were conducted with MSM and key informants prior to syphilis self-testing. The same MSM then used the syphilis self-test, quantitatively assessed its usability and participated in a second in-depth interview. Phase I data were analysed using a thematic approach, guided by an adapted social ecological model conceptual framework. Phase II interviews were analysed using rapid assessment procedure methodology, and usability was assessed using a pre-established index, adapted from existing HIVST scales. RESULTS Twenty MSM and 10 key informants were recruited for phase I in-depth interviews, and 16 of these MSM participated in phase II by completing a syphilis self-test kit. Facilitating factors for self-testing included the potential for increased privacy, convenience, autonomy, and avoidance of social and healthcare provider stigma. Barriers included the fear to test and uncertainty about linkage to care and treatment. Data from the Usability Index suggested high usability (89.6% on a 0-100 scale) among the men who received the self-test. CONCLUSIONS MSM in Zimbabwe were willing to use syphilis self-test kits and many of the barriers and facilitators were similar to those observed for HIVST. Syphilis self-testing may increase syphilis test uptake among sexual minorities in Zimbabwe and other low-income and middle-income countries.","Sri-Pathmanathan, Clarisse; Nhamo, Definate; Mamvuto, Takudzwa; Chapwanya, Gwendoline; Terris-Prestholt, Fern; Mahaka, Imelda; Marks, Michael; Tucker, Joseph D",Sexually transmitted infections,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2020-054911; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33927008/,261

Flow diverter stents (FDS) have evolved as a promising endovascular treatment option for aneurysms of the internal carotid artery and are associated with high occlusion rates and a favorable morbidity and mortality profile. OBJECTIVE To determine safety and efficacy of FDS for OSA in a large, multicenter cohort. METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively maintained databases of 127 consecutive patients harboring 160 OSA treated with FDS was performed. Aneurysms were classified based on location and morphology. Follow-up with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed 6 to 18 months after treatment. RESULTS Follow-up DSA was available for 101 (63.1%) aneurysms with a mean follow-up of 18 months. Complete occlusion was observed in 90 aneurysms (89.1%), near-complete occlusion (>95%) in 3 (3%), and incomplete occlusion (<95%) in 8 aneurysms (7.9%). One aneurysm was retreated with another FDS (0.9%). No risk factors for incomplete occlusion were identified. The OA was occluded at the latest follow-up in 6 cases (7.1%). Permanent morbidity occurred in 4 patients (3.1%), and there was no mortality related to the FDS procedure. CONCLUSION Treatment of OSA with FDS was found to be safe and effective. The retreatment rate was extremely low and aneurysms that occluded did not reanalyze.","Griessenauer, Christoph J; Piske, Ronie L; Baccin, Carlos E; Pereira, Benedito J A; Reddy, Arra S; Thomas, Ajith J; Abud, Thiago G; Ogilvy, Christopher S",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyw110; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28327931/,261

This was a retrospective study that included patients <20 years of age with a recent mandibular fracture. The outcome variable was missed mandibular fracture, which was determined when a fracture was not suspected or diagnosed during the patient's first assessment in primary healthcare. The primary predictor variable was age group (i.e. children <13 years or teenagers/adolescents aged 13-19 years). The explanatory variables were sex, mechanism of injury, and type of facial facture. Other variables were clinical symptoms and findings. Mandibular fracture was missed at first contact in 27 of 182 patients (14.8%). Fracture was missed significantly more often in patients <13 years than in older patients (33.3% vs. 8.8%, P<0.001). The only significant symptom or clinical finding that was associated with missed fractures was skin wound of the jaw (P=0.009). There was no association between missed fracture and sex or mechanism of injury. Mandibular fractures in children are often missed at the first healthcare contact.

132695,Inflammatory Response and Phenotyping in Severe Acute Respiratory Infection From the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and Other Etiologies.,2020-11-12,"Thumb basal joint arthritis treatment with biological arthroplasty is a widely used procedure in hand surgery centers. The several described techniques are based on the use of different tendons of the wrist, implying frequently a tenoplasty around flexor carpi radialis or transosseous tunnels to stabilize the articulation. The authors have been using, for many years, the technique conceived by F. Brunelli that relies on the anchorage of the volar band of the abductor pollicis longus tendon to the first intermetacarpal ligament, to obtain a suspension arthroplasty. Technical details are discussed. Sixty-seven patients in Eaton-Littler stage 2 or 3 with >4 years follow-up after surgery were evaluated. Each patient expressed a subjective evaluation relating to pain, functionality, strength, esthetic aspect, and general satisfaction. The following parameters have been considered as objective data: the angle of the first web space, the abduction and opposition of the first digit, the pinch, and the strength. X-rays were also performed to verify the distance between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal. In 84% of cases, a significant improvement was found in the considered parameters. Joint space was maintained in 76% of cases at radiologic follow-up. No patient needed surgical revision. The tenoplasty conceived by F. Brunelli presents several advantages, including the simple and reproducible execution, short surgical time, and comfortable postoperative course for the patient.

This virus is the same member of the coronavirus family that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) reported in China 2003, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The initial cases have been linked to a live seafood market in Wuhan, China, and the specific animal source is yet to be determined. The detection of this new virus in humans without knowing the source of the infection has raised greatly heightened concerns not only in China, but also internationally. To date, the outbreak has spread to most provinces in China and 25 other countries within a relatively short period.

A potential association between OSA and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity has been proposed on the basis of similar comorbid medical conditions associated with both OSA and COVID-19. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of 1,738 patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 between March and October of 2020. Patients were classified based on the presence or absence of OSA diagnosis based upon the International Classification of Diseases (ICD codes; G47.33 and U07.1 for OSA and COVID-19, respectively). Other data collected, including demographics, body mass index (BMI), and comorbid conditions. COVID-19 severity was compared between groups using the quick COVID-19 severity index. RESULTS Quick COVID-19 severity index scores were higher in patients with OSA compared to without OSA. However, the prevalence rates of type 2 DM (p<0.0001), coronary artery disease (p<0.0001), congestive heart failure (p<0.0001), and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (p<0.0001) were also significantly greater in the OSA group. Unadjusted models revealed higher risk of ICU admission in patients with COVID-19 and OSA. However, such an association attenuated and became non-significant after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and comorbid disease. CONCLUSIONS In our study, OSA does not appear to be an independent risk factor for worse COVID-19 outcomes in hospitalized patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to delineate the potential role of OSA in determining outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Mashaqi, Saif; Lee-Iannotti, Joyce; Rangan, Pooja; Celaya, Melisa P; Gozal, David; Quan, Stuart F; Parthasarathy, Sairam",Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine,https://doi.org/10.5664/jcsm.9424; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34019476/,261

Some years ago bundle interventions have been introduced to reduce CLABSI. The use of checklists may be an additional tool to improve the effect of these bundles even in highly specialized institutions. In this study we investigate if the introduction of a checklist reduces the frequency of CLABSI. METHODS During the study period from October 2011 to September 2012, we investigated the effect of implementing a checklist for the placement of central venous lines (CVL). Patients were allocated either to the checklist group or to the control group, roughly in a 1:2 ratio. The frequency of CLABSI was compared between the two groups. RESULTS During the study period 4416 CVL were inserted; 1518 in the checklist group and 2898 in the control group. The use of the checklist during CVL placement resulted in a lower CLABSI frequency. The incidence in the checklist group was 3.8 per 1000 catheter days as compared to 5.9 per 1000 catheter days in the control group (IRR = 0.57; p = 0.001). The use of the checklist also reduced the frequency of catheter colonisation significantly, 36.3 per 1000 catheter days in the checklist group vs 21.2 per 1000 catheter days in the control group, respectively (IRR = 0.58; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION The introduction of a checklist to improve the adherence to hygiene standards while placement of central venous lines reduced the frequency of infections significantly.","Wichmann, Dominic; Belmar Campos, Cristina E; Ehrhardt, Stephan; Kock, Timo; Weber, Claudia; Rohde, Holger; Kluge, Stefan",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-018-3178-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884118/,261

Areas covered: Maintained clinical remission rates up to 50% have been shown in UC patients receiving GLM, and higher GLM serum concentrations have been associated with improved clinical outcomes. Approximately 50% of UC patients do not respond to induction therapy with GLM, and up to 40% of GLM responders will lose response over time. In most patients, loss of response is associated with low serum GLM concentrations, which suggests insufficient exposure to GLM. Low GLM serum concentrations may be avoided by therapeutic drug monitoring. Expert commentary: So far, the therapeutic window for GLM has not yet been defined, but options to dose increase GLM based on therapeutic drug monitoring might result in improved clinical outcome and higher success rates.","Strik, Anne S; Berends, Sophie E; Mathôt, Ron A; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/17474124.2017.1303376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28276288/,261

Unfortunately, this HIV prevention method has not been ubiquitously taken up by those most at risk for many reasons, including difficulty in accessing care. Innovation, and necessity during the COVID pandemic, has increased the use of technology with new care models providing 100% of PrEP care virtually.ApproachThis presentation will focus on the impacts and early findings of Freddie, a novel and entirely virtual PrEP care model in Canada focused on gender and sexual minority communities. This online health program connects those most at risk of HIV transmission with affirming prescribers across multiple provinces to break down physical and social barriers to PrEP initiation and ongoing use.Outcomes/ImpactFreddie has reached the benchmark of 1,000 patients in Canada, the majority of which have never been on PrEP before, representing a quick uptake in virtual PrEP services in Canada. The observations made thus far affirm theories that inclusive virtual care models can lead to increased access to STBBI prevention methods.Innovation and SignificancePresenters will discuss the innovative components of Freddie’s virtual care model, explore findings as they relate to PrEP uptake and initiation by speaking to its initial successes and challenges, as well as how it addresses PrEP access barriers in Canada. This includes Freddie’s focus on LGBTQ2S+ Canadians who are known to be at higher risk of HIV and historically have faced extraordinary barriers accessing sexual health care in inclusive settings. The intervention explored in this presentation continues to address such barriers through an innovative and accessible care model.","Trombetta, T.

We use a strategic approach to managing crisis, first introduced by Burnett, to provide a conceptual framework for managing teaching turmoil and triumphs during this pandemic. We conduct an in-depth discussion of the literature and, adopting a critical realist’s perspective, provide current examples of universities’ best practices and decisions for each of the three phases of crisis management (identification, confrontation, and reconfiguration) for successful recovery during these trying times. As the gap between theory and practice remains a critical concern among scholars, we hope our article and proposed framework present a unique opportunity to explore and study how unexpected changes occur in higher education, and their remedies. Based on the need to reflect on the nature of current marketing education through crisis management, we identify the implications of our framework and offer valuable suggestions for future research.

The clustering algorithms used are K-means, Gaussian mixture models, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, mean-shift clustering, and DBSCAN. However, the clustering algorithm has a weakness in grouping data that has very high dimensions such as genome data, so that a dimensional reduction process is needed. In this research, dimensionality reduction was carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder method with three models that produce 2, 10, and 50 features. The main contributions achieved were the dimensional reduction and clustering scheme of SARS-CoV-2 sequence data and the performance analysis of each experiment on each scheme and hyper parameters for each method. Based on the results of experiments conducted, PCA and DBSCAN algorithm achieve the highest silhouette score of 0.8770 with three clusters when using two features. However, dimensionality reduction using autoencoder need more iterations to converge. On the testing process with Indonesian sequence data, more than half of them enter one cluster and the rest are distributed in the other two clusters. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

Such data are crucial for either biomedical research and genetic counseling and are essential for archeological and historical studies. Polish population, homogenous and sedentary in its nature but influenced by many migrations of the past, is unique and could serve as a good genetic reference for middle European Slavic nations. The aim of the present study was to describe first results of analyses of a newly created national database of Polish genomic variant allele frequencies. Never before has any study on the whole genomes of Polish population been conducted on such a large number of individuals (1,079). A wide spectrum of genomic variation was identified and genotyped, such as small and structural variants, runs of homozygosity, mitochondrial haplogroups and Mendelian inconsistencies. The allele frequencies were calculated for 943 unrelated individuals and released publicly as The Thousand Polish Genomes database. A precise detection and characterisation of rare variants enriched in the Polish population allowed to confirm the allele frequencies for known pathogenic variants in diseases, such as Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) or Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). Additionally, the analysis of OMIM AR genes led to the identification of 22 genes with significantly different cumulative allele frequencies in the Polish (POL) vs European NFE population. We hope that The Thousand Polish Genomes database will contribute to the worldwide genomic data resources for researchers and clinicians.","Kaja, Elżbieta; Lejman, Adrian; Sielski, Dawid; Sypniewski, Mateusz; Gambin, Tomasz; Suchocki, Tomasz; Dawidziuk, Mateusz; Golik, Paweł; Wojtaszewska, Marzena; Stępień, Maria; Szyda, Joanna; Lisiak-Teodorczyk, Karolina; Wolbach, Filip; Kołodziejska, Daria; Ferdyn, Katarzyna; Woźna, Alicja; Żytkiewicz, Marcin; Bodora-Troińska, Anna; Elikowski, Waldemar; Król, Zbigniew; Zaczyński, Artur; Pawlak, Agnieszka; Gil, Robert; Wierzba, Waldemar; Dobosz, Paula; Zawadzka, Katarzyna; Zawadzki, Paweł; Sztromwasser, Paweł",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.07.451425,261
183499,Curtailing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome within a community and its hospital.,2003,"Recent empirical studies have shown the negative psychological impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing and avoidance of social gatherings are considered among the best public health and safety measures to adopt to counter the outbreak, and governments are establishing subsequent rules worldwide. Consequently, interventions in workplaces need to be implemented remotely, including those regarding mental health. Therefore, the importance of digital solutions for workplace mental health promotion becomes apparent. Meta-analytical and systematic evidence has shown that digital technologies may be useful in improving workers’ mental health. Thus, digital-based interventions can be deemed as a feasible solution to deal with the negative psychological impact of the current pandemic. Based on previous literature, we developed a conceptual taxonomy composed of two main functional categories of digital solutions, such as (1) allowing assessment and intervention, and (2) allowing to work remotely. We also identified three sub-categories of (1), such as digital technologies for externally provided interventions, for stress self-management strategies, and for reformatting in-presence interventions. Human Factors and Ergonomics issues should be considered when dealing with the use of workplace mental health promotion digital technologies, both at the individual and organizational level, as they can be conceived as implementation challenges that may undermine interventions’ effectiveness when not managed properly. This paper intends to allow researchers to identify future directions of investigating workplace psychological well-being interventions based on novel technology advancements. Also, the paper provides practitioners with an overview of actionable solutions that can be easily implemented during these organizationally challenging times. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Giusino, D.; De Angelis, M.; Pietrantoni, L.","21st Congress of the International Ergonomics Association, IEA 2021",https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-74611-7_76,261

Our empirical analysis reveals several important findings. First, the main advantage of this approach is to detect the long-term relationship as well as the short-term dynamics and to represent the interdependence between the variables. We further estimate a multivariate GARCH type model that enables us to examine the dynamic conditional correlations (short-run links) among the considered variables under the effects of long-run interactions and volatility persistence. We determine that the volatility transmission was time-varying and that influence from the crisis. Moreover, the joint distribution is explored using the Gumbel copulas in order to describe the nonlinear structure of dependence between the variables. The empirical results provide evidence of fractional cointegration between the exchanges rates and show long-run causal links between the variables and we find significant bidirectional causal links. In particular, we show a positive dynamic correlation and the dependence structure is represented by the optimal copula coefficient used for measuring the risk spillovers between the exchange rates.","Boubaker, Heni Zorgati Mouna Ben Saad Bannour Nawres",Economic Analysis and Policy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eap.2021.06.014,261

Objectives: The objective was to evaluate the feasibility of using a medication dispense data in order to identify patients with chronic inflammatory diseases under B/TST in outpatient care setting and evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in France Methods: LRx contains all anonymized medication dispenses prescribed in outpatient care in a representative panel of French retails pharmacies, including data of near 40 million patients. Patients having at least one B/TST delivered in 2019 were selected. An algorithm was constructed using different steps, including a machine learning step by transfer learning applied in patient classified as having a rheumatologic condition in order to differentiate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) from spondyloarthritis (SA). We numbered 190,640 patients, of which 87.8% were classified in one of the following diseases: RA, SA, psoriatic arthritis (PA), psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (extrapolated data to France). Descriptive analysis was performed. The impact of COVID-19 on biotherapy initiation was evaluated during the lockdown period (W2-W19 2020) in these different conditions. Results: Among the 167,468 patients under B/TST, 20.7%, 18.4%, 6.5%, 37.9% and 16.5% were considered as having a psoriasis, IBD, PA, RA, and SA, respectively. Female patients were more frequent in RA and PA (≥ 60%);younger (< 20 years) and older patients (74 years) were found in patients with IBD (5.7%) and RA (12.6%), respectively. Contrasting with IBD, SA, and RA patients were mainly under anti-TNF treatment (≥ 90% for IBD and SA, 73.5% for RA), psoriasis and PA patients received a range of broadly well-balanced of B/TST. Among the immunosuppressant, methotrexate was mostly prescribed in RA (58.4%), PA (34.1%), and psoriasis (14.1%), and azathioprine in IBD (19.9%). Oral corticosteroid delivered at least 4 times in 2019 were mostly found to be associated with a RA condition (28%). A significant decrease of biotherapy initiation was observed during the lockdown in France in patients with IBD (-20%, p=0.03) and psoriasis (-54%, p<0.0001), not significant decrease in patients with SA (-6%) and increase in RA patients (+23%). Conclusion: The algorithm was able to identify patients with chronic inflammatory diseases under B/TST delivered in outpatient care and will allow to follow-up its management and study the COVID-19 impact on biotherapy initiation.

184004,Characterization of a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2003,"Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory and has had a formal association with Great Britain since the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. It has a population of around thirty-three thousand and shares a land border with Spain.The first reported case of Covid-19 in Gibraltar was reported on the 4th March 2020 from a Gibraltarian returning from Northern Italy. Early modelling completed by the Department of Public Health in March 2020 estimated the potential for five hundred Covid-19 related hospital admissions. St. Bernard’s Hospital is the only hospital in Gibraltar and has a capacity of around one hundred and fifty beds.The key issues identified early on were identifying a venue of sufficient capacity to create a Covid-19 field hospital, oxygen requirements and the actual building of the facility. A recently completed sports facility was identified as being available which had sufficient capacity to provide spaces for three hundred beds.The major challenge was ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to the field hospital. As it was in a remote location, oxygen had to be sourced independently of the main hospital. An operational decision was made to only admit patients who required 5L/min oxygen or less. A contingency plan was made to ensure oxygen cylinders could be charged within Gibraltar at two units: a newly commissioned oxygen plant and the local hyperbaric unit. The field hospital was operational by the time of the expected surge in Covid-19 cases.An important lesson is that each field hospital will have differing specialist needs but have a backbone of common requirements. New hospitals will need staff, equipment and a physical space. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic an important issue that was flagged up early was the requirement for substantial amounts of oxygen. This helped to guide our team to build a specific hospital for a specific situation.","Kumar, Arvind Burke Derek",BMJ Leader,https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-fmlm.134,261

184915,Specific features of the contact history of probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2005,"Several studies have found that black patients are more likely than white patients to test positive for or be hospitalized with COVID-19, but many of these same studies have found no difference in in-hospital mortality. These studies may have underestimated racial differences due to reliance on data from a single hospital system, as adequate control of patient-level characteristics requires aggregation of highly granular data from several institutions. Further, one factor thought to contribute to disparities in health outcomes by race is site of care. Several differences between black and white patient populations, such as access to care and referral patterns among clinicians, can lead to patients of different races largely attending different hospitals. We sought to develop a method that could study the potential association between attending hospital and racial disparity in mortality for COVID-19 patients without requiring patient-level data sharing among collaborating institutions. We propose a novel application of a distributed algorithm for generalized linear mixed modeling (GLMM) to perform counterfactual modeling and investigate the role of hospital in differences in COVID-19 mortality by race. Our counterfactual modeling approach uses simulation to randomly assign black patients to hospitals in the same distribution as those attended by white patients, quantifying the difference between observed mortality rates and simulated mortality risk following random hospital assignment. To illustrate our method, we perform a proof-of-concept analysis using data from four hospitals within the OneFlorida Clinical Research Consortium. Our approach can be used by investigators from several institutions to study the impact of admitting hospital on COVID-19 mortality, a critical step in addressing systemic racism in modern healthcare.","Edmondson, M.

We also present a delay-aware algorithm to investigate the initial relationship between tasks and identify a similar pattern for the mapped task graph on the various topologies. Our algorithm and predictor circuit decrease latency for determining related data to tasks and transfers data from global buffer onto PEs and buffers them according to its reusability for tasks with similar patterns. We utilized real data of the reported COVID-19 statistics and particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) condensation for evaluating our method. Simulation results demonstrate reducing energy consumption, delay, memory access, and increasing area consumption by approximately 61.83%, 39.96%, 66.66%, and 0.13%, respectively, for the mapped task graphs on a mesh network before employing the circuit and algorithm.","Rahmani, Amir Masoud Mirmahaleh Seyedeh Yasaman Hosseini",Microelectronics Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mejo.2021.105250,261

We interviewed Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) specialist physicians providing rehabilitation services throughout Rhode Island to organize a narrative assessing the pandemic's impact on the state's rehabilitation community and the responses of its leaders. Almost half of rehabilitation providers needed to suspend their services during the initial peak of the pandemic. Most experienced reductions in the size of their practices, as well as personnel issues that contributed to burnout. All physicians used telemedicine to connect with patients. Many reported issues with accessing personal protective equipment and providing clinical opportunities for trainees. Inpatient rehabilitation policies and practices helped to maintain access for COVID-positive and negative patients, yet challenges were faced when configuring physical space to abide by CDC social distancing guidelines and providing care without patient visitors.

186916,Severe acute respiratory syndrome among children.,2004,"Previous studies suggested that varicella-zoster virus derives its final envelope from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and that envelope glycoproteins (gps) are transported to the TGN independently of nucleocapsids. We tested the hypothesis that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a signal sequence or patch encoded in its cytosolic domain. cDNAs encoding gpI wild type (wt) and a truncated mutant gpI(trc) lacking transmembrane and cytosolic domains were cloned by using the PCR. Cells transfected with cDNA encoding gpI(wt) or gpI(trc) synthesized and N glycosylated the proteins. gpI(wt) accumulated in the TGN, some reached the plasmalemma, but none was secreted. In contrast, gpI(trc) was retained and probably degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum; none was found on cell surfaces, but some was secreted. The distribution of gpI(trc) was not affected by deletion of potential glycosylation sites. To locate a potential gpI-targeting sequence, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding chimeric proteins in which the ectodomain of a plasmalemmal marker, the interleukin-2 receptor (tac), was fused to different domains of gpI. A chimeric protein in which tac was fused with the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of gpI was targeted to the TGN. In contrast, a chimeric protein in which tac was fused only with the gpI transmembrane domain passed through the TGN and concentrated in endosomes. We conclude that gpI is targeted to the TGN as a result of a targeting sequence or patch in its cytosolic domain.","Zhu, Z; Gershon, M D; Hao, Y; Ambron, R T; Gabel, C A; Gershon, A A",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7494308/,261

They also present the preliminary results of a translational study aimed at investigating the role of terminal and anastomotic types of circulation in arterial branches jailed by flow-diverting stents as factors contributing to arterial patency or occlusion. METHODS Two Large White swine were used to validate a terminal-type arterial model at the level of the right ascending pharyngeal artery (APhA), created exclusively by endovascular means. Subsequently 4 Large White swine, allocated to 2 groups corresponding to the presence (Group B) or absence (Group A) of terminal-type flow modification, underwent placement of flow-diverting stents. Blood flow rates and velocities were quantified using a dedicated time-resolved 3D phase-contrast MRA sequence before and after stenting. Three months after stent placement, the stented arteries were evaluated with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Patent (circulating) ostia quantification was performed on the SEM images. RESULTS Terminal-type flow modification was feasible; an increase of 75.8% in mean blood velocities was observed in the right APhAs. The mean blood flow rate for Group A was 0.31 ± 0.19 ml/sec (95% CI -1.39 to 2.01) before stenting and 0.21 ± 0.07 ml/sec (95% CI -0.45 to 0.87) after stenting. The mean blood flow rate for Group B was 0.87 ± 0.32 ml/sec (95% CI -1.98 to 3.73) before stenting and 0.76 ± 0.13 ml/sec (95% CI -0.41 to 1.93) after stenting. Mean flow rates after stenting showed a statistically significant difference between Groups A and B (Welch test). Mean and maximal blood velocities were reduced in Group A cases and did not decrease in Group B cases. Control DSA and SEM findings showed near occlusion of the jailed APhAs in both cases of anastomotic circulation (mean patent ostium surface 32,776 μm2) and patency in both cases of terminal-type circulation (mean patent ostium surface 422,334 μm2). CONCLUSIONS Terminal-type arterial modification in swine APhAs is feasible. Sufficient data were acquired to perform an a priori analysis for further research. Flow diversion at the level of the APhA ostium resulted in significant stenosis in cases of anastomotic circulation, while sufficient patency was observed in terminal-type circulation.","Iosif, Christina; Berg, Philipp; Ponsonnard, Sebastien; Carles, Pierre; Saleme, Suzana; Pedrolo-Silveira, Eduardo; Mendes, Georges; Waihrich, Eduardo; Trolliard, Gilles; Couquet, Claude-Yves; Yardin, Catherine; Mounayer, Charbel",Journal of neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771853/,261

Recent use of JCR's journal impact factor for evaluation of journals and authors has provoked strongly mixed reactions among investigators. This paper examines the effects of the rapidly expanding literature on the impact factor over the past decade and examines the limitations of journal impact factor for evaluating individual author's contributions. The JCR analyzed 6088 journals in 2005, a 32% increase in new listings since 1995. During the same period, there was a 39% increase in new journal listings in the infectious diseases category. The phenomenon of journal proliferation has had a profound effect on the journal impact factor. During the past decade an increased impact factor was observed in 92% of the top ranking major journals, especially in young and rapidly expanding research fields. Certain highly cited new journals published primarily review articles - not original contributions. There was no increase in impact factor among some of the best known journals, such as Journal of Experimental Medicine, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA), and Journal of Infectious Diseases. Clearly, journal impact factor is an imperfect tool for measuring the quality of articles, and its use in evaluating authors has inherent risks. In spite of its limitations, journal impact factor can be used as a rough indicator of scientific quality in specific subject categories and for serious reading and learning.","Andersen, Julia; Belmont, John; Cho, Cheng T","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17164944/,261
190514,Severe acute respiratory syndrome.,2003,"Human aminopeptidase N (hAPN or CD13) and porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) are functional receptors for human coronavirus (HCV) 229E and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), respectively. However, hAPN cannot function as a receptor for TGEV and pAPN cannot function as a receptor for HCV 229E. In this study, we constructed a series of chimeric hAPN/pAPN genes and expressed the corresponding proteins in transfected cells. Subsequently, we identified the chimeric proteins that can function as a receptor for HCV 229E. The results show that replacement of a small region of pAPN sequence (pAPN amino acids 255-348) with the corresponding hAPN sequence (hAPN amino acids 260-353) converts pAPN into a functional receptor for HCV 229E. The region of hAPN that we have defined in this way does not correspond to the region of pAPN that has been identified as essential for the TGEV-receptor interaction. We conclude that although both viruses use a homologous receptor protein, different regions of the protein are required to mediate susceptibility to infection with HCV 229E and TGEV.","Kolb, A F; Maile, J; Heister, A; Siddell, S G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8887485/,261
191198,Antibody response and viraemia during the course of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus infection.,2004,"Recombination between coinfecting viruses had not been documented previously for a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus (mononegavirus). We investigated the potential of intermolecular recombination by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by coinfecting HEp-2 cells with two recombinant RSV (rRSV) mutants lacking either the G gene (DeltaG/HEK) or the NS1 and NS2 genes (DeltaNS1/2). These viruses replicate inefficiently and form pinpoint plaques in HEp-2 cells. Therefore, potential recombined viruses with a growth and/or plaque formation advantage should easily be identified and differentiated from the two parental viruses. Further identification of potential recombinants was aided by the inclusion of point mutation markers in the F and L genes of DeltaG/HEK and the design of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) primers capable of detecting these markers. Independent coinfections and control single infections by these two rRSV mutants were performed. In one of six coinfections, an RSV variant was identified that produced plaques slightly larger than those of wild-type RSV in HEp-2 cells. RT-PCR and sequencing provided evidence that this variant was a recombined RSV (rec-RSV). The rec-RSV appeared to have been generated by a polymerase jump from the DeltaG/HEK genome to that of DeltaNS1/2 and back again in the vicinity of the SH-G-F genes. This apparently involved nonhomologous and homologous recombination events, respectively. The recombined genome was identical to that of the DeltaG/HEK mutant except that all but the first 12 nucleotides of the SH gene were deleted and replaced by an insert consisting of the last 91 nucleotides of the G gene and its downstream intergenic region. This insert could have come only from the coinfecting DeltaNS1/2 virus. This resulted in the formation of a short chimeric SH:G gene. Northern and Western blot analysis confirmed that the rec-RSV did not express the normal SH and G mRNAs and proteins but did express the aberrant SH:G mRNA. This provides an experimental demonstration of intermolecular recombination yielding a viable, helper-independent mononegavirus. However, the isolation of only a single rec-RSV under these optimized conditions supports the idea that RSV recombination is rare indeed.","Spann, Kirsten M; Collins, Peter L; Teng, Michael N",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14512568/,261

192150,Analysis of deaths during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Singapore: challenges in determining a SARS diagnosis.,2004,"Mice infected with mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM develop an inflammatory demyelinating disease in the central nervous system with many similarities to human multiple sclerosis. The mouse disease is primarily immune-mediated because demyelination is not detected in JHM-infected mice lacking T or B cells but does occur after transfer of JHM-specific T cells. Although less is known about the ability of antibodies to mediate demyelination, the presence of oligoclonally expanded B cells and high concentrations of antibodies (against self or infectious agents) in the central nervous system of many multiple sclerosis patients suggests that antibodies may also contribute to myelin destruction. Here, we show that anti-JHM antibodies, in the absence of T or B cells, caused demyelination in JHM-infected mice. Anti-JHM antibody was detected adjacent to areas of demyelination, consistent with a direct interaction between antibody and infected cells. Demyelination was reduced by 85 to 90% in infected RAG1(-/-) mice lacking normal expression of activating Fc receptors (FcRgamma(-/-)) and by approximately 76% when complement was depleted by treatment with cobra venom factor. These data demonstrate that JHM-specific antibodies are sufficient to cause demyelination and that myelin destruction in the presence of anti-virus antibodies results from a combination of complement- and Fc receptor-dependent mechanisms.","Kim, Taeg S; Perlman, Stanley",The American journal of pathology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15743792/,261

Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of SJL/J mice causes persistent infection of CNS microglia, leading to the development of a chronic-progressive CD4(+) T-cell-mediated autoimmune demyelinating disease. We asked if TMEV infection of microglia activates their innate immune functions and/or activates their ability to serve as antigen-presenting cells for activation of T-cell responses to virus and endogenous myelin epitopes. The results indicate that microglia lines can be persistently infected with TMEV and that infection significantly upregulates the expression of cytokines involved in innate immunity (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6 [IL-6], IL-18, and, most importantly, type I interferons) along with upregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II, IL-12, and various costimulatory molecules (B7-1, B7-2, CD40, and ICAM-1). Most significantly, TMEV-infected microglia were able to efficiently process and present both endogenous virus epitopes and exogenous myelin epitopes to inflammatory CD4(+) Th1 cells. Thus, TMEV infection of microglia activates these cells to initiate an innate immune response which may lead to the activation of naive and memory virus- and myelin-specific adaptive immune responses within the CNS.","Olson, J K; Girvin, A M; Miller, S D",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11559811/,261

Comparison of the chemical shift data suggests that the helix structure is perturbed more to the 3'-side of the cis-syn dimer and more to the 5'-side of the trans-syn dimer. Thermodynamic parameters for the helix in equilibrium coil equilibrium were obtained by two-state, all or none, analysis of the melting behavior of the duplexes. Analysis of the temperature dependence of the T5CH3 1H NMR signal gave delta H = 44 +/- 4 kcal and delta S = 132 +/- 13 eu for the trans-syn duplex.

It was concluded that photodimerization of the dTpdT unit to give the cis-syn product causes little perturbation of the DNA whereas dimerization to give the trans-syn product causes much greater perturbation, possibly in the form of a kink or dislocation at the 5'-side of the dimer.","Taylor, J S; Garrett, D S; Brockie, I R; Svoboda, D L; Telser, J",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2271562/,261

The culprit, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was detected in patient specimens by traditional cell culture using an unusual cell line for respiratory viruses, Vero E6, and by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the polymerase 1 B region of the genome. In addition, serologic assays were rapidly developed, and the genome of this large virus was sequenced within one month of its spread to North America. At the present time, diagnostics have progressed to the point that RT-PCR has a sensitivity approaching 80% within the first few days of onset of illness, while serology has a sensitivity close to 100% on convalescent sera taken >21 days after illness onset. Viral culture remains a method confined to biosafety level III laboratories. The specificity of RT-PCR and serology remains to be conclusively defined, but in most studies to date seems to be >90%. Serologic cross-reactivity with human coronaviruses causing the common cold may be a problem with some serologic assays. The early development of SARS-CoV diagnostics is now being replaced by refinement and optimization of these assays.

Chronic GAV infections were observed in healthy Penaeus monodon collected from farms and healthy P. esculentus surviving experimental infection. During chronic-phase infections in both species, GAV was detected only in partitioned foci of cells with hypertrophied nuclei (spheroids) within the lymphoid organ. Acute-phase infections were observed in moribund P. monodon and P. esculentus infected experimentally with a high dose of GAV, and in moribund P. monodon collected from farms during outbreaks of disease. During acute experimental infections in P. monodon, ISH detected GAV throughout the lymphoid organ, in gills and in connective tissues throughout the cephalothorax. In moribund P. monodon collected from natural outbreaks of disease, GAV was also detected in the gills and in connective tissues of the cephalothorax, but the distribution of virus within the lymphoid organ varied. In acutely infected P. esculentus, GAV was detected in connective tissues, but was restricted to the inner stromal matrix cells and endothelial cells of intact lymphoid organ tubules. The tissue distribution of GAV identified by ISH suggests that shrimp are able to control and maintain chronic asymptomatic infection by a process involving lymphoid organ spheroids. Acute phase infections and the development of disease appear to be dose-related and involve the systemic distribution of virus in connective tissues throughout the cephalothorax.","Spann, Kirsten M; McCulloch, Russell J; Cowley, Jeff A; East, Iain J; Walker, Peter J",Diseases of aquatic organisms,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14524496/,261

195228,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS): epidemiology and clinical features.,2004,"Drug-induced tardive motor syndromes (TMS) is a group of disorders, characterized by involuntary movements of the tongue, face, lips, trunk and extremities, occurring after long-term exposure to a variety of pharmacological agents, mostly neuroleptics. The diagnosis of TMS requires exposure to dopamine receptor blocking agents for a period at least of 3 months, although for people over 60 years old the necessary exposure period is limited to 1 month. The exact pathophysiology still remains obscure. The aim of this article is to review the phenomenology, epidemiology and treatment options of the TMS, as clinically distinct movement disorders. TMS include tardive dyskinesia, which is the most common movement disorder, tardive dystonia, tardive akathisia, tardive Tourettism, tardive tremor and tardive myoclonus as well as some specific syndromes less often presented such as Pisa, Meige and Rabbit syndromes. Prevention remains the cornerstone in good clinical practice. Preventive approach requires thorough diagnostic process with frequent reviews in order to determine the necessity of use and dosing of neuroleptic treatment. Clinical vigilance for early detection of signs of TMS as well as recording of early extrapyramidal side-effects in the patient's history is needed, as these may predict the occurrence of TMS. In case of occurrence of TMS, gradual discontinuation of the offending agent is required. Therapeutic interventions include the administration of the following agents: atypical antipsychotics (mainly clozapine), benzodiazepines, vitamin E, reserpine, tetrabenazine, anticholinergics, botulinum toxin A. The early management of TMS is crucial for the patients' better clinical outcome and improved quality of life.","Havaki-Kontaxaki, B; Komborozos, A; Kontaxakis, V",Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22466675/,261
195333,Severe acute respiratory syndrome revisited.,2003,"AIM To evaluate the effects of different intracorporeal ligation techniques with titanium clips, Plasma Trisector (Gyrus, USA) (PTG), and surgical silk on bilateral laparoscopic varicocelectomy (LPVx). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between May 2009 and August 2012, 100 patients who underwent bilateral LPVx were evaluated. The demographic parameters of patients, preoperative radiological findings, semen analysis, operative data, and follow-up were recorded. All of the patients were divided into 3 groups, randomized prospectively. The patients whose veins were ligated by 5-mm titanium clips were included in group I, those whose veins were ligated by PTG were included in group II, and those whose veins were ligated by surgical silk were included in group III. The recorded data of the groups were analyzed. RESULTS Mean follow-up time was 18.8 + 1.1 months. According to the demographics of age, body mass index, spermiogram, and diameter of veins before surgery, there were no statistical differences between any of the groups (P > 0.05). However, operation time was longer in group III (P < 0.0001), while total numbers ofligated veins did not differ among the groups (P > 0.05). Additionally, hospital stay, oral intake, and complications were not different among the groups (P > 0.05). In follow-up the sperm count analysis was higher than the preoperative count analysis for all of the groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION PTG may provide a shorter operation time than using titanium clips and/or surgical silk in LPVx. Additionally, PTG may increase sperm count with fewer complications than the other ligation techniques in LPVx. Therefore, PTG may be the new candidate electrosurgical standard device for LPVx in the nearby future.","Akin, Yiğit; Ateş, Mutlu; Yücel, Selçuk; Başara, Işil; Çelik, Orçun; Bozkurt, Aliseydi; Nuhoğlu, Bariş",Turkish journal of medical sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25536736/,261

We undertook to develop a small animal model of hMPV infection, pathogenesis, and protection. Hamsters, guinea pigs, cotton rats, and nine inbred strains of mice were inoculated intranasally with hMPV. The animals were sacrificed, and nasal and lung tissue virus yields were determined by plaque titration. None of the animals exhibited respiratory symptoms. The quantity of virus present in the nasal tissue ranged from 4.6 x 10(2) PFU/gram tissue (C3H mice) to greater than 10(5) PFU/gram (hamster). The amount of virus in the lungs was considerably less than in nasal tissue in each species tested, ranging from undetectable (<5 PFU/g; guinea pigs) to 1.8 x 10(5) PFU/gram (cotton rat). The peak virus titer in cotton rat lungs occurred on day 4 postinfection. hMPV-infected cotton rat lungs examined on day 4 postinfection exhibited histopathological changes consisting of peribronchial inflammatory infiltrates. Immunohistochemical staining detected virus only at the luminal surfaces of respiratory epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract. hMPV-infected cotton rats mounted virus-neutralizing antibody responses and were partially protected against virus shedding and lung pathology on subsequent rechallenge with hMPV. Viral antigen was undetectable in the lungs on challenge of previously infected animals. This study demonstrates that the cotton rat is a permissive small animal model of hMPV infection that exhibits lung histopathology associated with infection and that primary infection protected animals against subsequent infection. This model will allow further in vivo studies of hMPV pathogenesis and evaluation of vaccine candidates.","Williams, John V; Tollefson, Sharon J; Johnson, Joyce E; Crowe, James E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103146/,261

ORF 5a and ORF 5b, that encode small proteins of unknown function. In the experiments described here, we have used the in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs to examine the expression of these ORFs. Our results show that a synthetic mRNA containing both ORFs is functionally bicistronic. More importantly, the expression of ORF 5b, but not ORF 5a, is maintained in a tricistronic mRNA containing an additional 5'-proximal ORF. Thus, in the context of the MHV mRNA 5 unique region, the initiation of protein synthesis on ORF 5b can occur independently of ribosomes that enter from the 5' end of the mRNA. We conclude that the translation of ORF 5b is mediated by the internal entry of ribosomes.","Thiel, V; Siddell, S G",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7964613/,261
196696,Safety and immunogenicity from a phase I trial of inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine.,2007,"The putative envelope glycoproteins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) likely play an important role in the initiation of viral infection. Available information suggests that the genomic regions encoding the putative envelope glycoproteins, when expressed as recombinant proteins in mammalian cells, largely accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum. In this study, genomic regions which include the putative ectodomain of the E1 (amino acids 174 to 359) and E2 (amino acids 371 to 742) glycoproteins were appended to the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein. This provided a membrane anchor signal and the VSV incorporation signal at the carboxy termini of the E1 and E2 glycoproteins. The chimeric gene constructs exhibited expression of the recombinant proteins on the cell surface in a transient expression assay. When infected with a temperature-sensitive VSV mutant (ts045) and grown at the nonpermissive temperature (40.5 degrees C), cells transiently expressing the E1 or E2 chimeric glycoprotein generated VSV/HCV pseudotyped virus. The resulting pseudotyped virus generated from E1 or E2 surprisingly exhibited the ability to infect mammalian cells and sera derived from chimpanzees immunized with the homologous HCV envelope glycoproteins neutralized pseudotyped virus infectivity. Results from this study suggested a potential functional role for both the E1 and E2 glycoproteins in the infectivity of VSV/HCV pseudotyped virus in mammalian cells. These observations further suggest the importance of using both viral glycoproteins in a candidate subunit vaccine and the potential for using a VSV/HCV pseudotyped virus to determine HCV neutralizing antibodies.","Lagging, L M; Meyer, K; Owens, R J; Ray, R",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9557633/,261

The recommendation to use Biosafety Level (BSL)3 practices within a BSL2 environment appears to have been a practical decision based on available resources; most diagnostic laboratories operate at BSL2. Safety is achieved with controls in administration, engineering and personal protective equipment/behaviour. At the heart of every safety policy is a risk assessment based on the exact manipulations employed. Excessive administrative and engineering controls are less important than the training and personal attitudes, abilities and understanding of the staff. The SARS outbreak focused our attention on the safety aspects of common mundane tasks, such as decapping blood tubes. Laboratories often claim they follow certain practices but casual observation does not always support these claims. Guidelines differed and created uncertainty. This was stressful for laboratory staff held accountable for their implementation. Attempts to categorise risks and their management into neatly wrapped parcels are attractive, but closer inspection reveals a subjective element that allows doubt to creep in with varying interpretations of the literature. Staff most at risk were those handling respiratory samples. Staff receiving samples via pneumatic tubes had least control over their exposure and were potentially exposed to aerosols from leaking samples.

Given the risk to human health and the theoretical potential for JEV use as a bioweapon, the development of safe and effective vaccines to prevent JEV infection is vital for preserving human health. The development of vaccines for JE began in the 1940s with formalin-inactivated mouse brain-derived vaccines. These vaccines have been shown to induce a protective immune response and to be very effective. Mouse brain-derived vaccines were still in use until May 2011 when the last lots of the BIKEN(®) JE-VAX(®) expired. Development of modern JE vaccines utilizes cell culture-derived viruses and improvements in manufacturing processes as well as removal of potential allergens or toxins have significantly improved vaccine safety. China has developed a live-attenuated vaccine that has proven to induce protective immunity following a single inoculation. In addition, a chimeric vaccine virus incorporating the prM and E structural proteins derived from the live-attenuated JE vaccine into the live-attenuated yellow fever 17D vaccine virus backbone is currently in clinical trials. In this article, we provide a summary of JE vaccine development and on-going clinical trials.

Only six core amino acids are conserved across all polymerases of positive-strand RNA viruses of eukaryotes. While exploring the function of one of these completely conserved residues, asparagine 297 in the prototypic poliovirus polymerase 3D(pol), we identified three viable mutants with noncanonical amino acids at this conserved position. Although asparagine 297 could be replaced by glycine or alanine in these mutants, the viruses exhibited Mn(2+)-dependent RNA replication and viral growth. All known RNA polymerases and replicative polymerases of bacterial, eukaryotic, and viral organisms are thought to be magnesium dependent in vivo, and therefore these mutant polioviruses may represent the first viruses with a requirement for an alternative polymerase cation. These results demonstrate the extreme functional flexibility of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Furthermore, the finding that strictly conserved residues in the nucleotide binding pocket of the polymerase can be altered in a manner that supports virus production suggests that drugs targeting this region of the enzyme will still be susceptible to the problem of drug-resistant escape mutants.","Crotty, Shane; Gohara, David; Gilligan, Devin K; Karelsky, Sveta; Cameron, Craig E; Andino, Raul",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12692240/,261

201034,"Surge of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections linked to single introduction of a virus strain in Myanmar, 2020",2021,"OBJECTIVE This health technology policy assessment will answer the following questions: When should in-room air cleaners be used?How effective are in-room air cleaners?Are in-room air cleaners that use combined HEPA and UVGI air cleaning technology more effective than those that use HEPA filtration alone?What is the Plasmacluster ion air purifier in the pandemic influenza preparation plan?The experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) locally, nationally, and internationally underscored the importance of administrative, environmental, and personal protective infection control measures in health care facilities. In the aftermath of the SARS crisis, there was a need for a clearer understanding of Ontario's capacity to manage suspected or confirmed cases of airborne infectious diseases. In so doing, the Walker Commission thought that more attention should be paid to the potential use of new technologies such as in-room air cleaning units. It recommended that the Medical Advisory Secretariat of the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care evaluate the appropriate use and effectiveness of such new technologies. Accordingly, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee asked the Medical Advisory Secretariat to review the literature on the effectiveness and utility of in-room air cleaners that use high-efficiency particle air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) air cleaning technology. Additionally, the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee prioritized a request from the ministry's Emergency Management Unit to investigate the possible role of the Plasmacluster ion air purifier manufactured by Sharp Electronics Corporation, in the pandemic influenza preparation plan. CLINICAL NEED Airborne transmission of infectious diseases depends in part on the concentration of breathable infectious pathogens (germs) in room air. Infection control is achieved by a combination of administrative, engineering, and personal protection methods. Engineering methods that are usually carried out by the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system function to prevent the spread of airborne infectious pathogens by diluting (dilution ventilation) and removing (exhaust ventilation) contaminated air from a room, controlling the direction of airflow and the air flow patterns in a building. However, general wear and tear over time may compromise the HVAC system's effectiveness to maintain adequate indoor air quality. Likewise, economic issues may curtail the completion of necessary renovations to increase its effectiveness. Therefore, when exposure to airborne infectious pathogens is a risk, the use of an in-room air cleaner to reduce the concentration of airborne pathogens and prevent the spread of airborne infectious diseases has been proposed as an alternative to renovating a HVAC system. Airborne transmission is the spread of infectious pathogens over large distances through the air. Infectious pathogens, which may include fungi, bacteria, and viruses, vary in size and can be dispersed into the air in drops of moisture after coughing or sneezing. Small drops of moisture carrying infectious pathogens are called droplet nuclei. Droplet nuclei are about 1 to 5μm in diameter. This small size in part allows them to remain suspended in the air for several hours and be carried by air currents over considerable distances. Large drops of moisture carrying infectious pathogens are called droplets. Droplets being larger than droplet nuclei, travel shorter distances (about 1 metre) before rapidly falling out of the air to the ground. Because droplet nuclei remain airborne for longer periods than do droplets, they are more amenable to engineering infection control methods than are droplets. Droplet nuclei are responsible for the airborne transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, chicken pox (varicella), measles (rubeola), and dessiminated herpes zoster, whereas close contact is required for the direct transmission of infectious diseases transmitted by droplets, such as influenza (the flu) and SARS. THE TECHNOLOGY In-room air cleaners are supplied as portable or fixed devices. Fixed devices can be attached to either a wall or ceiling and are preferred over portable units because they have a greater degree of reliability (if installed properly) for achieving adequate room air mixing and airflow patterns, which are important for optimal effectiveness. Through a method of air recirculation, an in-room air cleaner can be used to increase room ventilation rates and if used to exhaust air out of the room it can create a negative-pressure room for airborne infection isolation (AII) when the building's HVAC system cannot do so. A negative-pressure room is one where clean air flows into the room but contaminated air does not flow out of it. Contaminated room air is pulled into the in-room air cleaner and cleaned by passing through a series of filters, which remove the airborne infectious pathogens. The cleaned air is either recirculated into the room or exhausted outside the building. By filtering contaminated room air and then recirculating the cleaned air into the room, an in-room air cleaner can improve the room's ventilation. By exhausting the filtered air to the outside the unit can create a negative-pressure room. There are many types of in-room air cleaners. They vary widely in the airflow rates through the unit, the type of air cleaning technology used, and the technical design. Crucial to maximizing the efficiency of any in-room air cleaner is its strategic placement and set-up within a room, which should be done in consultation with ventilation engineers, infection control experts, and/or industrial hygienists. A poorly positioned air cleaner may disrupt airflow patterns within the room and through the air cleaner, thereby compromising its air cleaning efficiency. The effectiveness of an in-room air cleaner to remove airborne pathogens from room air depends on several factors, including the airflow rate through the unit's filter and the airflow patterns in the room. Tested under a variety of conditions, in-room air cleaners, including portable or ceiling mounted units with either a HEPA or a non-HEPA filter, portable units with UVGI lights only, or ceiling mounted units with combined HEPA filtration and UVGI lights, have been estimated to be between 30% and 90%, 99% and 12% and 80% effective, respectively. However, and although their effectiveness is variable, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged in-room air cleaners as alternative technology for increasing room ventilation when this cannot be achieved by the building's HVAC system with preference given to fixed recirculating systems over portable ones. Importantly, the use of an in-room air cleaner does not preclude either the need for health care workers and visitors to use personal protective equipment (N95 mask or equivalent) when entering AII rooms or health care facilities from meeting current regulatory requirements for airflow rates (ventilation rates) in buildings and airflow differentials for effective negative-pressure rooms. The Plasmacluster ion technology, developed in 2000, is an air purification technology. Its manufacturer, Sharp Electronics Corporation, says that it can disable airborne microorganisms through the generation of both positive and negative ions. (1) The functional unit is the hydroxyl, which is a molecule comprised of one oxygen molecule and one hydrogen atom. Plasmacluster ion air purifier uses a multilayer filter system composed of a prefilter, a carbon filter, an antibacterial filter, and a HEPA filter, combined with an ion generator to purify the air. The ion generator uses an alternating plasma discharge to split water molecules into positively and negatively charged ions. When these ions are emitted into the air, they are surrounded by water molecules and form cluster ions which are attracted to airborne particles. The cluster ion surrounds the airborne particle, and the positive and negative ions react to form hydroxyls. These hydroxyls steal the airborne particle's hydrogen atom, which creates a hole in the particle's outer protein membrane, thereby rendering it inactive. Because influenza is primarily acquired by large droplets and direct and indirect contact with an infectious person, any in-room air cleaner will have little benefit in controlling and preventing its spread. Therefore, there is no role for the Plasmacluster ion air purifier or any other in-room air cleaner in the control of the spread of influenza. Accordingly, for purposes of this review, the Medical Advisory Secretariat presents no further analysis of the Plasmacluster. REVIEW STRATEGY The objective of the systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of in-room air cleaners with built in UVGI lights and HEPA filtration compared with those using HEPA filtration only. The Medical Advisory Secretariat searched the databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, INAHATA (International Network of Agencies for Health Technology Assessment), Biosis Previews, Bacteriology Abstracts, Web of Science, Dissertation Abstracts, and NIOSHTIC 2. A meta-analysis was conducted if adequate data was available from 2 or more studies and where statistical and clinical heterogeneity among studies was not an issue. Otherwise, a qualitative review was completed. The GRADE system was used to summarize the quality of the body of evidence comprised of 1 or more studies. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS There were no existing health technology assessments on air cleaning technology located during the literature review. The literature search yielded 59 citations of which none were retained. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",,Ontario health technology assessment series,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23074468/,261

Using adapted measures from the CRISIS questionnaire, parents of children aged 6-18 (N = 1013; 56% male; 62% pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis) and self-reporting children/adolescents aged 10-18 (N = 385) indicated changes in mental health across six domains: depression, anxiety, irritability, attention, hyperactivity, and obsessions/compulsions. Changes in anxiety, irritability, and hyperactivity were calculated for children aged 2-5 years using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. COVID-19 exposure, compliance with emergency measures, COVID-19 economic concerns, and stress from social isolation were measured with the CRISIS questionnaire. Prevalence of change in mental health status was estimated for each domain; multinomial logistic regression was used to determine variables associated with mental health status change in each domain. Depending on the age group, 67-70% of children/adolescents experienced deterioration in at least one mental health domain; however, 19-31% of children/adolescents experienced improvement in at least one domain. Children/adolescents without and with psychiatric diagnoses tended to experience deterioration during the first wave of COVID-19. Rates of deterioration were higher in those with a pre-exiting diagnosis. The rate of deterioration was variable across different age groups and pre-existing psychiatric diagnostic groups: depression 37-56%, anxiety 31-50%, irritability 40-66%, attention 40-56%, hyperactivity 23-56%, obsessions/compulsions 13-30%. Greater stress from social isolation was associated with deterioration in all mental health domains (all ORs 11.12-55.24). The impact of pre-existing psychiatric diagnosis was heterogenous, associated with deterioration in depression, irritability, hyperactivity, obsession/compulsions for some children (ORs 1.96-2.23) but also with improvement in depression, anxiety, and irritability for other children (ORs 2.13-3.12). Economic concerns were associated with improvement in anxiety, attention, and obsessions/compulsions (ORs 3.97-5.57). Children/adolescents with and without pre-existing psychiatric diagnoses reported deterioration. Deterioration was associated with increased stress from social isolation. Enhancing social interactions for children/adolescents will be an important mitigation strategy for current and future COVID-19 waves.","Cost, Katherine Tombeau; Crosbie, Jennifer; Anagnostou, Evdokia; Birken, Catherine S; Charach, Alice; Monga, Suneeta; Kelley, Elizabeth; Nicolson, Rob; Maguire, Jonathon L; Burton, Christie L; Schachar, Russell J; Arnold, Paul D; Korczak, Daphne J",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,261

In this paper, metal decorated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) were evaluated for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) adsorption for potential use for designing viral inactivation surfaces. We employed first-principles methods based on the density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the capture of an individual H2O2 molecule on pristine and metal (Pt, Pd, Ni, Cu, Rh, or Ru) decorated SWCNTs. Although the single H2O2 molecule is weakly physisorbed on pristine SWCNT, a significant improvement on its adsorption energy was found by utilizing metal functionalized SWCNT as the adsorbent. It was revealed that Rh-SWCNT and Ru-SWCNT systems demonstrate outstanding performance for H2O2 adsorption. Furthermore, we discovered through calculations that Pt- and Cu-decorated SWNCT-H2O2 systems show high potential for filters for virus removal and inactivation with a very long shelf-life (2.2 × 1012 and 1.9 × 108 years, respectively). The strong adsorption of metal decorated SWCNTs and the long shelf-life of these nanomaterials suggest they are exceptional candidates for designing personal protection equipment against viruses.","Aasi, Aref; Aghaei, Sadegh M; Moore, Matthew D; Panchapakesan, Balaji",Int. j. mol. sci.

As yet, there are no established drugs available. Speeding up drug discovery is urgently required. We applied a workflow of combined in silico methods (virtual drug screening, molecular docking and supervised machine learning algorithms) to identify novel drug candidates against COVID-19. We constructed chemical libraries consisting of FDA-approved drugs for drug repositioning and of natural compound datasets from literature mining and the ZINC database to select compounds interacting with SARS-CoV-2 target proteins (spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, and 2'-o-ribose methyltransferase). Supported by the supercomputer MOGON, candidate compounds were predicted as presumable SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors. Interestingly, several approved drugs against hepatitis C virus (HCV), another enveloped (-) ssRNA virus (paritaprevir, simeprevir and velpatasvir) as well as drugs against transmissible diseases, against cancer, or other diseases were identified as candidates against SARS-CoV-2. This result is supported by reports that anti-HCV compounds are also active against Middle East Respiratory Virus Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. The candidate compounds identified by us may help to speed up the drug development against SARS-CoV-2.","Kadioglu, Onat; Saeed, Mohamed; Greten, Henry Johannes; Efferth, Thomas",Comput Biol Med,,261

Differences by gender, type of sport (individual vs. team), and competitive level (elite vs. amateur) were examined. One-way ANOVAs showed, in adults, significant differences between genders for perceived stress impact total score (TS; p = 0.017) and avoidance behavior, with higher scores in women (p = 0.045). Between individual and team sport, significant differences were found in TS (p = 0.038) and hyperarousal (p = 0.030), with higher results in individual. Adult elite athletes showed significantly higher scores in hyperarousal (p = 0.020) than amateurs. Significant differences were found between gender in adolescents for avoidance (p = 0.011), and between competitive levels in children, for intrusion (p = 0.020). These evidences may raise awareness on distress effects of COVID-19 lockdown among athletes and suggested applying specific well-being protocols during the activity resumption, considering gender, type of sport, and competitive level.","di Cagno, Alessandra; Buonsenso, Andrea; Baralla, Francesca; Grazioli, Elisa; Di Martino, Giulia; Lecce, Edoardo; Calcagno, Giuseppe; Fiorilli, Giovanni",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,261

However, the main viral proteinase (Mpro/3CLpro) has recently been regarded as a suitable target for drug design against SARS infection due to its vital role in polyproteins processing necessary for coronavirus reproduction. The present in silico study was designed to evaluate the effect of Jensenone, a essential oil component from eucalyptus oil, on Mpro by docking study. In the present study, molecular docking studies were conducted by using 1-click dock and swiss dock tools. Protein interaction mode was calculated by Protein Interactions Calculator.The calculated parameters such as binding energy, and binding site similarity indicated effective binding of Jensenone to COVID-19 proteinase. Active site prediction further validated the role of active site residues in ligand binding. PIC results indicated that, Mpro/ Jensenone complexes forms hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bond interactions and strong ionic interactions. Therefore, Jensenone may represent potential treatment potential to act as COVID-19 Mpro inhibitor. However, further research is necessary to investigate their potential medicinal use.","Sharma, Arun Dev; Kaur, Inderjeet",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00217v2.pdf,261

Considering the limited training cases and resources (e.g, time and budget), we propose a Multi-task Multi-slice Deep Learning System (M3Lung-Sys) for multi-class lung pneumonia screening from CT imaging, which only consists of two 2D CNN networks, i.e., slice- and patient-level classification networks. The former aims to seek the feature representations from abundant CT slices instead of limited CT volumes, and for the overall pneumonia screening, the latter one could recover the temporal information by feature refinement and aggregation between different slices. In addition to distinguish COVID-19 from Healthy, H1N1, and CAP cases, our M 3 Lung-Sys also be able to locate the areas of relevant lesions, without any pixel-level annotation. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on a chest CT imaging dataset with a total of 734 patients (251 healthy people, 245 COVID-19 patients, 105 H1N1 patients, and 133 CAP patients). The quantitative results with plenty of metrics indicate the superiority of our proposed model on both slice- and patient-level classification tasks. More importantly, the generated lesion location maps make our system interpretable and more valuable to clinicians.","Qian, Xuelin; Fu, Huazhu; Shi, Weiya; Chen, Tao; Fu, Yanwei; Shan, Fei; Xue, Xiangyang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.03201v1.pdf,261

We propose a novel pipeline for an autonomous agent to automatically capture an aesthetic photograph by navigating within a local region in a scene. Instead of classical optimization over heuristics such as the rule-of-thirds, we adopt a data-driven aesthetics estimator to assess photo quality. A reinforcement learning framework is used to optimize the model with respect to the learned aesthetics metric. We train our model in simulation with indoor scenes, and we demonstrate that our system can capture aesthetic photos in both simulation and real world environments on a ground robot. To our knowledge, this is the first system that can automatically explore an environment to capture an aesthetic photo with respect to a learned aesthetic estimator.","AlZayer, Hadi; Lin, Hubert; Bala, Kavita",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.09923v1.pdf,261

In the current study, the chicken LKB1 protein gene was amplified by PCR based on the primers and cDNA templates. Then, the cloning vector was constructed and the target gene was cloned. After that, the target gene was inserted into the expression vector to construct the recombinant plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3) host cells and the LKB1 recombinant proteins were successfully expressed by using Isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Finally, purified LKB1 proteins were used as antigen and the rabbit-derived antiserums were collected. The antiserum titer determined by ELISA was not less than 1:128000. The results of Western blot suggested that the polyclonal antibody is highly specific to chicken LKB1 protein. Immunofluorescence indicated that the LKB1 protein is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of liver, heart and hypothalamus cells of chicken. Our study showed that the LKB1 polyclonal antibodies produced by this method are effective and can be used to further study the role of LKB1 in the pathogenesis of chicken disease.","Zhang, Kun; Shi, Yan; Xu, Puzhi; Huang, Cheng; Zhou, Changming; Liu, Ping; Hu, Ruiming; Zhuang, Yu; Li, Guyue; Hu, Guoliang; Guo, Xiaoquan",Int. j. biol. macromol,,261

AIM: To synthesize existing data on the effectiveness of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) for N95 FFR decontamination. METHODS: Systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020176156) on UVGI in N95 FFRs using Embase, Medline, Global Health, Google Scholar, WHO feed, and MedRxiv. Two reviewers independently determined eligibility and extracted predefined variables. Original research reporting on function, decontamination, or mask fit following UVGI were included. FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS: Thirteen studies were identified, comprising 54 UVGI intervention arms and 58 N95 models. FFRs consistently maintained certification standards following UVGI. Aerosol penetration averaged 1.19% (0.70-2.48%) and 1.14% (0.57-2.63%) for control and UVGI arms respectively. Airflow resistance for the control arms averaged 9.79 mm H2O (7.97-11.70 mm H2O) vs 9.85 mm H2O (8.33-11.44 mm H2O) for UVGI arms. UVGI protocols employing a cumulative dose >20,000 J/m2 resulted in a 2 log reduction in viral load. A >3 log reduction was observed in seven UVGI arms using >40,000 J/m2. Impact of UVGI on fit was evaluated in two studies (16,200; 32,400 J/m2) and did not find evidence of compromise. Our findings suggest that further work in this area (or translation to a clinical setting) should use a cumulative UV-C dose of 40,000 J/m2 or greater, and confirm appropriate mask fit following decontamination.","Katie, O039; Hearn,; Gertsman, Shira; Sampson, Margaret; Webster, Richard; Tsampalieros, Anne; Ng, Rhiannon; Gibson, Jess; Lobos, Anna-Theresa; Acharya, Nina; Agarwal, Anirudh; Boggs, Samantha; Chamberlain, Graham; Staykov, Emiliyan; Sikora, Lindsey; McNally, James Dayre",J. hosp. infect,,261

239430,Plasma Levels of Glycohydrolases Activities in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Patients,2021,"Purpose: To give a better understanding of primary AE, the clinical characteristics and the possible therapeutic approaches. Background: Angioedema (AE) is a non-pitting, non-itching swelling of skin or mucosa. The symptom can become life-threatening if located in the airways. Primary (monosymptomatic) AE is a manifestation of several different diseases and the diagnosis is not always straight-forward. The aetiological and pathophysiological factors of primary AE are not completely clarified. There is a need for further investigation. Patients and Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients referred to an outpatient dermatology clinic in a tertiary care hospital for clinical assessment due to primary AE in the period from 1996 to 2014. Results: A total of 315 patients were identified with primary AE. The most frequent subtype was idiopathic AE (42.5%) and the second most common was angiotensin-converting enzymeinhibitor (ACEi)-induced AE (31.1%). Three patients were diagnosed with hereditary AE and one patient was diagnosed with acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency. At least 107 (34.0%) patients had established histaminergic AE. More than 1/3 of the patients were treated in an emergency room or hospitalized due to AE. A 98.1% of patients had experienced AE in the head and neck area. Seven patients were in the need of acute airway intervention. Six of these had ACEi-induced AE. Female sex and smoking were found to be risk factors for developing AE. Conclusion: The most frequent diagnoses were histaminergic-, non-histaminergic idiopathic AE and ACEi-induced AE, whereas complement C1-inhibitor deficiency was rare. Histaminergic AE made up a substantial group of patients with primary AE. Even though there are different pathophysiological causes of AE, many cases have overlapping clinical manifestations, which make diagnosis and treatment difficult.","Pall, Amalie Hartvig; Lomholt, Anne Fog; von Buchwald, Christian; Bygum, Anette; Rasmussen, Eva Rye",J Asthma Allergy,,261

METHODS: Three rabbits were immunized with lymphoid cells obtained from mesenteric lymphatic nodes of Wistar rats. Each one received subcutaneously 3x10(9) cells mixed with Freund's adjuvant. After 2 weeks, they were injected with the same amount of cells at weekly intervals for 4 additional times. In the 5th week they were bled and their serum were mixed. This serum, which had a cytotoxic titer of 1:1024, was used to immunize 2 goats that gave rise to the anti-antilymphocytic serum (AAS-1 and AAS-2). As control we immunized 1 additional goat with normal rabbit serum (ANS). The gel diffusion technique (AAS x rabbit serum) showed precipitation bands against till the following dilution: AAS-1 - 1/64, AAS-2 - 1/128 and ANS 1/124. Both AAS were able to block the in vitro lymphocytotoxity of goat antilymphocytic serum till dilution of 1:2 while ANS did not. The hearts from Wistar rats (donors) were transplanted in Holtzman rats. The transplanted rats were divide in groups: C1 - 11 animals (control that received no serum); C2 - 5 animals (control that received 1ml of goat normal serum); A- 19 animals - A1 with 5 rats injected intravenously in the day of surgery with 0.5ml of AAS-1, A2 with 7 rats injected with 1ml of AAS-1 only in the of surgery, and A3 with 7 rats that received 1ml of AAS-1 in days 0, 1 and 2 postoperatively; and group B with 19 rats (B1, B2 and B3) treated as group A except with the AAS-2 serum. RESULTS: Mean heart survival in groups C1 and C2 was respectively 11.9 and 14.6 days Survival range in the subgroups A1 and A2 were respectively 9 to 230 days and 23 to 230 days. In subgroup A3 heart survival was prolonged till 29 to 190 days in 5 animals. In group B only 3 animals had prolonged (120, 130 and 129 days) heart survival in comparison with the control groups. CONCLUSION: Anti-antilymphocytic serum against donor antigen is able to suppress rejection of cardiac allograft in rats.","Jorge Suaid, Haylton; Carlos Pereira Martins, Antonio; Tucci Jr, Silvio; Nina Rocha, Jeova; Antunes Rodrigues Júnior, Antonio; Antonio Gonçalves, Marco; José Cologna, Adauto",Acta cir. bras.,,261

The MMR is formulated by maximizing the interaction between the residual and functions of IVs that belong to a unit ball of reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This allows us to tackle the IV regression as an empirical risk minimization where the risk depends on the reproducing kernel on the instrument and can be estimated by a U-statistic or V-statistic. This simplification not only enables us to derive elegant theoretical analyses in both parametric and non-parametric settings, but also results in easy-to-use algorithms with a justified hyper-parameter selection procedure. We demonstrate the advantages of our framework over existing ones using experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.","Zhang, Rui; Imaizumi, Masaaki; Scholkopf, Bernhard; Muandet, Krikamol",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07684v1.pdf,261

288655,Determinants of survival after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Mexican outpatients and hospitalised patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Given the magnitude and speed of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, achieving timely and effective manual contact tracing has been a challenging task. Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated substantial enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, although surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases, and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation, or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French, and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal model, and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (n=25, 40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. Regarding the Montreal model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (n=24, 38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (n=2, 3%). As for the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, all the articles (n=63, 100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% (n=1) covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation. This may have contributed to the modest uptake of contact tracing apps worldwide. We make evidence-informed recommendations regarding data management, communication, stakeholder engagement, user experience, and implementation strategies for the successful and responsible development of contact tracing apps.","Osmanlliu, Esli; Rafie, Edmond; Bédard, Sylvain; Paquette, Jesseca; Gore, Genevieve; Pomey, Marie-Pascale",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,261
292842,Vitamin D in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients with non-invasive ventilation support,2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in many different policies being adopted across the world to reduce the spread of the virus. These policies include wearing surgical masks, hand hygiene practices, increased social distancing and full country-wide lockdown. Specifically, social distancing involves keeping a certain distance from others and avoiding gathering together in large groups. Automatic crowd density estimation is a technological solution that could help in guaranteeing social distancing by reducing the probability that two persons in a public area come in close proximity to each other while moving around. This paper proposes a novel low complexity RF sensing system for automatic people counting based on low cost UWB transceivers. The proposed system is based on an ordinary classifier that exploits features extracted from the channel impulse response of UWB communication signals. Specifically, features are extracted from the sorted list of singular values obtained from the singular value decomposition applied to the matrix of the channel impulse response vector differences. Experimental results achieved in two different environments show that the proposed system is a promising candidate for future automatic crowd density monitoring systems.","De Sanctis, Mauro; Conte, Aleandro; Rossi, Tommaso; Di Domenico, Simone; Cianca, Ernestina",Sensors (Basel),,261
298783,Sequential Analysis of Viral Load in a Neonate and Her Mother Infected With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,2020,"Resumo: Introdução: A pandemia do novo coronavírus trouxe consigo uma infodemia, ou seja, um excesso de informações, que, em populações com baixa análise crítica e falta de conhecimento técnico-científico, pode gerar e disseminar fake news. No Brasil, esses déficits são encontrados frequentemente nos idosos, que representam 13% da população, e na maior parte dos analfabetos absolutos e funcionais, o que os torna tanto vítimas quanto propagadores. Relato de Experiência: Foi realizada uma atividade multicêntrica baseada no projeto-piloto da Faculdade Evangélica Mackenzie do Paraná que promoveu educação em saúde para a população idosa por meio de redes sociais e comunicação on-line. Assim, os estudantes de Medicina ficaram disponíveis para esclarecer dúvidas e mitos relacionados à Covid-19 e enviar materiais informativos. Doze instituições de ensino superior da Região Sul do Brasil replicaram o projeto de 4 de julho a 6 de agosto de 2020, com o objetivo de combater às fake news e estimular a criação de canais de comunicação confiáveis com essa população. Discussão: A inclusão digital do idoso é algo recente, e a proporção daqueles que são usuários da internet vem crescendo no país. Entretanto, ainda há baixa interpretação crítica de informações, dificuldade de acompanhar o fluxo de notícias e pouca habilidade com ferramentas da internet. Nesse sentido, dar protagonismo a essa população digitalmente invisibilizada e permitir a ampliação do conhecimento médico geriátrico durante a pandemia, por meio do contato de acadêmicos com as demandas dos idosos, é uma forma efetiva de possibilitar um entendimento maior acerca das vulnerabilidades e necessidades do público geriátrico no que tange à educação em saúde. Conclusão: A construção do canal de comunicação entre acadêmicos e idosos apresentou uma possibilidade inovadora para a população idosa obter informação científica de forma acessível, de modo a conscientizá-la do novo coronavírus e da propagação de notícias falsas.","Yabrude, Angela Theresa Zuffo; Souza, Andressa Caroline Martins de; Campos, Catarine Wiggers de; Bohn, Loyse; Tiboni, Marcela",Rev. bras. educ. méd,,261

The aim of this systematic review is to summarize recommendations for sinus and anterior skull base surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Scopus and Embase were searched by two independent otolaryngologists from the Young Otolaryngologists of IFOS (YO-IFOS) for studies dealing with sinus and skull base surgery during COVID-19 pandemic. The review also included unpublished guidelines edited by Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery or Neurosurgery societies. Perioperative factors were investigated including surgical indications, preoperative testing of patients, practical management in operating rooms, technical aspects of surgery and postoperative management. The literature review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. The criteria for considering studies or guidelines for the review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, outcome, timing and setting (PICOTS) framework. RESULTS: 15 International publications met inclusion criteria. Five references were guidelines from national societies. All guidelines recommended postponing elective surgeries. An algorithm is proposed that classifies endonasal surgical procedures into three groups based on the risk of postponing surgery. Patients' COVID-19 status should be preoperatively assessed. Highest level of personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended, and the use of high-speed powered devices should be avoided. Face-to-face postoperative visits must be limited. CONCLUSIONS: Sinus and skull base surgeries are high-risk procedures due to potential aerosolization of SARS-CoV-2 virus. Protection of health care workers by decreasing exposure and optimizing the use of PPE is essential with sinus and anterior skull base surgery.","Radulesco, Thomas; Lechien, Jerome R; Sowerby, Leigh J; Saussez, Sven; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos; Sargi, Zoukaa; Lavigne, Philippe; Calvo-Henriquez, Christian; Lim, Chwee Ming; Tangjaturonrasme, Napadon; Vatanasapt, Patravoot; Dehgani-Mobaraki, Puya; Fakhry, Nicolas; Ayad, Tareck; Michel, Justin",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,261

Although some current therapeutic agents have showed potential prevention or treatment, a growing number of associated adverse events have occurred on patients with COVID-19 in the course of medical treatment. Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of the safety profile of therapeutic agents against COVID-19 is urgently needed. In this study, we proposed a network-based framework to identify the potential side effects of current COVID-19 drugs in clinical trials. We established the associations between 116 COVID-19 drugs and 30 kinds of human tissues based on network proximity and gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) approaches. Additionally, we focused on four types of drug-induced toxicities targeting four tissues, including hepatotoxicity, renal toxicity, lung toxicity, and neurotoxicity, and validated our network-based predictions by preclinical and clinical evidence available. Finally, we further performed pharmacovigilance analysis to validate several drug-tissue toxicities via data mining adverse event reporting data, and we identified several new drug-induced side effects without labeling in Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug instructions. Overall, this study provides forceful approaches to assess potential side effects on COVID-19 drugs, which will be helpful for their safe use in clinical practice and promoting the discovery of antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.","Wu, Qihui; Fan, Xiude; Hong, Honghai; Gu, Yong; Liu, Zhihong; Fang, Shuhuan; Wang, Qi; Cai, Chuipu; Fang, Jiansong",Food Chem Toxicol,,261

Methods: This paper summarizes the edited highlights of an online video meeting by Google meet on May 19, 2020, organized by the Korean Medicine Convergence Research Information Center. Five researchers specialized in immunology, microbiology, virology, preventive medicine, and herbology, respectively, presented what KM community should prepare for the future acute infectious disease outbreaks by learning from the previous research on antiviral effect of herbs for coronavirus and the experiences of the present COVID-19 pandemic. Results: There are a lot of herbs or natural products with potential anti-coronavirus effects reported from in vitro experiments and despite criticism, many clinical trials on traditional herbal medicine for COVID-19 are being conducted. In addition to establishing research evidence, KM community should train and produce public health professionals among Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs) and official participation in public healthcare system should be ensured in terms of regulation and policy. Newly developed KM treatments can be interpreted by the KM theories and also should be allowed by regulations for KMDs to utilize them. Conclusion: The present online discussion suggested directions of basic research for acute viral infections diseases utilizing KM and how to enforce relevant education and regulations in the post-COVID-19 era.","Park, Sunju; Hahm, Dae-Hyun; Joo, Myungsoo; Kim, Kyongmin; Kwon, Sunoh; Choi, Hoyoung; Lee, Hyangsook",Integr Med Res,,261

309650,"What Does Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Mean for Global Pneumonia Prevention, Diagnosis, and Treatment?",2020,"OBJECTIVE: The dramatic spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections calls for reliable, inexpensive tools to quickly identify patients with a poor prognosis. In this study, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was assessed within 72 h after admission of each of 153 consecutive, SARS-CoV-2 infected, adult patients to either of two hospitals in Tenerife, Spain, using suitable routine laboratory tests for lymphocyte counts, as well as ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and C-reactive protein levels. Results were correlated with the patients' respiratory function, defined through their pulse oximetric saturation/fraction of inspired oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) ratio. RESULTS: Within 72 h from admission, criteria matched ARDS (SpO2/FiO2 < 235) in 13.1% of cases. We found a significant, negative correlation between SpO2/FiO2 ratios and D-dimer, ferritin, and LDH levels (- 0.31, - 0.32, and - 0.41; p = 0.004, 0.004, and < 0.0001, respectively). In patients with ARDS, the mean LDH was 373 U/L (CI95%: 300.6-445.3), but only 298 U/L (CI95%: 274.7-323.1) when they did not develop the syndrome (p = 0.015). None of the additionally evaluated biomarkers correlated with the SpO2/FiO2 ratios. Serum LDH levels in patients hospitalised for COVID-19 correlate with ARDS, as defined by their SpO2/FiO2 ratio, and might help to predict said complication.","Figueira Gonçalves, Juan Marco; Hernández Pérez, José María; Acosta Sorensen, Marco; Wangüemert Pérez, Aurelio Luis; Martín Ruiz de la Rosa, Elena; Trujillo Castilla, José Luis; Díaz Pérez, David; Ramallo-Fariña, Yolanda",BMC Res Notes,,261
310065,"Risk Factors for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in Hospital Workers: Results From a Screening Study in New Jersey, United States in Spring 2020",2020,"The epicenter of the original outbreak in China has high male smoking rates of around 50%, and early reported death rates have an emphasis on older males, therefore the likelihood of smokers being overrepresented in fatalities is high. In Iran, China, Italy, and South Korea, female smoking rates are much lower than males. Fewer females have contracted the virus. If this analysis is correct, then Indonesia would be expected to begin experiencing high rates of Covid-19 because its male smoking rate is over 60% (Tobacco Atlas). Smokers are vulnerable to respiratory viruses. Smoking can upregulate angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, the known receptor for both the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the human respiratory coronavirus NL638. This could also be true for new electronic smoking devices such as electronic cigarettes and ""heat-not-burn"" IQOS devices. ACE2 could be a novel adhesion molecule for SARS-CoV-2 causing Covid-19 and a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of fatal microbial infections, and therefore it should be fast tracked and prioritized for research and investigation. Data on smoking status should be collected on all identified cases of Covid-19.","Brake, Samuel James; Barnsley, Kathryn; Lu, Wenying; McAlinden, Kielan Darcy; Eapen, Mathew Suji; Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh",,,261

We studied their preparedness and delivery of palliative care during COVID-19 as part of a mixed-method study. We present the results of an online questionnaire. METHODS: All FBOs providing palliative care in India were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Response rate was 46/64 (72%); 44 provided palliative care; 30/44 (68%) were in rural or semiurban areas with 10-2700 beds. Fifty-two per cent (23/44) had dedicated palliative care teams and 30/44 (68%) provided it as part of general services; 17/44 (39%) provided both. 29/44 (66%) provided palliative care for cancer patients; 17/44 (34%) reported that this was more than half their workload.The pandemic led to reduced clinical work: hospital 36/44 (82%) and community 40/44 (91%); with reduction in hospital income for 41/44 (93%). 18/44 (44%) were designated government COVID-19 centres; 11/40 (32%) had admitted between 1 and 2230 COVID-19 patients.COVID-19 brought challenges: 14/44 (32%) lacked personal protective equipment; 21/44 (48%) had reduced hospital supplies and 19/44 (43%) lacked key medications including morphine. 29/44 (66%) reported reduction in palliative care work; 7/44 (16%) had stopped altogether. Twenty-three per cent (10/44) reported redeployment of palliative care teams to other work. For those providing, palliative care 32/37 (86%) was principally for non-COVID patients; 13/37 (35%) cared for COVID-19 patients. Service adaptations included: teleconsultation, triaged home visits, medication delivery at home and food supply.

Os males éticos e religiosos, compreendidos como transgressio e pecado, estio relacionados a uma atitude ativa, a um fazer. O sofrimento inocente, ao contrario, deve ser pensado a partir da perspectiva da vítima. Como justificar a dor de inocentes vítimas de catástrofes, de doenças incuráveis, de violencia? É possível, por exemplo, conferir sentido a experiencia do sofrimento de famílias que perdem a luta contra o COVID-19? Se Deus é justo por que ele permite que os inocentes sofram? Com o objetivo de pensar a respeito destas questoes dividirei este texto em duas partes. Na primeira, apresentarei como Paul Ricoeur compreende o problema do mal a partir de tres dimensoes: a ética da transgressio, a religiosa do pecado e a dimensio do sofrimento inocente. Na segunda, mostrarei de que modo Ricoeur pensa o sofrimento como desafio. Para Ricoeur, como veremos, a dialética tradicional nao é capaz de conferir significado ao sofrimento inocente.

Ethic and religious expressions of evil, understood as transgression and sin, are related to an active attitude, to an act of making. Innocent suffering, on the contrary, should be considered from the perspective of the victim. How to justify the pain of innocent victims of catastrophes, incurable diseases, violence? Is it possible, for example, to confer sense of the experience of the suffering of families that lose the fight against COVID-19? If God is fair, how could he allow the suffering of innocent people? The first part of the text will present how Paul Ricoeur understands the problem of evil from three main dimensions: the ethic dimension of transgression, the religious dimension of sin, and the dimension of innocent suffering. The second part will discuss the way Ricoeur regards suffering as challenge. According to Ricoeur, traditional dialectics is not able to provide meaning to innocent suffering. The problem of evil demands a convergence between thought and action, as well as the spiritual transformation of feelings. That transformation, which should lead to a disinterested love of God, assumes a specific understanding of the relation between love and justice.","de Oliveira, Cláudia Maria Rocha",Horizonte,,261

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the level of anxiety and depression of healthcare students living in Jordan, and the effect on their learning process during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey completed by students studying a healthcare-oriented degree in a university in Jordan. Participants were recruited through social media (Facebook and WhatsApp). The validated previously published Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire was used as a part of the online survey to assess students' anxiety/depression scores. Students' responses regarding their learning process during the COVID-19 was also assessed. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 21.62 (SD = 4.90), with the majority being females (67.1%). The HADs' assessment revealed that 43.8% and 40.0% of participants had normal anxiety and depression scores, while 22.4% showed borderline abnormal anxiety/depression scores (33.8%). Many students (33.8%) were classified to have abnormal anxiety scores, while a smaller proportion (26.2%) was classified to have abnormal depression scores. Smoking (p = 0.022), lower family income (p = 0.039), and use of medications (p = 0.032) were positively associated with higher (worse) anxiety scores. Ranking the learning process during COVID-19 showed that 45.8% of the participants believed it was a 'good/very good/excellent' process. CONCLUSIONS: Anxiety and depression levels amongst university healthcare students in Jordan were found to be high when assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the learning process during the pandemic was not accepted by more than half of the students. Implementing psychological interventions for healthcare students during pandemics is strongly recommended in order to optimize students' mental health and their learning process alike.","Basheti, Iman A; Mhaidat, Qassim N; Mhaidat, Hala N",PLoS One,,261

320013,Systematic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Screening at Hospital Admission in Children: A French Prospective Multicenter Study,2021,"COVID-ADAPT is a stochastic, discrete-space, agent-based simulation model of airborne infection and public health interventions, capable of modeling SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Using a map of a real university dormitory floor, the model simulates agents moving about and potentially infecting each other. Health interventions tested are vaccination and masking, including whether the solitary initial infectious agent was masked. Universal masking with N95 masks and 100% vaccination of susceptible people resulted in significantly lower prevalence after 3 weeks compared to all other scenarios, but still led to a substantial number of infections. Increased vaccination levels from 52% to 100% by itself did not result in a significant difference in prevalence due to symptomatic and asymptomatic breakthrough infections. These results suggest that vaccination alone is insufficient to stem outbreaks, and the best way to reduce COVID-19 infections is to ensure that all infectious people are masked. However, because asymptomatic infections are common, the only way to ensure this is universal masking, which also reduces prevalence by protecting susceptible individuals from infection. Universal masking is the best way forward, especially under threat of the Delta variant, to keep facilities open and safe for occupants, while minimizing the number of infections.","McPeck, Roxanne; Magori, Krisztian",,,261
320972,Clinical Experience with Use of Remdesivir in the Treatment of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: a Case Series,2020,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has immensely strained healthcare systems worldwide. Diabetes has emerged as a major comorbidity in a large proportion of patients infected with COVID-19 and is associated with poor health outcomes. We aim to provide a practical guidance on screening of hyperglycemia in persons without known diabetes in low resource settings. METHODS: We reviewed the available guidelines on this subject and proposed an algorithm based on simple measures of blood glucose (BG) which can be implemented by healthcare workers with lesser expertise in low resource settings. RESULTS: We propose that every hospitalized patient with COVID-19 infection undergo a paired capillary BG assessment (pre-meal and 2-h post-meal). Patients with pre-meal BG < 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL) and post-meal BG < 10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) may not merit further monitoring. On the other hand, those with one or more value above these thresholds should undergo capillary BG monitoring (pre-meals and 2 hours after dinner) for the next 24 hours. When two or more (&#8805;50%) such values are significantly elevated [pre-meal &#8805;8.3 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) and post-meal &#8805;11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL)], pharmacotherapy should be immediately initiated. On the other hand, in patients with modest elevation of one or more values [pre-meal 7.8-8.3 mmol/L (140-150 mg/dL) and post-meal 10.0-11.1 mmol/L (180-200 mg/dL)], dietary modifications should be initiated and pharmacotherapy considered only if BG control remains suboptimal. CONCLUSION: We highlight strategies for screening of hyperglycemia in persons without known diabetes treated for COVID-19 infection in low resource settings. This guidance may well be applied to other settings in the near future.","Goyal, Alpesh; Gupta, Setu; Gupta, Yashdeep; Tandon, Nikhil",Diabetes Metab Syndr,,261
322697,Susceptibility of the Iranian population to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection based on variants of angiotensin I converting enzyme 2,2020,"Amid the rapidly evolving global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that has already had profound effects on public health and medical infrastructure globally, many questions remain about its impact on child health. The unique needs of neonates and children, and their role in the spread of the virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) should be included in preparedness and response plans. Fetuses and newborn infants may be uniquely vulnerable to the damaging consequences of congenitally- or perinatally-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection, but data are limited about outcomes of COVID-19 disease during pregnancy. Therefore, information on illnesses associated with other highly pathogenic coronaviruses (i.e., severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS]), as well as comparisons to common congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), are warranted. Research regarding the potential routes of acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the prenatal and perinatal setting is of a high public health priority. Vaccines targeting women of reproductive age, and in particular pregnant patients, should be evaluated in clinical trials and should include the endpoints of neonatal infection and disease.","Muldoon, Kathleen M; Fowler, Karen B; Pesch, Megan H; Schleiss, Mark R",J Clin Virol,,261

Age is a major predictor of adverse outcome following ACS. COVID-19 infection seems to escalate the risk in older patients with heart disease. Increasing odds of in-hospital death is associated with older age following COVID-19 infection. Importantly, it seems older patients with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), in particular IHD, diabetes and hypertension, are at the highest risk of mortality following COVID-19 infection. The evidence is sparse on the optimal care of older patients with ACS with lack of robust randomised controlled trials. In this setting, with the serious threat imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of rapidly evolving knowledge with much unknown, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment strategies offered to older patients. In cases where risks outweigh the benefits, it might not be an unreasonable option to treat such patients with a conservative or a palliative approach. Further evidence to elucidate whether invasive management is beneficial in older patients with ACS is required out-with the COVID-19 pandemic. Though it is hoped that the actual acute phase of COVID-19 infection will be short lived, it is vital that important clinical research is continued, given the long-term benefits of ongoing clinical research for patients with long-term conditions, including CVD. This review aimed to evaluate the challenges and the management strategies in the care of older patients presenting with ACS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rowland, Ben; Kunadian, Vijay",Heart,,261

This may lead to confusion and delays in the enablement of multicentre research projects. This study explores the effect of differing processes for Ethics and Governance in the establishment of the CovidSurg-Cancer study during the global COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An anonymous, structured web-based questionnaire was designed using the Research Electronic Data Capture application (REDCap) platform to capture consultant surgeons, fellows, and trainees experience in the ethics application process. 'CovidSurg-Cancer' was an international multicentre collaborative study to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the outcomes of patients undergoing cancer surgery. The ethics process to set up this observational study was used as to explore the differing processes applied across Australia. RESULTS: The CovidSurg-Cancer study was successfully set up in 14 hospitals. Four hospitals approved the study directly as an audit. Of the remaining sites, 10 ethics applications underwent Human Research Ethics Committee review following which two (14%) were subsequently approved as an audit activity and eight hospitals (57%) were given formal ethical approval with waiver of consent. Ethics application acceptance from another Australian Human Research Ethics Committee was provided with six applications; however, only three were reciprocated without the requirement for further agreements. A third of (30%) respondents suggested that the details of the application pathway, process and documentation were unclear. CONCLUSION: Ethics processes are varied across Australia with considerable repetition. A centralized, harmonized application process would enhance collaborative research.","Dudi-Venkata, Nagendra N; Cox, Daniel R A; Marson, Nicholas; Tan, Lorwai; Pockney, Peter; Muralidharan, Vijayaragavan; Watson, David I; Richards, Toby",ANZ j.

However, the year 2020 experienced a global pandemic due to COVID-19. This COVID-19 created an adverse impact on human life, economic, environment, and energy and transport sector compared to the pre-COVID-19 scenario. These above-mentioned sectors are interrelated and thus lockdown strategy and stay at home rules to reduce the COVID-19 transmission had a drastic effect on them. With lockdown, all industry and transport sectors were closed, energy demand reduced greatly but the time shift of energy demand had a critical impact on grid and energy generation. Decreased energy demand caused a silver lining with an improved environment. However, drowned economy creating a negative impact on the human mind and financial condition, which at times led to life-ending decisions. Transport sector which faced a financial dip last year trying to coming out from the losses which are not feasible without government aid and a new customer-friendly policy. Sustainable transport and the electric vehicle should take high gear. While people are staying at home or using work from home scheme, building indoor environment must specially be taken care of as a compromised indoor environment affects and increases the risk of many diseases. Also, the energy-efficient building will play a key role to abate the enhanced building energy demand and more generation from renewable sources should be in priority. It is still too early to predict any forecast about the regain period of all those sectors but with vaccination now being introduced and implemented but still, it can be considered as an ongoing process as its final results are yet to be seen. As of now, COVID-19 still continue to grow in certain areas causing anxiety and destruction. With all these causes, effects, and restoration plans, still SDGs will be suffered in great order to attain their target by 2030 and collaborative support from all countries can only help in this time.","Nundy, Srijita Ghosh Aritra Mesloub Abdelhakim Albaqawy Ghazy Abdullah Alnaim Mohammed Mashary",Journal of Cleaner Production,,261

This situation urges the identification of underlying risks and preferably biomarkers for evidence-based, more effective healthcare. Towards this goal, current literature review and network analysis synthesize available information on the AD-related gene APOE into four lines of mechanistic evidence. At a cellular level, the risk isoform APOE4 confers high infectivity by the underlying coronavirus SARS-CoV-2; at a genetic level, APOE4 is associated with severe COVID-19; at a pathway level, networking connects APOE with COVID-19 risk factors such as ACE2, TMPRSS2, NRP1, and LZTFL1; at a behavioral level, APOE4-associated dementia may increase the exposure to coronavirus infection which causes COVID-19. Thus, APOE4 could exert multiple actions for high infection and mortality rates of the patients, or generally, with COVID-19.","Xiong, Nian; Schiller, Martin R; Li, Jingwen; Chen, Xiaowu; Lin, Zhicheng",Alzheimers Res Ther,,261

It enables the identification of the key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by Ferguson and collaborators, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the initial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of infected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a `retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the effectiveness of the control policies adopted. The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as `social/physical distancing' and population density reduction by strict quarantining are essential for making k-star greater than 1, necessary for suppressing the pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to determine the the key parameters of the model. Possible extensions to the basic model to make it more realistic are indicated.","Thyagaraja, Anantanarayanan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12781v1.pdf,261
343975,Validation of a small-size pooling approach targeting hospital surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection,2020,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has become a global health emergency. Although many scientific advances have been achieved over the last few months, the knowledge about how the etiologic agent SARS-CoV-2 interacts with the host's immune system, regulating the pathogenesis and the outcome of the disease, is not yet fully understood. Objective: This is a narrative literature review to discuss the available evidence on modes of transmission and the main immunopathological mechanisms involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Material and method: A search in the indexed journals was carried out in the PubMed/MEDLINE database, during the period from January to May 2020. The following descriptors were used in the research: Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2, transmission, immunity, immunopathogenesis, and pathogenesis. Results and discussion: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurs through contact with airway secretions from a symptomatic patient. However, scientific evidence encourages transmission by asymptomatic and/or oligosymptomatic patients. Immunopathological studies suggest that the hypercytokinaemia promotes lung tissue damage and, subsequently, organ and system involvement, leading to decompensation, organ dysfunction and death. Regarding the humoral response, the high titers of B lymphocytes and antibodies, traditionally, correlated with the protection of the host, may be associated with the severity of the disease by SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: The host's immune response is determinant in the pathogenesis of Covid-19. However, further in vivo and/or in vitro studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 and, thus, assist in the development of a vaccine and/or therapeutic target.","Brito, Sávio Breno P.; Braga, Isaque O.; Moraes, Marília M.; Cunha, Carolina C.; Leão, Sydney C.; Takenami, Iukary",J.

We sought to evaluate the patient's experiences of performing remote respiratory assessments to guide future development and optimisation of the service. Twenty-five patients completed surveys. The mean age was 65.2 years and average time from diagnosis was 17.04 (2-99) months. Seventy-two percent (n = 18) required help from a caregiver to perform the tests. Ninety-two percent (n = 23) of patients reported that overall, they were satisfied and were happy to continue with remote respiratory assessment. Reducing the number of clinic visits for review and assessment was valued by 92% (n = 23) and reducing the risk associated with COVID-19 was valued by 96% (n = 24). The highest frequency reported as acceptable for performing the remote breathing assessments was monthly (60%, n = 15), followed by every second month (28%, n = 7). Remote respiratory testing is viewed positively by patients. These technologies used in combination with video-consultations and other novel forms of remote monitoring implemented in response to the COVID-19 crisis will continue to be valuable tools for clinical care in future.

353374,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection and Ischemic Stroke,2020,"The actual role of SARS-CoV-2 in brain damage remains controversial due to lack of matched controls. We aim to highlight to what extent is neuropathology determined by SARS-CoV-2 or by pre-existing conditions. Findings of 9 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and 6 matched non-COVID controls (mean age 79 y/o) were compared. Brains were analyzed through immunohistochemistry to detect SARS-CoV-2, lymphocytes, astrocytes, endothelium, and microglia. A semi-quantitative scoring was applied to grade microglial activation. Thal-Braak stages and the presence of small vessel disease were determined in all cases. COVID-19 cases had a relatively short clinical course (0-32 days; mean: 10 days), and did not undergo mechanical ventilation. Five patients with neurocognitive disorder had delirium. All COVID-19 cases showed non-SARS-CoV-2-specific changes including hypoxic-agonal alterations, and a variable degree of neurodegeneration and/or pre-existent SVD. The neuroinflammatory picture was dominated by ameboid CD68 positive microglia, while only scant lymphocytic presence and very few traces of SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Microglial activation in the brainstem was significantly greater in COVID-19 cases (p = 0.046). Instead, microglial hyperactivation in the frontal cortex and hippocampus was clearly associated to AD pathology (p = 0.001), regardless of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. In COVID-19 cases complicated by delirium (all with neurocognitive disorders), there was a significant enhancement of microglia in the hippocampus (p = 0.048). Although higher in cases with both Alzheimer's pathology and COVID-19, cortical neuroinflammation is not related to COVID-19 per se but mostly to pre-existing neurodegeneration. COVID-19 brains seem to manifest a boosting of innate immunity with microglial reinforcement, and adaptive immunity suppression with low number of brain lymphocytes probably related to systemic lymphopenia.

In general, the female immune system responds more efficiently to pathogens. However, this can lead to over-reactive immune responses, which may explain the higher presence of autoimmune diseases in women, but also potentially the more adverse effects of vaccination in females compared with in males. Many clinical and epidemiological studies reported, for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, a gender-biased differential response;however, the majority of reports dealt with a comparable morbidity, with males, however, showing higher COVID-19 adverse outcomes. Although gender differences in immune responses have been studied predominantly within the context of sex hormone effects, some other mechanisms have been invoked: cellular mosaicism, skewed X chromosome inactivation, genes escaping X chromosome inactivation, and miRNAs encoded on the X chromosome. The hormonal hypothesis as well as other mechanisms will be examined and discussed in the light of the most recent epigenetic findings in the field, as the concept that epigenetics is the unifying mechanism in explaining gender-specific differences is increasingly emerging.","Migliore, Lucia Nicolì Vanessa Stoccoro Andrea",Biomedicines,,261

DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Nembro, in the Bergamo province of Lombardy, northern Italy. POPULATION: Residents of Nembro. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Monthly all cause mortality between January 2012 and April 2020 (data to 11 April), number of confirmed deaths from covid-19 to 11 April 2020, and weekly absolute number of deaths between 1 January and 4 April across recent years by age group and sex. RESULTS: Nembro had 11 505 residents as of 1 January 2020. Monthly all cause mortality between January 2012 and February 2020 fluctuated around 10 per 1000 person years, with a maximum of 21.5 per 1000 person years. In March 2020, monthly all cause mortality reached a peak of 154.4 per 1000 person years. For the first 11 days in April, this rate decreased to 23.0 per 1000 person years. The observed increase in mortality was driven by the number of deaths among older people (&#8805;65 years), especially men. From the outbreak onset until 11 April 2020, only 85 confirmed deaths from covid-19 in Nembro were recorded, corresponding to about half of the 166 deaths from all causes observed in that period. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings show how covid-19 can have a considerable impact on the health of a small community. Furthermore, the results suggest that the full implications of the covid-19 pandemic can only be completely understood if, in addition to confirmed deaths related to covid-19, consideration is also given to all cause mortality in a given region and time frame.","Piccininni, Marco; Rohmann, Jessica L; Foresti, Luca; Lurani, Caterina; Kurth, Tobias",BMJ,,261

367519,"Assessment of Respiratory Bacterial Coinfections Among Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2-Positive Patients Hospitalized in Intensive Care Units Using Conventional Culture and BioFire, FilmArray Pneumonia Panel Plus Assay",2020,"This study demonstrates that an adoption of a segmenting and shielding strategy could increase the scope to partially exit COVID-19 lockdown while limiting the risk of an overwhelming second wave of infection. We illustrate this using a mathematical model that segments the vulnerable population and their closest contacts, the 'shielders'. Effects of extending the duration of lockdown and faster or slower transition to post-lockdown conditions and, most importantly, the trade-off between increased protection of the vulnerable segment and fewer restrictions on the general population are explored. Our study shows that the most important determinants of outcome are: (i) post-lockdown transmission rates within the general and between the general and vulnerable segments; (ii) fractions of the population in the vulnerable and shielder segments; (iii) adherence to protective measures; and (iv) build-up of population immunity. Additionally, we found that effective measures in the shielder segment, e.g. intensive routine screening, allow further relaxations in the general population. We find that the outcome of any future policy is strongly influenced by the contact matrix between segments and the relationships between physical distancing measures and transmission rates. This strategy has potential applications for any infectious disease for which there are defined proportions of the population who cannot be treated or who are at risk of severe outcomes.

The aim of this literature review is to summarize key findings related to ABO blood types and COVID-19 infection rate, symptom presentation, and outcome. Summarized findings include associations between ABO blood type and higher infection susceptibility, intubation duration, and severe outcomes, including death. The literature suggests that blood type O may serve as a protective factor, as individuals with blood type O are found COVID-19 positive at far lower rates. This could suggest that blood type O individuals are less susceptible to infection, or that they are asymptomatic at higher rates and therefore do not seek out testing. We also discuss genetic associations and potential molecular mechanisms that drive the relationship between blood type and COVID-19. Studies have found a strong association between a locus on a specific gene cluster on chromosome three (chr3p21.31) and outcome severity, such as respiratory failure. Cellular models have suggested an explanation for blood type modulation of infection, evidencing that spike protein/Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-dependent adhesion to ACE2-expressing cell lines was specifically inhibited by monoclonal or natural human anti-A antibodies, so individuals with non-A blood types, specifically O, or B blood types, which produce anti-A antibodies, may be less susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection due to the inhibitory effects of anti-A antibodies.","Zhang, Yujia; Garner, Rachael; Salehi, Sana; La Rocca, Marianna; Duncan, Dominique",Ann Hematol,,261

This study aims to identify the topics regarding Coronavirus that people learned about on YouTube. The videos about Coronavirus were also evaluated in terms of the reliability of their source of information. METHODS: In total, 160 videos on Coronavirus that had 500,000 or more views were analysed. The latent Dirichlet allocation method was used in the process of identifying the topics that were then compared in terms of video parameters. The reliability of the source of information provided by videos was assessed with a modified DISCERN tool. RESULTS: A proportion of 15.6 % of these videos had a scientific content, while 45 % of these videos were about the process entailed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In terms of video reliability, the difference between video types was found to be significant; videos with scientific content had more reliable sources of information (p<0.001).

with data from the same period in 2018–19 Patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were not included in study Our analysis of patients admitted during the study (lockdown) period revealed 69% reduction in AHF hospitalizations as compared to the control period (241 vs 782) and 60% reduction compared to same calendar period from the previous year (144 vs 602;Figure 1) It was contrary to an expected increase due to the availability issue of guideline-directed medical therapy in follow-up patients and an anticipated surge in AHF due to late presentation of patients with acute myocardial infarction associated mechanical complications Among the patients from the lockdown period, 96 7% presented with NYHA IV symptoms, this was significantly higher than the rate during the control period (out of 782;76 6% presented with NYHA IV symptoms during the control period;p value &lt;0 001;Table 1) The mean age (±SD) of patients in study and control period was 63 5(±11 2) and 61 1(±11 9) respectively, with no significant difference Compared with control group, study group patients were more commonly male (82 6 vs 71 6%;p value &lt;0 02), more likely to have atria fibrillation (23 7 vs 18 2%;p value &lt;0 02), lower eGFR (64 6 vs 77 7%;p value &lt;0 05), lower mean ejection fraction (24 2 ± 5 6 vs 30 4 ± 4 9%;p value &lt;0 001) and higher NT pro BNP levels (mean value 7349 2 vs 5680 4 pg/ml;p value &lt;0 001) Median length of stay during study and control period was 5 and 4 days respectively We also observed significantly increased in-hospital mortality during the lockdown period as compared to the control period (8 3% vs 5 4%;p value &lt;0 001) The number of patients presenting to ED with AHF in western India has reduced significantly, and yet, late presentations with advanced symptoms and low EF seem to have increased Similar pattern of decreased admission for cardiovascular emergency was reported from California, where weekly rates of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction decreased by up to 48% during the Covid-19 period (Solomon et al , n d [3]) The current case fatality rate for COVID-19 in India is approximately 2 6% [4], which is far less than that of AHF and we presume that many untreated AHF patients must have died at home during COVID-19 pandemic There have been reports of the inexplicable increase in out of hospital cardiac arrests, revealing that patients were staying too long at home to seek care for a more severe medical condition (Wong et al , 2020 [5]) Complete suspension of public transit system along with lack of emergency medical services in India, risk of acquiring COVID-19 at ED and misleading information in media and social platforms about flooding of hospital beds due to COVID-19, even when there were reserved wards for other emergencies, led to hospital avoiding behavior among patients suffering from even the most serious medical conditions Hospitals are now erroneously perceived as reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2 Community educational campaigns are imperative to convey that hospitals are secured, resourceful, and fully prepared for life-threatening emergencies;which if untreated, has higher morbidity and mortality rate as compared to COVID-19","Choudhary, Rahul; Sharma, Jai Bharat; Deora, Surender; Kaushik, Atul; Sanghvi, Sanjeev; Mathur, Rohit",The American Journal of

With the aging population and seemingly increasing outbreak of communicable diseases, it is expected that there will be a continued demand for inpatient/critical care providers. The current COVID-19 pandemic provides a glimpse of a health care system in severe provider shortage. Adult-gerontology acute nurse practitioners (GACNPs) can play a vital part in relieving that shortage. But with the increased role, there is an increased responsibility and need for expansion of AGACNP skill set. This includes the training and utilization of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). The case reports and data available from countries that have already combated COVID-19 outbreak show POCUS can play a key part in managing critically ill patients on isolation precautions.

391247,Modeling Donor Screening Strategies to Reduce the Risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Transmission via Fecal Microbiota Transplantation,2020,"BACKGROUND: Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital contact tracing apps have become prevalent worldwide in a coordinated effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. However, their uptake has been low and slow due to privacy concerns, the lack of trust and motivational affordances, and their minimalist design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article is to present a protocol for a systematic review of the main factors, including facilitators and barriers, that influence the adoption of contact tracing apps. METHODS: We searched seven databases, namely, Scopus, CINAHL, PubMed (MEDLINE), IEEE Xplore Digital Library, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, for relevant publications between October 30, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Three authors were involved in removing duplicates, screening, and selection of relevant articles according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols) guidelines. RESULTS: Altogether, we retrieved 777 articles from the seven databases. As of May 14, 2021, we have completed the screening process and arrived at 13 eligible articles to be included in the systematic review. We hope to elicit, summarize, and report the main findings in the systematic review article by the end of August 2021. We expect to uncover facilitators and barriers related to app utility, data security, ease of use, and persuasive design that are deemed important to adoption of contact tracing apps. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the systematic review will help researchers to uncover the gaps in the adoption of contact tracing apps, and decision makers and designers to focus on the principal adoption factors necessary to create better and more effective contact tracing apps.

To enhance knowledge and awareness of COVID-19, considerable online resources have been made available, including aspects related to the dental profession. The study aim was to examine the knowledge, perception, and attitude of dental professionals in Indonesia toward COVID-19. We conducted a survey via a questionnaire created using Google docs and distributed to 632 members of the Indonesian Dental Association in the context of a webinar hosted by the Indonesian Oral Biology Association on first June, 2020. Materials and Methods: The questionnaire consisted of 17 items pertaining to demographic data, knowledge and virus identification, awareness regarding drugs commonly used in dentistry during pandemic and research opportunities. Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire after the webinar by choosing one answer to each question. For the analysis, participants were divided into three groups according to their professional background i.e., employment at national hospital, private hospital, or academic faculty. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and expressed as frequencies and percentages. The chi-square test was used to investigate the association between professional activity and the level of knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes about COVID-19. Results: Sixty percent of the participants correctly identified the pathogenesis of the disease. This knowledge was not associated with their professional affiliation (p = 0.95). Sixty-seven percentage had comprehensive knowledge about virus detection methods. This knowledge was not associated with their affiliation either (p = 0.54). Questions regarding drugs of choice, prevention, and the spread of COVID-19 were correctly answered by 89, 96, and 82% of the participants, respectively. Knowledge of these aspects were significantly associated with the professional affiliation (p < 0.05). All respondents were optimistic regarding research opportunities (p < 0.01). Respondents from academics were more interested in joining COVID-19-related research projects with governmental institutions (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 among Indonesian dentists are reasonably good. However, further improvement would be beneficial to manage patients during this pandemic. As the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise in Indonesia, it is important that dentists keep abreast of the updated knowledge on this moving field. Dentist knowledge on infection control should be strengthened through continuous educational programs.","Widyarman, Armelia Sari; Bachtiar, Endang W; Theodorea, Citra Fragrantia; Rizal, M Ihsan; Roeslan, M Orliando; Djamil, Melanie S; Santosa, Didi N; Bachtiar, Boy M",Front Med (Lausanne),,261

In this work, a 23 full experimental design was performed and the response surface method (RSM) was used to indicate the optimum parameter of caffeine adsorption on Elaeis guineensis endocarp activated carbon, since the endocarp is the main by-product from dendê oil production. It was set the adsorbent point of zero charge (pHpzc), and the material was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The RSM results indicate removal efficiency (%) at the optimal conditions, 0.20 g of adsorbent, and caffeine initial concentration of 20 mg/L, and acidic medium was about 95%. Based on ANOVA and F test (Fcalculated > Fstandard), the mathematical/statistical model obtained fits well to the experimental data. The overall kinetic studies showed time was achieved after 5 h and caffeine adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order model suggesting chemisorption is a predominant mechanism. Redlich-Peterson and Sips models best represented the experimental data (0.967 < R2 < 0.993). Thermodynamic revealed that caffeine adsorption was spontaneous at all temperatures studied, exothermic, and probably with changes in the adsorbate-adsorbent complex during the process. The tests conducted in different water matrixes corroborate the suitability of this adsorbent to be used in caffeine removal even in a complex solution.","Melo, Larissa L A; Ide, Alessandra H; Duarte, José Leandro S; Zanta, Carmem Lucia P S; Oliveira, Leonardo M T M; Pimentel, Wagner R O; Meili, Lucas",,,261

Extensive research has been conducted on drugs that are already available and new treatments are also under development. Within this context, therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been the subject of widespread investigation focusing on two target-based groups, i.e., non-SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs, that target immune system responses, and SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs, designed to neutralize the virus protein structure. Here we review the latest literature about the use of mAbs in order to describe the state of the art of the clinical trials and the benefits of using these biotherapeutics in the treatment of COVID-19. The clinical trials considered in the present review include both observational and randomized studies. We begin by presenting the studies conducted using non-SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs for treating different immune disorders that were already on the market. Within this group of mAbs, we focus particularly on anti-IL-6/IL-6R. This is followed by a discussion of the studies on SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs. Our findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 specific mAbs are significantly more effective than non-specific ones.","Torrente-López, Anabel Hermosilla Jesús Navas Natalia Cuadros-Rodríguez Luis Cabeza José Salmerón-García Antonio",Vaccines,,261

The aim of this study was to compare the RT-PCR results obtain with the MDx Platform and the commercial assay cobas SARS-CoV-2 (Roche) on nasopharyngeal swab and other clinical specimens including sputum, bronchial aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage and anal swabs. METHODS: Samples received in our laboratory from patients suspected of COVID-19 (n = 262) were tested in parallel with our MDx platform SARS-CoV-2 PCR and with the cobas SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: The overall agreement between the two tests for all samples tested was 99.24% (260/262), which corresponded to agreements of 100% (178/178) on nasopharyngeal swabs, 95.45% (42/44) on lower respiratory tract specimen with discordant resultS obtained for very high cycle threshold (Ct) value and 100% (40/40) on anorectal swabs. The Ct values for nasopharyngeal swabs displayed an excellent correlation (R2 > 96%) between both tests.

413886,Serum Responses of Children With Kawasaki Disease Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Proteins,2020,"Acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also called COVID-19, is one of the most contagious viruses resulting in a progressive pandemic. Since specific antiviral treatments have not been developed yet and its fatal rate is almost high, early and fast detection is critical for controlling the outbreak. In this study, a piezoelectric microcantilever biosensor has been designed for detecting COVID-19 samples directly without requiring preparation steps. The biosensor acts as a transducer and is coated with the related antibody. When the SARS-CoV-2 antigens adsorbed on the microcantilever top surface through their spike proteins, a surface stress due to the mass change would be prompted leading to the measurable tip deflection and floating voltage. To obtain a biosensor with optimum parameters, different shapes and piezoelectric materials have been assessed and it was concluded that a Poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) biosensor in a shape of a holed punched form triangle, represented the best result. Therefore, the highly sensitive microcantilever biosensor can detect COVID-19 in clinical samples with various viral loads, rapidly. Also, it is selective enough to differentiate SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses with similar symptoms.","Kabir, Hannaneh; Merati, Mohsen; Abdekhodaie, Mohammad J",J Med Eng Technol,,261

417437,Novel biosensor platforms for the detection of coronavirus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical practice and education in manual therapy globally. Social distancing has limited in-person care and changed health-care provision. Education in manual therapy has moved to online platforms with in-person instruction restricted. The global impact on the clinical practice of manual therapy and education has to date not been explored. METHODS: a questionnaire survey methodology was used. A sample of convenience of global leaders in manual therapy practice and education received an electronic link to two surveys: one on clinical practice and one on education. Contributors could complete one or both surveys. RESULTS: Twenty-five surveys were received on clinical practice and 23 on education in manual therapy, representing the six major continents. Global themes in clinical practice demonstrated a sudden and dramatic shift away from patient contact, with limited modifications to manual therapy in patient care currently adopted. Themes in education were of a major shift to online learning, development of new modes of student instruction including video-based assessment and virtual case-based instruction. CONCLUSION: The international perspectives provided demonstrate a major change in manual therapy practice and education globally. Various approaches have been taken in practice and education without a uniform approach being demonstrated.","MacDonald, C W; Lonnemann, E; Petersen, S M; Rivett, Darren A; Osmotherly, P G; Brismée, J M",J Man Manip Ther,,261

METHODS: Patients totaling 239 were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were included in this study. Patients were divided into the improvement group and the death group according to their outcome (improvement or death). Clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters were collected from medical records. Continuous variables were tested by an independent sample T test, and categorical variables were analyzed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used for survival analysis in death patients. The time-dependent area under curves (AUC) based on white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count by age, blood urea nitrogen, and C-reactive protein were plotted. RESULTS: Efficacy evaluation indicated that 99 (41.4%) patients had deteriorated, and 140 (58.6%) patients had improved. Oxygen saturation, hemoglobin levels, infection-related indicators, lymphocyte and platelet counts, C-reactive protein, serum albumin, liver and kidney function, and lactate dehydrogenase in improvement group were statistically significant between the improvement and death groups. A survival analysis revealed that comorbidities, lymphocyte counts, platelet count, serum albumin, C-reactive protein level, and renal dysfunction may be risk factors in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Patients with comorbidities, lower lymphocyte counts in hemogram, platelet count and serum albumin, high C-reactive protein level, and renal dysfunction may have higher risk for death. More attention should be given to risk management in the progression of COVID-19.","Lu, Wen; Yu, Shuhui; Liu, Hailing; Suo, Lihua; Tang, Kuanyin; Hu, Jitao; Shi, Yantong; Hu, Ke",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,261

The safety and supply of blood during this pandemic has been a concern of blood banks and transfusion services as it is expected to adversely affect blood system activities. We aim to assess the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) during the first months of the pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was designed to address blood supply, transfusion demand, and donor management during the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Medical directors of different blood banks were invited to participate. RESULTS: A total of 16 centers participated with representation from 15/22 countries in the region. 75% were from national blood banks. Most centres had a decrease in the blood supply, ranging from 26-50%. Representatives from 14 countries (93.3%) believed that public fear has contributed to a decrease in donations. Most centres (n=12, 87.5%) had a reduction in transfusion demand, while those who did not, reported heavy involvement in treating patients with underlying haemoglobinopathies and haematological malignancies. Half of the centres activated their contingency plans. Four centres had to alter the blood donor eligibility criteria to meet demands. All centres implemented donor deferral criteria in relation to SARS-CoV-2, but were variable in measures to mitigate the risk of donor and staff exposure. CONCLUSION: Blood services in the region faced variable degrees of blood shortages. We summarize lessons learnt during this pandemic for the blood banks to consider to plan, assess, and respond proportionately to future similar pandemics.","Riyami, Arwa Z Al; Abdella, Yetmgeta E; Badawi, Maha A; Panchatcharam, Sathiya M; Ghaleb, Yasser; Maghsudlu, Mahtab; Satti, Maria; Lahjouji, Khadija; Merenkov, Zayd; Adwan, Asia; Feghali, Rita; Gebril, Naji; Hejress, Suha; Hmida, Slama; AlHumaidan, Hind; Jamal, Durenaz; Najjar, Osama; Raouf, May",Transfus. clin. biol,,261

Both a lack of accurate and timely data and pervasive misinformation are causing increasing harm and growing tension between data privacy and public health concerns. OBJECTIVE: This aim of this paper is to describe how blockchain, with its distributed trust networks and cryptography-based security, can provide solutions to data-related trust problems. METHODS: Blockchain is being applied in innovative ways that are relevant to the current COVID-19 crisis. We describe examples of the challenges faced by existing technologies to track medical supplies and infected patients and how blockchain technology applications may help in these situations. RESULTS: This exploration of existing and potential applications of blockchain technology for medical care shows how the distributed governance structure and privacy-preserving features of blockchain can be used to create ""trustless"" systems that can help resolve the tension between maintaining privacy and addressing public health needs in the fight against COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Blockchain relies on a distributed, robust, secure, privacy-preserving, and immutable record framework that can positively transform the nature of trust, value sharing, and transactions. A nationally coordinated effort to explore blockchain to address the deficiencies of existing systems and a partnership of academia, researchers, business, and industry are suggested to expedite the adoption of blockchain in health care.","Khurshid, Anjum",JMIR Med Inform,,261

426604,"Soil pathogens that may potentially cause pandemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses",2020,"The two-month nationwide lockdown implemented in Australia in response to COVID-19 involved restrictions on social gatherings and non-essential services, resulting in marked changes to the distribution of time spent at home and in the workplace. Given the likelihood of future lockdowns, this study aimed to investigate whether the lockdown was associated with an alteration in the pattern of acute hand injuries admitted to Sydney Hospital Hand Unit relative to the same period in 2019, and whether target areas for preventative strategies could be identified. During the lockdown period in 2020, 332 acute presentations were noted, and in the same period in 2019, 310 cases were noted. The mean patient age was higher in 2020, largely due to a 327% increase in do-it-yourself (DIY) injuries. Workplace injuries increased in 2020 despite a 9.5% reduction in hours-worked, reflecting a redistribution of workers into manual labour jobs with a higher risk for hand injuries. Patients who suffered low-energy injuries at work were also significantly younger in 2020, suggesting this effect was most pronounced in younger age-groups, probably due to the shutdown of hospitality-based industries. Domestic violence-related injuries increased in 2020, highlighting the need to maintain resources to provide support in such cases at subspecialty hand units, which are often largely outpatient-centred. This study, therefore, identified a number of key areas that could be targeted in the event of future lockdowns, including messages regarding safe DIY activities, and more stringent requirements regarding worksite briefing and safety for people commencing labour-based jobs, especially if transferring from another industry.","Ho, Emma; Riordan, Edward; Nicklin, Sean",J. plast. reconstr. aesthet. surg,,261

The outbreak of COVID-19, which is currently being spread widely in the world requires in-depth study, starting from the search for sources, prediction of spread patterns, to strategies for handling this virus outbreak. Mathematical modeling can be applied to support various fields of the study. In this paper, we discuss mathematical modeling of the spread of COVID-19 by providing analysis and predictions based on data from the case of COVID-19 in South Kalimantan Province. This study was conducted by estimating parameters of the SIR Model, which is accommodates the death cases in the data, supported by several methods, namely Runge Kutta Method and Nonlinear Least Squares Method. Our analysis to the data and the model yields a Basic Reproduction Number , which means that one individual infected by COVID-19 can produce three new infected individuals. Whereas our prediction shows that infected cases can reach to 37.82% and cases of death can reach to 0.49% of the population who remained in normal activities during the PSBB. The peaks of this case are estimated to occur in the 2nd week of August to the 1st week of October 2020. The fewer people who have normal activities, then the spread of COVID-19 is predicted to pass faster with smaller cases of infection and death. Conversely, the more people who have normal activities, then the spread of COVID-19 in South Kalimantan can take longer and take a higher number of victims.","Yulida, Yuni; Karim, Muhammad Ahsar",Media Bina Ilmiah,,261

Effective treatment options are still very rare. Therefore, the present knowledge on the pathophysiology of fatigue and the potential positive impact of treatment with vitamin C is illustrated. Additionally, the effectiveness of high-dose IV vitamin C in fatigue resulting from various diseases was assessed by a systematic literature review in order to assess the feasibility of vitamin C in post-viral, especially in long COVID, fatigue. Nine clinical studies with 720 participants were identified. Three of the four controlled trials observed a significant decrease in fatigue scores in the vitamin C group compared to the control group. Four of the five observational or before-and-after studies observed a significant reduction in pre-post levels of fatigue. Attendant symptoms of fatigue such as sleep disturbances, lack of concentration, depression, and pain were also frequently alleviated. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and circulatory disorders, which are important contributors to fatigue, are also discussed in long COVID fatigue. Thus, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, endothelial-restoring, and immunomodulatory effects of high-dose IV vitamin C might be a suitable treatment option.","Vollbracht, Claudia; Kraft, Karin",Nutrients,,261

453635,Transmembrane serine protease 2 Polymorphisms and Susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 Infection: A German Case-Control Study,2021,"Background: Our area, corona (COVID-19) quarantine was applied from March 14 to April 23, 2020. It was in all forms, including curfew, social distancing, self-quarantine, area quarantine, self-monitoring, and isolation. Due to their concerns about their safety and families, friends, colleagues, and society, everybody was feeling upset, fearful, and anxious. Several studies have reported an association between prolonged sitting time and weight gain. As a way to relieve the tension during that period, people started stocking up on unhealthy foods like over-salted snacks and over-sweetened sugars. People stayed at home, feeling bored, anxious, and stressed and sought relief by eating. Also, there was a rise in emotional eating when the stress of isolation increased by the closure of gyms, casinos, and movie theaters. Moreover, restaurants were allowed to serve the only takeout. Besides, unemployment was skyrocketing, hospitals were overflowing (or were preparing for the possibility), many people were struggling to meet their basic needs, and no one knows when or how it would end. Objective: The study aimed to figure out whether social isolation during the COVID-19 quarantine is consistent and associated with emotional eating and gaining weight or not. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional case series study was conducted on 765 patients who have visited the bariatric clinic in Sulaimani city, Kurdistan-Iraq, from April 23 to June 23, 2020. An individual face-to-face interview was conducted with each participant to obtain signed informed consent, provide them with information about the type and the subject of the work, and ask them the study's questions. Each interview lasted between 30 and 45â¯min and was conducted in a closed session by two Kurdistan Board trainees. Results: No patient who was quarantined for the COVID-19 was included in the work, but all other patients were included. The selected patients were those who had undergone social distancing (nâ¯=â¯568, 82.48%) by the local law and did self-isolation (nâ¯=â¯134, 17.51%) at home for reasons like having comorbidity, being prone to contamination due to their jobs (health, police, and media workers), having some family members at home with comorbidity (nâ¯=â¯23, 03.00%), and having comorbidity and having undergone social distancing because of their other family members' need to do so for their physical disability (nâ¯=â¯25, 03.27%). Almost all patients (nâ¯=â¯741, 96.86%), even, those with comorbidity (nâ¯=â¯136, 17.78%), were emotionally stable before the outbreak. Seventy-three female patients (09.54%) and138 males (20.65%) sustain their weight during and two months after the outbreak, while the rest (nâ¯=â¯554, 72.41%) gained different amounts of weight. Conclusion: Social distancing and self-isolation in the last COVID-19 outbreak influenced weight gain, but weight gain of less than 2â¯kg was observed among almost all patients who gained weight (98.05%). The patients who were gain more than 3â¯kg were mostly females or/and from the center of large cities.","Ahmed, Hiwa Omer",,,261

We identified a total of 102 eligible studies for systematic review, in which 49 studies adjusting for confounders were included in the meta-analysis. We found no association between prior ACEI/ARB use and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in general population (adjusted OR [aOR] 1.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94-1.05). The risk of mortality (aOR 0.87, 95%CI 0.66-1.04) and severe outcomes (aOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.73-1.24) are also unchanged among COVID-19 patients taking ACEI/ARB. These findings remain consistent in subgroup analyses stratified by populations, drug exposures and in other secondary outcomes. This systematic review provides evidence-based support to current medical guidelines and position statements that ACEI/ARB should not be discontinued. Additionally, there has been no evidence for initiating ACEI/ARB regimen as prevention or treatment of COVID-19.","Xu, Jiuyang; Teng, Yaqun; Shang, Lianhan; Gu, Xiaoying; Fan, Guohui; Chen, Yijun; Tian, Ran; Zhang, Shuyang; Cao, Bin",Clin Infect Dis,,261
455220,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infections in Primary School Age Children After Partial Reopening of Schools in England,2021,"BackgroundThere is evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of the UK population, but this needs synthesising to guide effective policy recommendations and ensure support is targeted to populations most at risk. We conducted a rapid systematic review of the evidence of the impact of COVID-19 and associated restrictions on the mental health of UK adults, including risk and protective factors. MethodA range of databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Studies were eligible if they reported primary quantitative or qualitative research on the mental health of UK adults between March 2020 and March 2021. Journal publications and pre-prints were included. Reviews, position papers, protocol papers and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. The study authors screened papers for eligibility and included 102 papers in the analysis. ResultsThe evidence from this review indicates that the mental health of UK adults has declined since the start of the pandemic, with different populations being unequally affected. Populations particularly affected are women, young adults, ethnic minorities, people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, people with pre-existing conditions and people who have had COVID-19. Other risk factors include having to isolate and time spent watching pandemic related news. Protective factors include social contact and maintaining healthy behaviours, such as physical activity. ConclusionsPolicy should aim to discourage risky behaviours while ensuring support is available for people to engage in protective behaviours. Interventions should be directed towards populations that have been most adversely affected. Addressing the decline in mental health across the UK population since the COVID-19 pandemic will require increasing mental health provision and ensuring equitable access to support.","Batteux, Eleonore; Taylor, Jo; Carter, Holly",,,261

455882,Relationship Between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the Etiology of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI),2020,"OBJECTIVE: Neurosurgical patients are at a higher risk of having a severe course of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to determine morbidity, hospital course and mortality of neurosurgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic in a multi-center health care system. METHODS: A retrospective, observational study was conducted to identify all hospitalized neurosurgical patients positive for COVID-19 from 3/11/20 to 11/02/20 at Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Clinic Health System. RESULTS: Eleven hospitalized neurosurgical patients (0.68%) were positive for COVID-19. Four patients (36.6%) were men and 7 (63.3%) were women. The mean age was 65.7 years (range: 35-81 years). All patients had comorbidities. The mean length of stay was 13.4 days (range: 4-30 days). Seven patients had a central nervous system malignancy (4 metastases, 1 meningioma, 1 glioblastoma, and 1 schwannoma). Three patients presented cerebrovascular complications including two spontaneous intraparenchymal hemorrhages and 1 ischemic large vessel stroke. One patient presented with an unstable traumatic spinal burst fracture. Four patients underwent neurosurgical/neuroendovascular interventions. Discharge disposition was to home in 5, rehabilitation facility in 3 and hospice in 3 patients. Five patients expired on follow-up, three within 30-days from COVID-19 complications and two from progression of their metastatic cancer. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is rare among the inpatient neurosurgical population. In all cases, patients had multiple comorbidities. All symptomatic patients from the respiratory standpoint had complications during their hospitalization. Three patients, who expired within 30-days of hospitalization were all related to COVID-19 complications. Neurosurgical procedures were only performed if deemed emergent.","Marenco-Hillembrand, Lina; Erben, Young; Suarez-Meade, Paola; Franco-Mesa, Camila; Sherman, Wendy; Eidelman, Benjamin H; Miller, David A; O039,; Keefe, Nancy L; Bendok, Bernard R; Spinner, Robert J; Chaichana, Kaisorn L; Meschia, James F; Quiñones-Hinojosa, Alfredo",World neurosurgery (Online),,261
465472,Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of 26 Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Carriers,2020,"BACKGROUND: Public health (PH) practitioners have a strong moral commitment to health equity and social justice. However, PH values often do not align with health systems values, making it challenging for PH practitioners to promote health equity. In spite of a growing range of PH ethics frameworks and theories, little is known about ethical concerns related to promotion of health equity in PH practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical concerns of PH practitioners in promoting health equity in the context of mental health promotion and prevention of harms of substance use. METHODS: As part of a broader program of public health systems and services research, we interviewed 32 PH practitioners. RESULTS: Using constant comparative analysis, we identified four systemic ethical tensions: [1] biomedical versus social determinants of health agenda; [2] systems driven agendas versus situational care; [3] stigma and discrimination versus respect for persons; and [4] trust and autonomy versus surveillance and social control. CONCLUSIONS: Naming these tensions provides insights into the daily ethical challenges of PH practitioners and an opportunity to reflect on the relevance of PH frameworks. These findings highlight the value of relational ethics as a promising approach for developing ethical frameworks for PH practice.","Pauly, Bernie; Revai, Tina; Marcellus, Lenora; Martin, Wanda; Easton, Kathy; MacDonald, Marjorie",BMC Public Health,,261

This paper uses a modelling-based scenario analysis to assess the restriction policies relating to air transport in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia during and after the pandemic and their effects on the environment. The simulation results highlight the need to reduce the negative environmental impact produced by the aviation sector and suggest that policymakers should try to focus on creating ways to reduce the impact made by the aviation industry on the environment, through a coordinated environmental policy between countries, including the three that are the subject of the present case study in order to highlight these issues.","Calderon-Tellez, Javier; Herrera, Milton M",Transp Res Interdiscip Perspect,,261

In this study, a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 multiplex microsphere immunoassay (MMIA) was developed for the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid (N) that was more sensitive than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (98% versus 87%). The MMIA was then applied and validated in 264 first responders in Colorado using serum and dried blood spot (DBS) eluates, compared to ELISA, and evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. Four percent (11/264) of first responders were seropositive in July to August 2020. Serum and DBS were highly correlated for anti-RBD and anti-N antibodies (R = 0.83, P < 0.0001 and R = 0.87, P < 0.0001, respectively) by MMIA. The MMIA accurately predicted SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies using DBS (R = 0.76, P = 0.037). On repeat antibody testing 3 months later, anti-RBD IgG decreased less rapidly than anti-N IgG measured by MMIA, with a median change in geometric median fluorescence intensity of 62% versus 79% (P < 0.01) for anti-RBD and anti-N IgG, respectively. This novel MMIA using DBS could be scalable for rapid and affordable SARS-CoV-2 serosurveillance in the United States and globally.","Schultz, Jonathan S; McCarthy, Mary K; Rester, Cody; Sabourin, Katherine R; Annen, Kyle; DomBourian, Melkon; Eisenmesser, Elan; Frazer-Abel, Ashley; Knight, Vijaya; Jaenisch, Thomas; Morrison, Thomas E; Rochford, Rosemary; Kedl, Ross M",J. clin. microbiol,,261
469058,Myopericarditis caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Public health responses to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) including lockdowns may negatively impact physical and mental functioning in clinical populations. People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more susceptible to physical function deterioration while practicing social distancing. Recent reports have suggested that about 50% of people with MS (pwMS) decreased their leisure physical activity during COVID-19, and upwards of 30% reported decreased physical fitness levels. However, the impact of social distancing on adverse health-related outcomes such as falls has not received much scrutiny. Therefore, we explored the frequency and characteristics of falls experienced by people living with and without MS during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Two-hundred and thirty-nine individuals, including 106 pwMS (median age: 59 years) and 133 people living without MS (median age: 66 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A snowball sampling strategy was used for online recruitment. Participants completed a customized falls questionnaire and the number of falls experienced (if any) during COVID-19 was recorded. Fall-related characteristics such as the timing, locations, activities undertaken before falling and consequences, as well as self-reported physical activity were also recorded. RESULTS: Overall, participants reported 232 falls (1.67 falls/person in pwMS and 0.41 falls/person in non-MS participants). People living with MS (pwMS) had a significantly higher frequency of falls (58.5% vs 21.8%; p< 0.001) and recurrent falls (45.3% vs 9.8%; p< 0.001) compared to non-MS participants. Additionally, pwMS reported a significantly higher proportion of in-home falls (83.9% vs 54.2%; p = 0.004), as well as a higher proportion of overall injuries (44.3% vs 12.5%, p< 0.001), fractures (5.7% vs 0.8%, p = 0.048), and healthcare utilization (9.4% vs 1.6%, p = 0.007) compared to non-MS participants. A similar proportion of pwMS (49.1%) and non-MS participants (52.2%) reported lower physical activity levels during COVID-19. CONCLUSION: This cross-sectional study revealed that pwMS remain at high risk of falls and fall-related outcomes during COVID-19. The high number of falls experienced by pwMS is of clinical concern considering the current strain on the healthcare system. Findings from this study highlight the importance of monitoring falls and the potential for telerehabilitation in persons with MS during COVID-19.","Zanotto, Tobia; Frechette, Mikaela L; Koziel, Stephen R; Hsieh, Katherine L; Sosnoff, Jacob J",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,261
469725,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection reaches the human nervous system: How?,2020,"Without modern medical management and vaccines, the severity of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might approach the magnitude of 1894-plague (12 million deaths) and 1918-A(H1N1) influenza (50 million deaths) pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic was heralded by the 2003 SARS epidemic which led to the discovery of human and civet SARS-CoV-1, bat SARS-related-CoVs, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-related bat CoV HKU4 and HKU5, and other novel animal coronaviruses. The suspected animal-to-human jumping of 4 betacoronaviruses including the human coronaviruses OC43(1890), SARS-CoV-1(2003), MERS-CoV(2012), and SARS-CoV-2(2019) indicates their significant pandemic potential. The presence of a large reservoir of coronaviruses in bats and other wild mammals, culture of mixing and selling them in urban markets with suboptimal hygiene, habit of eating exotic mammals in highly populated areas, and the rapid and frequent air travels from these areas are perfect ingredients for brewing rapidly exploding epidemics. The possibility of emergence of a hypothetical SARS-CoV-3 or other novel viruses from animals or laboratories, and therefore needs for global preparedness should not be ignored. We reviewed representative publications on the epidemiology, virology, clinical manifestations, pathology, laboratory diagnostics, treatment, vaccination, and infection control of COVID-19 as of 20 January 2021, which is 1 year after person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was announced. The difficulties of mass testing, labour-intensive contact tracing, importance of compliance to universal masking, low efficacy of antiviral treatment for severe disease, possibilities of vaccine or antiviral-resistant virus variants and SARS-CoV-2 becoming another common cold coronavirus are discussed.","To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Sridhar, Siddharth; Chiu, Kelvin Hei-Yeung; Hung, Derek Ling-Lung; Li, Xin; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Tam, Anthony Raymond; Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Zhang, Anna Jian-Xia; Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Emerg Microbes Infect,,261

This study aimed to characterize flu-like syndrome cases (FS) in HCWs notified in Brazil and compare them with FS cases in the general community (GC). In the Brazilian protocol, FS corresponds to a suspected case of COVID-19. The manuscript analyzed cases of FS in five Brazilian states, estimating the incidence rates of cases of FS and clinical and epidemiological characteristics. Registered cases (March to June 2020) totaled about 1,100,000 cases of FS. HCWs represented 17% of the registers, whose incidence was 20.41/100 vs. 2.15/100 in the GC. FS cases in HCWs concentrated the highest percentages in the age group of 30 to 49 years (65.15%) and among the nursing staff (46.86%). This study was the first interstate evaluation in Brazil to estimate suspected cases of FS by COVID-19 in HCWs. In order to control the spread of viral respiratory infections in HCWs, including COVID-19, it is necessary to review the management of health information to identify who they are, how many they are, and to what situations these workers are most frequently exposed, as well as in what professions they have. This information can guide specific, practical, and far-reaching actions.","Assunção, Ada Ávila; Maia, Emanuella Gomes; Jardim, Renata; de Araújo, Tânia Maria",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,261
475509,The Possible Protective Role of α-Synuclein Against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infections in Patients With Parkinson's Disease,2020,"Since December 2019, a new pandemic has appeared causing a considerable negative global impact. The SARS-CoV-2 first emerged from China and transformed to a global pandemic within a short time. The virus was further observed to be spreading rapidly and mutating at a fast pace, with over 5,775 distinct variations of the virus observed globally (at the time of submitting this paper). Extensive research has been ongoing worldwide in order to get a better understanding of its behaviour, influence and more importantly, ways for reducing its impact. Data analytics has been playing a pivotal role in this research to obtain valuable insights into understanding and fighting against the spread of infection. However, this is time and resource intensive, making it difficult to observe and quickly identify the impact of mutations. Factors such as the spread or virulence could explain the three months delay in revealing the new virus variant in the UK. This paper presents an extensive correlation analysis of the effect caused by the different SARS-CoV-2 strains, and their influence on the population across diverse factors, such as propagation and fatality rates, during the peak of the pandemic, with a focus on two major countries in theMiddle East, the United Arab Emirate (UAE) and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This research aims to investigate the epidemiological behaviour of the Coronavirus' genomic variants over time in the UAE, compared with the KSA, where correlation analysis is carried out for a number of cases, deaths and their statistical deviations. The results of the analysis highlight very interesting insights into the epidemiological impact of the Covid-19 genomic behaviour in both countries, which could lead to important actions taken to minimize the impact on wider public health, possibly saving lives, and the economy. For instance, our method identifies a potential correlation between a spike in the number of deaths per case of 5.5 observed in the UAE by March 24th, with the emergence of new genomic variants of the Coronavirus (G0_c, G0_e1 and G0_e2). Our proposed methodology can be instrumental in identifying and classifying new variations of the virus earlier, and possibly predicting foreseeable mutations through pattern analysis, hence creating proactivemeasures to control its spread, such as the recent case of the new virus variant, recently discovered in the UK. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

496598,"Correction for Khan et al., ""Emergence of a Novel Coronavirus, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: Biology and Therapeutic Options""",2020,"The coronavirus pandemic has significantly impacted solid organ transplantation (SOT). Early in the outbreak period, transplant societies recommended suspending living kidney transplant programs in communities with widespread transmission to avoid exposing recipients to increased risk of immunosuppression, while recommendations were made to reserve deceased-donor kidney transplantation for likely life-saving indications. SOT recipients may be at high risk from COVID-19 disease due to chronic immunosuppressive treatment and other medical comorbidities. Mortality rates reported between 13 to over 30% in SOT recipients. In addition to high rates of complications and mortality attributable to COVID-19 infections, the pandemic has also led to additional complexities in transplantation including new questions regarding screening of donors and recipients, decision making to accept a patient for kidney transplant or wait after pandemic. The clinical implications of COVID-19 infection may also differ depending on the type of the transplanted organ and recipient comorbidities which further impacts decisions on continuing transplantation during the pandemic. Transplant activity during a pandemic should be tailored with careful selection of both donors and recipients. Furthermore, while tremendous strides have been made in treatment strategies and vaccinations, the impact of these in transplant recipients may be attenuated in the setting of their immunosuppression. In this review, we aim to summarize several aspects of COVID-19 in transplantation, including the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, clinical outcomes in SOT recipients, and end-stage kidney disease patients, transplant activity during the pandemic, and treatment options for COVID-19 disease.","Azzi, Yorg; Bartash, Rachel; Scalea, Joseph; Loarte-Campos, Pablo; Akalin, Enver",Transplantation,,261

The spread of the disease has been on the increase across the globe for some time with no end in sight. The research used the data of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria for the numerical simulation which has been fitted to the model. We brought in the consideration of both asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals with the fact that an exposed individual is either sent to quarantine first or move to one of the infected classes with the possibility that susceptible individual can also move to quarantined class directly. It was found that the proposed model has two equilibrium points; the disease-free equilibrium point ( DFE ) and the endemic equilibrium point ( E 1 ) . Stability analysis of the equilibrium points shows ( E 0 ) is locally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number, R 0 < 1 and ( E 1 ) is globally asymptotically stable whenever R 0 > 1 . Sensitivity analysis of the parameters in the R 0 was conducted and the profile of each state variable was also depicted using the fitted values of the parameters showing the spread of the disease. The most sensitive parameters in the R 0 are the contact rate between susceptible individuals and the rate of transfer of individuals from exposed class to symptomatically infected class. Moreover, the basic reproduction number for the data is calculated as R 0 &#8776; 1.7031 . Existence and uniqueness of solution established via the technique of fixed point theorem. Also, using the least square curve fitting method together with the fminsearch function in the MATLAB optimization toolbox, we obtain the best values for some of the unknown biological parameters involved in the proposed model. Furthermore, we solved the fractional model numerically using the Atangana-Toufik numerical scheme and presenting different forms of graphical results that can be useful in minimizing the infection.","Ahmed, Idris; Modu, Goni Umar; Yusuf, Abdullahi; Kumam, Poom; Yusuf, Ibrahim",Results Phys,,261

METHODS: A systematic review was performed using the Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL databases and the World Health Organization Novel Coronavirus website to identify studies that reported mortality and characteristics of patients with cancer who were diagnosed with COVID-19. The primary study outcome was mortality, defined as all-cause mortality or in-hospital mortality within 30 days of initial COVID-19 diagnosis. The pooled proportion of mortality was estimated using a random-effects model, and study-level moderators of heterogeneity were assessed through subgroup analysis and metaregression. RESULTS: Among 2922 patients from 13 primarily inpatient studies of individuals with COVID-19 and cancer, the pooled 30-day mortality rate was 30% (95% CI, 25%-35%). The overall pooled 30-day mortality rate among 624 patients from 5 studies that included a mixture of inpatient and outpatient populations was 15% (95% CI, 9%-22%). Among the hospitalized studies, the heterogeneity (I2 statistic) of the meta-analysis remained high (I2 , 82%). Cancer subtype (hematologic vs solid), older age, male sex, and recent active cancer therapy each partially explained the heterogeneity of mortality reporting. In multivariable metaregression, male sex, along with an interaction between the median patient age and recent active cancer therapy, explained most of the between-study heterogeneity (R2 , 96%). CONCLUSIONS: Pooled mortality estimates for hospitalized patients with cancer and COVID-19 remain high at 30%, with significant heterogeneity across studies. Dedicated community-based studies are needed in the future to help assess overall COVID-19 mortality among the broader population of patients with cancer.","Desai, Aakash; Gupta, Rohit; Advani, Shailesh; Ouellette, Lara; Kuderer, Nicole M; Lyman, Gary H; Li, Ang",Cancer,,261

However, complications principally of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple-organ failure can occur rapidly. Leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease, is similar to Covid-19 in that most infections are mild or asymptomatic and only a small number develop ARDS. Cytokine storm is considered to be the main incriminating factor in both. High dose steroids have been used to ameliorate the effects in leptospirosis, and similarly, reports suggest a benefit in Covid-19. SARS CoV-2 and leptospira, one a virus and the other a bacterium, are two species separated by millions of years of evolution, but producing illnesses with similar spectra, with cytokine storm being the common precipitating factor.

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0–18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children < 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2–18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.","Lee, Eun; Kim, Chul-Hong; Lee, Yong Ju; Kim, Hyo-Bin; Kim, Bong-Seong; Kim, Hyung Young; Kim, Yunsun; Kim, Sangyoung; Park, Chorong; Seo, Ju-Hee; Sol, In Suk; Sung, Myongsoon; Song, Min Seob; Song, Dae Jin; Ahn, Young Min; Oh, Hea Lin; Yu, Jinho; Jung, Sungsu; Lee, Kyung Suk; Lee, Ju Suk; Jang, Gwang Cheon; Jang, Yoon-Young; Chung, Eun Hee; Chung, Hai Lee; Choi, Sung-Min; Choi, Yun Jung; Han, Man Yong; Shim, Jung Yeon; Kim, Jin Tack; Kim, Chang-Keun; Yang, Hyeon-Jong",BMC Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-020-4810-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32050912/,261

As specifically concerns this latest infectious pathology, laboratory medicine can provide a substantial contribution to diagnosing an acute severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through molecular testing, establishing the presence and extent of an immune response against the virus, mostly through serological testing. However, it can also help to predict the risk of unfavorable disease progression by measuring some conventional laboratory tests and, last but not least, can provide reliable therapeutic guidance. This article is hence aimed at offering recent updates on the important role and value of laboratory investigations in COVID-19, also providing information on some hot topics such as virus RNA detection in different biological samples, causes of recurrent positivity of reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), potential strategies for enhancing the throughput of molecular testing (i.e., pre-test probability assessment, sample pooling, use of rapid tests), as well as pragmatic indications for enhancing the quality and value of serological testing and laboratory-based monitoring.

This paper explores the governance of human resources during the pandemic, looking at the Quebec health system as a revelatory case. We identify three issues related to health human resource (HHR) policies: working conditions, recognition at work and scope of practice. We empirically probe these issues based on an analysis of popular media, policy reports and participant observation by the lead authors in various forums and research projects. Using an integrated model of HHR, we identify major vulnerabilities in this domain. Persistent labour shortages, endemic deficiencies in working environments and inequity across occupational categories limit the ability to address critical HHR issues. We propose three ways to eliminate HHR vulnerabilities: reorganize work through participatory initiatives, implement joint policy making to rebalance power across the health workforce, and invest in the development of capacities at all system levels.","Denis, Jean Louis; Côté, Nancy; Fleury, Charles; Currie, Graeme; Spyridonidis, Dimitrios",Int J Health Plann Manage,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33647168/; https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3129,261

Protein analysis was performed on 15 serum samples using iTRAQ. The study population included healthy controls (n=5), patients with CHB (n=5) and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=5). Western blotting was used to verify the results in an additional nine serum samples from healthy controls, patients with CHB and patients with HBV-induced ACLF (n=3, respectively). Using iTRAQ analysis, 16 different serum proteins with ≥1.5-fold differences in expression levels were identified in the patients with CHB and ACLF compared with the healthy controls. Five of those proteins, C-reactive protein precursor, hemoglobin β chain variant Hb S-Wake, apolipoprotein J precursor, platelet factor 4 precursor and vitronectin, which demonstrated the greatest differences in their expression levels and the most significant correlation with liver diseases, were subsequently verified using western blotting. The western blotting results were consistent with the results from the iTRAQ. Two of the five proteins are not classified by biological process, and the biological functions of all the proteins in HBV-induced ACLF remain unclear. This preliminary study demonstrated that a correlation between the expression of various serum proteins and the different pathogenetic conditions induced by HBV may exist.

While wastewater-based epidemiology has been implemented as an alternative/additional monitoring tool to reduce reporting bias, the relationship between passive and wastewater surveillance data has not yet been explicitly examined. As there is strong age dependency in the symptomatic ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infections, here, we aimed to estimate i) an age-dependent association between the number of reported cases and viral load in wastewater and ii) the time lag between these time series. The viral load in wastewater was modeled as a combination of contributions from virus shedding by different age groups, incorporating the delay, and fitted with daily case count data collected from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health and SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in wastewater recorded by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority. The estimated lag between the time series of viral loads in wastewater and of reported cases was 10.8 (95% confidence interval: 10.2–11.6) and 8.8 (8.4–9.1) days for the northern and southern areas of the wastewater treatment plant, respectively. The estimated contribution rate of a reported case to the viral load in wastewater in the 0–19 yr age group was 0.38 (0.35–0.41) and 0.40 (0.37–0.43) for the northern and southern areas, and that in the 80+ yr age group was 0.67 (0.65–0.69) and 0.51 (0.49–0.52) for the northern and southern areas, respectively. The estimated lag between these time series suggested the predictability of reported cases 10 days later using viral loads in wastewater. The contribution of a reported case in passive surveillance to the viral load in wastewater differed by age, suggesting a large variation in viral shedding kinetics among age groups.","Omori, Ryosuke; Miura, Fuminari; Kitajima, Masaaki",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34147797/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721035142; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148442; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721035142?v=s5,261

Changes in redox homeostasis, including intracellular glutathione (GSH) depletion, are one of the key events that favor virus replication and contribute to the pathogenesis of virus-induced disease. Redox homeostasis has an important role in maintaining an appropriate Th1/Th2 balance, which is necessary to mount an effective immune response against viral infection and to avoid excessive inflammatory responses. It is known that excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by viral infection activates nuclear factor (NF)-kB, which orchestrates the expression of viral and host genes involved in the viral replication and inflammatory response. Moreover, redox-regulated protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) chaperones have an essential role in catalyzing formation of disulfide bonds in viral proteins. This review aims at describing the role of GSH in modulating redox sensitive pathways, in particular that mediated by NF-kB, and PDI activity. The second part of the review discusses the effectiveness of GSH-boosting molecules as broad-spectrum antivirals acting in a multifaceted way that includes the modulation of immune and inflammatory responses.","Fraternale, Alessandra; Zara, Carolina; De Angelis, Marta; Nencioni, Lucia; Palamara, Anna Teresa; Retini, Michele; Di Mambro, Tomas; Magnani, Mauro; Crinelli, Rita",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33808471/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22073603,261

However, these discussions are often left for when critical intervention is needed in the Emergency Department, and this has been exacerbated in the new context of the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Establishing effective, formal training for Emergency Medicine (EM) residents to successfully carry out these conversations and potentially improve patient care is needed. Methodology A physician dual-certified in Emergency Medicine and Palliative Care developed a virtual course on best practices in determining GOC for EM residents. It occurred for one hour during resident didactic conference and all residents who attended were included. A survey was sent to all participants to assess the success of the course’s content and method of delivery. Results Of the 39 residents who participated, 18 (46%) completed the survey. The majority (94%) agreed the course helped close knowledge gaps and increased comfort in carrying out these discussions and 100% planned to incorporate these learning points into practice. A smaller majority (61%) thought the virtual platform was an effective method of delivery and 61% felt the breakout rooms helped with learning retention. Open-ended comments reflected learners’ desire for more of this content, suggestions to augment with simulation, as well as technical difficulties experienced. Conclusions This course helped EM residents identify and close knowledge gaps in determining patients’ GOC who plan to incorporate what they learned into their clinical practice. Next steps in validating the course include seeking more pointed feedback of the virtual format and assessing its effects over broader audiences after making feedback-focused adjustments to its content and delivery.","Crossman, Megan E; Stobart-Gallagher, Megan; Siegel, Mari",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026375/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.14558,261
608714,Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),2003,"In late 2019, the new Coronavirus has been identified in the city of Wuhan then COVID-19 spreads like wildfire in the rest of the world. Pregnant women represent a risk category for increased abortion rates and vertical transmission with adverse events on the newborns has been recently confirmed. The scientific world is struggling for finding an effective cure for counteracting symptomatology. Today, there are many therapeutic proposes but none of them can effectively counteract the infection. Moreover, many of these compounds show important side effects not justifying their use. Scientific literature reports an immune system over-reaction through interleukins-6 activation. In this regard, the possibility to control the immune system represents a possible strategy for counteracting the onset of COVID-19 symptomatology. Vitamin D deficiency shows increased susceptibility to acute viral respiratory infections. Moreover, Vitamin D seems involved in host protection from different virus species by modulating activation and release of cytokines. Myo-inositol down-regulates the expression of IL-6 by phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. Furthermore, myo-inositol is the precursor of phospholipids in the surfactant and it is applied for inducing surfactant synthesis in infants for treating respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). This review aims to summarize the evidence about COVID-19 infection in pregnant women and to encourage the scientific community to investigate the use of Vitamin D and Myo-inositol which could represent a possible preventive treatment for pregnant women or women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART).","Bezerra Espinola, Maria Salome; Bertelli, Matteo; Bizzarri, Mariano; Unfer, Vittorio; Laganà, Antonio Simone; Visconti, Berniero; Aragona, Cesare",J Reprod Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165037821000012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165037821000012; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jri.2021.103271; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33493945/,261

611909,The severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in mainland China dissected,2011-02-18,"Antibodies are widely used reagents to test for expression of proteins and other antigens. However, they might not always reliably produce results when they do not specifically bind to the target proteins that their providers designed them for, leading to unreliable research results. While many proposals have been developed to deal with the problem of antibody specificity, it is still challenging to cover the millions of antibodies that are available to researchers. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of automatically generating alerts to users of problematic antibodies by extracting statements about antibody specificity reported in the literature. The extracted alerts can be used to construct an “Antibody Watch” knowledge base containing supporting statements of problematic antibodies. We developed a deep neural network system and tested its performance with a corpus of more than two thousand articles that reported uses of antibodies. We divided the problem into two tasks. Given an input article, the first task is to identify snippets about antibody specificity and classify if the snippets report that any antibody exhibits non-specificity, and thus is problematic. The second task is to link each of these snippets to one or more antibodies mentioned in the snippet. The experimental evaluation shows that our system can accurately perform the classification task with 0.925 weighted F1-score, linking with 0.962 accuracy, and 0.914 weighted F1 when combined to complete the joint task. We leveraged Research Resource Identifiers (RRID) to precisely identify antibodies linked to the extracted specificity snippets. The result shows that it is feasible to construct a reliable knowledge base about problematic antibodies by text mining.","Hsu, Chun-Nan; Chang, Chia-Hui; Poopradubsil, Thamolwan; Lo, Amanda; William, Karen A.; Lin, Ko-Wei; Bandrowski, Anita; Ozyurt, Ibrahim Burak; Grethe, Jeffrey S.; Martone, Maryann E.",PLoS Comput Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043624/; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01937v2.pdf; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008967,261

Evidence from severe acute respiratory syndromes in 2003,2021-04-22,"Background: Coronavirus primarily targets the human respiratory system, COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019) triggered in China in the late 2019. In March 2020, WHO announced the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to analyze and visualize the scientific structure of the COVID-19 publications using co-citation and co-authorship. Methods: This is a scientometric study. Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) was searched for all documents regarding COVID-19, MERS-Cov, and SARS-Cov from the beginning to 2020. An Excel spreadsheet was applied to gather and analyze the data and the CiteSpace was used to visualize and analyze the data. Results: A total of 5159 records were retrieved in WoSCC. The structure of the network indicated that the network mean silhouette was low (0.1444), implying that the network clusters’ identity is not identifiable with high confidence. The network modularity was 0.7309. The cluster analysis of the co-citation network on documents from 2003 to 2020 provided 188 clusters. The largest cluster entitled, ""the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"" had 255 nodes. The coauthorship network illustrated that the most prolific countries, USA, China, and Saudi Arabia, have focused on a specific field and have formed separate clusters. Conclusion: The present study identified the important topics of research in the field of COVID-19 based on co-citation networks as well as the analysis of clusters of countries' collaborations. Despite the similarities in the production behavior in prolific countries, their thematic focus varies so that a country like China plays a role in ""Quantitative Detection"" cluster, while USA is the leading country in the ""Biological Evaluation"" cluster.","Okhovati, Maryam; Arshadi, Homa",Med J Islam Repub Iran,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996671/; https://doi.org/10.47176/mjiri.35.20,261

The etiology of influenza‐like‐illness in developing countries such as Papua New Guinea is poorly understood. The etiological agents associated with influenza‐like‐illness were investigated retrospectively for 300 nasopharyngeal swabs received by the Papua New Guinea National Influenza Centre in 2010. Real‐time PCR/RT‐PCR methods were used for the detection of 13 respiratory viruses. Patients with influenza‐like‐illness were identified according to the World Health Organization case definition: sudden onset of fever (>38°C), with cough and/or sore throat, in the absence of other diagnoses. At least one viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 66.3% of the samples tested. Rhinoviruses (17.0%), influenza A (16.7%), and influenza B (12.7%) were the pathogens detected most frequently. Children <5 years of age presented with a significantly higher rate of at least one viral pathogen and a significantly higher rate of co‐infections with multiple viruses, when compared to all other patients >5 years of age. Influenza B, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were all detected at significantly higher rates in children <5 years of age.

SARS-CoV-2 antibody detection was performed in serum samples of 1216 HCWs, using a reference CMIA assay and 8/1216 (0.66%) were detected positive. Positive serum samples were further tested with other assays; however, only one sample was positive by all tests. The rest 7 cases were negative with ECLIA and ELISA and gave discordant results with RIC test. Six months later, new serum samples of seropositive HCWs were analyzed with the same 7 tests, with inconsistent results again. Identification of reliable SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests is important to determine the actual number of past infections, the duration of antibodies, and guide public health decisions.","Tatsi, Elizabeth-Barbara; Dellis, Charilaos; Petridou, Evangelia; Banou, Kirkira; Zachariadou, Levantia; Syriopoulou, Vassiliki; Michos, Athanasios",Infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34224078/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s15010-021-01653-2,261

Multifunctional graphene platforms were proposed for the detection of several typical biomarkers (i.e., circulating tumor cells, exosomes, circulating nucleic acids, etc.) in liquid biopsy, and numerous methods, including optical, electrochemical, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), etc., have been developed for their detection. Due to the massive advancements in biology, material chemistry, and analytical technology, it is necessary to review the progress in this field from both medical and chemical sides. Liquid biopsy is considered a revolutionary technique that is opening unexpected perspectives in the early diagnosis and, in therapy monitoring, severe diseases, including cancer, metabolic syndrome, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disorders. Although nanotechnology based on graphene has been poorly applied for the rapid diagnosis of viral diseases, the extraordinary properties of graphene (i.e., high electronic conductivity, large specific area, and surface functionalization) can be also exploited for the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old male, COVID-19-confirmed patient complaining of abdominal pain since two days prior was transferred to our hospital. Perforated appendicitis with a periappendiceal abscess was diagnosed by computed tomography. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed in a negative-pressure operating room. The surgical team wore enhanced personal protective equipment. Electrocautery was not used during surgery and no other special instruments were applied to reduce aerosol generation. No special instruments or filters were used for the removal of intra-abdominal gas. The operation was completed successfully and no immediate surgical complications occurred. The patient advanced to a normal diet on the 4(th) postoperative day. The patient was treated with antibiotics for bacteremia and antiviral therapy for underlying pneumonia in the setting of COVID-19 with most symptoms dissipating by the 7(th) postoperative day. The patient was discharged on the 30(th) postoperative day without any complications. DISCUSSION: A well-designed manual, a well-trained surgical team, and a negative-pressure operating room are essential for safe laparoscopic appendectomies in COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: When surgery is performed in a negative-pressure operating room by a well-trained surgical team, a laparoscopic appendectomy can be successfully performed under the principles of obtaining optimum clinical outcomes while faithfully ensuring the safety of healthcare providers and the hospital environment.","Oh, Dongkyu; Kang, Yu Min; Choi, Jin Yong; Lee, Wang Jun",Int J Surg Case Rep,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221026122031021X?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33169098/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221026122031021X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.10.137,261

622939,Understanding the Spatial Clustering of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong,2004-07-27,"Bronchoscopy is useful as a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in children with Tuberculosis (TB) disease complicated by airway obstruction. It is needed in children when surgical intervention may be required for airway compression, when drug resistance is suspected, and to rule out an alternative diagnosis for airway obstruction. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) should be performed when other, less invasive samples cannot be collected, or when they fail to provide useful diagnostic information. BAL specimens collected at bronchoscopy can be tested using molecular TB assays and mycobacterial culture. The aim of this review is to evaluate the role of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis and management of pulmonary TB in children, and, specifically, to review the role of interventional bronchoscopy. A search of electronic databases was undertaken using the online databases PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Advanced Scholar, and Web of Science to identify relevant literature. The search was limited to pediatrics, pulmonology, bronchoscopy, and pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis for all articles published in English on pediatric bronchoscopy between 2010 and 2020. Recent advances in pediatric bronchoscopy was included, as well as recent research on improving the diagnosis with the use of interventional bronchoscopy. The role of bronchoscopy in pediatric pulmonary tuberculosis has changed during the last decade, from a simple method of collecting samples for bacteriological conformation to an more sophisticate procedure. New methods are available for collecting samples, which includes the use of Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and also better methods of bacteriological conformation. Interventions are now possible; not only to improve the diagnostic abilities of bronchoscopy but also to diagnose, manage, and follow-up upon airway-related complications. Bronchoscopy services remain limited in resource-limited countries due to the high cost of equipment.","Goussard, Pierre; Retief, Francois; Burke, Jonathan; Malherbe, Annemie; Janson, Jacques",Ther Adv Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1177/20499361211037168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34422266/,261

METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled a total of 170 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent CTPA examination for PE suspicion. Pulmonary arteries diameters, right ventricle/left ventricle (RV/LV) ratio, presence, absence, and distribution of PE, pulmonary artery obstructive index (PAO index), and lobe involvement were recorded. All CT scans were reviewed to assess temporal CT changes and the COVID CT-severity score. RESULTS: A total of 76 out of 170 patients (44.7%) developed PE without having any major risk factors for venous thromboembolism. The most severe pulmonary arteries involvement, expressed in terms of PAO Index, occurred in those patients with markedly elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) values and those patients with an advanced temporal stage of lung disease. The majority PE-positive patients were hospitalized in non-intensive wards. PE-positive patients showed a slightly higher hospitalization time in comparison with PE-negative ones. In the three months of study, overall 85.9% of patients were discharged while 14.1% died, of whom 13 PE-positive (54.2%).

623569,Infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a patient with AIDS,2020,"The ability to differentiate between negative emotional states [negative emotion differentiation (NED)] has been conceptualized as a trait that facilitates effective emotion regulation and buffers stress reactivity. In the present research, we investigated the role of NED in within-person processes of daily affect regulation and coping during times of stress (the first COVID-19-related pandemic lockdown in April 2020). Using intensive longitudinal data, we analyzed whether daily stress had an indirect effect on sleep quality through calmness in the evening, and we tested whether NED moderated this within-person indirect effect by buffering the link between daily stress and calmness in the evening. A non-representative community sample (n = 313, 15–82 years old) participated in a 21-day ambulatory assessment with twice-daily surveys. The results of multilevel mediation models showed that higher daily stress was related to within-day change in calmness from morning to evening, resulting in less calmness in the evening within persons. Less calmness in the evening, in turn, was related to poorer nightly sleep quality within persons. As expected, higher NED predicted a less negative within-person link between daily stress and calmness in the evening, thereby attenuating the indirect effect of daily stress on nightly sleep quality through calmness. This effect held when we controlled for mean negative emotions and depression. The results provide support for a diathesis-stress model of NED, and hence, for NED as a protective factor that helps to explain why some individuals remain more resilient during times of stress than others.","Lischetzke, Tanja; Schemer, Lea; Glombiewski, Julia A.; In-Albon, Tina; Karbach, Julia; Könen, Tanja",Front Psychol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.684117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456798/,261

METHODS: We prospectively compared natural spring water gargle to combined oro-nasopharyngeal swab (ONPS) for the diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in paired clinical specimens (1005 ONPS and 1005 gargles) collected from 987 unique early symptomatic as well as asymptomatic individuals from the community. RESULTS: Using a direct RT-PCR method with the Allplex™ 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene), the clinical sensitivity of the gargle was 95.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.2 – 98.3%), similar to the sensitivity of the ONPS (93.8%; 95% CI, 88.2 – 97.3%), despite significantly lower viral RNA concentration in gargles, as reflected by higher cycle threshold values. No single specimen type detected all COVID-19 cases. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was stable in gargles at room temperature for at least 7 days.

In almost all cases a stable hairpin was predicted four to nine nucleotides downstream of the shifty heptanucleotide. More than half of the resulting hairpin loops give rise to potential pseudoknotting with sequences downstream of this hairpin. Especially in the case of the shifty heptanucleotides U UUA AAC and G GGA AAC, stable downstream pseudoknots are present.

As winter approaches in the northern hemisphere, it is important to characterize the differences in disease presentation and trajectory between COVID-19 patients and other patients with common respiratory illnesses. These differences can enhance knowledge of pathogenesis and help in guiding treatment. Methods: Data from electronic medical records were obtained from individuals admitted with respiratory illnesses to Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel, between October 1st, 2014 and September 1st, 2020. Four groups of patients were defined: COVID-19 (693), influenza (1,612), severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) (2,292) and Others (4,054). The variable analyzed include demographics (7), vital signs (8), lab tests (38), and comorbidities (15) from a total of 8,651 hospitalized adult patients. Statistical analysis was performed on biomarkers measured at admission and for their disease trajectory in the first 48 hours of hospitalization, and on comorobidity prevalence. Results: COVID-19 patients were overall younger in age and had higher body mass index, compared to influenza and SARI. Comorbidity burden was lower in the COVID-19 group compared to influenza and SARI. Severely- and moderately-ill COVID-19 patients older than 65 years of age suffered higher rate of in-hospital mortality compared to hospitalized influenza patients. At admission, white blood cells and neutrophils were lower among COVID-19 patients compared to influenza and SARI patients, while pulse rate and lymphoctye percentage were higher. Trajectories of variables during the first two days of hospitalization revealed that white blood count, neutrophils percentage and glucose in blood increased among COVID-19 patients, while decreasing among other patients. Conclusions: The intrinsic virulence of COVID-19 appeared higher than influenza.

DESIGN: Quasi-experimental cluster-control outbreak evaluation. METHODS: All patients and staff on the outbreak ward (case cluster), and randomly selected patients and staff on COVID-19 wards (positive control cluster) and a non-COVID-19 wards (negative control cluster) underwent reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. Hand hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) compliance, detection of environmental SARS-COV-2 RNA, patient behavior, and SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody prevalence were assessed. RESULTS: In total, 145 staff and 26 patients were exposed, resulting in 24 secondary cases. Also, 4 of 14 (29%) staff and 7 of 10 (70%) patients were asymptomatic or presymptomatic. There was no difference in mean cycle threshold between asymptomatic or presymptomatic versus symptomatic individuals. None of 32 randomly selected staff from the control wards tested positive. Environmental RNA detection levels were higher on the COVID-19 ward than on the negative control ward (OR, 19.98; 95% CI, 2.63–906.38; P < .001). RNA levels on the COVID-19 ward (where there were no outbreaks) and the outbreak ward were similar (OR, 2.38; P = .18). Mean monthly hand hygiene compliance, based on 20,146 observations (over preceding year), was lower on the outbreak ward (P < .006). Compared to both control wards, the proportion of staff with detectable antibodies was higher on the outbreak ward (OR, 3.78; 95% CI, 1.01–14.25; P = .008). CONCLUSION: Staff seroconversion was more likely during a short-term outbreak than from sustained duty on a COVID-19 ward. Environmental contamination and PPE use were similar on the outbreak and control wards. Patient noncompliance, decreased hand hygiene, and asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission were more frequent on the outbreak ward.","Lesho, Emil P.; Walsh, Edward E.; Gutowski, Jennifer; Reno, Lisa; Newhart, Donna; Yu, Stephanie; Bress, Jonathan; Bronstein, Melissa Z.",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1017/ice.2020.1437; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33427144/,261

Computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted consisting of 29 questions on the topic of lifestyle habits during the lockdown. The cohort comprised 51.5% women and 51% overweight or obese subjects and had a mean age of 50 ± 18 years. Of the respondents, 44.5% self-reported weight gain during the lockdown; of these, 58.0% were women, 69.9% had previous excess weight, 44.7% lived with a relative who also gained weight, and 73.5 experienced increased appetite. Further, an increased consumption of energy-dense products was found relative to respondents who did not gain weight (p ≤ 0.016 for all). Additionally, respondents were unaware that obesity is a poor prognostic factor for COVID-19 infection, lived in smaller flats, and had a lower level of education and lower monthly income. The factors independently associated with weight gain were female gender, previous overweight or obesity, lack of food care, increased appetite, and increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, alcoholic beverages, and snacks (p ≤ 0.023 for all).

An oscillating saw always generates noise, fine infectious dust particles, and the possibility of traumatic injuries, all of which can induce occupational hazard risks to autopsy workers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objectives: The first goal of this study was to explore the production of noise and bone dust emission, comparing an oscillating saw and a robotic autopsy saw during an autopsy. The second goal was to evaluate the performance of a new robotic autopsy method, used during skull opening. The third goal was to encourage mortuary workers to use robotic technology during the autopsy procedure to protect us away from occupational injuries as well as airborne infections. Materials and Methods: The experiments involved a comparison of noise levels and aerosol production during skull cutting between the oscillating saw and the robotic autopsy saw. Results: The results confirmed that noise production from the robotic autopsy saw was lower than the oscillating saw. However, the bone dust levels, produced by the robotic autopsy saw, were greater than the oscillating saw, but were not greater than the dust concentrations which were present before opening the skull. Conclusions: The use of a new robotic system might be an alternative choice for protecting against occupational damage among the healthcare workers.

Lymphocyte subsets and total monocyte and subsets counts were monitored as well as the expression of HLA-DR. For 5 patients, SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell polyfunctionality was assessed against Spike and Nucleoprotein SARS-CoV-2 peptides. Non-specific inflammation markers were increased in all patients. Median monocyte HLA-DR expression was below the 8,000 AB/C threshold defining acquired immunodepression. A V trend curve for lymphopenia, monocyte numbers, and HLA-DR expression was observed with a nadir between days 11-14 after the onset of symptoms. Intermediate CD14++CD16+ monocytes increased early with a reduction in classic CD14++CD16- monocytes. Polyfunctional SARS-Cov-2-specific CD4 T-cells were present and functional, whereas virus-specific CD8 T-cells were less frequent and not efficient.

We examined the feasibility of two different sensors (Opos and Bluetooth beacons) for collecting person-to-person contacts and hand hygiene in office-based workplaces. Opo is an interaction sensor that captures sensor-to-sensor interactions through ultrasonic frequencies, which correspond to face-to-face contacts between study participants. Opos were additionally used to measure hand hygiene events by affixing sensors to soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer dispensers. Bluetooth beacons were used in conjunction with a smartphone application and recorded proximity contacts between study participants. Participants in two office sites were followed for one-week in their workplace in March 2018. Contact patterns varied by time of day and day of the week. Face-to-face contacts were of shorter mean duration than proximity contacts. Supervisors had fewer proximity contacts but more face-to-face contacts than non-supervisors. Self-reported hand hygiene was substantively higher than sensor-collected hand hygiene events and duration of hand washing events was short (median: 9 seconds, range: 2.5–33 seconds). Given that office settings are key environments in which working age populations spend a large proportion of their time and interactions, a better characterization of empirical social networks and hand hygiene behaviors for workplace interactions are needed to mitigate outbreaks and prepare for pandemics. Our study demonstrates that implementing sensor technologies for tracking interactions and behaviors in offices is feasible and can provide new insights into real-world social networks and hygiene practices. We identified key social interactions, variability in hand hygiene, and differences in interactions by workplace roles. High-resolution network data will be essential for identifying the most effective ways to mitigate infectious disease transmission and develop pandemic preparedness plans for the workplace setting.","Zivich, Paul N.; Huang, Will; Walsh, Ali; Dutta, Prabal; Eisenberg, Marisa; Aiello, Allison E.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33465139/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243358,261

To investigate the underlining mechanism, we isolated one strain of SARS- CoV-2 (ZJ01) in mild COVID-19 patient and found the existence of 35 specific gene mutation by gene alignment. Further phylogenetic analysis and RSCU heat map results suggested that ZJ01 may be a potential evolutionary branch of SARS-CoV-2. We classified 54 strains of viruses worldwide (C/T type) based on the base (C or T) at positions 8824 and 28247. ZJ01 were both T at these two sites, becoming the only TT type currently identified in the world. The prediction of Furin cleavage site (FCS) and the sequence alignment of virus family indicated that FCS may be an important site of coronavirus evolution. ZJ01 had mutations near FCS (F1-2), which caused changes in the structure and the electrostatic distribution of the S protein surface, further affecting the binding capacity of Furin. Single cell sequencing and ACE2-Furin co-expression results confirmed that Furin level was higher in the whole body, especially in glands, liver, kidney and colon while FCS may help SARS-CoV-2 infect these organs. The evolutionary pattern of SARS-CoV-2 towards FCS formation may result in its clinical symptom becoming closer to HKU-1 and OC43 (the source of FCS sequence-PRRA) caused influenza, further showing potential in differentiating into mild COVID-19 subtypes.","Xi, Jin; Xu, Kangli; Jiang, Penglei; Lian, Jiangshan; Hao, Shaorui; Jia, Hongyu; Yao, Hangping; Zhang, Yimin; Zheng, Ruoheng; Chen, Dong; Yao, Jinmei; Hu, Jianhua; Gao, Jianguo; Shen, Jian; Wen, Liang; Ren, Yue; Yu, Guodong; Wang, Xiaoyan; Lu, Yingfeng; Yu, Xiaopeng; Yu, Liang; Xiang, Dairong; Zheng, Lin; Wu, Nanping; Lu, Xiangyun; Cheng, Linfang; Liu, Fumin; Wu, Haibo; Jin, Changzhong; Yang, Xiaofeng; Qian, Pengxu; Qiu, Yunqing; Sheng, Jifang; Liang, Tingbo; Li, Lanjuan; Yang, Yida",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.10.20033944,261

Due to the ease of transmission, early prevention measures are proved to be fundamental to control the pandemic and, hence, the saturation of the health systems. Given the difficulty of obtaining characteristics of these systems of different countries and regions, it is necessary to define indicators based on basic information that enable the assessment of the evolution of the impact of a disease in a health system along with fair comparisons among different ones. This present paper introduces the Health Sufficiency Indicator ([Formula: see text]), in its accumulated and daily versions. This indicator measures the additional pressure that a health care system has to deal with due to a pandemic. Hence, it allows to evaluate the capacity of a health system to give response to the corresponding needs arising from a pandemic and to compare the evolution of the disease among different regions. In addition, the Potential Occupancy Ratio ([Formula: see text]) in both its hospital ward bed and ICU bed versions is here introduced to asses the impact of the pandemic in the capacity of hospitals.

The confinement of the population and the outbreak impact on health care systems disrupted the routine care for non COVID-19 patients. Particular challenges have been faced for services working with neurodevelopmental disabilities and pediatric neurological disorders. We present the adaptation of our Child Neurology and Developmental Neuropsychology Service at the Developmental Neurology Unit, which is responsible for cognitive and behavioral assessment of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and neurological diseases, on an inpatient/outpatient basis, to the epidemic outbreak. In particular, we describe the introduction of telehealth in clinical practice and provide qualitative and quantitative data regarding the feasibility of the telemedicine protocol and the level of satisfaction experienced by families. OUTCOMES: Patients admitted on an inpatient basis are limited to non-deferrable cases; all patients do pre-admission screening to exclude COVID-19 infection. Child neurologists and psychologists have switched the out-patient visits to telemedicine sessions, despite they had little to no previous experience in telemedicine. Families’ response to the proposal of video-sessions has been positive with 93% of families accepting it, preparing appropriate devices and conditions to participate at home. Main barriers to tele-sessions access were socio-economic and linguistic disadvantage, together with familiar health issues. The Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire revealed high level of agreementi between expected care and actual care received by patients and caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of our Service confirms the importance of an inclusive response to emergency with respect to people with disabilities, ensuring the quality and continuity of care in times of population quarantine. Our experience could be useful worldwide to evaluate the feasibility of the Italian emergency response applied to the assistance of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities.","Taddei, Matilde; Bulgheroni, Sara",Res Dev Disabil,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891422220302183; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007533/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422220302183?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103786,261

The primary aim was to establish if follow-up at one week in place of the 72-hour British Orthopaedic Association Standards for Trauma & Orthopaedics (BOAST) guidance was safe following manipulation under anaesthetic. A parallel adaptation during lockdown was the non-expectation of Bier’s block. The secondary aim was to compare clinical outcomes with respect to block type. METHODS: Overall, 90 patients were assessed in a cross-sectional cohort study using a mixed, retrospective-prospective approach. Consecutive sampling of 30 patients pre-lockdown (P1), 30 during lockdown (P2), and 30 during post-lockdown (P3) was applied. Type of block, operative status, follow-up, and complications were extracted. Primary endpoints were early complications (≤ one week). Secondary endpoints were later complications including malunion, delayed union or osteotomy. RESULTS: In P1, 86.6% of patients were seen between days one to three, 26.7% in P2, and 56.7% in P3. There were no documented complications from days one to three. Operative rate was 35.5%, which did not vary significantly (p= 0.712). Primary endpoints occurred between day four to seven, and included one patient each period treated for plaster cast pain. Secondary endpoints in P1 included delayed union (one patient). During P2, this included malunion (one patient), a pressure sore (one patient) and ulnar cutaneous nerve symptoms (two patients). In P3, malunion was identified in one patient. Mean follow-up was six months (4 to 9) with union rate 96%. Change in block practice varied significantly (p =＜0.05). The risk ratio of complications using regional block (Bier’s) over haematoma block was 0.65. CONCLUSION: Follow-up adaptations during lockdown did not adversely affect patient outcomes. Regional anaesthesia is gold standard for manipulation of displaced distal radial fractures.

669613,Acute Blindness as a Complication of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2,2021-08-03,"This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of data pre-processing and word embedding techniques in the context of Arabic document classification in the domain of health-related communication on social media. We evaluate 26 text pre-processings applied to Arabic tweets within the process of training a classifier to identify health-related tweets. For this task we use the (traditional) machine learning classifiers KNN, SVM, Multinomial NB and Logistic Regression. Furthermore, we report experimental results with the deep learning architectures BLSTM and CNN for the same text classification problem. Since word embeddings are more typically used as the input layer in deep networks, in the deep learning experiments we evaluate several state-of-the-art pre-trained word embeddings with the same text pre-processing applied. To achieve these goals, we use two data sets: one for both training and testing, and another for testing the generality of our models only. Our results point to the conclusion that only four out of the 26 pre-processings improve the classification accuracy significantly. For the first data set of Arabic tweets, we found that Mazajak CBOW pre-trained word embeddings as the input to a BLSTM deep network led to the most accurate classifier with F(1) score of 89.7%. For the second data set, Mazajak Skip-Gram pre-trained word embeddings as the input to BLSTM led to the most accurate model with F(1) score of 75.2% and accuracy of 90.7% compared to F(1) score of 90.8% achieved by Mazajak CBOW for the same architecture but with lower accuracy of 70.89%. Our results also show that the performance of the best of the traditional classifier we trained is comparable to the deep learning methods on the first dataset, but significantly worse on the second dataset.","Albalawi, Yahya; Buckley, Jim; Nikolov, Nikola S.",J Big Data,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40537-021-00488-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34249602/,261

Although scholars agree that organizational health literacy contributes to health promotion and risk prevention via patient empowerment, literature is not consistent in depicting the interplay between organizational health literacy and preventive medicine. The article intends to shed light into this issue, summarizing current knowledge about this topic and advancing avenues for further development. A narrative literature review was performed through a systematic search on PubMed(®), Scopus(®), and Web of Science(™). The review focused on 50 relevant contributions. Organizational health literacy triggers the transition towards a patient-centered approach to care. It complements individual health literacy, enabling patients to actively participate in health promotion and risk prevention as co-producers of health services and co-creators of value. However, many obstacles – including lack of time and limited resources available – prevent the transition towards health literate health care organizations. Two initiatives are required to overcome extant barriers. On the one hand, a health literate workforce should be prepared to increase the institutional ability of health care organizations to empower and engage patients in health co-creation. On the other hand, increased efforts should be made to assess organizational health literacy and to make its contribution to preventive medicine explicit.","Palumbo, Rocco",Yale J Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33795988/,261

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase; data published by Johns Hopkins University; and Chinese databases CNKI, Wanfang, and Chongqing Weipu. Reports on chest CT imaging features of children with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to August 10, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively and a meta-analysis carried out using Stata12.0 software. Results: Thirty-seven articles (1747 children) were included in this study. The overall rate of abnormal lung CT findings was 63.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 55.8-70.6%), with a rate of 61.0% (95% CI: 50.8-71.2%) in China and 67.8% (95% CI: 57.1-78.4%) in the rest of the world in the subgroup analysis. The incidence of ground-glass opacities was 39.5% (95% CI: 30.7-48.3%), multiple lung lobe lesions 65.1% (95% CI: 55.1-67.9%), and bilateral lung lesions 61.5% (95% CI: 58.8-72.2%). Other imaging features included nodules (25.7%), patchy shadows (36.8%), halo sign (24.8%), consolidation (24.1%), air bronchogram signs (11.2%), cord-like shadows (9.7%), crazy-paving pattern (6.1%), and pleural effusion (9.1%). Two articles reported three cases of white lung, another reported two cases of pneumothorax, and another one case of bullae. CONCLUSION: The lung CT results of children with COVID-19 are usually normal or slightly atypica, with a low sensitivity and specificity compared with that in adults. The lung lesions of COVID-19 pediatric patients mostly involve both lungs or multiple lobes, and the common manifestations are patchy shadows, ground-glass opacities, consolidation, partial air bronchogram signs, nodules, and halo signs; white lung, pleural effusion, and paving stone signs are rare. CLINICAL IMPACT: Therefore, chest CT has limited value as a screening tool for children with COVID-19 and can only be used as an auxiliary assessment tool.","Wang, J.-G.; Mo, Y.-F.; Su, Y.-h.; Wang, L.-c.; Liu, G.-b.; Li, M.; Qin, Q.-q.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.02.20187187v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.02.20187187,261
674738,Plausibility of therapeutic effects of Rho kinase inhibitors against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19),2020-04-10,"Abstract Human coronaviruses are important human pathogens and have also been implicated in multiple sclerosis. To further understand the molecular biology of human coronavirus 229E (HCV-229E), molecular cloning and sequence analysis of the viral RNA have been initiated. Following established protocols, the 3′-terminal 1732 nucleotides of the genome were sequenced. A large open reading frame encodes a 389 amino acid protein of 43,366 Da, which is presumably the nucleocapsid protein. The predicted protein is similar in size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence to the nucleocapsid proteins of other coronaviruses. This is especially evident when the sequence is compared with that of the antigenically related porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), with which a region of 46% amino acid sequence homology was found. Hydropathy profiles revealed the existence of several conserved domains which could have functional significance. An intergenic consensus sequence precedes the 5′-end of the proposed nucleocapsid protein gene. The consensus sequence is present in other coronaviruses and has been proposed as the site of binding of the leader sequence for mRNA transcriptional start. This region was also examined by primer extension analysis of mRNAs, which identified a 60-nucleotide leader sequence. The 3′-noncoding region of the genome contains an 11-nucleotide sequence, which is relatively conserved throughout the Coronavirus family and lends support to the theory that this region is important for the replication of negative-strand RNA.","Schreiber, Steven S.; Kamahora, Toshio; Lai, Michael M.C.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0042682289900500; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0042682289900500; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2922924/,261
674778,Phages bearing affinity peptides to severe acute respiratory syndromes-associated coronavirus differentiate this virus from other viruses,2013-05-09,"Building on Froebelian principles that highlight the importance of family and community, this study explored the importance of collaboration and communication as part of a two-way dialogue. The aim was to identify the key characteristics of a model that would encourage interest and commitment to partnerships from both parents and practitioners. The idea of such partnerships has a solid theoretical background and is supported both rhetorically and by legislation by the Department of Education. However, research has shown that practice often falls short of the ideal, due to reasons such as the managerial discourse that constructs parents as potential consumers and the challenges faced when performance is prioritised over creativity. As part of the study, we employed a mixed methods approach and encouraged parents and practitioners to work together by participating at two sessions with families and children. The sessions provided parents and practitioners with space and time to explore the issue of working in ‘partnership’. After careful consideration of ethical issues, data were collected using pre and post-session questionnaires with all participants, as well as face to face interviews with some of them. Findings indicate that both parties need to invest time and recognise that ‘effective partnership’ is a two way process which requires engagement and dialogue to be able to develop meaningful relationships of trust. The findings were used to develop the ‘CAFE' partnership model which incorporates those elements considered important to facilitate the development of partnerships between practitioners and parents. The CAFE model addresses the gap in the literature in terms of unpicking the key features of a partnership approach, as captured through the lived experience of both parents and practitioners. It also contributes to deepening the understanding of the applications of Froebelian principles in contemporary contexts and the ways in which they can encourage high quality early childhood development and education. Future research should explore how this model could be used to evaluate existing practice and guide the development of current partnership policies and approaches.","Kambouri, Maria; Wilson, Teresa; Pieridou, Myria; Quinn, Suzanne Flannery; Liu, Jie",Early Child Educ J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33897250/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10643-021-01181-6,261
675639,Why Do We Need Serological Tests for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Diagnosis?,2020-12-02,"OBJECTIVES: In the current study, we aimed to explore the experiences and attitudes among healthcare professionals as they transitioned from their familiar disciplines to respiratory medicine, intensive care or other departments during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic. BACKGROUND: In preparation for the increasing number of patients suspected of having or who would be severely ill from COVID‐19, a major reconstruction of the Danish Healthcare System was initiated. The capacity of the healthcare system to respond to the unprecedented situation was dependent on healthcare professionals’ willingness and ability to engage in these new circumstances. For some, this may have resulted in uncertainty, anxiety and fear. DESIGN: The study was a descriptive study using semi‐structured focus group interviews. Healthcare professionals (n = 62) from seven departments were included, and 11 focus group interviews were conducted. The focus group interviews took place during June 2020. Analyses was conducted using thematic analysis. The current study was reported using the consolidated criteria for reporting Qualitative research (COREQ). RESULTS: Healthcare professionals experiences was described by five themes: 1) Voluntary involvement, 2) Changes within the organisation, 3) Risks, 4) Professional identity and 5) Personal investment. Common to all five themes was the feeling of being on a pendulum from a meaningful experience to an experience of mental overload, when situations and decisions no longer seemed to be worthwhile. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals experienced a pendulum between a meaningful experience and one of mental overload during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The swinging was conditioned by the prevailing context and was unavoidable. Relevance to clinical practice. To balance the continuous pendulum swing, leaders must consider involvement, and to be supportive and appreciative in their leader style. This is consistent with a person‐centred leadership that facilitates a well‐adjusted work‐life balance and may help prevent mental overload developing into burnout.","Rosted, Elizabeth; Thomsen, Thora Grothe; Krogsgaard, Marianne; Busk, Henriette; Geisler, Anja; Thestrup Hansen, Stine; Kjerholt, Mette; Mortensen, Camilla Becker; Thomsen, Trine Hørmann; Beck, Malene; Petersen, Marian",J Clin Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34309109/,261

Towards this, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead compartmental models were fitted to COVID-19 data from all Nigerian states in this study, from which four parameters were estimated per state. A density-based clustering method was used to identify states with similar outbreak dynamics, and the stage of the outbreak determined per state. Subsequently, outbreak dynamics were correlated with absolute humidity, temperature, population density and distance to the international passenger travel gateways in the country. The models revealed that while the outbreak is still increasing nationally, outbreaks in at least 12 states have peaked. A total of at least 519,672 confirmed cases were predicted by January 2021, with a worst case scenario of at least 14,785,457. Weak positive correlations were found between COVID-19 spread and absolute humidity (Pearson’s Coefficient = 0.136, p [Formula: see text] 0.05) and temperature (Pearson’s Coefficient = 0.021, p [Formula: see text] 0.05). While many studies have established links between temperature and humidity and COVID-19 spread, the correlation has most usually been negative where it exists. The findings in this study of possible positive correlation is in line with a a number of previous studies showing such unexpected correlations in the tropics or subtropics.

Identifying changes in viral genomes provides key insights into viral diversity, how viruses spread within populations, and viral strategies for evasion of host immune systems. Here we report twenty-five SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences collected from some of the first COVID-19 cases in eastern Ontario, Canada (March 18-30, 2020). The reported genomes belong to the S-clade (n=2) and G-clade (n=23) of SARS-CoV-2 and contain 45 polymorphic sites including one shared missense and three unique synonymous variants in the gene encoding the spike protein. A phylogenetic analysis enabled the tracing of viral origin and potential transmission into and within Canada. There may be as many as sixteen unique infection events represented in these samples, including at least three that were likely introduced from Europe and seven from the USA. In addition, four separate genomes are each shared by multiple patients, suggesting a common origin or community spread even during this early stage of infection. These results demonstrate how molecular epidemiology and evolutionary phylogenetics can help local health units track origins and vectors of spread for emerging diseases like SARS-CoV-2. Earlier detection and screening in this way could improve the effectiveness of regional public health interventions to prevent future pandemics.","Sjaarda, Calvin P; Rustom, Nazneen; Huang, David; Perez-Patrigeon, Santiago; Hudson, Melissa L; Wong, Henry; Guan, T Hugh; Ayub, Muhammad; Soares, Claudio N; Colautti, Robert I; Evans, Gerald A; Sheth, Prameet M",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.25.171744,261

Natural infection by ECoV has been reported in adult horses worldwide, whereas experimental infection has only been reported in juvenile horses. An experimental infection model is needed to study the clinical presentation, laboratory abnormalities, and pathophysiological changes associated with ECoV. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical, hematologic, molecular, and serological features of adult horses experimentally infected with ECoV. ANIMALS: Eight adult horses. METHODS: Four horses were intragastrically infected with fecal material containing 10(9) genome equivalents of ECoV. Four additional horses were exposed daily to the feces from the experimentally‐infected horses. Monitoring included physical examinations, as well as daily nasal swab, whole blood, and fecal collection for molecular detection of ECoV. Blood was collected every other day for hematologic analysis and weekly for serologic analysis. RESULTS: All 8 horses shed ECoV in feces. Six of the 8 horses (75%) exhibited mild, clinical disease with soft, formed manure; 1 horse exhibited transient pyrexia. All horses maintained total white cell counts within normal limits, but 3 horses developed transient lymphopenia. No statistically significant differences (P = .20) were observed in quantity of fecal shedding of ECoV between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Experimental infection of adult horses with ECoV was associated with mild and self‐limiting clinical signs, transient lymphopenia, and fecal shedding of ECoV, which mimics natural infection. No differences between experimentally‐infected horses and horses exposed to ECoV‐containing feces were identified. Results of our study support a fecal‐oral route of transmission.","Schaefer, Emily; Harms, Corey; Viner, Molly; Barnum, Samantha; Pusterla, Nicola",J Vet Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15318; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30353949/,261

How far are developing countries like India (with wide socioeconomic and cultural diversity) geared up for this challenge remains unexplored. At this critical juncture, we aim to evaluate if online teaching methods are as feasible, acceptable, and effective as in-class teaching for medical/nursing students. Objectives The questionnaire captured: (1) practicability/feasibility of online classes, (2) health issues from online classes, (3) current methods for e-teaching, and (4) student attitudes and preferences. Design Cross-sectional Survey Settings Population-based study in India Participants Nursing and medical undergraduate students (I-IV year) Methodology The online questionnaire was distributed to 200 medical and nursing colleges across India. Categorical variables were analyzed using chi-square tests. Binary logistic regression was done to analyze factors predicting health issues in students. p<0.05 was considered significant. Results Overall, 1541 medical and 684 nursing students completed the survey from 156 cities. The availability of laptop (p<0.0001), Wi-Fi (p<0.0001), dedicated room (p<0.0001), and computer proficiency was more in students of affluent families and those from cities (p<0.0001).

Power-point presentation was the most widely (80%) used method of teaching. Only 30% got adequate time to interact with teachers. Only 20.4% felt e-learning can replace conventional teaching. Students preferred: 3-6 classes/day, each class<40 minutes, 10-20 minutes break between classes and interactive sessions. Conclusion There is a need to improve information and communication infrastructure to enhance feasibility of e-learning for nursing/ medical students in India.

WMSD comes second in the source of disability in both developed and developing countries. The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence, patterns, and risk factors of musculoskeletal pain disorders among teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among school teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. A validated online Arabic questionnaire was distributed among teachers living in the Qassim region through multiple social networking applications like Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram. The questionnaire consisted of Socio-demographic characteristics, the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire, and a modified version of the Örebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening questionnaire. Results A total of 503 school teachers were recruited. The proportion of musculoskeletal pain was 91%, and the most common site of pain was back (74.4%), followed by the shoulder (57.5%) and leg (51.5%). The proportion of disabling pain was (80.1%) while the rest was non-disabling pain (19.9%). In the multiple regression model, the predictors of increased disabling pain were back pain, leg pain, neck pain, and those with 51-70 kg weight. In comparison, the predictors of decreased disabling pain were having more than 7 hours of sleep and those with 20-30 classes per week. Conclusion Musculoskeletal pain disorders were widely prevalent among school teachers in the Qassim region, Saudi Arabia. Most teachers considered pain as disabling, which negatively affected their attendance. The back, shoulder, and neck were the most painful sites associated with disabling pain.","Aldukhayel, Abdulrhman; Almeathem, Fatimah K; Aldughayyim, Aram A; Almeshal, Razan A; Almeshal, Emtenan A; Alsaud, Jolan S; Albaltan, Reema I",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595078/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17510,261

680360,Review of Viral Testing (Polymerase Chain Reaction) and Antibody/Serology Testing for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 for the Intensivist,2020-06-15,"BACKGROUND: Medical professionals must maintain their health to provide quality medical care to patients safely. However, the health-related quality of life of medical professionals is a complex issue that currently lacks a standardized evaluation approach. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify their perceptions of the health-related quality of life of medical professionals and explore ways to measure their quality of life as accurately. METHODS: This study explored the subjective health status and well-being of Korean medical professionals by conducting three focus group discussions (FGDs) with 12 physicians and 6 nurses (November to December 2019). In the FGD, we elicited participants' opinions on existing health-related quality of life measurement tools. Also, we analyzed transcribed data through content analysis. RESULTS: Participants in this study noted the ambiguity in the current definitions of health provided by the World Health Organization. They shared various problems of their health, mainly concerning fatigue and sleep disorders due to their work pattern. Also, participants shared anxiety, burden, and fear of negative consequences due to the complexity of their work. Participants voiced the necessity of a questionnaire on health-related quality of life that reflects the working lives of medical professionals. CONCLUSION: Medical professionals in Korea were mainly criticizing about health-related quality of life problems caused by their work characteristics. The results of this study will provide valuable information for future health-related quality of life surveys targeting medical professionals in Korea, and also help to determine the method for monitoring the health-related quality of life for health professionals. In addition, the aspects and items identified by medical professionals as important for their health-related quality of life may be used as a basis for developing a new health-related quality of life measurement tools for medical professionals.","Pyo, Jeehee; Ock, Minsu; Park, Bohyun; Kim, Nam-eun; Choi, Eun Jeong; Park, Hyesook; Ahn, Hyeong Sik",J Korean Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33463094/,261
682648,Molecular Epidemiology of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome–Associated Coronavirus Infections in Taiwan,2005-05-01,"Avian coronaviruses, including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), are important respiratory pathogens of poultry. The heavily glycosylated IBV spike protein is responsible for binding to host tissues. Glycosylation sites in the spike protein are highly conserved across viral genotypes, suggesting an important role for this modification in the virus life cycle. Here, we analyzed the N-glycosylation of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of IBV strain M41 spike protein and assessed the role of this modification in host receptor binding. Ten single Asn–to–Ala substitutions at the predicted N-glycosylation sites of the M41–RBD were evaluated along with two control Val–to–Ala substitutions. CD analysis revealed that the secondary structure of all variants was retained compared with the unmodified M41–RBD construct. Six of the 10 glycosylation variants lost binding to chicken trachea tissue and an ELISA-presented α2,3-linked sialic acid oligosaccharide ligand. LC/MS(E) glycomics analysis revealed that glycosylation sites have specific proportions of N-glycan subtypes. Overall, the glycosylation patterns of most variant RBDs were highly similar to those of the unmodified M41–RBD construct. In silico docking experiments with the recently published cryo-EM structure of the M41 IBV spike protein and our glycosylation results revealed a potential ligand receptor site that is ringed by four glycosylation sites that dramatically impact ligand binding. Combined with the results of previous array studies, the glycosylation and mutational analyses presented here suggest a unique glycosylation-dependent binding modality for the M41 spike protein.","Parsons, Lisa M.; Bouwman, Kim M.; Azurmendi, Hugo; de Vries, Robert P.; Cipollo, John F.; Verheije, Monique H.",Journal of Biological Chemistry,http://www.jbc.org/content/294/19/7797.full.pdf; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0021925820354727; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021925820354727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30902814/; https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.007532,261

The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COronaVIrus Disease-19 (COVID-19). The main purpose of this review is to provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2. Methods The authors searched the MEDLINE database for clinical studies related to virus characteristics, pathogenesis, diagnosis, transmission mechanisms, and treatment options. Results As of January 27, 2021, the number of infected individuals and deaths associated with COVID-19 are approximately 100 million and 2 million worldwide, respectively. The manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, and the severity is affected by age and preexisting medical conditions. Children and adolescents are usually asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. The elderly, in comparison, may experience severe illness and have a disproportionally elevated mortality. Among those who survive, some may experience enduring deficits. The viral load is particularly elevated in saliva and oropharynx, which constitute potential sources of infection. The diagnosis of the disease may be confounded by factors related to the replicating cycle of the virus, viral load, and sensitivity of the diagnostic method utilized. At present, COVID-19 has no cure but can be prevented. Its treatment is based on supportive care along with antiviral medications and monoclonal antibodies. In severe cases with multi-organ involvement, mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and hemodynamic support may be necessary. Conclusions COVID-19 is a transmittable disease with a variable course. A substantial number of patients, particularly children, remain asymptomatic. Significant advances were done in the development of new treatments. However, the mortality in vulnerable populations remains elevated.","Lamberghini, Flavia; Testai, Fernando D.",J Am Dent Assoc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0002817721000738; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002817721000738?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33926623/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.adaj.2021.01.014,261

In this paper, we use a stochastic epidemic SIRC model, with cross-immune class and time-delay in transmission terms, for the spread of COVID-19. We analyze the model and prove the existence and uniqueness of positive global solution. We deduce the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] for the stochastic model which is smaller than [Formula: see text] of the corresponding deterministic model. Sufficient conditions that guarantee the existence of a unique ergodic stationary distribution, using the stochastic Lyapunov function, and conditions for the extinction of the disease are obtained. Our findings show that white noise plays an important part in controlling the spread of the disease; When the white noise is relatively large, the infectious diseases will become extinct; Re-infection and periodic outbreaks can occur due to the existence of feedback time-delay (or memory) in the transmission terms.","Rihan, F.

Recently, viral mutants termed variants of concern (VOC) which may escape host immunity have emerged. The efficacy of spike encoding mRNA vaccines (CVnCoV and CV2CoV) against the ancestral strain and the VOC B.1.351 was tested in a K18-hACE2 transgenic mouse model. Naive mice and mice immunized with a formalin-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparation were used as controls. mRNA-immunized mice develop elevated SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific antibody and neutralization titers which are readily detectable, but significantly reduced against VOC B.1.351. The mRNA vaccines fully protect from disease and mortality caused by either viral strain. SARS-CoV-2 remains undetected in swabs, lung, or brain in these groups. Despite lower neutralizing antibody titers compared to the ancestral strain BavPat1, CVnCoV and CV2CoV show complete disease protection against the novel VOC B.1.351 in our studies.","Hoffmann, Donata; Corleis, Björn; Rauch, Susanne; Roth, Nicole; Mühe, Janine; Halwe, Nico Joel; Ulrich, Lorenz; Fricke, Charlie; Schön, Jacob; Kraft, Anna; Breithaupt, Angele; Wernike, Kerstin; Michelitsch, Anna; Sick, Franziska; Wylezich, Claudia; Hoffmann, Bernd; Thran, Moritz; Thess, Andreas; Mueller, Stefan O.; Mettenleiter, Thomas C.; Petsch, Benjamin; Dorhoi, Anca; Beer, Martin",Nat Commun,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24339-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193869/,261
