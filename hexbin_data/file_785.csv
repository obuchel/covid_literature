40713,De ervaren steun van ouderen tijdens de lockdown,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND: The excessive amount of information (infodemic) about SARS-COV2 is a global challenge for healthcare authorities in tackling misinformation. Aim of the study was to investigate SARS-COV2 global and Italian web search amount made through a reliable information source during 2019-20 SARS-COV2 epidemic. METHODS: From December 15th, 2019 to February 23rd, 2020, we used Google Trends to analyze global changes in the volume of searches about “Coronavirus” in relation to reliable sources: “World Health Organization”, “WHO” and the Italian equivalents of “Ministry of Health” and “National Institute of Health”. Primary searches and associated queries (AQs) were analyzed by nation and Italian Region. RESULTS: Global interest on “Coronavirus” progressively rose from mid-January, with 2 peaks on days 28th and 31st, fell on February 20th and rose again until day 23rd. “WHO” searches fluctuated with no clear pattern but increased on January 26th and February 3rd. 'WHO' term was among the most frequent “Coronavirus” AQs and viceversa. Singapore, Italy and New Zealand were the most interested nations in “Coronavirus”, while China was at first place in “Coronavirus+WHO” searches. In Italy from January 21st interest in “Coronavirus” gradually increased, with peaks on days 28th and 31st and a higher peak on February 21st. The other terms showed a fluctuating trend, with peaks on January 31st for “WHO” and “Ministry of Health” and on February 21st for all of them. “Coronavirus” was most frequently AQ to “Italy” and “China”, while AQs for the other terms were “Coronavirus” and “WHO official website”. The most interested Italian Regions for “Coronavirus” and “Coronavirus+WHO” were Lazio and Friuli Venezia-Giulia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Interest in SARS-COV2 globally increased during the considered period, especially within most affected areas. The associations between terms thus highlighted seems to confirm that the general population relies on trustworthy information sources. KEY MESSAGES: Infodemic can be at the same time a danger and an opportunity during global and local health emergencies. Health systems should take advantage of current search flow in order to foster reliable information sharing.","Antinolfi, F; Brunelli, L; Cocconi, R; Brusaferro, S",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543573/,785
44344,Une Europe unie face à la deuxième vague,2021-01-07,"Unlike the successful immunization of native H. contortus antigens that contributed to the realization of the first commercial vaccine Barbervax, not many studies revealed the encouraging protective efficacies of recombinant H. contortus antigens in laboratory trials or under field conditions. In our preliminary study, H. contortus α/β-hydrolase domain protein (HcABHD) was demonstrated to be an immunomodulatory excretory–secretory (ES) protein that interacts with goat T cells. We herein evaluated the protective capacities of two HcABHD preparations, recombinant HcABHD (rHcABHD) antigen and anti-rHcABHD IgG, against H. contortus challenge via active and passive immunization trials, respectively. Parasitological parameter, antibody responses, hematological pathology and cytokine profiling in unchallenged and challenged goats were monitored and determined throughout both trials. Subcutaneous administration of rHcABHD with Freund adjuvants elicited protective immune responses in challenged goats, diminishing cumulative fecal egg counts (FEC) and total worm burden by 54.0% and 74.2%, respectively, whereas passive immunization with anti-rHcABHD IgG conferred substantial protection to challenged goats by generating a 51.5% reduction of cumulative FEC and a 73.8% reduction of total worm burden. Additionally, comparable changes of mucosal IgA levels, circulating IgG levels, hemoglobin levels, and serum interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-17A levels were observed in rHcABHD protein/anti-rHcABHD IgG immunized goats in both trials. Taken together, the recombinant version of HcABHD might have further application under field conditions in protecting goats against H. contortus infection, and the integrated immunological pipeline of ES antigen identification, screening and characterization may provide new clues for further development of recombinant subunit vaccines to control H. contortus.","Lu, Mingmin; Tian, Xiaowei; Zhang, Yang; Wang, Wenjuan; Tian, Ai-Ling; Aimulajiang, Kalibixiati; Liu, Lianrui; Li, Charles; Yan, Ruofeng; Xu, Lixin; Song, Xiaokai; Li, Xiangrui",Vet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7786147/,785
88995,"Clinical Characteristics of 138 Hospitalized Patients With 2019 Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia in Wuhan, China.",2020-02-07,"Countries worldwide are making wide-ranging attempts to stymie the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and most of their efforts depend on the financial, structural, and social resources available. Given the increase in documented cases of COVID-19 in Puerto Rico, the extension of an aggressive and restrictive quarantine has been the correct step to slow down the potential contagion. Nevertheless, in this article, we discuss additional concrete actions that should be considered. This unprecedented scenario provides us the opportunity to rethink our limited resources based on a socioecological perspective, with the aim of creating efficiency and reducing the inequities that could accompany the pandemic.

From three wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), 28 treated and untreated wastewater composite samples were collected from April 4 to May 2, 2020. In this study, polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000) was used through one-step real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for identification of RNA viruses. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was elicited from wastewater composite samples in all inlet samples taken from the three above mentioned cities. The results of outlet samples were as follows: 1) Results from Qom and East Anzali outlets showed no trace of SARS-CoV-2 RNA despite the difference in treatment disinfection method used (chlorine vs. ultraviolet (UV) disinfection). 2. In Tehran, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of the outlet samples taken from the modules disinfected by UV. Out of the four samples taken from the modules disinfected by chlorine, two were positive for the SARS-CoV-2 RNA which could have been caused by deficiencies in operation and maintenance. It can be concluded that meeting the standards of operation and maintenance (O&M) in WWTPs can considerably ensure that wastewater does not act as one of the roots of transmission for the disease.","Nasseri, Simin; Yavarian, Jila; Baghani, Abbas Norouzian; Azad, Talat Mokhtari; Nejati, Ahmad; Nabizadeh, Ramin; Hadi, Mahdi; Jandaghi, Nazanin Zahra Shafiei; Vakili, Behnam; Vaghefi, Seyed Koushyar Azam; Baghban, Mahtab; Yousefi, Somayeh; Nazmara, Shahrokh; Alimohammadi, Mahmood",J Environ Health Sci Eng,,785

Based on recent laboratory and epidemiological studies, a growing list of mutations in the virus has the potential to enhance its transmission or help it evade the immune response. To further compound the problems, there are considerable challenges to the availability of effective, affordable, safe vaccines on a mass scale. These impediments have led some to explore additional options available in traditional medicines, especially immune-boosting natural products. Saffron has been used for centuries to treat fever, bronchitis, cold and other immune, respiratory disorders. Herein, we discuss the potential role of saffron during and after COVID-19 infection, focusing on immunomodulation, respiratory, renal, and cardiovascular functions. As a nutraceutical or drug supplement, it can alleviate the magnitude of COVID-19 symptoms in patients. The anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and other medicinal properties attributed to saffron bioactive compounds can help in both pre-and post- infection management strategies. The abnormalities associated with COVID-19 survivors include anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Saffron can help manage these post-hospitalization abnormalities (sub-acute and chronic) too, owing to its anti-depressant property. It can help common people boost immunity and manage depression, stress and anxiety caused due to prolonged lockdown, isolation or quarantine.","Husaini, Amjad M; Jan, Khan Nadiya; Wani, Gowher A",Heliyon,,785

NHS England have proposed the formation of a Pan-London Emergency Cardiac surgery (PLECS) service to provide urgent and emergency cardiac surgery for the whole of London. In this initial report, we outline our experience of setting up and delivering a pan-regional service for the delivery of urgent and emergency cardiac surgery with a focus on maintaining a COVID-free in-hospital environment. In doing so, we hope that other regions can use this as a starting point in developing their own region-specific pathways if the spread of coronavirus necessitates similar measures be put in place across the United Kingdom.","Hussain, Azhar; Balmforth, Damian; Yates, Martin; Lopez-Marco, Ana; Rathwell, Claire; Lambourne, Jonathan; Roberts, Neil; Lall, Kulvinder; Edmondson, Stephen",J Card Surg,,785

For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity based on satellite data with fixed temporal frequency (e.g., 3 h). However, to achieve more timely (under 30 min) and accurate TC intensity estimates, a deep learning model is demanded to handle temporally-heterogeneous satellite observations. Specifically, infrared (IR1) and water vapor (WV) images are available under every 15 minutes, while passive microwave rain rate (PMW) is available for about every 3 hours. Meanwhile, the visible (VIS) channel is severely affected by noise and sunlight intensity, making it difficult to be utilized. Therefore, we propose a novel framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) with CNN. The model utilizes all data, including VIS and PMW information, during the training phase and eventually uses only the high-frequent IR1 and WV data for providing intensity estimates during the predicting phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GAN-CNN framework achieves comparable precision to the state-of-the-art models, while possessing the capability of increasing the maximum estimation frequency from 3 hours to less than 15 minutes.","Chen, Boyo; Chen, Buo-Fu; Chen, Yun-Nung",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14977v1.pdf,785

Additionally, various deep learning models are tested with synthesized or real chest CT images for COVID-19 and Non-COVID-19 classification. In comparison, all models achieve excellent results (over than 90%) in accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score for both synthesized and real COVID-19 CT images, demonstrating the reliable of the synthesized dataset.

This change creates space for new narratives towards resilience. The resilience perspective implies preparing for shocks as well as various futures that might evolve. Thus, more sustainable food systems cannot only be built to be pandemic proof. This preparation can be facilitated by co-designing contrasting future narratives, identifying means for developing capacity to adapt to those futures and developing tools to enhance that capacity, such as demonstrated here. The capacity of food systems to adapt and transform is enhanced by dialogue, transparency and collective learning in food value chains and networks, sovereignty over resources, and built-in diversity in response to change. In market-led global food chains, supplier-buyer diversity is important, while in public-led regions with some market protection, farm and crop diversity might matter more in response to variability in weather, price and policies. During, for example, an international conflict, or the time of a pandemic, diverse food sourcing from local producer-consumer cooperatives to community-supported and urban agriculture could secure food for citizens. Assessments of critical diversity in response to shocks and volatility can help actors to tailor effective diversity to manage resilience while avoiding the long-feared trade-off between diversity and resource-use efficiency. The interdependence of humanity deserves attention, as food systems are only as resilient as their weakest actor. A truly resilient global food system implies not only preparedness for coming shocks and changes but also a foundation that makes shocks less probable and critical.","Kahiluoto, Helena",Food Secur,,785
507746,Expresión de infección por SARS-CoV-2 en niños: infección aguda sintomática y síndrome inflamatorio multisistémico,2021,"Conventional coagulation process is not effective to eliminate trace organic compounds (TrOCs). This study proposed a novel peroxomonosulfate (PMS) amended iron coagulation process and found its effectiveness in eliminating TrOCs in synthetic and natural waters. In synthetic waters containing hydroquinone (HQ) or benzoquinone (BQ), Fe(III)/PMS effectively degraded carbamazepine (CBZ), a representative of resistant TrOCs. The step of reduction of Fe(III) to form Fe(II) governed the degradation rate of CBZ as PMS activation by Fe(II) was the dominant reaction to generate SO4â¢-, which was the major reactive oxidant in the system. Meanwhile, HQ was quickly transformed to BQ in the Fe(III)/PMS system and BQ acted as an electron shuttle to induce Fe(III)/Fe(II) redox cycle and accelerate PMS activation. Natural organic matter (NOM) bearing phenolic and quinone moieties played similar roles as HQ and BQ and fast CBZ degradation was also observed. Finally, two surface waters spiked CBZ were subjected to bench-scale experimentation to simulate coagulation/flocculation/sedimentation processes in water treatment plants. Compared to the conventional iron coagulation process, the PMS-amended iron coagulation process increased the removal percentage of CBZ by 50%-80%. Overall, this study demonstrates that PMS enhanced iron coagulation is a promising process for the abatement of TrOCs in water treatment.","Wang, Yu; Pan, Tao; Yu, Yafei; Wu, Yang; Pan, Yanheng; Yang, Xin",Water Res,,785

METHODS: Retrospective service data (Cambridge, UK; 17 736 consecutive singleton pregnancies, 2004-2008; 826 consecutive gestational diabetes pregnancies, 2014-2019) and 361 women with &#8805;1 gestational diabetes risk factor (OPHELIA prospective observational study, UK) were included. Pregnancy outcomes included gestational diabetes (National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence or International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups criteria), diabetes in pregnancy (WHO criteria), Caesarean section, large-for-gestational age infant, neonatal hypoglycaemia and neonatal intensive care unit admission. Receiver-operating characteristic curves and unadjusted logistic regression were used to compare random plasma glucose, fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c performance. RESULTS: Gestational diabetes diagnosis was significantly associated with random plasma glucose at 12 weeks [area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for both criteria 0.81 (95% CI 0.79-0.83)], fasting plasma glucose [National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.75 (95% CI 0.65-0.85); International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups: area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.98)] and HbA1c at 28 weeks' gestation [National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence: 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.90); International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups: 0.84 (95% CI 0.77-0.91)]. Each measure predicts some, but not all, pregnancy outcomes studied. At 12 weeks, ~5% of women would be identified using random plasma glucose &#8805;8.5 mmol/l (sensitivity 42%; specificity 96%) and at 28 weeks using HbA1c &#8805;39 mmol/mol (sensitivity 26%; specificity 96%) or fasting plasma glucose &#8805;5.2-5.4 mmol/l (sensitivity 18-41%; specificity 97-98%). CONCLUSIONS: Random plasma glucose at 12 weeks, and fasting plasma glucose or HbA1c at 28 weeks identify women with hyperglycaemia at risk of suboptimal pregnancy outcomes. These opportunistic laboratory tests perform adequately for risk stratification when oral glucose tolerance testing is not available.","Meek, C L; Lindsay, R S; Scott, E M; Aiken, C E; Myers, J; Reynolds, R M; Simmons, D; Yamamoto, J M; McCance, D R; Murphy, H R",Diabet Med,,785
