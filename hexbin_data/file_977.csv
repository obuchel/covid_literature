Early nutritional supplementation in non-critically ill patients hospitalized for the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19): rationale and feasibility of a shared pragmatic protocol,6.19695,10.094777,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated the unplanned, widespread adoption of telepsychotherapy by mental health care professionals. Psychotherapy supervision is also undergoing a rapid shift to telepractice, though questions remain about the efficacy and regulatory standing of telesupervision. A critical unanswered question is: How does telesupervision compare with traditional in-person supervision? This study (completed before the COVID-19 pandemic) used a multiple baseline singlecase design to compare the relative effectiveness of in-person supervision and telesupervision. For the small sample of supervisee participants, in-person supervision and telesupervision had equivalent outcomes; there was no significant decrease in participant-rated supervision satisfaction or supervisory working alliance after participants switched from the initial in-person supervision format to telesupervision. In follow-up interviews, participants discussed 4 themes which may be relevant to mental health care professionals adopting telesupervision: (a) differences between modalities, (b) characteristics of an effective supervisor, (c) the role of technology, and (d) personal preference. These results add to a small but growing evidence base that suggests telesupervision is a viable alternative to in-person supervision. Practical recommendations for telesupervision during the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed.","Tarlow, Kevin R.; McCord, Carly E.; Nelon, Jordan L.; Bernhard, Paula A.",J. Psychother.

With this pandemic, to combat the spreading of COVID-19, effective testing methodologies and immediate medical treatments are much required. Chest X-rays are the widely available modalities for immediate diagnosis of COVID-19. Hence, automation of detection of COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using machine learning approaches is of greater demand. A model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images is proposed in this paper. A novel concept of cluster-based one-shot learning is introduced in this work. The introduced concept has an advantage of learning from a few samples against learning from many samples in case of deep leaning architectures. The proposed model is a multi-class classification model as it classifies images of four classes, viz., pneumonia bacterial, pneumonia virus, normal, and COVID-19. The proposed model is based on ensemble of Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN) classifiers at decision level. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been demonstrated through extensive experimentation on a publicly available dataset consisting of 306 images. The proposed cluster-based one-shot learning has been found to be more effective on GRNN and PNN ensembled model to distinguish COVID-19 images from that of the other three classes. It has also been experimentally observed that the model has a superior performance over contemporary deep learning architectures. The concept of one-shot cluster-based learning is being first of its kind in literature, expected to open up several new dimensions in the field of machine learning which require further researching for various applications.","Aradhya, V N Manjunath; Mahmud, Mufti; Guru, D S; Agarwal, Basant; Kaiser, M Shamim",Cognit Comput,977,1
