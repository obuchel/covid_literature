H5N8 and H5N2 viruses have caused major economic losses in the poultry industry in Europe and North America, and lethal human infections with H5N6 virus have occurred in Asia. Knowledge of the evolution of receptor-binding specificity of these viruses, which might affect host range, is urgently needed. We report that emergence of these viruses is accompanied by a change in receptor-binding specificity. In contrast to ancestral clade 2.3.4 H5 proteins, novel clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins bind to fucosylated sialosides because of substitutions K222Q and S227R, which are unique for highly pathogenic influenza virus H5 proteins. North American clade 2.3.4.4 virus isolates have retained only the K222Q substitution but still bind fucosylated sialosides. Altered receptor-binding specificity of virus clade 2.3.4.4 H5 proteins might have contributed to emergence and spread of H5Nx viruses.","Guo, Hongbo; de Vries, Erik; McBride, Ryan; Dekkers, Jojanneke; Peng, Wenjie; Bouwman, Kim M.; Nycholat, Corwin; Verheije, M.

Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is one of the most prevalent nutrition-related health problems in the world and is a significant risk factor in the development of severe respiratory infections in infants and young children. Bovine RSV (BRSV) is a primary cause of lower respiratory tract disease in young cattle. The calf model of BRSV infection is useful to understand the immune response to human RSV infection. We have previously developed an amphiphilic polyanhydride nanoparticle (NP)-based vaccine (i.e., nanovaccine) encapsulating the fusion and attachment proteins from BRSV (BRSV-NP). Calves receiving a single, intranasal dose of the BRSV-NP vaccine are partially protected from BRSV challenge. Here, we evaluated the impact of VAD on the immune response to the BRSV-NP vaccine and subsequent challenge with BRSV. Our results show that VAD calves are unable to respond to the mucosal BRSV-NP vaccine, are afforded no protection from BRSV challenge and have significant abnormalities in the inflammatory response in the infected lung. We further show that acute BRSV infection negatively impacts serum and liver retinol, rendering even well-nourished individuals susceptible to VAD. Our results support the use of the calf model for elucidating the impact of nutritional status on mucosal immunity and respiratory viral infection in infants and underline the importance of VA in regulating immunity in the respiratory mucosa.","McGill, Jodi L.; Kelly, Sean M.; Guerra-Maupome, Mariana; Winkley, Emma; Henningson, Jamie; Narasimhan, Balaji; Sacco, Randy E.",Sci Rep,364,1

Here, we reported a case of pNET producing vasopressin in a 78-year-old man with hyponatremia. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient presented with anorexia approximately 4 years ago, and the laboratory test results indicated hyponatremia. He was hospitalized 3 times subsequently due to anorexia in the past 4 years, during which laboratory tests consistently indicated severe hyponatremia. DIAGNOSIS: Upon admission, his serum osmolarity, urine osmolarity, urine sodium level, and 24-hour urine sodium level was 277 mOsm/kg H2O, 465 mOsm/kg H2O, 82.5 mmol/L, and 140.25 mmol, respectively. Gallium-68-labeled tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid-Dphel-Tyr3-octreotate positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed a high uptake lesion measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter in the pancreatic body, and the possibility of pNET was considered. Besides, laboratory tests showed that adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone released by the pituitary was insufficient in the case of low levels of cortisol, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone. Thus, the diagnosis of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) was considered along with hypopituitarism. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent surgery, and pNET was confirmed by pathology examination. The immunohistochemical study showed that the tumor cells were positive for somatostatin receptors 2 and vasopressin. OUTCOMES: In the last follow-up 17 months after surgery, the patient was in good condition, taking methylprednisolone 4 mg every other day, and had been free of anorexia or hyponatremia episodes. LESSONS: This case illustrated the potential ectopic production of vasopressin resulting in SIAD in pNETs, highlighting the adoption of gallium-68-labeled tetraazacyclododecanetetraacetic acid-Dphel-Tyr3-octreotate positron emission tomography-computed tomography and vasopressin immunohistochemical staining in the evaluation of the etiology of SIAD.","Li, Jingyan; Zhang, Xinxin; He, Qing; Feng, Wenli; Ding, Li; Wang, Zhuoqun; Yu, Haonan; Chen, Qiusong; Lu, Ning; Xu, Dongbo; Cui, Jingqiu",Medicine (Baltimore),364,20

SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered) model has been widely used to analyse infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, bioterrorism, to name a few. On the other hand, agent-based model begins to spread in recent years. The model enables to represent the behaviour of each person on the computer. It also reveals the spread of infection by simulation of the contact process among people in the model. The study designs a model based on smallpox and Ebola fever model in which several health policies are decided such as vaccination, the gender-specific workplace and so on. The infectious simulation of rubella, which has not yet vaccinated completely for men in Japan, is implemented in the model. As results of experiments using the model, it has been found that preventive vaccine to all the men is crucial factors to prevent the spread in women.","Kurahashi, Setsuya",Agents and Multi-agent Systems: Technologies and Applications 2019,364,19

Lack of SARS-CoV-2 Antibody Seroconversion After Prompt Identification and Cohorting of Sentinel sars-cov-2-positive Residents in a Skilled Nursing Facility,12.027112,11.82408,2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Global spread of SARS-CoV-2 led to an urgent need for data on national and regional prevalence to inform public health policy. Healthcare systems were also in need of data to develop best practices around defining patient risk. We describe a data analytics tool developed at our institution which uses public data sources to track county-level prevalence of COVID-19 so as to delineate risk for individual patients. METHODS: We investigated a number of data sources tracking COVID-19 case counts, assessing for (1) frequency of updates, (2) granularity of geographic detail (optimally to zip-code or county) and (3) completeness of the data. We chose the Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 data set. This contains counts of new diagnoses per day by county using Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) codes. The dataset is updated daily with adjustments made for backdated corrections. We developed a data analytics tool which allowed for direct comparison of county period prevalence. We developed a metric of 10-day rolling period prevalence calculated as a total case count from the preceding 10 days, divided by county population from 2018 American Community Survey (ACS) estimates. RESULTS: Benchmarking against local (peak of 3.12 cases per 1,000 persons) and regional prevalence, we set 6 cases/1,000 persons as the threshold for a Geographic Region with Widespread Community Transmission (GReWCoT). Counties have to reach this threshold for at least 4 out of 7 days within the period 3 to 10 days prior to the evaluation, to adjust for bulking of test results and delayed reporting. We used the analytics tool to support a semimonthly review of geographic regions, and made specific recommendations for patients from qualifying regions including use of modified enhanced precautions (including surgical mask and eye protection), as well as restricted visitation of caregivers.

Perceived by the US and the Arab world as ‘pro-Iranian Shi’a militias’, as a spoiler to Iraq’s sovereignty, and an Iranian means of securing its control over Baghdad, while some militias began as NSAAs, the PMU have evolved into quasi-state actors by becoming part of the state, but not under its complete control.

Main funding source(s): Dutch Heart Foundation - senior E-Dekker grant Physical activity and sedentary behaviour in cardiovascular disease patients during the COVID-19 lockdown in the Netherlands; a longitudinal cohort study BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that the COVID-19 lockdown caused a more inactive lifestyle, but it is unknown whether these acute effects persist over time. We prospectively evaluated changes in physical activity and sedentary behaviour among chronic cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients during the first-wave COVID-19 lockdown and aimed to identify factors associated with physical inactivity. METHODS: 1,565 CVD patients were included and baseline physical activity and sedentary behaviour were assessed using validated questionnaires at 5 weeks after the initiation of the Dutch lockdown (March 2020). Follow-up measures were collected every subsequent 4 weeks until July 2020. Multivariate mixed model analyses were performed to identify whether age, gender, CVD subtype, lockdown adherence and mental health factors impacted changes in physical (in)activity. RESULTS: Patients were 67 (interquartile range [60, 73]) years, mostly male (73%) and primarily diagnosed with myocardial infarction (48%) or angina pectoris (18%). Daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was 143 minutes (95% confidence interval (CI) 137; 148) at baseline, with almost no changes during follow-up on a group level (Δ+8.0 (95%CI -1.1; 17.0); Δ+11.2 (95%CI 1.9; 20.5) and Δ+8.0 (95%CI -1.5; 17.5) min/day after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, respectively).Female gender (Δ-40.7 (95%CI -48.5; -33.0) min/day); heart failure (Δ-23.0 (95%CI -36.5; -9.5) min/day); fear of a COVID-19 infection (Δ-6.6 (95%CI -9.4; -3.8) min/day) and limited possibilities for physical activity (Δ-7.4 (95%CI -10.1; -4.7) min/day) were independently associated with a decrease in physical activity. Sedentary time was 567 (95%CI 555; 578) min/day at baseline which did not change after 4 weeks (Δ+12.1 (95%CI -6.0; 30.2) min/day) and after 8 weeks (Δ+15.2 (95%CI -3.3; 33.8) min/day), but significantly increased after 12 weeks of follow-up (Δ+19.0 (95%CI 0.1; 37.8) min/day). Lack of social contact (Δ+8.4 (95%CI 2.3; 14.5); limited possibilities for physical activity (Δ+14.7 (95%CI 8.8; 20.5) and younger age (Δ+2.1 (95%CI 1.3; 2.8) min/day were independently associated with an increase in sedentary time. CONCLUSIONS: A time-dependent increase in daily sedentary time was observed among chronic CVD patients during the COVID-19 lockdown, whereas physical activity levels did not substantially change. Our findings highlight the need to develop and implement novel solutions to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary time during (and beyond) the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in CVD patients who are female, younger, diagnosed with heart failure, have a lack of social contact, fear of COVID-19 infection and experience limited physical activity possibilities during the lockdown.","Van Bakel, BMA; Bakker, EA; De Vries, F; Thijssen, DHJ; Eijsvogels, TMH",Eur J Prev Cardiol,364,1

RESULTS The total number of in-hospital mortality was 43/328 (13.1%). Multivariate analysis identified that there was a 26% higher risk of in-hospital death for each unit increase in NLR (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.08; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01 to 1.14; p = 0.0147).

Higher serum concentrations of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents are associated with improved clinical and endoscopic outcomes. Correlations between GLM serum concentrations and clinical and endoscopic outcomes were investigated during induction and maintenance treatment. In addition, a population pharmacokinetic model was developed to identify factors associated with the pharmacokinetics of GLM in UC. Methods: A prospective observational trial (GO-KINETIC) was conducted in patients with moderate to severe UC receiving induction and maintenance treatment with GLM. Clinical and endoscopic outcomes were evaluated, fecal GLM concentrations were measured and pharmacokinetic data were analyzed. Results: A total of 20 patients were enrolled. At week 8 (after induction treatment), 12 out of 20 patients (60%) showed an endoscopic response (≥1 point reduction in endoscopic Mayo score). Patients with endoscopic response at week 8 had numerically higher median GLM serum concentrations at week 2 compared to endoscopic non-responders: 9.1 µg/ml [5.9-12.3] vs. 7.1 µg/mL [5.2-9.0]; p = .384, respectively. At week 52, 3/20 patients (15%) achieved endoscopic remission (endoscopic Mayo score ≤1) and continued GLM treatment. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed an inverse association between albumin concentrations and GLM clearance. GLM concentrations were undetectable in fecal samples. Conclusions: After induction therapy, 60% of the patients showed endoscopic response. During maintenance therapy, about one third of patients discontinued GLM treatment because of loss of response. These patients might benefit from dose optimization.","Berends, Sophie E; Strik, Anne S; Jansen, Jeroen M; de Boer, Nanne K; van Egmond, Pleun S; Brandse, Johannan F; Mathôt, Ron A; D'Haens, Geert R; Löwenberg, Mark",Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,364,12

We were also first to use multiphoton microscopy, a non-invasive and label-free imaging technique, to quantify and link the aortic ultrastructure to possible changes in the skin dermis. Here, we aimed to assess the effects of long-term doxycycline treatment on the aortic ultrastructure and skin dermis of MFS mice through immunohistochemical evaluation and quantification of elastic and collagen content and morphology using multiphoton microscopy. Our results demonstrate a rescue of aortic elastic fiber fragmentation and disorganization accompanied by a decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression within the aortic wall in doxycycline-treated MFS mice. At 12 months of age, reduced skin dermal thickness was observed in both MFS and control mice, but only dermal thinning in MFS mice was rescued by doxycycline treatment. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was reduced in the skin of doxycycline-treated MFS mice. A decrease in dermal thickness was found to be positively associated with increased aortic root elastin disorganization and wall thickness.

This large-scale project used machine learning (i.e., Random Forests) to 1) quantify the extent to which relationship quality is predictable and 2) identify which constructs reliably predict relationship quality. Across 43 dyadic longitudinal datasets from 29 laboratories, the top relationship-specific predictors of relationship quality were perceived-partner commitment, appreciation, sexual satisfaction, perceived-partner satisfaction, and conflict. The top individual-difference predictors were life satisfaction, negative affect, depression, attachment avoidance, and attachment anxiety. Overall, relationship-specific variables predicted up to 45% of variance at baseline, and up to 18% of variance at the end of each study. Individual differences also performed well (21% and 12%, respectively). Actor-reported variables (i.e., own relationship-specific and individual-difference variables) predicted two to four times more variance than partner-reported variables (i.e., the partner's ratings on those variables). Importantly, individual differences and partner reports had no predictive effects beyond actor-reported relationship-specific variables alone. These findings imply that the sum of all individual differences and partner experiences exert their influence on relationship quality via a person's own relationship-specific experiences, and effects due to moderation by individual differences and moderation by partner-reports may be quite small. Finally, relationship-quality change (i.e., increases or decreases in relationship quality over the course of a study) was largely unpredictable from any combination of self-report variables. This collective effort should guide future models of relationships.","Joel, Samantha; Eastwick, Paul W; Allison, Colleen J; Arriaga, Ximena B; Baker, Zachary G; Bar-Kalifa, Eran; Bergeron, Sophie; Birnbaum, Gurit E; Brock, Rebecca L; Brumbaugh, Claudia C; Carmichael, Cheryl L; Chen, Serena; Clarke, Jennifer; Cobb, Rebecca J; Coolsen, Michael K; Davis, Jody; de Jong, David C; Debrot, Anik; DeHaas, Eva C; Derrick, Jaye L; Eller, Jami; Estrada, Marie-Joelle; Faure, Ruddy; Finkel, Eli J; Fraley, R Chris; Gable, Shelly L; Gadassi-Polack, Reuma; Girme, Yuthika U; Gordon, Amie M; Gosnell, Courtney L; Hammond, Matthew D; Hannon, Peggy A; Harasymchuk, Cheryl; Hofmann, Wilhelm; Horn, Andrea B; Impett, Emily A; Jamieson, Jeremy P; Keltner, Dacher; Kim, James J; Kirchner, Jeffrey L; Kluwer, Esther S; Kumashiro, Madoka; Larson, Grace; Lazarus, Gal; Logan, Jill M; Luchies, Laura B; MacDonald, Geoff; Machia, Laura V; Maniaci, Michael R; Maxwell, Jessica A; Mizrahi, Moran; Muise, Amy; Niehuis, Sylvia; Ogolsky, Brian G; Oldham, C Rebecca; Overall, Nickola C; Perrez, Meinrad; Peters, Brett J; Pietromonaco, Paula R; Powers, Sally I; Prok, Thery; Pshedetzky-Shochat, Rony; Rafaeli, Eshkol; Ramsdell, Erin L; Reblin, Maija; Reicherts, Michael; Reifman, Alan; Reis, Harry T; Rhoades, Galena K; Rholes, William S; Righetti, Francesca; Rodriguez, Lindsey M; Rogge, Ron; Rosen, Natalie O; Saxbe, Darby; Sened, Haran; Simpson, Jeffry A; Slotter, Erica B; Stanley, Scott M; Stocker, Shevaun; Surra, Cathy; Ter Kuile, Hagar; Vaughn, Allison A; Vicary, Amanda M; Visserman, Mariko L; Wolf, Scott",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,364,33

However, these tools are limited by cost or patient tolerance. We investigated whether baseline impedance measured during high-resolution impedance manometry (HRIM) distinguishes GERD patients from controls. METHODS Consecutive patients with clinical HRIM and MII-pH testing were identified. Gastroesophageal reflux disease was defined by esophageal pH <4 for ≥5% of both the supine and total study time, whereas controls had an esophageal pH <4 for ≤3% of the study performed off PPI. Baseline impedance was measured over 15 seconds during the landmark period of HRIM and over three 10 minute intervals during the overnight period of MII-pH. KEY RESULTS Among 29 GERD patients and 26 controls, GERD patients had a mean esophageal acid exposure time of 22.7% compared to 1.2% in controls (P<.0001). Mean baseline impedance during HRIM was lower in GERD (1061 Ω) than controls (2814 Ω) (P<.0001). Baseline mucosal impedance measured during HRIM and MII-pH correlated (r=0.59, P<.0001). High-resolution esophageal manometry baseline impedance had high diagnostic accuracy for GERD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931 on receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis. A HRIM baseline impedance threshold of 1582 Ω had a sensitivity of 86.2% and specificity of 88.5% for GERD, with a positive predictive value of 89.3% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES Baseline impedance measured during HRIM can reliably discriminate GERD patients with at least moderate esophageal acid exposure from controls.

Young children, women of reproductive age and pregnant women living in sub-Saharan Africa are the most vulnerable. It is estimated that iron deficiency accounts for half of anaemia cases. Apart from nutritional deficiency, infection, inflammation and genetic factors are the major drivers of anaemia. However, the role of genetic risk factors has not been thoroughly investigated. This is particularly relevant in African populations, as they carry high genetic diversity and have a high prevalence of anaemia. Multiple genetic variations in iron regulatory genes have been linked to impaired iron status. Here we conducted a literature review to identify genetic variants associated with iron imbalance among global populations. We compare their allele frequencies and risk scores and we investigated population-specific selection among populations of varying geographic origin using data from the Keneba Biobank representing individuals in rural Gambia and the 1000 Genomes Project. We identified a significant lack of data on the genetic determinants of iron status in sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the studies on genetic determinants of iron status have been conducted in Europeans. Also, we identified population differences in allele frequencies in candidate putative genetic risk factors. Given the disproportionately high genetic diversity in African populations coupled with their high prevalence of iron deficiency, there is need to investigate the genetic influences of low iron status in Sub-Saharan Africa. The resulting insights may inform the future implementation of iron intervention strategies.","Jallow, Momodou W; Cerami, Carla; Clark, Taane G; Prentice, Andrew M; Campino, Susana",PloS one,364,0

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has established a minimum light intensity for direct laryngoscopy (DL) of over 500 lux for at least ten minutes, but no such standard exists for Macintosh geometry videolaryngoscope (Mac-VL) blades, which allow for both direct or indirect (videoscopic) viewing of the larynx. Using in situ bench and in vitro testing in a human cadaver, we determined illumination and luminance values delivered by various Mac-VLs and compared these with published minimum lighting benchmarks as well as a reference direct laryngoscope. METHODS We tested six Mac-VLs (i-view™, McGRATH™ MAC, GlideScope® Spectrum™ [single-use] DVM S4, GlideScope® Titanium [reusable] Mac T4, C-MAC® S [single-use] Macintosh #4, C-MAC® [reusable] Macintosh #4) together with one direct laryngoscope (Heine LED). Each laryngoscope was assessed with three measurements, as follows: part 1: illuminance (lux) was measured in situ using a purpose-designed benchtop light intensity measurement apparatus; part 2: luminance (light reflected back to the eye) was measured (in candela m-2 [cd·m-2]) during videolaryngoscopy (VL) and DL in a human cadaver using a spot meter pointed at the interarytenoid notch; part 3: illuminance (lux) was measured during VL and DL in a human cadaver using a light meter surgically implanted just proximal to the vocal cords. RESULTS Illuminance and luminance varied significantly among the Mac-VLs. Mean (standard devitation) illuminance among the six tested Mac-VLs ranged from 117 (11) to 2,626 (42) lux in the measurement apparatus and from 228 (11) to 2,900 (374) lux by the surgically implanted light meter in the cadaver. All values were less than the reference Heine direct laryngoscope and some fell below the published ISO standard of 500 lux for DL. Luminance testing by spot meter had a similarly wide range, varying from 3.78 (0.60) to 49.1 (10.4) cd·m-2, with some Mac-VLs delivering less luminance than the reference Heine direct laryngoscope. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate that illuminance and luminance provided by Mac-VLs used for direct laryngeal viewing varies substantially between devices, with some falling below standards previously suggested as the minimum required for DL. While this may have no implications for the quality of image visible on a device's video monitor, the clinician should be aware that when Mac-VLs are used for direct viewing of the larynx, lighting may not be optimal. This might adversely affect ease or success of tracheal intubation.","Harlow, Madeleine; Kovacs, George; Brousseau, Paul; Law, J Adam",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,364,5

We hypothesized that cerebrovascular autoregulation is band-limited and delineated by a cutoff frequency for which ABP variations induce cerebrovascular reactivity. Neonatal swine (n = 8) were anesthetized using constant minute ventilation while positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was modulated between 6 and 0.75 cycles/min (min(-1)). The animals were hemorrhaged until ABP was below the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA), and PEEP modulations were repeated. Vascular reactivity was quantified at each frequency according to the phase lag between ABP and intracranial pressure (ICP) above and below the LLA. Phase differences between ABP and ICP were small for frequencies of >2 min(-1), with no ability to differentiate cerebrovascular reactivity between ABPs above or below the LLA. For frequencies of <2 min(-1), ABP and intracranial pressure (ICP) showed phase shift when measured above LLA and no phase shift when measured below LLA [above vs. below LLA at 1 min(-1): 156° (139-174°) vs. 30° (22-50°); P < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA for both frequency and state of autoregulation]. Data taken above LLA fit a Butterworth high-pass filter model with a cutoff frequency at 1.8 min(-1) (95% confidence interval: 1.5-2.2). Cerebrovascular reactivity occurs for sustained ABP changes lasting 30 s or longer.

The authors describe their experience with this patient population and seek to identify predictors of sufficiency of endoscopic surgery alone. METHODS The medical records of patients with syndromic craniosynostosis who underwent endoscopic repair were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, operative details, and follow-up data were collected. RESULTS A total of 6 patients with syndromic craniosynostosis underwent endoscopic surgery followed by helmet therapy during the study period. Of these, 3 patients were male. The involved syndromes included Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Jackson-Weiss, Muenke, Saethre-Chotzen, and craniosynostosis-3 (n = 1 each). The patients underwent endoscopic surgery at a median age of 2.1 months (range 0.9-4.1 months). The median estimated blood loss was 30 ml (range 20-100 ml), with 2 patients requiring a transfusion. The median length of stay in the hospital was 1.5 days (range 1-4 days), and the median follow-up was 29.0 months (range 16.8-81.7 months), with 1 patient (16.7%) requiring an open revision. Three patients (50%) were classified as Whitaker Category I at the last follow-up. The patients for whom additional open surgery was performed or recommended (Whitaker Category IV) were the oldest patients in the cohort, ranging from 2.6 to 4.1 months at the time of surgery. CONCLUSIONS This series demonstrates that endoscopic surgery can be sufficient to treat syndromic craniosynostosis without subsequent open calvarial remodeling over a median follow-up period of at least 2 years. The findings suggest that younger age at the time of endoscopic surgery may be an important factor in determining the sufficiency of this procedure. Even among patients who require subsequent open calvarial remodeling, early endoscopic surgery may allow for growth and development of the brain and skull while delaying the need for open remodeling until the patient is older and can better tolerate the procedure.","Hersh, David S; Hoover-Fong, Julie E; Beck, Natalie; Dorafshar, Amir H; Ahn, Edward S",Journal of neurosurgery.

Initial data indicated that TIM3 functioned as a 'co-inhibitory' or 'checkpoint' receptor, but due to the lack of a definable inhibitory signalling motif, it was also suggested that TIM3 might act as a co-stimulatory receptor. Recent studies have shown that TIM3 is part of a module that contains multiple co-inhibitory receptors (checkpoint receptors), which are co-expressed and co-regulated on dysfunctional or 'exhausted' T cells in chronic viral infections and cancer. Furthermore, co-blockade of TIM3 and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) can result in tumour regression in preclinical models and can improve anticancer T cell responses in patients with advanced cancers. Here, we highlight the developments in understanding TIM3 biology, including novel ligand identification and the discovery of loss-of-function mutations associated with human disease. In addition, we summarize emerging data from human clinical trials showing that TIM3 indeed acts as a 'checkpoint' receptor and that inhibition of TIM3 enhances the antitumour effect of PD1 blockade.","Wolf, Yochai; Anderson, Ana C; Kuchroo, Vijay K",Nature reviews.

ARI often leads to hospitalisation, and it has been indicated that causative viral and bacterial infections go undetermined and results in the occurrence of resistant strains. The objective of the study was to assess the prevalence of various viral and bacterial infections in patients with ARIs. MATERIALS AND METHODS Two hundred samples were collected from July 2011 to July 2012 with patients suffering from ARI. Viral and bacterial infections were determined by real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS Influenza-like illness (ILI) consisted of 109 patients and ARI consisted of 91 patients. Pandemic influenza A H1N1 was the major viral infection with 21 (19.2%) patients in ILI as compared with 16 (17.4%) patients in ARI. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was found to be 1 (0.9%) in ILI and ARI. Viral co-infections were 16 (14.4%) in ILI and 4 (4.37%) in ARI where pandemic influenza A H1N1 and influenza type B were major contributors. In bacterial infections, Streptococcus pneumoniae with 11 (10.9%) cases were predominant in both the groups. Bacterial co-infection accounted for only 1 (1.09%) case in both the groups but the most significant finding was the viral-bacterial co-infection in which Haemophilus influenzae was the major co-infecting bacteria with the influenza viruses with 4 (4.36%) cases as compared with Streptotoccus pneumoniae.

Statistical analyses were performed by using the STATA software version 14. The significance level was set at P&lt;0.05.Results:The mean ± standard deviation age of the study population was 34.2 ± 8.4 years. Out of 483 participants, 55 (11.4%) were identified as high-risk exposure category, 52 (10.8%) as medium-risk category and 77 (15.9%) as low-risk category. According to multiple logistic regression models, it was observed that cough (odds ratio (OR)=2.2;P=0.001), running nose (OR=3.3;P&lt;0.001), suffocation (OR=3.2;P&lt;0.001), shivering (OR=3.4;P=0.001), nausea (OR=3.3;P=0.001), vomiting (OR=7.2;P=0.025), diarrhoea (OR=3.0;P=0.001), muscular pain (OR=2.1;P=0.005), joint pain (OR=2.2;P=0.005) and fatigue (OR=2.1;P=0.003) were significantly associated with risk assessment.Conclusions:The findings showed that more than one-fifth of studied healthcare workers were at high or medium-risk exposure of COVID-19. Cough and fatigue had the most frequencies in healthcare workers with high or medium-risk exposure, and also, vomiting and shivering had a stronger association with risk assessment status.","Shamshirgaran, Seyed Morteza Aminisani Nayyereh Abasi Hamid Mollanoroozy Ensiyeh Mohammad Malekzadeh Masoud Fazel Hadi Ghasemi Ahmad khorashadizade Fatemeh Moshar-Movahed Ghasem Alimardani Amir Sadegh Gholami Ali",Proceedings of Singapore Healthcare,364,16

The method adopted is a systematic literature review based on the quantitative and qualitative analysis of 56 articles selected through specific queries on the SCOPUS database and published from 2004 to 2020. Results of the quantitative analysis identify conditions able to evaluate collaborations, highlighting the need to adopt a transdisciplinary approach analysing both social and ecological challenges and assessing both social and ecological results. Moreover, they suggest preferring using primary data involving multi-sector and multi-scale actors and enlarging the geographical context to the most vulnerable countries. The results of the qualitative analysis provide specific recommendations for collaborations being effective when related to communication, equity, foresight, and respect, which need to be further strengthened by all actors. Multiplicity in visions and approaches should be seen as a resource able to stimulate creativity in social arrangements and environmental practices, making collaborations in environmental projects instrumental for the effectiveness of adaptive governance of SES.","Andriollo, Elena Caimo Alberto Secco Laura Pisani Elena",Sustainability,364,24

Examples include disease and epidemiological data such as privacy-preserving statistics on patients who suffered from epidemic diseases like the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Embedded in the huge volumes of COVID-19 data for large numbers of COVID-19 cases around the world is implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and knowledge—which can be discovered by data mining. As “a picture is worth a thousand words”, having the pictorial representation further enhances this knowledge discovery process. Visualization of COVID-19 data helps users discover useful information and knowledge—such as popular features and their associative relationships—related to COVID-19 cases. Moreover, visualization of discovered knowledge helps users get a better understanding and interpretation of discovered knowledge. Hence, in this paper, we present a data science solution that makes good use of both data mining and visualization for conducting data analytics and visual analytics of COVID-19 data to reveal important information and knowledge from COVID-19. Evaluation on real-life COVID-19 data demonstrates the effectiveness of our solution in revealing useful information and knowledge of COVID-19 by data mining and visualization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Leung, C.

DESIGN We prospectively evaluated the general health status of HCWs during the SARS epidemic. The Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 Survey was given to all HCWs immediately after caring for patients with SARS and 4 weeks after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts. Tests for detection of SARS coronavirus antibody were performed for HCWs at these 2 time points and for control subjects during the SARS epidemic. SETTING Tertiary care referral center in Taipei, Taiwan. SUBJECTS Ninety SARS-care task force members (SARS HCWs) and 82 control subjects. RESULTS All serum specimens tested negative for SARS antibody. Survey scores for SARS HCWs immediately after care were significantly lower than those for the control group (P<.05 by the t test) in 6 categories. Vitality, social functioning, and mental health immediately after care and vitality and mental health after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts were among the worst subscales. The social functioning, role emotional, and role physical subscales significantly improved after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts (P<.05, by paired t test). The length of contact time (mean number of contact-hours per day) with patients with SARS was associated with some subscales (role emotional, role physical, and mental health) to a mild extent. The total number of contact-hours with symptomatic patients with SARS was a borderline predictor (adjusted R2=0.069; P=.038) of mental health score. CONCLUSIONS The impact of the SARS outbreak on SARS HCWs was significant in many dimensions of general health. The vitality and mental health status of SARS HCWs 1 month after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts remained inferior to those of the control group.","Chen, Ning-Hung; Wang, Pa-Chun; Hsieh, Meng-Jer; Huang, Chung-Chi; Kao, Kuo-Chin; Chen, Ya-Hui; Tsai, Ying-Huang",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,364,17

The promoter regions of the IFN-alpha genes, however, have different transcription factor binding sites, implying differential transcriptional activation. Evolutionary conservation of multiple subtypes may have resulted from external pressures associated with the crucial nature of an IFN response, namely that different viruses that are tropic for different target tissues determine the nature and extent of an IFN response, specifically the IFN-alpha subtype profile. METHODS Studies were undertaken to examine inducible IFN gene expression profiles in response to infection with single-stranded RNA viruses: Sendai virus (SeV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV-1) and coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3). RESULTS In vitro, distinct signature profiles of SeV and MHV-1-inducible gene expression for IFN-alpha2, IFN-alpha4 and IFN-alpha5 subtypes in L2 and L929 mouse fibroblast cells, in relation to the extent and kinetics of their induction, were identified. In vivo, whereas A/J mice are highly permissive for both MHV-1 and CVB3 infections and mount a poor IFN response, C57B1/6 mice are relatively resistant to both virus infections and mount a vigorous IFN response. CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that the infecting virus and the target cell type dictate the extent and signature of inducible type I IFN gene expression. The extent of IFN response to viral infection influences the subsequent biological outcome: a robust IFN response prescribes a level of resistance, whereas a poor IFN response contributes towards a permissive phenotype for infection.","Baig, Ehtesham; Fish, Eleanor N",Antiviral therapy,364,1

However, funding of hospital preparedness, especially surge capacity, has lagged behind other preparedness priorities. Only a small portion of the money allocated for national preparedness is directed toward health care, and hospitals receive very little of that. Under current policy, virtually the entire funding stream for hospital preparedness comes from general tax revenues. Medical payers (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance) directly fund little, if any, of the current bill. Funding options to improve preparedness include increasing the current federal grants allocated to hospitals, using payer fees or a tax to subsidize preparedness, and financing other forms of expansion capability, such as mobile hospitals. Alternatively, the status quo of marginal preparedness can be maintained. In any event, achieving higher levels of preparedness likely will take the combined commitment of the hospital industry, public and private payers, and federal, state, and local governments. Ultimately, the costs of preparedness will be borne by the public in the form of taxes, higher healthcare costs, or through the acceptance of greater risk.","De Lorenzo, Robert A",Prehospital and disaster medicine,364,8

Poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs) are an ancient family of enzymes, as evidenced by the poly-ADP-ribosylating activities reported in dinoflagellates and archaebacteria and by the identification of Parp-like genes in eubacterial and archaeabacterial genomes. Six genes encoding ""bona fide"" PARP enzymes have been identified in mammalians: PARP1, PARP2, PARP3, PARP4/vPARP, PARP5/Tankyrases-1 and PARP6/Tankyrases-2. The best studied of these enzymes PARP1 plays a primary role in the process of poly-ADP-ribosylation.

However, in healthcare risk prediction applications, the proportion of cases with the condition (label) of interest is often very low relative to the available sample size. Though very prevalent in healthcare, such imbalanced classification settings are also common and challenging in many other scenarios. So motivated, we propose a variational disentanglement approach to semi-parametrically learn from rare events in heavily imbalanced classification problems. Specifically, we leverage the imposed extreme-distribution behavior on a latent space to extract information from low-prevalence events, and develop a robust prediction arm that joins the merits of the generalized additive model and isotonic neural nets. Results on synthetic studies and diverse real-world datasets, including mortality prediction on a COVID-19 cohort, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing alternatives.","Xiu, Zidi; Tao, Chenyang; Gao, Michael; Davis, Connor; Goldstein, Benjamin; Henao, Ricardo",ArXiv,364,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-three patients undergoing dialysis with Permcath catheter, 49 with Palindrome catheter, and 56 with AVF were recruited. Urea clearance (KT/V), urea reduction rate, and the highest blood flow at the arteriovenous junction during dialysis were determined during the dialysis sessions. Catheter-related infection, catheter-associated thrombosis, and annual patency rate were also evaluated. RESULTS In patients using Permcath catheter for dialysis, the incidence of secondary renal injury (metabolic diseases, hypertension, and ischemic kidney diseases) was 73.1%, which was significantly higher than that in patients with AVF (51.5%; P = .001). In the Palindrome group, maximum blood flow, KT/V, urea reduction rate, and annual patency rate were significantly higher than those in the Permcath group, and the incidence of access-related infection was significantly higher than that in the AVF group. In the Palindrome group, the prevalence of thromboembolism was 30.6%, which was significantly lower than that in the Permcath group (46.5%), but higher than that in the AVF group (5.4%). CONCLUSIONS For dialysis patients, Palindrome catheter was superior to Permcath catheter and comparable with the AVF in terms of the maximum blood flow, dialysis adequacy, and annual patency rate. Dialysis with Palindrome catheter has a high infection rate and a high incidence of thromboembolism as in the dialysis with Permcath catheter.","Li, Mingxu; Zhang, Zhiyong; Yu, Yongwu; Chen, Hong; Li, Xinxin; Ma, Junhong; Dong, Zhen",Iranian journal of kidney diseases,364,20

We evaluated the nasal and serum levels of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) in patients with acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis and investigated the correlation of these levels with illness severity. Fifty-one patients (28 boys, 23 girls) with acute bronchiolitis positive for RSV by direct immunoenzyme assay in nasal secretions (Group A) were studied. Thirty healthy children (17 boys, 13 girls) constituted the control group (Group B). Subjects in both groups were matched for age and gender. The ages (mean+/-SE) in Groups A and B were 4.5+/-0.41 and 5.0+/-0.65 mo, respectively. Venous blood and nasal secretions were taken from patients in group A on 1, 5, and 15 days after admission and once from controls (Group B) for determinations of HNE in nasal lavage and serum, as well as white blood counts (WBC). The peripheral blood eosinophil and neutrophil counts were elevated in 22/51 patients (43.1%) and 15/51 patients (29.4%), respectively. In nasal lavage specimens, neutrophils represented>or=75% and eosinophils>2% of all cells in 42/51 (82.0%) patients and 11/51 (21.5%) patients, respectively. There was strong correlation between the level of HNE and the percentage of neutrophils in nasal lavage (r=0.92). The mean nasal HNE concentrations of the patients on 1, 5, and 15 days after admission were higher than those of Group B (p<0.0001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). Mean serum HNE concentrations on 1, 5, and 15 days after admission were higher in Group A than in Group B (p<0.0001, p<0.0001, p<0.0001, respectively). Nasal and serum HNE concentrations showed no correlations with the clinical score of disease severity (r=0.28 and r=0.29, respectively). This study shows that (a) serum and nasal HNE concentrations were significantly higher in RSV bronchiolitis patients than in controls, (b) they did not return to normal after the respiratory symptoms had improved, and (c) they showed no significant correlations with clinical score of severity. The results indicate that neutrophils contribute significantly to airway inflammation in these subjects and HNE levels in serum and nasal lavage may be useful markers of inflammation in acute RSV bronchiolitis.","Emboriadou, M; Hatzistilianou, Maria; Magnisali, Ch; Sakelaropoulou, A; Exintari, M; Conti, Pio; Aivazis, V",Annals of clinical and laboratory science,364,20

However, there is still disagreement as to the likelihood and frequency of such vertical transmission. OBJECTIVE: Summarize and analyze the published evidence on forms of SARS-CoV-2 vertical transmission (either intrauterine or intrapartum). EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We carried out a review of literature published in English and Spanish from January 1, 2020 through October 30, 2020. Search engines included PubMed/MEDLINE, SciELO, LILACS, Cochrane, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and medRxiv. There were no restrictions concerning type of study. The review included 48 original research articles, 11 review articles, a meta-analysis, 2 pre-published articles, 15 systematic reviews, and 10 editorials or comments. DEVELOPMENT: Medical thinking on congenital or intrapartum maternal-fetal/neonatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has evolved from preliminary evidence that was divided as to whether these forms of vertical transmission were even possible to current evidence support ing both forms of transmission and hypothesizing as to the mechanisms that guide them. The presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in maternal, placental, fetal or neonatal tissues has been demonstrated by RT-PCR, specific immunoglobulin detection tests, immunostaining and in-situ hybridization. It is estimated that infections acquired either congenitally or intrapartum occur in 1.8%-8.0% of newborns born to women who test positive for COVID-19 at the end of their pregnancies. This review found 53 neonates who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first 48 hours of life by either RT-PCR or specific IgM tests. According to criteria outlined in this review, the timing of infection corresponded to congenital or intrapartum transmission in 39.6% (21/53) of COVID-19-positive newborns, to postpartum transmission in 15.1% (8/53) and remains unspecified in 45.3% (24/53). CONCLUSIONS: Congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection in the fetus/newborn is possible, but rare. International collaborative studies using common epidemiological surveillance instruments would allow for a more precise specification of the frequency of congenital and intrapartum SARS-CoV-2 infection at the population level.","Robaina-Castellanos, Gerardo Rogelio; Riesgo-Rodríguez, Solangel de la Caridad",MEDICC Rev,364,25

Repurposing marketed therapies may be an effective strategy for finding treatments quickly and, recently, in vitro and clinical testing of such therapies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has skyrocketed. However, not all marketed drugs showing in vitro efficacy could achieve therapeutic concentrations in humans and discernment of drugs that have favorable pharmacokinetic properties can save time and resources for future studies. Here, we compile marketed therapies, including supplements, having anti-viral activity with in vitro, in vivo, and/or clinical data against &#945; and ß coronaviruses into tables, alongside their pharmacokinetic properties. We point to several drugs or supplements available for immediate repurposing because they have achievable blood concentrations in humans well above their inhibitory concentrations against coronaviruses. This compilation may contribute to the implementation of rapid future studies by narrowing the vast number of marketed drugs reported for potential efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of their pharmacokinetic properties and published coronavirus data.","Cicka, Danielle; Sukhatme, Vikas P",J. mol. cell biol.

For DNA molecules, digital PCR has been developed as an absolute quantification method which is not dependent on external calibrators. While when it comes to RNA molecules, reverse transcription (RT) step must be taken before PCR amplification to obtain cDNA. With different kinds of reverse transcriptase (RTase) and RT reaction conditions being used in laboratory assays, the efficiency of RT process differs a lot which led variety in quantification results of RNA molecules. In this study, we developed HPLC method combined with enzymatic digestion of RNA to nucleotides for quantification of RNA without RT process. This method was metrologically traceable to four nuceloside monophosphate (NMP) Certification Reference Materials of National Institute of Metrology, China (NIMC) for insurance of accuracy. The established method was used to evaluate the reverse transcription digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-dPCR) of three target genes of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) RNA, including open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab), nucleocapsid protein (N) and envelope protein (E) gene. Three available RT kits had been evaluated and disparities were observed for the RT efficiency varied from 9% to 182%. It is thus demonstrated that HPLC combined with enzymatic digestion could be a useful method to quantify RNA molecules and evaluate RT efficiency. It is suggested that RT process should be optimized and identified in RNA quantification assays.","Niu, Chunyan; Dong, Lianhua; Gao, Yunhua; Zhang, Yongzhuo; Wang, Xia; Wang, Jing",Talanta,364,19

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis on Connecticut nursing home (n = 215) COVID-19 report, linked to other nursing home files and county counts of confirmed cases and deaths. Multivariable two-part models determined the associations of key nursing home characteristics with the likelihood of at least one confirmed case (or death) in the facility, and with the count of cases (deaths) among facilities with at least one confirmed case (death). SETTING: All Connecticut nursing homes (n = 215). PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths among residents. RESULTS: The average number of confirmed cases was eight per nursing home (zero in 107 facilities), and the average number of confirmed deaths was 1.7 per nursing home (zero in 131 facilities). Among facilities with at least one confirmed case, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing (per resident day) was associated with 22% fewer confirmed cases (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = .78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .68-.89; P < .001); compared with one- to three-star facilities, four- or five-star facilities had 13% fewer confirmed cases (IRR = .87; 95% CI = .78-.97; P < .015), and facilities with high concentration of Medicaid residents (IRR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.02-1.32; P = .025) or racial/ethnic minority residents (IRR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.03-1.29; P = .026) had 16% and 15% more confirmed cases, respectively, than their counterparts. Among facilities with at least one death, every 20-minute increase in RN staffing significantly predicted 26% fewer COVID-19 deaths (IRR = .74; 95% CI = I .55-1.00; P = .047).

The importance of vaccination (v) during the Covid19 (CV19) pandemic has been widely discussed in the media. To ascertain the receptiveness of type 2 diabetics (T2D) to fluv during the CV19 pandemic and their acceptance of an eventual CV19 vaccine (CVv) we carried out telephone interviews with 34 unselected T2D pts in Montreal, Quebec post the 1st wave of CV19 in that region. Pts were asked if they planned taking the fluv and/or an eventual CVv, reasons for reticence to v, and attitudes toward and compliance with public health (PH) directives. They were also asked their primary source of health related information. Recent HbA1c and insulin use were recorded. Thirty four T2Ds were surveyed, 22 M 50–87 yrs (mean 69.2) and 12 F 49–84 yrs (mean 68.8). Eleven M and 5 F were on insulin. HbA1c ranged from 5.9–13.0 (mean 7.3). None of the pts had recently discussed v with a healthcare provider (HCP). One pt received his health related information from Facebook, the others from mainstream media. None had contraindications to v. None had been diagnosed with CV19. Past influenza history was unknown. Forty one percent (14/34) of pts, 11 M 50–86 yrs (mean 66.0) and 3 F 49–66 yrs (mean 59.0) did not plan to take the fluv. They explained their decisions as never having taken fluv (12 pts) or having been ill despite having taken it (2 pts). Neither accessibility nor cost were issues. Two F, 62 and 66 yrs, who refused fluv also refused CVv. Six M aged 60–86 yrs (mean 70.5) and 1 F aged 73 yrs were planning to wait to access real life safety (6pts) or efficacy (1pt) data before accepting CVv. All pts claimed to be following PH guidelines including social distancing, hand washing, and mask recommendations;91.2% (31/34) fully agreed with PH policies, 2 were in moderate agreement and 1 thought PH policy was not strict enough. Of the latter 3 pts none planned on taking the fluv. One planned taking the CVv, 1 planned not to, and the 3rd planned to wait before deciding. Despite a long history of use, recommendations by experts, and free and easy accessibility, T2D pts questioned after the 1st wave of CV19 are not convinced of the fluv’s importance. Despite high case numbers and being themselves at high risk, not all T2Ds are willing to unequivocally accept a potential Health Canada sanctioned CVv. This study underlines the important work HCPs have ahead in educating and reassuring pts with regard to vaccination.","Gilfix, Reisa Elstein Jack Elstein Eleanor",Journal of the Endocrine Society,364,20

Recent clinical guidelines have supported the use of corticosteroids or remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19. However, uncertainty remains about which patients are most likely to benefit from treatment with either drug; such knowledge is crucial for avoiding preventable adverse effects, minimizing costs, and effectively allocating resources. This study presents a machine-learning system with the capacity to identify patients in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with improved survival time. METHODS: Gradient-boosted decision-tree models used for predicting treatment benefit were trained and tested on data from electronic health records dated between December 18, 2019, and October 18, 2020, from adult patients (age &#8805;18 years) with COVID-19 in 10 US hospitals. Models were evaluated for performance in identifying patients with longer survival times when treated with a corticosteroid versus remdesivir. Fine and Gray proportional-hazards models were used for identifying significant findings in treated and nontreated patients, in a subset of patients who received supplemental oxygen, and in patients identified by the algorithm. Inverse probability-of-treatment weights were used to adjust for confounding. Models were trained and tested separately for each treatment. FINDINGS: Data from 2364 patients were included, with men comprising slightly more than 50% of the sample; 893 patients were treated with remdesivir, and 1471 were treated with a corticosteroid. After adjustment for confounding, neither corticosteroids nor remdesivir use was associated with increased survival time in the overall population or in the subpopulation that received supplemental oxygen. However, in the populations identified by the algorithms, both corticosteroids and remdesivir were significantly associated with an increase in survival time, with hazard ratios of 0.56 and 0.40, respectively (both, P = 0.04). IMPLICATIONS: Machine-learning methods have the capacity to identify hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in whom treatment with a corticosteroid or remdesivir is associated with an increase in survival time. These methods may help to improve patient outcomes and allocate resources during the COVID-19 crisis.","Lam, Carson; Siefkas, Anna; Zelin, Nicole S; Barnes, Gina; Dellinger, R Phillip; Vincent, Jean-Louis; Braden, Gregory; Burdick, Hoyt; Hoffman, Jana; Calvert, Jacob; Mao, Qingqing; Das, Ritankar",Clin. ther,364,1

Disruption of GI functions is associated with the development of severe GI disorders as well as the alteration of food intake and caloric balance. Functional GI disorders as well as the dysregulation of energy balance and food intake are frequently associated with, or result from, alterations in the central regulation of GI control. The faithful and rapid transmission of information from the stomach and upper GI tract to second order neurons of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) relies on the delicate modulation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission, as does the relay of integrated signals from the NTS to parasympathetic efferent neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV). Many studies have focused on understanding the physiological and pathophysiological modulation of these glutamatergic synapses, although their role in the control and regulation of GI functions has lagged behind that of cardiovascular and respiratory functions. The purpose of this review is to examine the current literature exploring the role of glutamatergic transmission in the DVC in the regulation of Gl functions.","Clyburn, Courtney; Browning, Kirsteen N",Am. j. physiol. gasterointest. liver physiol,364,16

Here, we created essential-gene CRISPRi knockdown libraries in biofilm-forming Bacillus subtilis and measured competitive fitness during colony co-culture with wild type. Partial knockdown of some translation-related genes reduced growth rates and led to out-competition. Media composition led some knockdowns to compete differentially as biofilm versus non-biofilm colonies. Cells depleted for the alanine racemase AlrA died in monoculture but survived in a biofilm-colony co-culture via nutrient sharing. Rescue was enhanced in biofilm-colony co-culture with a matrix-deficient parent, due to a mutualism involving nutrient and matrix sharing. We identified several examples of mutualism involving matrix sharing that occurred in three-dimensional biofilm colonies but not when cultured in two dimensions. Thus, growth in a three-dimensional colony can promote genetic diversity through sharing of secreted factors and may drive evolution of mutualistic behavior.","Arjes, Heidi A; Willis, Lisa; Gui, Haiwen; Xiao, Yangbo; Peters, Jason; Gross, Carol; Huang, Kerwyn Casey",eLife (Cambridge),364,16

Exposure to respiratory droplets can theoretically be reduced by surgical mask usage. However, there is a lack of experimental evidence supporting surgical mask usage for prevention of COVID-19. METHODS: We used a well-established golden Syrian hamster SARS-CoV-2 model. We placed SARS-CoV-2-challenged index hamsters and naive hamsters into closed system units each comprising 2 different cages separated by a polyvinyl chloride air porous partition with unidirectional airflow within the isolator. The effect of a surgical mask partition placed between the cages was investigated. Besides clinical scoring, hamster specimens were tested for viral load, histopathology, and viral nucleocapsid antigen expression. RESULTS: Noncontact transmission was found in 66.7% (10/15) of exposed naive hamsters. Surgical mask partition for challenged index or naive hamsters significantly reduced transmission to 25% (6/24, P = .018).

In very different ways, the immune and taste systems both fulfill this function, with growing evidence suggesting a relationship between the two, through shared signaling pathways, receptors, and feedback loops. The purpose of this review was to explore recent reports on taste and immunity in model animals and in humans to explore our understanding of the interplay between these systems. RECENT FINDINGS: Acute infections in the upper airway, as with SARS-CoV-2, are associated with a proinflammatory state, and blunted taste perception. Further, recent findings highlight taste receptors working as immune sentinels throughout the body. Work in humans and mice also points to inflammation from obesity impacting taste, altering taste bud abundance and composition. There is accumulating evidence that taste cells, and particularly their receptors, play a role in airway and gut immunity, responsive to invading organisms. Inflammation itself may further act on taste buds and other taste receptor expressing cells throughout the body as a form of homeostatic control.","Goodman, Jason R; Dando, Robin",Curr Nutr Rep,364,16

Materials and Methods: Women veterans aged 45-60 years registered at the Miami, West Palm Beach, and Orlando Veterans Affairs Healthcare Systems (VAHS). Intervention group: women in the Miami VAHS enrolled in My HealtheVet who were sent an invitation, agreed to participate, and completed the baseline survey. Comparison group: women from the Miami, West Palm Beach, and Orlando VAHS who responded to the baseline survey. Results: The intervention group enrolled 269 women at Miami VAHS: average age 53.2 years; 42.4% white, 43.1% black, and 24.2% Hispanic; 95.9% already used My Healthe Vet. The Comparison group had 590 women: average age 53.8 years; 70.8% white, 20.7% black, and 10.2% Hispanic; 57.6% already used My Healthe Vet. Conclusions: The differences between the intervention and comparison groups likely represent the regional demographic variations and the disparate recruitment techniques adopted for the two groups. Using within- and between-group comparisons at the end of the 6-month intervention, this novel project will evaluate the feasibility of a patient portal intervention on knowledge and shared decision-making regarding menopause among racially and ethnically diverse women. The study highlights the scalable and enormous potential for patient portals in nonurgent chronic disease management and shared decision-making, important in the existing health care climate, wherein ""meaningful use"" of electronic health records is mandated. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, medical care has abruptly changed to telehealth and this approach to patient education is more relevant now than ever before.

Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have not been well described. We describe the prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and clinical phenotype of seropositive children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital in South India. METHODS: To determine the seropositivity and describe the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 infection amongst hospitalised children, we performed a prospective clinical data collection and blood sampling of children admitted to Kanchi Kamakoti CHILDS Trust Hospital, Chennai, India over 4 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In seropositive children, we compared antibody titres between children with and without PIMS-TS. RESULTS: Of 463 children, 91 (19.6%) were seropositive. The median (range) age of seropositive children was 5 years (1 month-17 years). Clinical presentation was consistent with Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated or related with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) in 48% (44/91) of seropositive children. The median (range) antibody titre was 54.8 (11.1-170.9) AU/ml among all seropositive children. The median antibody titre among the children with PIMS-TS (60.3 AU/mL) was significantly (p = 0.01) higher when compared to the children without PIMS-TS (54.8 AU/mL). CONCLUSION: We describe the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 amongst hospitalised children in a LMIC tertiary children's hospital. Almost half of the seropositive children had PIMS-TS. Antibody levels may be helpful in the diagnosis and disease stratification of PIMS-TS. LAY SUMMARY: Children usually present with minimal or no symptoms of COVID-19 infection. However, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) or Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome associated or related with SARS-CoV-2 infection (PIMS-TS) has emerged as a distinctive paediatric illness related to SARS-CoV-2. Recently, antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 is being used increasingly as a diagnostic test for PIMS-TS. However, data on the antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children are sparse. We, therefore, attempted to identify the seropositivity and describe the clinical spectrum of COVID-19 infection amongst infants and children getting hospitalised in a children's hospital in south India. Nearly one-fifth of the hospitalised children tested serology positive over 4 months. Antibody levels in children with PIMS-TS were significantly higher in comparison to the other two groups (acute COVID-19 infection and children without PIMS-TS). Results from our study suggest that all children are at risk of COVID-19 infection though they may present with mild illness or no symptoms. We also observed that antibody testing may have a possible role in diagnosis of PIMS-TS.","Venkataraman, Aishwarya; Balasubramanian, S; Putilibai, Sulochana; Lakshan Raj, S; Amperayani, Sumanth; Senthilnathan, S; Manoharan, Anand; Sophi, Arokia; Amutha, R; Sadasivam, Kalaimaran; Goenka, Anu; Ramanan, A V",J. trop. pedriatr,364,20

A 59-year-old female admitted for shortness of breath (SOB), productive cough, fever, and nausea in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. Oxygen saturation was 81% necessitating supplemental oxygen. She was transferred to intensive care unit (ICU) for worsening hypoxia; intubated and received tocilizumab following which her oxygen requirements improved. A 52-year-old female admitted from an outside hospital with SOB, intubated for worsening hypoxia, in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. She received tocilizumab 400 mg intravenous for 2 doses on ICU admission, with clinical improvement. A 56-year-old female hospitalized with worsening SOB, fever, and cough for 8 days saturating 88% on room air in the setting of COVID-19 pneumonia. Worsening hypoxia necessitated high flow nasal cannula. She was transferred to the ICU where she received 2 doses of tocilizumab 400 mg intravenous. She did not require intubation and was transitioned to nasal cannula. A hyperinflammatory syndrome may cause a life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Tocilizumab is the first marketed interleukin-6 blocking antibody, and through targeting interleukin-6 receptors likely has a role in treating cytokine storm.

Though drugs like remdesivir, favipiravir, and dexamethasone found beneficial for COVID-19 management, they have limitations clinically, and vaccine development takes a long time. The researchers have reported key proteins which could act as druggable targets. Among them, the major protease Mpro is first published, plays a prominent role in viral replication and an attractive drug-target for drug discovery. Hence, to target Mpro and inhibit it, we accomplished the virtual screening of US-FDA approved drugs using well-known drug repurposing approach by computer-aided tools. METHODS: The protein Mpro, PDB-ID 6LU7 was imported to Maestro graphical user interphase of Schrödinger software. The US-FDA approved drug structures are imported from DrugBank and docked after preliminary protein and ligand preparation. The drugs are shortlisted based on the docking scores in the Standard Precision method (SP-docking) and then based on the type of molecular interactions they are studied for molecular dynamics simulations. RESULTS: The docking and molecular interactions studies, five drugs emerged as potential hits by forming hydrophilic, hydrophobic, electrostatic interactions. The drugs such as arbutin, terbutaline, barnidipine, tipiracil and aprepitant identified as potential hits. Among the drugs, tipiracil and aprepitant interacted with the Mpro consistently, and they turned out to be most promising. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the possible exploration for drug repurposing using computer-aided docking tools and the potential roles of tipiracil and aprepitant, which can be explored further in the treatment of COVID-19.","Baby, Krishnaprasad; Maity, Swastika; Mehta, Chetan H; Suresh, Akhil; Nayak, Usha Y; Nayak, Yogendra",Arch. med. res,364,1

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has enabled in-depth analysis of intercellular heterogeneity in various diseases. However, its full potentials for personalized medicine are yet to be reached. Towards this, we propose A Single-cell Guided pipeline to Aid Repurposing of Drugs (ASGARD). ASGARD can repurpose single drugs for each cell cluster and for multiple cell clusters at individual patient levels; it can also predict personalized drug combinations to address the intercellular heterogeneity within each patient. We tested ASGARD on three independent datasets, including advanced metastatic breast cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). On single-drug therapy, ASGARD shows significantly better average accuracy (AUC=0.95) compared to two other single-cell pipelines (AUC 0.69 and 0.57) and two other bulk-cell-based drug repurposing methods (AUC 0.80 and 0.75). The top-ranked drugs, such as fulvestrant and neratinib for breast cancer, tretinoin and vorinostat for leukemia, and chloroquine and enalapril for severe COVID19, are either approved by FDA or in clinical trials treating corresponding diseases. In conclusion, ASGARD is a promising pipeline guided by single-cell RNA-seq data, for repurposing personalized drugs and drug combinations.

However, inherent to such partnerships can be imbalanced power dynamics, which may pose a barrier and prevent the project from achieving its potential. The sources and impacts of these power dynamics are complex and the solutions multi-faceted. In our project, these imbalances of power were mitigated because the correct steps were taken both by the educators, as well as by the organisation. We produced outputs that led to significant change in the curriculum, in the short space of 2 weeks. I attribute this largely to the careful management of power dynamics throughout.

However, the downstream effects regarding susceptibilities to secondary infection risk remains unknown. This study seeks to determine risk differences for secondary infections among COVID-19 patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Methods: We conducted a matched retrospective cohort study from two large, acute care hospitals in Western Connecticut from March 1, to May 31, 2020. We collected variables using manual medical record abstraction. The primary exposure variable was any dose of tocilizumab. The primary outcome was any healthcare-associated bacterial or fungal infection as defined by the National Healthcare Safety Network. We performed a Kaplan–Meier analysis to assess the crude difference in cumulative probability of healthcare-associated infection (HAI) across exposure groups. We also performed a multivariable Cox regression analysis to determine the hazard ratio for HAI by exposure group while controlling for potential confounders. Results: The Kaplan–Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in the cumulative probability of HAI across groups. The adjusted hazard of HAI for patients given tocilizumab was 0.85 times that of patients not given tocilizumab (95% confidence interval = 0.29, 2.52, P = 0.780) after controlling for relevant confounders. Conclusions: Tocilizumab did not increase the incidence of secondary infection among COVID-19 patients.

The intestinal barrier disruption would allow bacterial translocation and increase in the severity of such lesions. The aim of the present study was to evaluate intestinal injury after ischemia and reperfusion with and without antibiotic coverage. Under ether anesthesia forty-two Wistar male rats were submitted to an abdominal midline incision. The mesenteric arteries were clamped for 30 minutes. After this period of ischemia, reperfusion was induced for equal period of time. Twenty-one rats received eritromicin, 50mg/kg orally, 24 hours before the operation. The remain animals were operated without antibiotics coverage. Each of the two groups animals were divided into 3 others groups: control, ischemia and ischemia-reperfusion groups. After the reperfusion period, a intestinal segment was excised for histopathological studies. Results were evaluated according to the criteria of CHIU and col. and were submitted to statical analysis. In the control group any difference was found in the intestines of the animals with and without antibiotic coverage. The ischemia group, with or without antibiotic, showed lesions that ranged from vilos loss to mucosal infarction. The lesions were similar in the ischemia-reperfusion group. We verified that intestines submitted to reperfusion under antibiotic coverage showed more severe lesions than ischemic intestines without antibiotics coverage (p= 0,0303). We can conclude that the administrations of antibiotics before the induction of ischemia or ischemia-reperfusion does not improve the severity of histological lesions.","de Lourdes Pessole Biondo-Simões, Maria; Hintz Greca, Fernando; Ioshi, Sergio; Izat El Tawil, Imad; Martinez Menini, Carla; Cesar Rampazzo, Júlio",Acta cir. bras.,364,20

Nevertheless, to mandate the use of face masks or coverings in public areas, additional human resources are required, which is tedious and attention-intensive. To automate the monitoring process, one of the promising solutions is to leverage existing object detection models to detect the faces with or without masks. As such, security officers do not have to stare at the monitoring devices or crowds, and only have to deal with the alerts triggered by the detection of faces without masks. Existing object detection models usually focus on designing the CNN-based network architectures for extracting discriminative features. However, the size of training datasets of face mask detection is small, while the difference between faces with and without masks is subtle. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a face mask detection framework that uses the context attention module to enable the effective attention of the feed-forward convolution neural network by adapting their attention maps feature refinement. Moreover, we further propose an anchor-free detector with Triplet-Consistency Representation Learning by integrating the consistency loss and the triplet loss to deal with the small-scale training data and the similarity between masks and occlusions.

In the past year many researchers have proposed different models and approaches to explore in what ways the spread of the disease could be mitigated. One of the models that have been used a great deal is the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. Some researchers have modified the traditional SEIR model, and proposed new versions of it. However, to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art papers have not considered the effect of different vaccine types, meaning single shot and double shot vaccines, in their SEIR model. In this paper, we propose a modified version of the SEIR model which takes into account the effect of different vaccine types. We compare how different policies for the administration of the vaccine can influence the rate at which people are exposed to the disease, get infected, recover, and pass away. Our results suggest that taking the double shot vaccine such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna does a better job at mitigating the spread and fatality rate of the disease compared to the single shot vaccine, due to its higher efficacy.","Ogholbake, Aram Ansary; Khamfroush, Hana",,364,1

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests are expensive, reliant on centralized labs, can take days to deliver results, and are prone to backlogs and supply shortages. Antigen tests that bind and detect the surface proteins of a virus are rapid and scalable but suffer from high false negative rates. To address this problem, an inexpensive, simple, and robust 60-minute do-it-yourself (DIY) workflow to detect viral RNA from nasal swabs or saliva with high sensitivity (0.1 to 2 viral particles/µL) and specificity (>97% true negative rate) utilizing reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) was developed. ALERT (Accessible LAMP-Enabled Rapid Test) incorporates the following features: (1) increased shelf-life and ambient temperature storage, compared to liquid reaction mixes, by using wax layers to isolate enzymes from other reagents; (2) improved specificity compared to other LAMP end-point reporting methods, by using sequence-specific QUASR (quenching of unincorporated amplification signal reporters); (3) increased sensitivity, compared to methods without purification through use of a magnetic wand to enable pipette-free concentration of sample RNA and cell debris removal; (4) quality control with a nasopharyngeal-specific mRNA target; and (5) co-detection of other respiratory viruses, such as influenza B, by multiplexing QUASR-modified RT-LAMP primer sets. The flexible nature of the ALERT workflow allows easy, at-home and point-of-care testing for individuals and higher-throughput processing for labs and hospitals. With minimal effort, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific primer sets can be swapped out for other targets to repurpose ALERT to detect other viruses, microorganisms, or nucleic acid-based markers.","Bektas, Ali; Covington, Michael F; Aidelberg, Guy; Arce, Anibal; Matute, Tamara; Núñez, Isaac; Walsh, Julia; Boutboul, David; Delaugerre, Constance; Lindner, Ariel B; Federici, Fernán; Jayaprakash, Anitha D",Viruses,364,20

However, little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on this historically disadvantaged population. This study assessed the extent US PIs have been adversely affected by COVID-19 across the 50 states. METHODS: Using state-level national data as of September 9th, 2020, we conducted a secondary-data analysis of COVID-19 cases and deaths in PIs relative to their population representation and other racial groups, case odds ratios, and age-adjusted standard mortality ratios. KEY RESULTS: Only 46% of states reported PI cases and 36% of states reported PI deaths. Of 23 states with available data on PIs, PIs were overrepresented in COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to their population representation in 21 and 14 states, respectively. The proportion of COVID-19 cases and deaths to the PI population was highest among all racial groups in 15 and 9 states, respectively. PIs had higher odds of exposure to COVID-19 than Whites in 21 of 23 states, and higher number of observed deaths than expected in 6 of 7 states with available PI data.

A complex challenge faced by the scientific community is to address the factors that determine whether the cross-species transmissions will result in spillover or sustained onwards infections. Here we review recent literature and present a perspective on current approaches we are using to understand the mechanisms underlying host shifts. We highlight the usefulness of the interactions between Drosophila species and viruses as an ideal study model. Additionally, we discuss how cross-infection experiments - when pathogens from a natural reservoir are intentionally injected in novel host species- can test the effect cross-species transmissions may have on the fitness of virus and host, and how the host phylogeny may influence this response. We also discuss experiments evaluating how cooccurrence with other viruses or the presence of the endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia may affect the performance of new viruses in a novel host. Finally, we discuss the need of surveys of virus diversity in natural populations using next-generation sequencing technologies. In the long term, these approaches can contribute to a better understanding of the basic biology of host shifts.","Pimentel, André C; Beraldo, Camila S; Cogni, Rodrigo",Genet Mol Biol,364,30

Modified Nernst-Planck Poisson (mNPP) equations are used to calculate the ion density per unit area in a parallel plate capacitor geometry with a bulk ion concentration of 215 &#8804; cbulk &#8804; 1782 mol/m3. With electrodes of equal size at a 2 V potential difference, the EDL ion density of the single-ion conductor is â¼7 × 1013 ions/cm2, which is approximately 50% of the ion density induced in the dual-ion conductor. However, this difference is reduced to 8% when the electrode at which the cationic EDL forms is 10 times smaller than the counter electrode. Thus, for a field-effect transistor gated by a single-ion conductor, it is especially important to have a large gate-to-channel size ratio to achieve strong ion doping. The modeled ion densities are validated by Hall-effect measurements on graphene Hall bars gated by a polyethylene oxide (PEO)-based single-ion conductor. The sheet carrier density, nS, is â¼2 × 1013 cm-2 at Vg = 2 V, which is 3.5 times smaller than the predicted value and has the same order of magnitude as the ns measured for a PEO-based, dual-ion conductor on the same graphene. The numerical modeling results can be approximated by a simple analysis of capacitors in series, where the EDLs are modeled as capacitors with thickness estimated by the sum of the Debye screening length and the Stern layer. The series of capacitor estimate agrees with the numerical modeling of the dual-ion conductor to within 10% and the single-ion conductor to within 30% from 0.25 to 2 V (cbulk = 925 mol/m3); similar agreement is observed in the concentration range of 353-1650 mol/m3 for both single- and dual-ion conductors.","Woeppel, Aaron; Xu, Ke; Kozhakhmetov, Azimkhan; Awate, Shubham; Robinson, Joshua A; Fullerton-Shirey, Susan K",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),364,1

We analysed cardiological parameters including ECG and high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) level and their association with mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We retrospectively analysed the demographics, comorbidities, laboratory findings and electrocardiographic parameters of 453 consecutive patients, whose outcome was clear, died or discharged. Findings were compared between survivors and non-survivors. Also, the same comparison was made between cardiac injury and no-cardiac injury subgroups. RESULTS: The cardiac injury group had significantly higher in-hospital mortality than the no-cardiac injury group. Also, frequencies of atrial fibrillation, axis change, ST-segment/T-wave change, fragmented QRS, premature atrial/ventricular contraction was found to be higher in the cardiac injury group. Moreover, non-survivors had longer QRS intervals, more frequent ST-segment/T-wave changes and isolated S1Q3T3 pattern than surviving patients. Laboratory results showed median values of hs-TnT at the admission of 4.95 ng/L (IQR, 3-12.35) with concentrations markedly higher in the non-surviving patients vs survivors. Hs-TnT value along with age and respiratory rate was found to be an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Comorbidities were more frequently reported in non-surviving and cardiac injury groups than those surviving and without cardiac injury. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 patients, both elevated hs-TnT and ECG abnormalities, suggesting cardiac involvement, on admission portends an ominous prognosis and indicates at higher risk of in-hospital mortality. Prioritised treatment and more aggressive therapeutic strategies could be planned to avoid the occurrence of death in these patients.","Omar, Timor; Karakayali, Muammer; Perincek, Gökhan",Acta Cardiol,364,23

Biochemical and immunogenic characterization of structural proteins and their post-translational modifications in virions, the end-products of the vaccine candidate, would be essential for the quality control and process development of vaccine products and for studying the immunogenicity and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. By using a panel of rabbit antisera against virions and five structural proteins together with a convalescent serum, the spike (S) glycoprotein was shown to be N-linked glycosylated, PNGase F-sensitive, endoglycosidase H-resistant and cleaved by Furin-like proteases into S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S and S1/S2 subunits could form homodimers/trimers. The membrane (M) protein was partially N-linked glycosylated; the accessory protein 3a existed in three different forms, indicative of cleavage and dimerization. Furthermore, analysis of the antigenicity of these proteins and their post-translationally modified forms demonstrated that S protein induced the strongest antibody response in both convalescent and immunized animal sera. Interestingly, immunization with the inactivated vaccine did not elicit antibody response against the S2 subunit, whereas strong antibody response against both S1 and S2 subunits was detected in the convalescent serum. Moreover, vaccination stimulated stronger antibody response against S multimers than did the natural infection. This study revealed that the native S glycoprotein stimulated neutralizing antibodies, while bacterially-expressed S fragments did not.

However, platforms such as Facebook and Twitter continue to pose unique challenges for clinical healthcare providers and public health officials alike. In order to effectively communicate during public health emergencies such as Covid-19, it's increasingly critical for healthcare providers and public health officials to understand how patients gather - and adjudicate the merits of - health-related information online. OBJECTIVE: With that goal in mind, we conducted a survey of 1,003 U.S.-based adults to better understand how health consumers have utilized social media to learn and stay informed about the Covid-19 pandemic, including the extent to which they've relied on credible scientific information sources and how they've gone about ""fact-checking"" pandemic related information. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted via sample purchased through an industry leading market research provider. Results are reported with a 95% confidence level and a margin of error of +/- 3. Participants included 1,003 U.S.-based adults (18 or older). Participants were selected via a stratified quota sampling approach to ensure a representative sample of the U.S. population. Balanced quotas were determined (by region of the country) for gender, age, race, ethnicity. RESULTS: The results show a heavy reliance on social media during the Covid-19 pandemic, with more than three quarters of respondents (76%) saying that they have relied on social media a least ""a little"", and nearly 60% of respondents indicating that they read information about Covid-19 on social media at least once a week. According to the findings, most social media users are unlikely to ""fact-check"" what they see online with a health professional, despite reporting high levels of mistrust in the accuracy of Covid-related information on social media. We also find a greater likelihood of vaccination among those ""following"" more credible, scientific sources on social media during the pandemic (X2 = 50.790; &#966; = 0.258; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that health professionals will need to be both strategic and proactive when engaging with health consumers on social media if they hope to counteract the deleterious effects of erroneous misinformation (as well as malicious disinformation). Effective training, institutional support, and proactive collaboration can help health professionals adapt to evolving patterns of health information seeking.","Neely, Stephen; Eldredge, Christina; Sanders, Ron",J. med. internet res,364,1

Given its recent appearance, our current knowledge about the possible influence that this disease can exert on pregnancy is very limited. One of the unknowns to be solved is whether there is a vertical transmission of the infection during pregnancy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids, the possible presence of this germ in vaginal discharge and amniotic fluid was investigated in four pregnant Caucasian patients affected by mild acute symptoms of COVID-19 during the second trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: There is no laboratory evidence to suggest a possible passage of SARS-CoV-2 from the infected mother to the amniotic fluid. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to expand the investigation of COVID-19 cases diagnosed during pregnancy to clarify the real influence that SARS-CoV-2 has on pregnant women and their offspring, as well as those factors that modulate the disease.","Hijona Elósegui, J J; Carballo García, A L; Fernández Risquez, A C; Bermúdez Quintana, M; Expósito Montes, J F",Rev. clin. esp.

The objective of this systematic review is to identify studies pertaining to antivirals, both as sole and combined therapies, in COVID-19 patients and review the clinical outcomes of these treatment methods. AREAS COVERED: A systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items or Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was done on Medline, Global Health, and EMBASE using keywords and MeSH terms relevant to COVID- 19 and antivirals. Limits were put on date to obtain articles between December 2019 to May 2020 (the time at which the search was performed). 776 articles were identified and screened. After screening, 16 studies were included. The narrative synthesis revealed three key themes (1) Use of antivirals only (such as lopinavir, umifenovir, and remdesivir), (2) Use of lopinavir-ritonavir alongside other treatments, and (3) Use of other antivirals in combination with other treatments. EXPERT OPINION: Using antivirals in combination with other treatments has potential; however, further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are required to identify the best candidate components that should comprise combined treatments for COVID-19. This should optimize treatment efficacy and improve patient outcomes.","Hussain, Nafisa; Yoganathan, Anusha; Hewage, Savini; Alom, Samiha; Harky, Amer",Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther,364,1

However, national polls conducted before vaccine distribution began suggested that many persons were hesitant to receive COVID-19 vaccination (2). To examine perceptions toward COVID-19 vaccine and intentions to be vaccinated, in September and December 2020, CDC conducted household panel surveys among a representative sample of U.S. adults. From September to December, vaccination intent (defined as being absolutely certain or very likely to be vaccinated) increased overall (from 39.4% to 49.1%); the largest increase occurred among adults aged &#8805;65 years. If defined as being absolutely certain, very likely, or somewhat likely to be vaccinated, vaccination intent increased overall from September (61.9%) to December (68.0%). Vaccination nonintent (defined as not intending to receive a COVID-19 vaccination) decreased among all adults (from 38.1% to 32.1%) and among most sociodemographic groups. Younger adults, women, non-Hispanic Black (Black) persons, adults living in nonmetropolitan areas, and adults with lower educational attainment, with lower income, and without health insurance were most likely to report lack of intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Intent to receive COVID-19 vaccine increased among adults aged &#8805;65 years by 17.1 percentage points (from 49.1% to 66.2%), among essential workers by 8.8 points (from 37.1% to 45.9%), and among adults aged 18-64 years with underlying medical conditions by 5.3 points (from 36.5% to 41.8%). Although confidence in COVID-19 vaccines increased during September-December 2020 in the United States, additional efforts to tailor messages and implement strategies to further increase the public's confidence, overall and within specific subpopulations, are needed. Ensuring high and equitable vaccination coverage across all populations is important to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Nguyen, Kimberly H; Srivastav, Anup; Razzaghi, Hilda; Williams, Walter; Lindley, Megan C; Jorgensen, Cynthia; Abad, Neetu; Singleton, James A",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,364,20

Methods: We examined emergency department patients between February 3 and March 31, 2020 with an acute respiratory illness who were tested for SARS-CoV-2. We determined COVID-19 status by PCR and metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS). We compared clinical presentation, diagnostics, treatment, and outcomes. Findings: Among 316 patients, 33 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2; 31 without COVID-19 tested positive for another respiratory virus. Among patients with additional viral testing (27/33), no SARS-CoV-2 co-infections were identified. Compared to those who tested negative, patients with COVID-19 reported longer symptoms duration (median 7d vs. 3d, p < 0.001). Patients with COVID-19 were more often hospitalized (79% vs. 56%, p = 0.014). When hospitalized, patients with COVID-19 had longer hospitalizations (median 10.7d vs. 4.7d, p < 0.001) and more often developed ARDS (23% vs. 3%, p < 0.001). Most comorbidities, medications, symptoms, vital signs, laboratories, treatments, and outcomes did not differ by COVID-19 status. Interpretation: While we found differences in clinical features of COVID-19 compared to other acute respiratory illnesses, there was significant overlap in presentation and comorbidities. Patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be admitted to the hospital, have longer hospitalizations and develop ARDS, and were unlikely to have co-existent viral infections.

As for other innovative nanopharmaceuticals (NPhs), the advancement of robust methods to assess their quality and safety profiles-in line with regulatory needs-is critical for facilitating their development and clinical translation. Asymmetric-flow field-flow fractionation coupled to multiple online optical detectors (MD-AF4) is considered a very versatile and robust approach for the physical characterisation of nanocarriers, and has been used successfully for measuring particle size, polydispersity and physical stability of lipid-based systems, including liposomes and solid lipid nanoparticles. However, the unique core structure of LNP-RNA, composed of ionizable lipids electrostatically complexed with RNA, and the relatively labile lipid-monolayer coating, is more prone to destabilization during focusing in MD-AF4 than previously characterised nanoparticles, resulting in particle aggregation and sample loss. Hence characterisation of LNP-RNA by MD-AF4 needs significant adaptation of the methods developed for liposomes. To improve the performance of MD-AF4 applied to LNP-RNA in a systematic and comprehensive manner, we have explored the use of the frit-inlet channel where, differently from the standard AF4 channel, the particles are relaxed hydrodynamically as they are injected. The absence of a focusing step minimizes contact between the particle and the membrane, reducing artefacts (e.g. sample loss, particle aggregation). Separation in a frit-inlet channel enables satisfactory reproducibility and acceptable sample recovery in the commercially available MD-AF4 instruments. In addition to slice-by-slice measurements of particle size, MD-AF4 also allows to determine particle concentration and the particle size distribution, demonstrating enhanced versatility beyond standard sizing measurements.","Mildner, R; Hak, S; Parot, J; Hyldbakk, A; Borgos, S E; Some, D; Johann, C; Caputo, F",Eur J Pharm Biopharm,364,1

The Fleischner Society has recommended chest X-ray (CXR) in detecting cases with high risk for disease progression, for triaging suspected patients with moderate-to-severe illness, and to eliminate false negatives in areas with high pre-test probability or limited resources. Although CXR is less sensitive than real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in detecting mild COVID-19, it is nevertheless useful because of equipment portability, low cost and practicality in serial assessments of disease progression among hospitalized patients. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to review the typical and relatively atypical CXR manifestations of COVID-19 pneumonia in a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: The CXRs of 136 COVID-19 patients confirmed through real-time RT-PCR from March to May 2020 were reviewed. Literature search was performed using PubMed. RESULTS: A total of 54 patients had abnormal CXR whilst the others were normal. Typical CXR findings included pulmonary consolidation or ground-glass opacities in a multifocal, bilateral peripheral or lower zone distribution, whereas atypical CXR features comprised cavitation and pleural effusion. CONCLUSION: Typical findings of COVID-19 infection in chest computed tomography studies can also be seen in CXR. The presence of atypical features is associated with worse disease outcome. Recognition of these features on CXR will improve accuracy and speed of diagnosing COVID-19 patients.","Chan, Wai Yee; Hamid, Marlina Tanty Ramli; Gowdh, Nadia Fareeda Muhammad; Rahmat, Kartini; Yaakup, Nur Adura; Chai, Chee Shee",,364,24

The addition of this conventional treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma showed potential clinical improvement. For patients with MERS, ribavirin, lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon, and convalescent plasma were continuously recommended. However, a high-dose of corticosteroid was suggested for severe cases only. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir and convalescent plasma was commonly reported. There was limited evidence for the effect of corticosteroids, other antiviral drugs like ribavirin, and favipiravir. Monoclonal antibody of tocilizumab and antimalarial agents of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were also introduced. Among antibiotics for infection therapy, azithromycin was suggested. In conclusion, this study showed the up-to-date evidence of treatment options for COVID-19 that is helpful for the therapy selection and the development of further guidelines and recommendations. Updates of on-going clinical trials and observational studies may confirm the current findings.","Hoang, Tung; Anh, Tho Tran Thi",Infect Chemother,364,20

Zoonotic transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus caused the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which led to over 2 million deaths worldwide. Elevated inflammatory responses and cytotoxicity in the lungs are associated with COVID-19 severity in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals. Bats, which host pathogenic CoVs, operate dampened inflammatory responses and show tolerance to these viruses with mild clinical symptoms. Delineating the mechanisms governing these host-specific inflammatory responses is essential to understand host-virus interactions determining the outcome of pathogenic CoV infections. Here, we describe the essential role of inflammasome activation in determining COVID-19 severity in humans and innate immune tolerance in bats that host several pathogenic CoVs. We further discuss mechanisms leading to inflammasome activation in human SARS-CoV-2 infection and how bats are molecularly adapted to suppress these inflammasome responses. We also report an analysis of functionally important residues of inflammasome components that provide new clues of bat strategies to suppress inflammasome signaling and innate immune responses. As spillover of bat viruses may cause the emergence of new human disease outbreaks, the inflammasome regulation in bats and humans likely provides specific strategies to combat the pathogenic CoV infections.","Nagaraja, Sahana; Jain, Disha; Kesavardhana, Sannula",J. leukoc. biol,364,1

Online polls performed without sound scientific rigour do not yield representative results. Yet, both inside and outside Belarus it is of great importance to obtain precise estimates of the ratings of all candidates. These ratings could function as reliable proxies for the election's outcomes. We conduct an independent poll based on the combination of the data collected via Viber and on the streets of Belarus. The Viber and the street data samples consist of almost 45000 and 1150 unique observations respectively. Bayesian regressions with poststratification were build to estimate ratings of the candidates and rates of early voting turnout for the population as a whole and within various focus subgroups. We show that both the officially announced results of the election and early voting rates are highly improbable. With a probability of at least 95%, Sviatlana Tikhanouskaya's rating lies between 75% and 80%, whereas Aliaksandr Lukashenka's rating lies between 13% and 18% and early voting rate predicted by the method ranges from 9% to 13% of those who took part in the election. These results contradict the officially announced outcomes, which are 10.12%, 80.11%, and 49.54% respectively and lie far outside even the 99.9% credible intervals predicted by our model. The only marginal groups of people where the upper bounds of the 99.9% credible intervals of the rating of Lukashenka are above 50% are people older than 60 and uneducated people. For all other marginal subgroups, including rural residents, even the upper bounds of 99.9% credible intervals for Lukashenka are far below 50%. The same is true for the population as a whole. Thus, with a probability of at least 99.9% Lukashenka could not have had enough electoral support to win the 2020 presidential election in Belarus.","Zahorski, Ales",,364,1

DESIGN: descriptive study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: this study analysed the reports of patients with ILI sent to the Healthcare company from 17 March to 17 April 2020 by their GPs or FP and subsequently classified into: redundant reports (people already known to the healthcare company as confirmed or probable case COVID-19); reports inconsistent with ILI criteria (patients not known to APSS as probable/confirmed case; without ILI criteria); appropriate reports (patients not known to APSS as probable/confirmed case; with ILI criteria). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: proportion of GPs and FPs who participated to report system reporting at least one patient, out of the total number of GPs and FPs; frequency of patients reported as ILI; time (in days) to manage reported patients. The cumulative weekly rate of ""non-redundant"" (not already known to APSS as probable/confirmed case) reports per thousand inhabitants was also calculated. RESULTS: over 80% of GPs and FPs voluntary participated into the reporting system of patients with COVID-19 clinical criteria. Overall, 4,270 patients were reported; of these, 2,865 (67%) were not known to APSS as probable/confirmed case. Response time in days decrease progressively during the period of activity (from a mean of 6 days to 0.4 days during the 12th and 16th week of 2020, respectively). The cumulative weekly rate of client reports which were not already known as probable or confirmed cases (per 1,000 population) ranges from 3.54 to 6.84 cases in the 12th and 16th week, respectively. Among the 4,270 reports, 1,471 patients considered possible COVID-19 cases were identified due to the presence of ILI symptoms, even in the absence of a swab or a positive history for close contact with COVID-19 case. From the epidemiological investigation into the 1,471 possible cases, 2,514 close contacts were identified and quarantined at home. Of the 2,514 close contacts, 127 (5.05%) people developed symptoms during quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: the integration among primary care, GPs and FPS, and the Department of Prevention could be an element of success in the management of the COVID-19 emergency and in the return to a normal phase. However, further assessments are required on the effectiveness and impact of the adopted model, especially in relation to the exit from phase 1 and phase 2 of the pandemic emergency.","Mantovani, William; Franchini, Silvia; Mazzurana, Mirko; Zuccali, Maria Grazi; Pizzo, Francesco; Zanin, Alessandra; Ferro, Antonio",Epidemiol Prev,364,10

While research has focused on the effectiveness of, and adherence to, these interventions, less attention has been paid to their implementation in practice and what aspects of the therapist role support success. An understanding of the key factors related to the therapist role and intervention delivery is required if these iCBTs are to be applied in routine clinical care and outcomes optimized. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is greater emphasis on allowing patients access to remote therapies. We report the experiences and reflections of 4 therapists and their 2 supervisors in delivering an online, therapist-supported intervention in a randomized controlled trial for children and young people with tic disorders (the Online Remote Behavioural Intervention for Tics [ORBIT] trial). Themes discussed include the importance of training, supervision, creating support documents/manuals, and record keeping. Alongside this are communication strategies used by therapists to encourage patient adherence and treatment effectiveness. These include rapport building, treatment personalization, and suggestions for overcoming non-engagement. These reflections offer important considerations for the delivery of iCBTs as well as implications associated with the implementation of these interventions in existing services and future research studies.

As an alternative outlook to the thinking of totalitarian singularity and individualism, community-in its possible and impossible making-can offer more meaningful engagement with the other human being by being responsible and extending care towards the Other.

Agents that inhibit components of the pro-inflammatory cascade have garnered interest as potential treatment options with hopes that dampening the pro-inflammatory process may improve clinical outcomes. Baricitinib is a reversible Janus-associated kinase (JAK)-inhibitor that interrupts the signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in COVID-19 immunopathology. It may also have antiviral effects by targeting host factors that viruses rely for cell entry and by suppressing type I interferon driven angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 up regulation. However, baricitinib's immunosuppressive effects may be detrimental during acute viral infections by delaying viral clearance and increasing vulnerability to secondary opportunistic infections. The lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor patients' immune status as illness evolves complicates deployment of immunosuppressive drugs like baricitinib. Furthermore, baricitinib carries the risk of increased thromboembolic events which is concerning given the proclivity towards a hyper-coagulable state in COVID-19 patients. In this article we review available data on baricitinib with an emphasis on immunosuppressive and antiviral pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety and current progress in COVID-19 clinical trials.","Cj Jorgensen, Sarah; Ly Tse, Christopher; Burry, Lisa; Dresser, Linda D",Pharmacotherapy,364,1

Prevention and early diagnosis are the key strategies followed by most countries. This study presents the perspective of different modes of transmission of coronavirus,especially during clinical practices and among the pediatrics. Further, the diagnostic methods and the advancement of the computerized tomography have been discussed. Droplets, aerosol, and close contact are thesignificantfactors to transfer the infection to the suspect. This study predicts the possible transmission of the virus through medical practices such as ophthalmology, dental, and endoscopy procedures. With regard to pediatric transmission, as of now, only afew child fatalities had been reported. Childrenusually respond to the respiratory virus; however, COVID-19 response ison the contrary. The possibility of getting infected is minimal for the newborn. There has been no asymptomatic spread in children until now. Moreover, breastfeedingwould not transmit COVID-19, which is encouraging hygiene news for the pediatric. In addition, the current diagnostic methods for COVID-19 including Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)and chest computed topography(CT) scan, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) andimmunochromatographic fluorescence assay, are also discussed in detail.

The 317 participants were recruited over four days (April 1st–4th) during the start of the dynamic increase of the pandemic in Poland. The study was performed via open-access forums on the internet. The analyses indicated that stronger basic hope and higher levels of meaning in life and life satisfaction correlate with lower state anxiety and lower COVID-19 stress. Mediation analyses suggested the following interpretation of the interdependencies: basic hope supports meaning in life and life satisfaction and the increase in the latter two factors results in lower anxiety and COVID-19 stress. The results suggest that these three global assumptions and feelings may serve as buffers against anxiety as well as nonproductive thinking and decision making in the face of an unpredictable threat.","Trzebiński, Jerzy; Cabański, Maciej; Czarnecka, Jolanta Zuzanna",J.

Nucleic acid agonists of the innate immune system can be administered to activate an effective antiviral program for prophylaxis in exposed populations, a measure of particular relevance for SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its efficient evasion of the host antiviral response. In this study, we utilized the K18-hACE2 mouse model of COVID-19 to examine whether prophylactic activation of the antiviral receptor RIG-I protects mice from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Systemic treatment of mice with a specific RIG-I ligand one to seven days prior to infection with a lethal dose of SARS-CoV-2 improved their survival of by up to 50 %. Improved survival was associated with lower viral load in oropharyngeal swabs and in the lungs and brain of RIG-I-treated mice. Moreover, despite antiviral protection, the surviving mice that were treated with RIG-I ligand developed adaptive SARS-CoV-2-specific immunity. These results reveal that prophylactic RIG-I activation by synthetic RNA oligonucleotides is a promising strategy to convey short-term, unspecific antiviral protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may be a suitable broad-spectrum approach to constraining the spread of newly emerging viruses until virus-specific therapies and vaccines become available.","Marx, Samira; Kuemmerer, Beate M; Gruetzner, Christian; Kato, Hiroki; Schlee, Martin; Bartok, Eva; Renn, Marcel; Hartmann, Gunther",,364,30

METHODS: We analysed furin, leptin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, triglycerides, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and C-reactive protein in serum from 166 children in the Pediatric Osteoporosis Prevention (POP) study collected at mean age (SD) 9.9 (0.6) years. Children were classified as low-to-normal weight, overweight or obese. Total body fat mass (kg), trunk fat mass (kg) and total body lean mass (kg) were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Body fat percentage (%) was calculated. RESULTS: We found that circulating furin levels were higher in children with obesity and overweight compared with children with low-to-normal weight (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). Also, there were positive correlations between circulating furin, total body fat mass, trunk fat mass, body fat percentage, triglycerides, adipokines and pro-inflammatory markers. CONCLUSION: This study indicates associations between furin, adiposity and a pro-inflammatory milieu in children. We suggest that future studies investigate the role of furin in fat tissue inflammation and associated increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases in children. Studies should also investigate whether higher furin levels could be a link between obesity and severe coronavirus disease 2019 in children.","Swärd, Per; Rosengren, Björn E; Jehpsson, Lars; Karlsson, Magnus K",Acta paediatr. scand,364,20

In addition, pulses are affordable and shelf-stable. The combination of these factors, an elevated consumer interest in plant-based diets, and the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased purchasing of pulses and even empty grocery store shelves. Although pulses have many associated benefits, some consumers are hesitant to regularly eat pulses, claiming concerns of abdominal discomfort or a lack of knowledge on how to best prepare pulses. To capitalize on increased consumer interest and purchasing of pulses, now is the time for outreach efforts that address these concerns and the positive outcomes associated with pulses, thereby promoting public and environmental health. Consumers must actively decide to add pulses to their grocery lists and incorporate them into their regular eating patterns. Motivation to adopt new eating habits is essential because knowledge alone does not result in behavior change. Thus, to mitigate perceived barriers and drive consumption, we suggest application of the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model and emphasis of three main benefits of pulses as motivators: (1) culinary versatility, (2) sustainability, and (3) healthfulness.","Didinger, Chelsea; Thompson, Henry",Nutrients,364,16

The Portuguese constitutional and legal framework is particularly generous regarding the right to healthcare to irregular migrants. Nevertheless, until now, several practical barriers prevented full access to healthcare services provided by the national health service, even in situations in which it was legally granted. This decision is not only remarkable in light of the fulfilling of migrants’ rights to health, as imposed by international commitments assumed by, but also in view of the fight against COVID-19. The decision is grounded both on human rights and in public health reasons. The paper is divided in two main parts.

The mastery-avoidance goal is defined as engaging in a task to avoid losing knowledge or skills that have already been acquired. We aimed to explore the role of mastery-avoidance goals in changes occurring in low frustration tolerance (LFT) levels over a span of one academic year. This approach enables us to understand which type of motivational orientation is expected to explain most adaptive educational outcomes. Methods.: First year medical students (n = 241) participating in a physician-patient communication course completed the surveys of motivational orientations and LFT at the beginning and at the end of the academic year. A confirmatory factor analysis supported the construct validity of the motivational orientations structure. Results.: Cross-lagged analysis using structural equation modelling revealed that the mastery-approach goal was negatively related to the progression of LFT while mastery-avoidance goal was positively related. Conclusions.: The findings suggest that what matters is not merely the level of motivation, but rather the type of motivational orientations that students pursue. Encouraging students to improve their current skills, while discouraging competitiveness and reducing fear of losing competence, may enhance the effectiveness of medical training programmes.","Madjar, Nir; Bachner, Yaacov G; Kushnir, Talma",Natl Med J India,364,16

The exponential community spread of disease limited the time for development and training. METHODS: The goals of our workflow and process development were to maximize safety for staff and patients, minimize risk of contamination, and reduce the waste of unused supplies and materials. We used a cyclical improvement system and the plus/delta debriefing method to rapidly develop workflows consisting of sequential checklists and procedure-specific packs. RESULTS: We designed independent workflows for labor analgesia, neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery, conversion of labor analgesia to cesarean anesthesia, and general anesthesia. In addition, we created procedure-specific material packs to optimize supplies and prevent wastage. Finally, we generated sequential checklists to allow staff to perform standard operating procedures without extensive training. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these workflows and tools allowed our staff to urgently care for patients in high-risk situations without prior experience. Over time, we refined the workflows using a cyclical improvement system. We present our checklists and workflows as well as the system we used for their development, so that others may use them to their benefit.","Li, Yunping; Ciampa, Erin J; Zucco, Liana; Levy, Nadav; Colella, Meredith; Golen, Toni; Shainker, Scott A; Lunderberg, J Mark; Ramachandran, S Krishna; Hess, Philip E",,364,1

Most cases have reported these complications as barotrauma from mechanical ventilation with COVID-19 disease. We aim to report three polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 patients who developed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax unrelated to mechanical ventilation. We originally analyzed 800 patients with COVID-19 disease at Orlando Regional Medical Center from March 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, of which 12 patients developed pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax in their hospital course. Interestingly, three patients developed pneumomediastinum on chest imaging prior to intubation. We present these three patients, one female and two males, ages of 42, 64, and 65, respectively, who were diagnosed with COVID-19 disease through nasopharyngeal sampling tests with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum and pneumothorax are potential complications of COVID-19 disease in the lungs unrelated to mechanical ventilation. This is similar to previous outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) diseases. Further investigation is needed to define the causality of pneumomediastinum in nonintubated COVID-19 patients to define the incidence of disease.","Tucker, Lara; Patel, Sachin; Vatsis, Catherine; Poma, Antonia; Ammar, Ali; Nasser, Wael; Mukkera, Satyanarayana; Vo, Mai; Khan, Rumi; Carlan, Steve",Case Rep Crit Care,364,20

Following the first reports of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 in 2019 and its rapid spread worldwide and the outbreak of a new highly variable strain of influenza A virus (H1N1) in 2009, developing quick, accurate monitoring and diagnostic approaches for emerging infections is considered critical. Efficient air sampling of coronaviruses and the H1N1 virus allows swift, real-time identification, triggering early adjuvant interventions. Electrostatic precipitation is an efficient method for sampling bio-aerosols as hydrosols; however, sampling conditions critically impact this method. Corona discharge ionizes surrounding air, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may impair virus structural components, leading to RNA and/or protein damage and preventing virus detection. Herein, ascorbic acid (AA) dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as the sampling solution of an electrostatic sampler to counteract virus particle impairment, increasing virus survivability throughout sampling. The findings of this study indicate that the use of PBS+AA is effective in reducing the ROS damage of viral RNA by 95%, viral protein by 45% and virus yield by 60%.","Piri, Amin; Kim, Hyeong Rae; Park, Dae Hoon; Hwang, Jungho",J Hazard Mater,364,31

As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives. DATA: Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic. CONCLUSION: Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.","Hoeben, Evelien M; Bernasco, Wim; Suonperä Liebst, Lasse; van Baak, Carlijn; Rosenkrantz Lindegaard, Marie",PLoS One,364,29

Evidence-based interventions to address these risk factors exist, but often as a separate and overlapping package. The current study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a common elements-based intervention to improve mother-infant interaction at 12 months post-partum. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm, single-blinded, individual randomised controlled trial is being carried out in the community settings of the rural subdistrict of Gujar Khan in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. 250 pregnant women in third trimester with distress (Self-Reporting Questionnaire, cut-off score >9) have been randomised on 1:1 allocation ratio into intervention (n=125) and treatment-as-usual arms (n=125). The participants in the intervention arm will receive 15 individual sessions of intervention on a monthly basis by non-specialist facilitators. The intervention involves components of early stimulation, learning through play, responsive feeding, guided discovery using pictures, behavioural activation and problem solving. The primary outcome is caregiver-infant interaction at 12 months postpartum. The secondary outcomes include maternal psychological well-being, quality of life, social support and empowerment. Infant secondary outcomes include growth, nutrition and development. The data will be collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months postpartum. A qualitative process evaluation will be conducted to inform the feasibility of intervention delivery. ETHICS: Ethics approval for the present study was obtained from the Human Development Research Foundation Institutional Review Board, Islamabad Pakistan. DISSEMINATION: If proven effective, the study will contribute to scale-up care for maternal and child mental health in low resource settings, globally. The findings of the present study will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences and community forums.

We compared CS' cumulative incidence of being tested, testing positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), being hospitalized and dying of COVID-19 with that of the general population; we compared COVID-19 prognosis in CS and in patients without cancer. During the study period, 15 391 people (1527 CS) underwent real-time polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 4541 (447 CS) tested positive; 541 (113 CS) died of COVID-19. CS had higher age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) of testing (1.28 [95% confidence interval, CI = 1.21-1.35]), of positive test (IRR 1.06 [95% CI = 0.96-1.18]) and of hospitalization and death (IRR 1.27 [95% CI = 1.09-1.48] and 1.39 [95%CI = 1.12-1.71], respectively). CS had worse prognosis when diagnosed with COVID-19, particularly those below age 70 (adjusted odds ratio [OR] of death 5.03; [95% CI = 2.59-9.75]), while the OR decreased after age 70. The OR of death was higher for CS with a recent diagnosis, that is, <2 years (OR = 2.92; 95% CI = 1.64-5.21), or metastases (OR = 2.09; 95% CI = 0.88-4.93). CS showed the same probability of being infected, despite a slightly higher probability of being tested than the general population. Nevertheless, CS were at higher risk of death once infected.","Mangone, Lucia; Gioia, Francesco; Mancuso, Pamela; Bisceglia, Isabella; Ottone, Marta; Vicentini, Massimo; Pinto, Carmine; Giorgi Rossi, Paolo",Int. j. cancer,364,5

This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress in postpartum Mexican women. The study included 293, 4-12-week postpartum women over the age of 18. The Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), Trait-State Trait Anxiety Inventory (T-STAI), and Ten Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), which are all questionnaires validated for the Mexican population, were applied using a web-based online survey. Prevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. The mean +/- standard deviation (SD) of the maternal age was 29.9 +/- 6.3 years;the EPDS score: 11 +/- 6, T-STAI score: 41.7 +/- 12.3, and PSS-10 score: 17.1 +/- 7. The prevalence (95% CI) of the postpartum depression symptoms was 39.2% (34-45%), trait anxiety symptoms were found among 46.1% (32-43%) of the participants, and moderate and high perceived stress were in 58% (52-64) and 10.9% (7.8-15) of the participants, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety, and perceived stress was higher among postpartum Mexican women during the COVID-19 outbreak than before the lockdown.

While some measures can be achieved at the organisational level through policy, every Service person's experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have differed, affected by a range of personal, occupational and geographical factors. A successful recovery phase for each Service personnel (SP) therefore relies on localised assessments and individualised support plans. The return of SP to the physical environment must be safe, and the financial needs of their whole family must be considered. Commanders must understand the need for balance in supporting social reconnection both personally and in the workplace. Commanders have an important role in the development of SPs' mental resilience; supporting mental well-being, early recognition of deteriorating mental health and signposting, and compassionate understanding of the needs of SP deployed or bereaved. Disruptions to healthcare service provision will impact the duration of medical downgrading, workforce capacity and operational effectiveness according to extant parameters, which must be understood by commanders. Likewise, functional fitness may have been adversely affected. Physical health and fitness recovery can be supported by time-based extensions to occupational health policy and graduated return to work physical training programmes.","Taylor, Hannah; Quantick, O; Ross, D",,364,1

Currently, the treatment options for COVID-19 are limited. The purpose of the experiments presented here was to investigate the effectiveness of ketotifen, naproxen and indomethacin, alone or in combination, in reducing SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition, the cytotoxicity of the drugs was evaluated. The findings showed that the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen both reduce viral yield. Compared to ketotifen alone (60% inhibition at EC50), an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 79%, 83% and 93% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 µM indomethacin, respectively. Compared to ketotifen alone, an increase in percentage inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 to 68%, 68% and 92% was found when co-administered with 25, 50 and 100 µM naproxen, respectively. For both drug combinations the observations suggest an additive or synergistic effect, compared to administering the drugs alone. No cytotoxic effects were observed for the administered dosages of ketotifen, naproxen, and indomethacin. Further research is warranted to investigate the efficacy of the combination of ketotifen with indomethacin (SJP-002C) or naproxen in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.","Kiani, Pantea; Scholey, Andrew; Dahl, Thomas A; McMann, Lauren; Iversen, Jacqueline M; Verster, Joris C",Viruses,364,13

We have identified IFNß-1a as the most promising drug to be repurposed for COVID-19. The rationale relies on the evidence of IFNß anti-viral activity in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and animal models resembling SARS-CoV-2 infection and on a recent clinical trial where IFNß was indicated as the key component of a successful therapeutic combination. METHODS: This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, monocentric, phase II trial (INTERCOP trial). One hundred twenty-six patients with positive swab detection of SARS-CoV-2, radiological signs of pneumonia, and mild-to-moderate disease will be randomized 2:1 to IFNß-1a in addition to standard of care vs standard of care alone. No other anti-viral drugs will be used as part of the regimens, both in the control and the intervention arms. IFNß-1a will be administered subcutaneously at the dose of 44 mcg (equivalent to 12 million international units) three times per week, at least 48 h apart, for a total of 2 weeks. The primary outcome is the time to negative conversion of SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal swabs. Secondary outcomes include improvement or worsening in a clinical severity score measured on a 7-point ordinal scale (including transfer to intensive care unit and death), oxygen- and ventilator-free days, mortality, changes in pulmonary computed tomography severity score, hospital stay duration, reduction of viral load measured on nasopharyngeal swabs, number of serious adverse events, and changes in biochemical markers of organ dysfunction. Exploratory outcomes include blood cell counts, cytokine and inflammatory profile, peripheral mRNA expression profiles of interferon-stimulated genes, and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and to IFNß-1a. INTERCOP is the first study to specifically investigate the clinical benefits of IFNß-1a in COVID-19 patients. DISCUSSION: Potential implications of this trial are multifaceted: should the primary outcome be fulfilled and the treatment be safe, one may envisage that IFNß-1a be used to reduce the infectivity of patients with mild-to moderate disease. In case IFNß-1a reduced the duration of hospital stay and/or ameliorated the clinical status, it may become a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2020-002458-25.

PDCoV-related diarrhea first occurred in the USA in 2014 and was subsequently reported in South Korea, China, Thailand, Vietnam, and Lao People's Democratic Republic, leading to massive economic losses and posing a threat to the swine industry worldwide. Currently, no treatments or vaccines for PDCoV are available. The critical step in the development of potential vaccines against PDCoV infection is the isolation and propagation of PDCoV in cell culture. This chapter provides a detailed protocol for isolation and propagation of PDCoV in swine testicular (ST) and LLC porcine kidney (LLC-PK) cell cultures supplemented with pancreatin and trypsin, respectively. Filtered clinical samples (swine intestinal contents or feces) applied to ST or LLC-PK cells produce cytopathic effects characterized by rounding, clumping, and detachment of cells. PDCoV replication in cells can be quantifiably monitored by qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence assays, and immune-electron microscopy. Infectious viral titers can be evaluated by using plaque assays or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assays. The ST or LLC-PK cells efficiently supported serial passage and propagation of PDCoV. After serial passage of PDCoV in either ST or LLC-PK cells, the virus can be purified further in ST cells by plaque assays.","Hu, Hui; Jung, Kwonil; Kenney, Scott P; Saif, Linda J",Methods Mol Biol,364,25

METHODS: We created a survey consisting of 22 questions to assess the respondent's operative experience, location, type of practice, subspecialty, changes in clinic and operative volumes, changes to staff, and changes to income since the pandemic began. The survey was distributed electronically to neurosurgeons throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. RESULTS: Of the 724 who opened the survey link, 457 completed the survey. The respondents were from throughout the United States and Puerto Rico and represented all practices types and subspecialties. Nearly all respondents reported hospital restrictions on elective surgeries. Most reported a decline in clinic and operative volume. Nearly 70% of respondents saw a decrease in the work hours of their ancillary providers, and almost one half (49.1%) of the respondents had had to downsize their practice staff, office assistants, nurses, schedulers, and other personnel. Overall, 43.6% of survey respondents had experienced a decline in income, and 27.4% expected a decline in income in the upcoming billing cycle. More senior neurosurgeons and those with a private practice, whether solo or as part of a group, were more likely to experience a decline in income as a result of the pandemic compared with their colleagues. CONCLUSION: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic will likely have a lasting effect on the practice of medicine. Our survey results have described the early effects on the neurosurgical workforce. Nearly all neurosurgeons experienced a significant decline in clinical volume, which led to many downstream effects.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional study with online questionnaires was designed with 472 valid responses in Indonesia. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Individual Work Performance Questionnaire (IWPQ) were administered. Non-parametric tests and structural equation modeling were employed to analyze the data. Findings: The prevalence of depression was 18.4%, anxiety 46.4% and stress 13.1%, with relatively good productivity. Gender, age, education level, job experiences, marital status, number of children and nature of the organization were associated with the employees' psychological health but not with their productivity, while the workspace availability influenced both outcomes. The study path model showed the negative correlation between WFH employees' psychological well-being and productivity. Research limitations/implications: This study may contribute to the implication of current mandatory WFH on mental well-being and productivity. Further studies need to address the representativeness and generalizability issues as well as incorporating potential stressors. Practical implications: Organizations may adopt WFH as a future working arrangement and identify the individual and occupational characteristics that provide the most impacts on productivity. It is also necessary for them to develop proper strategies to mitigate the psychological risks and overcome the WFH challenges. Originality/value: There is still a lack of studies investigating the relationship between simultaneous effects of WFH on psychological well-being and productivity, and how they affect some socio-demographic variables in the context of COVID-19.","Sutarto, A.

RECENT FINDINGS: While living with food insecurity impacts stress and diet-related behaviors in children and adolescents, it is not clear whether food insecurity is associated with obesity above and beyond the influence of poverty. However, strategies to mitigate food insecurity and obesity are inherently connected, and recent examples from clinical practice (e.g., screening for food insecurity among patients) and advocacy (e.g., policy considerations regarding federal food programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP) are discussed. Food insecurity and obesity coexist in low-income children and adolescents in the USA.

Households with a SARS-CoV-2 confirmed positive case and at least one child in the Netherlands were followed for 6 weeks. Naso (NP)- and oropharyngeal (OP) swabs, oral fluid and feces specimens were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and serum for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. The dynamics of the presence of viral RNA and the serological response was modeled to determine the sampling time-frame and sample type with the highest sensitivity to confirm or reject a SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between adults and children within a household was correlated with symptom severity of index cases. In children higher viral loads compared to adults were detected at symptom onset. Early in infection, higher viral loads were detected in NP and OP specimens, while RNA in especially feces were longer detectable. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies have a 90% probability of detection from 7 days (total Ig) and 18 days (IgG) since symptom onset. In conclusion this study has shown that on average, children carry higher loads of virus as compared to adults early after infection. For highest probability of detection in SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics early in infection, RT-PCR on NP and OP specimens are more sensitive than on oral fluid and feces. For SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics late after infection, RT-PCR on feces specimens and serology are more valuable.","Han, Wanda G.H.; Swart, Arno; Marinovic, Axel Bonacic; Eggink, Dirk; Reimerink, Johan; Wijsman, Lisa A; Veer, Bas van der; Brink, Sharon van den; Brandt, Anne-Marie van den; Tol, Sophie van; Godeke, Gert-Jan; Brouwer, Fion; Hoogerwerf, Marieke; group, - the Dutch FFX-COVID-19 research; Reukers, Daphne F.M.; Rots, Nynke; Reusken, Chantal; Meijer, Adam",,364,26

The need for social distancing and relaxing of federal and state telemental health regulations paved the way for widespread adoption of direct-to-consumer (DTC) ambulatory mental health video visits. METHODS: We present cases that demonstrate the use of video visits across 6 clinical areas, each serving a unique population of patients, in a large behavioral health system. The benefits and limitations of this modality are illustrated in children, adults, and older adults with mood disorders, anxiety disorders, intellectual disability, substance use disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and schizophrenia. RESULTS: Although telephone visits were acceptable and necessary to serve some patients, there are many advantages to video visits in providing best patient care. Education and support for telemental health-delivered to both patients and clinicians-is critical to the success of the DTC model. CONCLUSIONS: DTC telemental health is a widespread clinical tool used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because this model has many strengths and advantages compared with traditional telemental health delivered in a clinic, regulators and insurers should be open to its continued use postpandemic when clinically appropriate.","Gannon, Jessica M; Schlesinger, Abigail; Glance, Jody; Sujata, Mandayam; Fredrick, Noreen; Wyler, James; Perez, Gina",Ann Clin Psychiatry,364,20

SARS-CoV-2 is the virus causing COVID-19. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is definitely one of the main clinically relevant consequences in patients with COVID-19. Starting from the earliest reports of the COVID-19 pandemic, two peculiar neurological manifestations (namely, hyposmia/anosmia and dysgeusia) were reported in a relevant proportion of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2. At present, the physiopathologic mechanisms accounting for the onset of these symptoms are not yet clarified. CXCL10 is a pro-inflammatory chemokine with a well-established role in the COVID-19-related cytokine storm and in subsequent development of ARDS. CXCL10 is also known to be involved in coronavirus-induced demyelination. On these bases, a role for CXCL10 as the common denominator between pulmonary and olfactory dysfunctions could be envisaged. The aim of the present report will be to hypothesize a role for CXCL10 in COVID-19 olfactory dysfunctions.

Many researchers rely on such models as they can be efficiently estimated and also provide interpretability. However, advances in machine learning research indicate that neural networks can be powerful data modeling techniques, as they can give higher accuracy for a plethora of learning problems and datasets. In the past, they have been tried on time-series forecasting as well, but their overall results have not been significantly better than the statistical models especially for intermediate length times series data. Their modeling capacities are limited in cases where enough data may not be available to estimate the large number of parameters that these non-linear models require. This paper presents an easy to implement data augmentation method to significantly improve the performance of such networks. Our method, Augmented-Neural-Network, which involves using forecasts from statistical models, can help unlock the power of neural networks on intermediate length time-series and produces competitive results. It shows that data augmentation, when paired with Automated Machine Learning techniques such as Neural Architecture Search, can help to find the best neural architecture for a given time-series. Using the combination of these, demonstrates significant enhancement in the forecasting accuracy of three neural network-based models for a COVID-19 dataset, with a maximum improvement in forecasting accuracy by 21.41%, 24.29%, and 16.42%, respectively, over the neural networks that do not use augmented data.","Javeri, Indrajeet Y.; Toutiaee, Mohammadhossein; Arpinar, Ismailcem B.; Miller, Tom W.; Miller, John A.",,364,16

Given the both paucity and lack of consensus among data on statins efficacy and safety amongst COVID-19 patients, the current guideline is to continue statin in COVID-19 patients, who have previously been treated with statins. The aim of this paper was to compare hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who did and did not receive statins, in terms of COVID-19 outcomes. MethodsWe conducted population-based retrospective study using South Koreas nationwide healthcare database as of May 15 2020. We identified 4,349 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and aged 40 years or older. The cohort entry was defined as the date of hospitalization. Statin users were individuals with inpatient and outpatient prescription records of statins in the 240 days before cohort entry, and non-users were those without such records during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite endpoint of all-cause death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation use and cardiovascular outcomes (myocardial infarction (MI), transient cerebral ischemic attacks (TIA) or stroke). We conducted inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), to compare outcomes between statin users and non-users. Findings1,115 patients were statin users (mean age = 65.9 years; 60% female), and 3,234 were non-users (mean age = 58.3 years; 64% female). Statin use was not associated with increased risk of the primary outcome (IPTW OR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.60-1.11). Subgroup analysis showed a protective role of statins, for individuals with hypertension (IPTW OR 0.40; 95% CI: 0.23-0.69, p for interaction: 0.0087).

This had already been established in the Severn Deanery.MethodNorthern Ireland (NI) and the East of England (EoE) deaneries were selected as pilot areas for the project. Preparation for the project included collaboration with trainees from the Severn deanery and meeting with the RCPsych Digital team. A scoping questionnaire was circulated to trainees in each deanery.Following this, two closed groups were initiated on Workplace in August 2019 for Northern Ireland and East of England trainees.ResultResults from the survey sent prior to the social media pages being established indicated there was appetite among trainees for the project. The pages were established in July 2019. The pilot project was promoted by representatives.In the initial phases, approximately 40% of trainees signed up. Information regarding college and local events, committee meeting updates and training opportunities was disseminated on the platform. There was evidence of early use by trainees outside of the representative group.This however was not sustained and gradually use of the platform reduced over the pilot period, both in postings and membership. A further questionnaire circulated in July 2020 highlighted trainees’ concerns relating to the platform, including concerns around data protection and a high number of notifications associated with the Workplace medium. The ultimate impact on engagement was also felt to be minimal.ConclusionFollowing feedback and increasing usage costs by Workplace, it was decided not to continue with a nationwide role out of the project. COVID-19 has seen the successful use of platforms such as Microsoft Teams and these may be considered in the future, given their integration with existing trust systems.","Grimason, Amy Matheiken Shevonne Somerville Laura Martin Fiona Baker Luke Garg Kabir Sharma Aastha Morris Simon George",BJPsych Open,364,1

The viral infection expanded internationally and World Health Organization announced a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify and measure the effects of this pandemic on anxiety levels and sleep disturbance and the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) among the HCWs in India. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional study using piloted structured questionnaires with self-reported responses from 368 volunteer males and females HCWs from India. Study participants were identified through social networking sites: Facebook and WhatsApp. The degree of symptoms of anxiety, sleep quality and the availability of PPE was assessed by the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) scale, Single Sleep Quality scale and questions on availability of PPE. RESULTS: Majority of the study subjects were in the age group 45-60 years and 52.2% were doctors. Severe anxiety scores (GAD>10) were observed in 7.3%; moderate, mild and minimal anxiety was observed in 12.5%, 29.3% and 50.8% HCWs respectively, and 31.5% had poor to fair sleep scores (<6). Univariate analysis showed female gender and inadequate availability of PPE significantly associated with higher anxiety levels (P= 0.01 and 0.01). Sleep disturbance was significantly associated with age<30 years (P=0.04) and inadequate PPE (P<0.001). Multivariable analysis showed that poorer quality of sleep was associated with higher anxiety levels (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has potentially caused a significant level of anxiety and sleep disturbance amongst HCWs, associated with female gender, younger age group, and availability of inadequate PPE, which puts HCWs at constant risk of contracting the infection themselves or transmitting it to their families. Early detection of at-risk HCWs and institution of situation-tailored mitigation measures will enable alleviation of the risk of long term, serious psychological sequelae as well as reduce HCWs' current anxiety.","Gupta, Bhawna; Sharma, Vyom; Kumar, Narinder; Mahajan, Akanksha",,364,9

The healthcare sector is not an exception, especially those in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs), where most safety systems are not robust when compared with developed countries. The study aim is to assess the occupational safety climate among healthcare workers (HCWs) in LMICs using Nigeria as a case study. A cross-sectional study was adopted to measure safety climate perception among professionals working in healthcare establishment during the COVID-19 pandemic using a validated Nordic Safety Climate Questionnaire (NOSACQ-50). At the end of the survey period, 83% (433) of the responses were adjudged to have met the threshold criteria and were used to inform the study outcome. Worker safety commitment within the healthcare facilities (M = 3.01, SD = 0.42) was statistically significantly higher than management safety priority, commitment, and competence (M = 2.91, SD = 0.46), t(130.52), p &lt;0.001. A significant effect of the management role was found in regards to management safety priority, commitment, and competence (F(1, 406) = 3.99, p = 0.046, η2 = 0.010). On the contrary, the managerial position does not have a significant effect on worker safety commitment (F(1, 417) = 0.59, p = 0.440, η2 = 0.001). The outcome from the study showed that, where there is active promotion of a positive safety climate in healthcare sectors in LMICs, employees are more likely to engage in positive safety behaviour. To help address the identified gaps, there is the need for more effort to be made towards promoting an effective and positive safety climate across the establishment, including management and healthcare worker commitments.","Moda, Haruna Musa Dama Fabian M.; Nwadike, Christopher Alatni Basim S.; Adewoye, Solomon O.; Sawyerr, Henry Doka Pauline J.

METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 20 patients (26 tumors) scheduled to undergo thoracoscopic pulmonary wedge resection between April 2016 and October 2018. Ultrasonographic tumor detection was performed with an ARIETTA 850 and L51K probe (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Ultrasonography was repeated after achieving adequate lung collapse under a positive intrathoracic pressure of 8-15 mmHg. The appearance on preoperative CT versus the ultrasonographic localization was compared for each tumor. The receiver operating characteristic curves were compared for the tumor dimension of the lung window, consolidation dimension of the lung window, tumor dimension of the mediastinal window (MD), and tumor depth from the lung surface. RESULTS: The average age was 62 years (range 42-79 years), average pathological tumor size was 9 mm (range 3-22 mm), and average tumor depth was 6 mm (range 1-25 mm). Although no tumors could be visualized before lung collapse, 22 tumors (85%) were detectable with ultrasonography after lung collapse. Of these 22 tumors, 16 were well-depicted, while six were poorly delineated. MD showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.81), and tumors with a MD of &#8804; 6 mm had a high risk of difficult localization using ultrasonography. CONCLUSION: This ultrasonographic method obtained high tumor detection rates, especially for tumors with a MD > 6 mm. Tumors with a MD &#8804; 6 mm may require another localization method.

In 2020 retaining skilled experienced nurses continues to be a major global challenge. The dominant and consistent concentration of workforce research to date has focused on attitudinal factors including job satisfaction and burnout and there is limited research on how organisational commitment in combination with job satisfaction and burnout may explain what keeps nurses in nursing. Objectives: : To measure how organisational commitment in combination with job satisfaction and burnout relate to the intention of Registered General Nurses' staying in nursing (ITSN). Design & Methods: : A quantitative descriptive design using a cross-sectional survey was utilised. A national postal survey of a representative sample of registered general nurses employed within the Republic of Ireland (ROI) health services was undertaken in 2010. A number of established valid and reliable instruments were used to measure attitudinal factors and their relationship with intention to stay (ITSN). Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 24.0 and descriptive, correlational and multiple regression analysis were undertaken. Results: : A total of 756 registered nurses participated in this study. The strongest predictor of intention to stay in nursing was organisational commitment (ß=.32, p=.000) while burnout and job satisfaction had a significant relationship with ITSN. Conclusion: : Results reveal the complex and multidimensional nature of ITSN with the majority of nurses having a strong intention to stay in nursing. Organisational commitment and low burnout represented predictors which are influential in nurses remaining in nursing throughout their career lifespan. These results remain relevant in 2020 particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic when retention and recruitment of skilled and experienced nurses to the workforce will be critical to the management of health care, considering the increased nurse vacancy rates in many countries and the evident lack of resolution of the issues raised from this study.","Bell, Mary; Sheridan, Ann",Int J Nurs Stud Adv,364,15

It is unknown what combined impact reductions in sexual activity and interruptions in HIV/STI services will have on HIV/STI epidemic trajectories. METHODS: We adapted a model of HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia for a population of approximately 103,000 men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Atlanta area. Model scenarios varied the timing, overlap, and relative extent of COVID-related sexual distancing and service interruption within four service categories (HIV screening, PrEP, ART, and STI treatment). RESULTS: A 50% relative decrease in sexual partnerships and interruption of all clinical services, both lasting 18 months, would generally offset each other for HIV (total 5-year population impact for Atlanta MSM: -227 cases), but have net protective effect for STIs (-23,800 cases). If distancing lasted only 3 months but service interruption lasted 18 months, the total 5-year population impact would be an additional 890 HIV cases and 57,500 STI cases. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate action to limit the impact of service interruptions is needed to address the indirect effects of the global COVID pandemic on the HIV/STI epidemic.","Jenness, Samuel M; Le Guillou, Adrien; Chandra, Christina; Mann, Laura M; Sanchez, Travis; Westreich, Daniel; Marcus, Julia L",J. infect. dis,364,20

In Switzerland, compulsory use of masks was introduced in indoor public spaces and later in schools. In the canton of Zurich, masks were introduced for secondary school children (grades 7-9) from November 2020, and for primary school children (grades 4-6) from February 2021- along with other protective measures against SARS-CoV-2. This study explored perceptions towards the usefulness of masks in school and public in a cohort of children and adolescents in the canton of Zurich, Switzerland, in January - May 2021. MethodsSchool children aged 10 to 17 years enrolled in Ciao Corona, a prospective school-based cohort study, responded to nested online surveys between January 12 to March 24 2021 (Q1) and March 10 to May 16 2021 (Q2). Secondary school children were surveyed at Q1 and Q2, and primary school children at Q2 only. Surveys for parents and their children included questions on childrens perception of the usefulness of masks and mask wearing behavior. Associations between perceived usefulness of masks and childs school level, gender, and parents educational attainment were analyzed with Pearsons and McNemars chi-squared tests. Free-text comments provided by children were classified into categories of expressed attitude towards mask wearing. Results595 (54% girls) and 1118 (52% girls) school children responded to online questionnaires at Q1 and Q2, respectively. More than half of school children perceived masks to be useful at school (Q1:60% and Q2:57%) and in public (Q1:69% and Q2:60%). Girls perceived masks as useful more often than boys (at Q2 at school: 61% versus 53%, in public: 64% versus 57%), and children of parents with high educational attainment more often than those of parents with lower educational attainment (at Q2 at school: 61% versus 49%, in public: 63% versus 54%). There were no differences in the perceived usefulness of masks among children in primary versus secondary school. At Q1 and Q2 each, about 20% of children provided individual statements about masks, of which 36% at Q1 and 16% at Q2 reported side-effects and discomfort such as skin irritations, headache or difficulties breathing during physical education. ConclusionApproximately 60% of school children perceived masks at school and in public places as useful. A small but non-negligible proportion of children reported discomfort and side-effects that should be considered to ensure high adherence to mask wearing among school children. Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04448717 https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04448717 CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD STATEMENTWorldwide about 150 countries fully closed their schools at some point during the coronavirus pandemic, while other countries - such as Switzerland - kept schools open almost all the time. However, among other protective measures, children in secondary school (aged approximately 14-16 years) had to wear masks since November 2020, and older children in primary school (aged 11-13 years) - since February 2021. As part of the large study Ciao Corona based in schools in Switzerland, we wanted to learn how children perceive the usefulness of masks in school and public. Children and their parents completed questionnaires in January-March (595 secondary school children) and March-May 2021 (1118 secondary and primary school children). We found that about 60% of children perceived masks to be useful at school and in public. Girls perceived masks as useful more often than boys, and children of parents with university or college education more often than those of parents with lower education. About 7- 9% of children reported side-effects and discomfort such as skin irritations, headache or difficulties breathing during physical education. Although side-effects were not frequently reported, they should be considered to ensure high adherence to mask wearing among school children.","Ammann, Priska; Ulyte, Agne; Haile, Sarah R; Puhan, Milo A; Kriemler, Susi; Radtke, Thomas",,364,6

With the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the availability of portable pulse-oximeters and wearable heart rate detectors has boomed in the market. At the same time, in 2020 we assisted to an unprecedented increase of healthcare breaches, revealing the extreme vulnerability of the current generation of WBANs. Therefore, the development of new security protocols to ensure data protection, authentication, integrity and privacy within WBANs are highly needed. Here, we targeted a WBAN collecting ECG signals from different sensor nodes on the individual's body, we extracted the inter-pulse interval (i.e., R-R interval) sequence from each of them, and we developed a new information theoretic key agreement protocol that exploits the inherent randomness of ECG to ensure authentication between sensor pairs within the WBAN. After proper pre-processing, we provide an analytical solution that ensures robust authentication; we provide a unique information reconciliation matrix, which gives good performance for all ECG sensor pairs; and we can show that a relationship between information reconciliation and privacy amplification matrices can be found. Finally, we show the trade-off between the level of security, in terms of key generation rate, and the complexity of the error correction scheme implemented in the system.","Guglielmi, Anna V.; Muraro, Alberto; Cisotto, Giulia; Laurenti, Nicola",,364,16

Such a sequence allows for reduced power deposition and easy inclusion of other modules. METHODS: An ihMT MPRAGE-style sequence (ihMTRAGE) was initially simulated to investigate acquisition of the 3D ihMT data sequentially, or in an interleaved manner. The ihMTRAGE sequence was implemented on a 3T clinical scanner to acquire ihMT data from the brain and spine. RESULTS: Both simulations and in vivo data provided an ihMT signal that was significantly greater using a sequential ihMTRAGE acquisition, compared with an interleaved implementation. Comparison with a steady-state ihMT acquisition (defined as having one MT RF pulse between successive acquisition modules) demonstrated how ihMTRAGE allows for a reduction in average power deposition, or greater ihMT signal at equal average power deposition. Inclusion of a prospective motion-correction module did not significantly affect the ihMT signal obtained from regions of interest in the brain. The ihMTRAGE acquisition allowed combination with a spatial saturation module to reduce phase wrap artifacts in a cervical spinal cord acquisition. CONCLUSIONS: Use of preparations necessary for ihMT experiments within an MPRAGE-style sequence provides a useful alternative for acquiring 3D ihMT data. Compared with our steady-state implementation, ihMTRAGE provided reduced power deposition, while allowing use of the maximum intensity from off-resonance RF pulses. The 3D ihMTRAGE acquisition allowed combination of other modules with the preparation necessary for ihMT experiments, specifically motion compensation and spatial saturation modules.","Varma, Gopal; Munsch, Fanny; Burns, Brian; Duhamel, Guillaume; Girard, Olivier M; Guidon, Arnaud; Lebel, R Marc; Alsop, David C",Magn.

Automated diagnosis studies have been constrained by underpowered single-center datasets, and although some results have shown promise, their generalizability to other institutions remains questionable as the data heterogeneity between institutions is not taken into account. By allowing models to be trained in a distributed manner that preserves patients' privacy, federated learning promises to alleviate these issues, by enabling diligent multi-center studies. We present the first federated learning study on the modality of cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and use four centers derived from subsets of the M\&M and ACDC datasets, focusing on the diagnosis of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We adapt a 3D-CNN network pretrained on action recognition and explore two different ways of incorporating shape prior information to the model, and four different data augmentation set-ups, systematically analyzing their impact on the different collaborative learning choices. We show that despite the small size of data (180 subjects derived from four centers), the privacy preserving federated learning achieves promising results that are competitive with traditional centralized learning. We further find that federatively trained models exhibit increased robustness and are more sensitive to domain shift effects.","Linardos, Akis; Kushibar, Kaisar; Walsh, Sean; Gkontra, Polyxeni; Lekadir, Karim",,364,9

This report describes our data, provides comparative analysis, together with meta-analysis of published studies and describes our protocols to restart the transplant programme. Methods: Data were analysed on kidney transplant, dialysis and waitlisted patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (naso-pharyngeal swab PCR) between March 1, 2020 and June 30, 2020 together with meta-analysis of 16 studies. Results: 23/1494 kidney transplant patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared to 123/1278 haemodialysis patients (1.5% vs 9.6%, p<0.001), 12/253 waitlisted patients (1.5% vs 4.7%, p=0.002). 19 required hospital admission, 6 died and 13 developed AKI. Overall case fatality ratio was 26.1% compared to patients on haemodialysis (27.6%, p=0.99) and waitlisted patients (8.3%, p=0.38). Within our entire cohort, 0.4% of transplant patients died compared to 0.4% of waitlisted patients and 2.7% of haemodialysis patients. Patients who died were older [Alive (median 71years) vs. Dead (median 59years), p=0.01]. In meta-analysis of 16 studies, including ours, pooled case fatality ratio was 24% [95%CI (19%, 28%)]; AKI proportion in 10 studies was 50% [95%CI (45%, 56%)], with some evidence against no heterogeneity between studies (p=0.02). Conclusions: From our cohort of transplant patients, a significantly lower proportion of patients contracted COVID-19 compared to waitlisted and dialysis patients. The case fatality ratio was comparable to that of dialysis cohort and pooled case fatality ratio from meta-analysis of 16 studies. The pooled AKI ratio in the meta-analysis was similar to our experience.","Phanish, Mysore; Ster, Irina Chis; Ghazanfar, Abbas; Cole, Nicholas; Quan, Virginia; Hull, Richard; Banerjee, Debasish",,364,16

This includedrheumatology patients on immunosuppressive therapies sufficient toincrease their risk of infection. MethodsThis was a retrospective audit assessing the number of rheumatologypatients within the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust (MSETrust) and Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Trust (BHRTrust) who were sent shielding letters. We audited how effective thesemeasures were in preventing COVID-19 infection during the shieldingperiod (up to 1st July 2020). Risk criteria from NHS Digital and theBritish Society for Rheumatology (BSR) were used by individualdepartments within these Trusts to identify the relevant patients. Weaudited from case records demographic details, rheumatologicaldiagnoses, therapies and associated co-morbidities in these patients.ResultsA total of 5, 876 high risk patients within these Trusts were identifiedand sent shielding letters: 4, 914 within the MSE Trust and 962 patientswithin the BHR Trust. As seen in Table 1, of these 5, 876 patients, 28(0.48%) were hospitalised with positive tests for COVID-19: 23 of the4, 914 (0.47%) in MSE Trust and 5 of the 962 (0.52%) in BHR Trust.Of the 28 COVID-19 admissions, 10 died (36%). The number ofrheumatology patients that developed COVID-19 as a proportion of allpatients admitted across these two Trusts was 0.76% (28 out of3, 695).ConclusionThis audit supports the idea that shielding is an effective tool inprotecting these vulnerable patients. Most of our patients admittedwere elderly, had multiple co-morbidities and generally conformedwith the known risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness. This supportsGovernment guidelines and BSR risk scoring and is particularlyimportant as it is becoming increasingly apparent that COVID-19 willbe prevalent for a long time to come. In line with the recent EULARCOVID-19 registry report, only one of the hospitalised patients fromthese Trusts was on anti-TNF therapy, suggesting that these therapieswere in fact protective. It raises the open question: whetherimmunosuppression may have a protective effect in someRheumatology patients.","Ranasinghe, C.; Nandagudi, A.; Balogh, E.; Sekaran, E.; Doherty, T.; Ali, A.; Koduri, G.; Dasgupta, B.",Rheumatology (United Kingdom),364,26

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study in 31 consecutive adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients. TEG with and without heparinase and anti-factor Xa analysis were performed. Standard thromboprophylaxis was given with dalteparin (75-100 IU/kg subcutaneously). RESULTS: Five patients (16%) had symptomatic thromboembolic events. All patients had a maximum amplitude (MA) > 65 mm and 13 (42%) had MA > 72 mm at some point during ICU stay. Anti-factor Xa activity were below the target range in 23% of the patients and above target range in 46% of patients. There was no significant correlation between dalteparin dose and anti-factor Xa activity. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 have hypercoagulability with high MA on TEG. The effect of LMWH on thromboembolic disease, anti-factor Xa activity and TEG was variable and could not be reliably predicted. This indicates that standard prophylactic doses of LMWH may be insufficient. Monitoring coagulation and the LMWH effect is important in patients with COVID-19 but interpreting the results in relation to risk of thromboembolic disease poses difficulties.","Stattin, K; Lipcsey, M; Andersson, H; Pontén, E; Bülow Anderberg, S; Gradin, A; Larsson, A; Lubenow, N; von Seth, M; Rubertsson, S; Hultström, M; Frithiof, R",J Crit Care,364,26

The purpose of this article is to systematically review and meta-analyze the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT in detecting coronavirus disease (COVID-19). MATERIALS AND METHODS. MEDLINE was systematically searched for publications on the diagnostic performance of chest CT in detecting COVID-19. Methodologic quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate random-effects model. RESULTS. Six studies were included, comprising 1431 patients. All six studies included patients at high risk of COVID-19, and five studies explicitly reported that they included only symptomatic patients. Mean prevalence of COVID-19 was 47.9% (range, 27.6-85.4%). High or potential risk of bias was present throughout all QUADAS-2 domains in all six studies. Sensitivity ranged from 92.9% to 97.0%, and specificity ranged from 25.0% to 71.9%, with pooled estimates of 94.6% (95% CI, 91.9-96.4%) and 46.0% (95% CI, 31.9-60.7%), respectively. The included studies were statistically homogeneous in their estimates of sensitivity (p = 0.578) and statistically heterogeneous in their estimates of specificity (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION. Diagnostic accuracy studies on chest CT in COVID-19 suffer from methodologic quality issues. Chest CT appears to have a relatively high sensitivity in symptomatic patients at high risk of COVID-19, but it cannot exclude COVID-19. Specificity is poor. These data, along with other local factors such as COVID-19 prevalence, available real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction tests, staff, hospital, and CT scanning capacity, can be useful to healthcare professionals and policy makers to decide on the utility of chest CT for COVID-19 detection in the hospital setting.","Adams, Hugo J A; Kwee, Thomas C; Yakar, Derya; Hope, Michael D; Kwee, Robert M",AJR Am J Roentgenol,364,33

A key challenge has been how to measure the impact of responses to continuity of learning both to ensure more effective responses in the event of further disruptions, but also to help the education community conceptualize more creative and effective approaches to learning, through blended and flexible approaches. This study reflects on the findings from a UNICEF survey targeting parents and adolescents across 6 states in India, and identifies lessons learned for addressing learning inequities during future school closures. We focus on measuring three key variables – access to technology, their utilization, and perceived learning for different profiles of children. As students began learning from home, technology access rates in households were initially used to determine the estimated maximum reach of different distance learning modalities during school closures. Beyond access, we find significant variations in adolescents’ use of technology for learning purposes and their perceptions of learning, linked to the type of remote learning modality, gender, location and type of school. We discuss the implications for government strategies and policies to ensure better utilization of technologies which are available in households and to address equity gaps in learning opportunities.","van Cappelle, Frank Chopra Vidur Ackers Jim Gochyyev Perman",International Journal of Educational Development,364,20

In our paper, we propose a deep learning-founded enterprise solution for smart store customer relationship management (CRM), which allows us to predict the age and gender from a customer’s face image taken in an unconstrained environment to facilitate the smart store’s extended services, as it is expected for a modern venture. For the age estimation problem, we mitigate the data sparsity problem of the large public IMDB-WIKI dataset by image enhancement from another dataset and perform data augmentation as required. We handle our classification tasks utilizing an empirically leading pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN), the VGG-16 network, and incorporate batch normalization. Especially, the age estimation task is posed as a deep classification problem followed by a multinomial logistic regression first-moment refinement. We validate our system for two standard benchmarks, one for each task, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for both real age and gender estimation. © 2021 by the authors.

Thirteen symptoms were recorded after 3, 7, 10 and 14 days. The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with any of four cardinal (group A) symptoms: fever, cough, shortness of breath or anosmia. At baseline, symptoms in decreasing frequency were: cough (53.2%), weakness (44.9%), headache (42.6%), pain (35.2%), sore throat (28.7%), runny nose (26.9%), chills (22.7%), shortness of breath (22.2%), anosmia (18.5%), fever (16.2%), diarrhea (6.9%), nausea/vomiting (6.5%) and irritability/confusion (3.2%). Group A symptoms in the placebo vs hesperidin group was 88.8% vs 88.5% (day 1) and reduced to 58.5 vs 49.4 % at day 14 (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.38-1.27, p = 0.23). At day 14, 15 subjects in the placebo group and 28 in the hesperidin group failed to report their symptoms. In an attrition bias analysis imputing ''no symptoms'' to missing values, the hesperidin group shows reduction of 14.5 % of group A symptoms from 50.9% to 36.4% (OR: 0.55, 0.32-0.96, p = 0.03). Anosmia, the most frequent persisting symptom (29.3%), was lowered by 7.3% at 25.3 % in the hesperidin group vs 32.6% in the placebo group (p = 0.29).

Therefore, the determination of the removal efficiencies and the fates of micropollutants in a full-scale leachate treatment plant located in the largest city of Turkey were aimed in this study. Some important processes, such as equalization pond, bioreactor, ultrafiltration (UF) and nanofiltration (NF), are being operated in the treatment plant. Landfill leachate was characterized as an intense pollution source of macro and micropollutants compared to other water types. Chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH3, suspended solids (SS) and electrical conductivity (EC) values of the landfill leachate (and their removal efficiencies in the treatment plant) were determined as 18,656 ± 12,098 mg/L (98%), 3090 ± 845 mg/L (99%), 4175 ± 1832 mg/L (95%) and 31 ± 2 mS/cm (51%), respectively. Within the scope of the study, the most frequently and abundantly detected micropollutants in the treatment plant were found as heavy metals (8 ± 1.7 mg/L), VOCs (38 ± 2 µg/L), alkylphenols (9 ± 3 µg/L) and phthalates (8 ± 3 µg/L) and the overall removal efficiencies of these micropollutants ranged from -11% to 100% in the treatment processes. The main removal mechanism of VOCs in the aerobic treatment process has been found as the volatilization due to Henry constants greater than 100 Pa·m3/mol. However, the molecular weight cut off restriction of UF membrane has caused to less or negative removal efficiencies for some VOCs. The biological treatment unit which consists of sequential anoxic and oxic units (A/O) was found effective on the removal of PAHs (62%) and alkylphenols (87%). It was inferred that both NO3 accumulation in anoxic reactor, high hydraulic retention time (HRT) and sludge retention time (SRT) in aerobic reactor provide higher biodegradation and volatilization efficiencies as compared to the literature. Membrane processes were more effective on the removal of alkylphenols (60-80%) and pesticides (59-74%) in terms of influent and effluent loads of each unit. Removal efficiencies for Cu, Ni and Cr, which were the dominant heavy metals, were determined as 92, 91 and 51%, respectively and the main removal mechanism for heavy metals has thought to be coprecipitation of suspended solids by microbial biopolymers in the bioreactor and the separation of colloids during membrane filtration. Total effluent loads of the LTP for VOCs, semi volatiles and heavy metals were 1.0 g/day, 5.2 g/day and 1.5 kg/day, respectively. It has been concluded that the LTP was effectively removing both conventional pollutants and micropollutants with the specific operation costs of 0.27 $/(kg of removed COD), 0.13 $/(g of removed VOCs), 0.35 $/(g of removed SVOCs) and 2.6 $/(kg of removed metals).","Argun, Mehmet Emin; Akkus, Mehmet; Ates, Havva",Sci Total Environ,364,1

391087,391087,391087,Qualitative serology in patients recovered from SARS CoV 2 infection,12.004775,11.54465,2020,"Background: COVID-19 threatens the global community because a large fraction of infected people are asymptomatic, yet can effectively transmit SARS-CoV-2. Finding and isolating these silent carriers is a crucial step in confining the spread of the disease. A sudden loss of the sense of smell has been self-reported by COVID-19 patients across different countries, consistent with expression of the molecular factors mediating SARS-CoV-2 uptake into human olfactory epithelial supporting cells. However, precise quantification of olfactory loss in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers is missing to date. Methods: To quantify olfactory functions in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, we designed an olfactory-action meter that determines detectability indices at different odor concentrations and an olfactory matching accuracy score using monomolecular odors. The optimization of test parameters allowed us to reliably and accurately assess olfactory deficits in a patient within 20 minutes. Findings: Measurement of detection indices at low concentrations revealed a 50% reduction in asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers. Further, patients with better detection scores showed significantly reduced olfactory matching accuracies compared to normal healthy subjects. Our quantification of olfactory loss, considering all parameters, identified 82% of the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers with olfactory deficits. However, on subjective evaluation, only 15% of the patients noticed a compromised ability to smell. Interpretation: Compromised olfactory fitness can serve as a strong basis for identifying asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Detailed design specifications and protocols provided here should enable the development of a sensitive, fast, and economical screening strategy that can be administered to large populations to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19.

Rapidly generated viral genome sequences have allowed the spread of the virus to be tracked via phylogenetic analysis (Hadfield et al ., 2018; Pybus et al ., 2020; Worobey et al ., 2020). While the virus spread globally in early 2020 before borders closed, intercontinental travel has since been greatly reduced, allowing continent-specific variants to emerge. However, within Europe travel resumed in the summer of 2020, and the impact of this travel on the epidemic is not well understood. Here we report on a novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, 20A.EU1, that emerged in Spain in early summer, and subsequently spread to multiple locations in Europe, accounting for the majority of sequences by autumn. We find no evidence of increased transmissibility of this variant, but instead demonstrate how rising incidence in Spain, resumption of travel across Europe, and lack of effective screening and containment may explain the variant's success. Despite travel restrictions and quarantine requirements, we estimate 20A.EU1 was introduced hundreds of times to countries across Europe by summertime travellers, likely undermining local efforts to keep SARS-CoV-2 cases low. Our results demonstrate how genomic surveillance is critical to understanding how travel can impact SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and thus for informing future containment strategies as travel resumes. CAVEATS: 20A.EU1 most probably rose in frequency in multiple countries due to travel and difference in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. There is no evidence that it spreads faster . There are currently no data to evaluate whether this variant affects the severity of the disease . While dominant in some countries, 20A.EU1 has not taken over everywhere and diverse variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to circulate across Europe. 20A.EU1 is not the cause of the European 'second wave.'","Hodcroft, Emma B; Zuber, Moira; Nadeau, Sarah; Crawford, Katharine H D; Bloom, Jesse D; Veesler, David; Vaughan, Timothy G; Comas, Iñaki; Candelas, Fernando González; Stadler, Tanja; Neher, Richard A",,364,0

DESIGN: We nested an analytical cross-sectional study of COVID-19-related stigma and bullying among HCW within a larger mixed-methods effort assessing COVID-19-related lived experience and impact. Adjusted OR (aOR) and 95% CIs evaluated the association between working in healthcare settings and experience of COVID-19-related bullying and stigma, controlling for confounders. Thematic qualitative analysis provided insight into lived experience of COVID-19-related bullying. SETTING: We recruited potential participants in four languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian) through Amazon Mechanical Turk's online workforce and Facebook. PARTICIPANTS: Our sample included 7411 people from 173 countries who were aged 18 years or over. FINDINGS: HCW significantly experienced more COVID-19-related bullying after controlling for the confounding effects of job-related, personal, geographic and sociocultural variables (aOR: 1.5; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0). HCW more frequently believed that people gossip about others with COVID-19 (OR: 2.2; 95% CI 1.9 to 2.6) and that people with COVID-19 lose respect in the community (OR: 2.3; 95% CI 2.0 to 2.7), both which elevate bullying risk (OR: 2.7; 95% CI 2.3 to 3.2, and OR: 3.5; 95% CI 2.9 to 4.2, respectively). The lived experience of COVID-19-related bullying relates frequently to public identities as HCW traverse through the community, intersecting with other domains (eg, police, racism, violence). INTERPRETATION: After controlling for a range of confounding factors, HCW are significantly more likely to experience COVID-19-related stigma and bullying, often in the intersectional context of racism, violence and police involvement in community settings.","Dye, Timothy D; Alcantara, Lisette; Siddiqi, Shazia; Barbosu, Monica; Sharma, Saloni; Panko, Tiffany; Pressman, Eva",BMJ Open,364,1

They are powerful because there are consequences associated with breaking laws. The intention of legislation is to create societies where all people are compelled to do what is good. The assumption inherent in legislation is that ‘laws serve the common good’. This however, is not always the case in reality. There are good and bad laws. This chapter analyses Zimbabwe’s regulatory framework to assess its impact of the urban food system. The data was collected by reviewing the relevant laws, by-laws, policies and plans used in the regulation of the urban food system. The examination reveals that most Zimbabwean laws are very old and have not been regularly reviewed to reflect contemporary challenges and the socio-economic reality. They are not responsive and cannot respond to pandemics, such as the COVID-19. They have not been adapted to meet the objectives of the New Urban Agenda (NUA). Some of the most frequently used laws were enacted for a different era and no longer effectively serve under the current circumstances. The study also reveals that the laws are negative and aim to control and stop rather than facilitate innovation and encourage compliance. It concludes that Zimbabwean authorities must consider a new innovative people-centred approach to enacting legislation to govern livelihoods in general and the food system in particular. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Toriro, P.",Advances in 21st Century Human Settlements,364,12

However, the extremely low oral bioavailability of Pae (approximately 3%-4%) limits its formulation development and clinical application. This study aimed to develop micelles using the glycyrrhizic acid (GL) as the carrier to improve the oral absorption of Pae. METHODS: Pae loaded GL micelles were prepared by the ultrasonic dispersion method and its formulation was optimized by single-factor tests. Characterizations of Pae loaded GL micelles including particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), drug loading (DL), morphology, and drug release in vitro were carried out. The single-pass intestinal perfusion and pharmacokinetic studies of Pae loaded GL micelles were also evaluated in rats and compared with Pae solution and the mixed solution of Pae and GL. RESULTS: The optimized Pae loaded GL micelles had EE of (42.21 ± 0.89)%, particle size of (58.89 ± 4.24) nm with PDI of (0.194 ± 0.010), zeta potential of (-24.40 ± 1.90) mV. Pae loaded GL micelles showed a nearly spherical shape under TEM. Drug release of micelles demonstrated a delayed drug release compared to Pae solution. The single-pass intestinal perfusion study showed a significantly higher permeability of Pae in duodenum (P < 0.05), jejunum (P < 0.05), ileum (P < 0.01) and colon (P < 0.01) intestine after perfusion of Pae loaded GL micelles as compared to Pae solution. The in vivo pharmacokinetics demonstrated that the Cmax and AUC0-t values of Pae loaded GL micelles were approximately 2.18- and 3.64-fold superior than the Pae solution. CONCLUSION: These results suggested GL could be a potential carrier for the oral delivery of Pae.","Shen, Chengying; Shen, Baode; Zhu, Junjun; Wang, Jing; Yuan, Hailong; Li, Xiaofang",Drug Dev Ind Pharm,364,1

Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable which satisfies an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, time-dependent variable R(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable R(t) can be interpreted as a generalized effective reproduction number. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability since the model is formulated in terms of the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the sample effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. Extrapolated values of R(t) can be used in the model to make reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and the ongoing results are available on a web-based platform[1]. In this paper, we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of four to five weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.","Köhler-Rieper, Felix; Röhl, Claudius H.

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of all patients who underwent emergency orthopaedic trauma surgery at a single urban major trauma centre over the first six-week period of national lockdown. Demographics, co-morbidities, injuries, injury severity scores, surgery, COVID-19 status, complications and mortalities were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were included for review who underwent multiple procedures. Significant co-morbidity was present in 72%. The overall COVID-19 infection rate of the study population at any time was 22%. Sub-group analysis indicated 13% had active COVID-19 at the time of surgery. Only 4% of patients developed COVID-19 post surgery with no mortalities in this sub-group. The overall mortality rate was 4%. The overall complication rate was 14%. However mortality and complications rates were higher if the patients had active COVID-19 at surgery, if they were over 70 years and had sustained life-threatening injuries. CONCLUSION: The overall survival rate for patients undergoing emergency orthopaedic trauma surgery during the COVID-19 peak was 96%. The rate of any complication was more significant in those presenting with active COVID-19 infections who had sustained potentially life threatening injuries and were over 70 years of age. Conversely those without active COVID-19 infection and who lacked significant co-morbidities experienced a lower complication and mortality rate.","Hope, Natalie; Gulli, Valeria; Hay, Daniel; Tahmassebi, Ramon; Vasireddy, Aswinkumar; Tavakkolizadeh, Adel; Colegate-Stone, Toby",Surg.

OBJECTIVE.­: To accurately reflect the preexisting diseases and pathologic conditions of decedents with SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infection through autopsy. DESIGN.­: Comprehensive data from 135 autopsy evaluations of COVID-19-positive decedents is presented, including histologic assessment. Postmortem examinations were performed by 36 pathologists at 19 medical centers or forensic institutions in the United States and Brazil. Data from each autopsy were collected through the online submission of multiple-choice and open-ended survey responses. RESULTS.­: Patients dying of or with COVID-19 had an average of 8.89 pathologic conditions documented at autopsy, spanning a combination of prior chronic disease and acute conditions acquired during hospitalization. Virtually all decedents were cited as having more than 1 preexisting condition, encompassing an average of 2.88 such diseases each.

Male COVID-2019 patients were more likely to develop severe pneumonia. Patients with severe and critical conditions are older and have higher rates of hypertension (P = .003) and coronary heart disease (P = .017). All severe and critical patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed bilateral lung involvement and have more multiple lobes involvement than common patients (P < .001). Severe and critical patients showed higher white blood cell count (P = .006), neutrophil (NEU) count (P = .001), NEU% (P = .002), procalcitonin (P = .011), C-reactive protein (P = .003), prothrombin time (P = .035), D-dimer (P = .025), aspartate aminotransferase (P = .006), and lower lymphocyte (LYM) count (P = .019), LYM% (P = .001), albumin (P < .001). Logistic regression analysis showed that NEU count is an independent risk factor for deterioration, with the threshold of 6.5 × 109 ·L-1 . We concluded that the laboratory independent risk factor for the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia is NEU count. In addition, COVID-19 patients with bilateral lung involvement or multiple lobes involvement should be taken seriously and actively treated to prevent deterioration of the disease.","Wang, Chang-Zheng; Hu, Shun-Lin; Wang, Lin; Li, Min; Li, Huan-Tian",J. med. virol,364,10

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a review of current literature related to surgical and clinical management of patients during COVID-19 crisis paying special attention to oncological ones and especially those suffering from PCa. Based on these publications and current urological guidelines, a manual to manage PCa patients is suggested. RESULTS: Patients suffering from cancer are likely to develop serious complications from COVID-19 disease together with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the management of oncological patients should be taken into special consideration and most of the treatments postponed. In case the procedure is not deferrable, it should be adapted to the current situation. While the shortest radiotherapy (RT) regimens should be applied, surgical procedures must undergo the following recommendations proposed by main surgical associations. PCa prognosis is generally favourable and therefore one can safely delay most of the biopsies up to 6 months without interfering with survival outcomes in the vast majority of cases. In the same way, most of the localised PCa patients are suitable for active surveillance (AS) or hormonal therapy until local definitive treatment could be reconsidered. In metastatic as well as castration resistant PCa stages, adding androgen receptor targeted agents (abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide) to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) could be considered in high risk patients. On the contrary, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and Radium-223 must be avoided with regard to the consequence of hematologic toxicity and risk of COVID-19 infection because of immunodepression. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the biopsies should be delayed while AS is advised in those patients with low risk PCa. ADT allows us to defer definitive local treatment in many cases of intermediate and high risk PCa. In regard to metastatic and castration resistant PCa, combination therapies with abiraterone, apalutamide, darolutamide or enzalutamide could be considered. Chemotherapy, Radium-223 and immunotherapy are discouraged.","Sanchez, Lara Rodriguez; Cathelineau, Xavier; Pinto, Alexis M Alva; Borque-Fernando, Ángel; Gil, Maria Jesús; Yee, Chi-Hang; Sanchez-Salas, Rafael",Int Braz J Urol,364,15

We sought to determine the cost and success of implementation of a podcast for a surgical department in a large academic hospital. METHODS: We created a podcast series for Israeli medical students during the COVID-19 epidemic based on the Medical Student Core Curriculum of the American College of Surgeons / Association for Surgical Education. Episodes were available for free download or streaming on a designated website and popular podcast platforms. Podcast analytics were used to measure public listeners and uptake. RESULTS: Total development time was 90 hours at an estimated cost of $7091 USD. A total of 10 episodes were released between March 21, 2020 and August 31, 2020. An average of 9 ± 1.26 h (range 2-6) was required to generate each episode, including 3.4 ± 1.26 h (2-6) for content review and 5.6 ± 2 h (4-10) for audio production. An average episode ran for 35.9 ± 4.3 min (28-42). Podcasts recorded a total of 5678 downloads, with an average of 228 and 336 downloads per episode in the first 30 and 90 days, respectively. The average daily downloads before the students returned to clinical rotations (March 21-April 30) was 48 ± 58.3 (7-283;) compared to 16 ± 7.4 after their return (1-38; P< 0.01). Estimated costs to produce a video-based education series would have been significantly more. CONCLUSION: Podcasts can serve as a cost-effective and quickly produced instructional tool to supplement online learning. Further research is required to determine the efficacy of podcasts versus video-based education modules.","Anteby, Roi; Amiel, Imri; Cordoba, Mordehay; Axelsson, Carl Gustaf S; Rosin, Danny; Phitayakorn, Roy",J Surg Res,364,6

Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have been shown to have increased vulnerability and risk to disasters due to links between racism, vulnerability, and economic power, based on disadvantage related to different disaster stages: 1) reduced perception of personal disaster risk; 2) lack of preparedness; 3) reduced access and response to warning systems; 4) increased physical impacts due to substandard housing; 5) likelihood of poorer psychological outcomes; 6) cultural insensitivity on the part of emergency workers; 7) marginalization, lower socio-economic status, and less familiarity with support resources leading to protracted recovery; and 8) diminished standard of living, job loss, and exacerbated poverty during reconstruction and community rebuilding. Moreover, given that psychiatric morbidity is predictable in populations exposed to disasters, mental health and psychosocial support programs should increasingly become a standard part of a humanitarian response. In the crisis and immediate recovery phase of disasters, the focus should be on making survivors feel safe and giving them assistance in decreasing their anxiety by addressing their basic needs and welfare. So, it is critical that governmental institutions, business, and non-profit organizations proactively find mechanisms to work collaboratively and share resources. Special attention and extra resources must be directed towards vulnerable and marginalized populations.

Existing molecular profiling studies have focused on analysing functional omics data of a single type, which captures changes in a small subset of the molecular perturbations caused by the virus. As the logical next step, results from multiple such omics analysis may be aggregated to comprehensively interpret the molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative approach is to integrate data simultaneously in a parallel fashion to highlight the inter-relationships of disease-driving biomolecules, in contrast to comparing processed information from each omics level separately. We demonstrate that valuable information may be masked by using the former fragmented views in analysis, and biomarkers resulting from such an approach cannot provide a systematic understanding of the disease aetiology. Hence, we present a generic, reproducible and flexible open-access data harmonisation framework that can be scaled out to future multi-omics analysis to study a phenotype in a holistic manner. The pipeline source code, detailed documentation and automated version as a R package are accessible. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline, we applied it to a drug screening task. We integrated multi-omics data to find the lowest level of statistical associations between data features in two case studies. Strongly correlated features within each of these two datasets were used for drug-target analysis, resulting in a list of 84 drug-target candidates. Further computational docking and toxicity analyses revealed seven high-confidence targets, amsacrine, bosutinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, nintedanib and sunitinib as potential starting points for drug therapy and development.","Chen, Tyrone; Philip, Melcy; Lê Cao, Kim-Anh; Tyagi, Sonika",Brief. bioinform,364,9

Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression. Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS). Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety. Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables. Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals' mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders. Clinical psychologists should identify individuals' particular cognition and mental disorders to provide a more accurate and adequate intervention for them.","Zhu, Yue; Zhang, Lihua; Zhou, Xia; Li, Chenxiang; Yang, Dong",J Affect Disord,364,33

We report population-based, age- and-sex-specific background incidence rates of conditions representing potential vaccine adverse events of special interest (AESI) for the Swedish general population using register data. MethodsWe studied an age/sex-stratified random 10% sample of the Swedish population on 1 Jan 2020, followed for AESI outcomes during 1 year, as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and developed, before the start of vaccinations. We selected and defined the following outcomes based on information from regulatory authorities, large-scale adverse events initiatives and previous studies: aseptic meningitis, febrile seizure, Kawasaki syndrome, MISC, post-infectious arthritis, arthritis, myocarditis, ARDS, myocardial infarction, stroke, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, kidney failure, liver failure, erythema multiforme, disseminated intravascular coagulation, autoimmune thyroiditis, and appendicitis. We calculated incidence rates stratified by age, sex and time period (quarters of 2020), and classified them using Council of International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) categories: very common, common, uncommon, rare, or very rare. ResultsWe included 972,723 study subjects, representing the Swedish national population on 1 Jan 2020. We found that AESI incidence rates vary greatly by age and in some cases sex. Several common AESIs showed expected increase with age, while some (e.g. appendicitis, aseptic meningitis, autoimmune thyroiditis, Kawasaki syndrome and MISC) were more common in young people, and others exhibited a flatter age pattern (e.g. myocarditis, DIC and erythema multiforme). Consequently, the CIOMS classification for AESIs varied widely according to age. Considerable variability was suggested for some AESI rates across the 4 quarters of 2020, potentially related to pandemic waves, seasonal variation, healthcare system overload or other healthcare delivery effects. ConclusionAge, sex, and timing of rates are important to consider when background AESI rates are compared to corresponding rates observed with COVID-19 vaccines.","Nyberg, Fredrik; Lindh, Magnus; Vanfleteren, Lowie EGW; Hammar, Niklas; Wettermark, Björn; Sundström, Johan; Santosa, Ailiana; Kirui, Brian K; Gisslén, Magnus",,364,1

Current platforms available to distribute scientific and clinical research data and information include preprint repositories and traditional peer-reviewed journal articles. Social media (SoMe) has now also emerged as a helpful platform to share discoveries in science and medicine. OBJECTIVE: This study analyzed activity on SoMe (specifically, Twitter) as it compared to the activity of article publications - in the form of preprints and peer-reviewed journals - related to COVID-19 and gastroenterology (GI) during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data from Twitter (Tweets, user data), preprint servers (Bio/MedRxiv)and PubMed (articles published) related to COVID-19 was collected and analyzed during the first 6 months of the pandemic, from December 2019 through May 2020. Global and regional geographic and gastrointestinal organ specific social media trends were compared to preprint and publication activity. Any relationships between Twitter activity and preprint articles published, as well as Twitter activity and PubMed articles published overall, by organ system and geographical location were identified using Spearman's rank-order correlation. RESULTS: Over the 6-month period, there were 73,079 tweets from 44,609 users, 7,164 journal article publications, and 4,702 preprint article publications. Twitter activity (number of Tweets) peaked during March while preprint and publication activity (number of articles published) peaked in April 2020. Overall, strong correlations were identified between the trends in activity of Twitter and both preprints and publications (p<0.001 for both). COVID-19 data across the 3 platforms mainly concentrated on pulmonology/critical care, but when looking at the field of GI, most tweets pertained to pancreatology, most publications focused on hepatology, and most preprints covered hepatology and luminal GI (LGI). Regarding GI subfields, there were significant positive associations between trends in Twitter activity and research for all topics (p=0.009 for LGI, p=0.006 for hepatology and IBD, p=0.007 for endoscopy), except pancreatology (p=0.2) - meaning that Twitter activity did not correlate to the same activity in publications. Finally, Twitter activity was highest in the US (7,331 tweets) whereas PubMed activity was highest in China (1,768 publications). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic displayed the potential of SoMe as a vehicle for disseminating scientific information during a public health crisis. Sharing and spreading info on COVID-19 in a timely manner during this time was key, and SoMe, particularly Twitter, achieved that much faster. Future investigation could demonstrate how SoMe can be used to augment and promote scholarly activity especially as the world begins relying more and more on digital/virtual platforms. Scientists and clinicians should consider the use of SoMe in augmenting public awareness of their scholarly pursuits.","Taneja, Sonia L; Passi, Monica; Bhattacharya, Sumona; Schueler, Samuel A; Gurram, Sandeep; Koh, Christopher",J. med. internet res,364,32

Their dysfunctions result in different diseases like cancer making them an important drug target in oncology and beyond. The present study aims at identifying the selective inhibitors for ATP binding site in CDK proteins (CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK5) following a multi-target drug designing approach. Significant challenges lie in identifying the selective inhibitor for the ATP binding site as this region is highly conserved in all protein kinases. Molecular docking coupled with molecular dynamics simulation and free energy of binding calculations (MMPBSA/MMGBSA) were used to identify the potent competitive ATP binding site inhibitors. All the four proteins were docked against the library of drug-like compounds and the outcomes of the docking study were further analyzed by Molecular dynamics (total of 6µs) and MMPB/GBSA techniques. Five different inhibitors for structurally distant protein kinases, i.e. CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK5 are identified with the binding energy (&#916;Gbind-PB) in the range -18.24 to -28.43Kcal/mol. Mechanistic complexities associated with the binding of the inhibitor are unraveled by carefully analyzing the MD trajectories. It is observed that certain residues (Lys33, Asp127, Asp145, Tyr15, Gly16, Asn144) and regions are critical for the retention of inhibitors in active pocket, and significant conformational changes take place in the active site region as well as its neighbor following the entry of the ligand inside active pocket as inferred by RMSD and RMSF. It is observed that LIG3 and LIG4 are the best possible inhibitors as reflected from their high binding energy, interaction pattern, and their retention inside the active pocket. This study will facilitate the process of multi-target drug designing against CDK proteins and can be used in the development of potential therapeutics against different diseases.","Ahmed, Basharat; Khan, Sara; Nouroz, Faisal; Farooq, Umar; Khalid, Saba",J Biomol Struct Dyn,364,9

Such testing strategy may miss out on detecting asymptomatic individuals who got infected via community spread. Thus, it is important to allocate a separate budget of test-kits per day targeted towards preventing community spread and detecting new cases early on. In this report, we consider the problem of allocating test-kits and discuss some solution approaches. We believe that these approaches will be useful to contain community spread and detect new cases early on. Additionally, these approaches would help in collecting unbiased data which can then be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models trained to predict COVID-19 infections.","Biswas, Arpita; Bannur, Shruthi; Jain, Prateek; Merugu, Srujana",,364,4

The number of people who are still vulnerable to the virus is too high to hamper new outbreaks, leading a compelling need to find new therapeutic options devoted to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection. Drug repurposing represents an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. RESULTS: We developed a network-based tool for drug repurposing provided as a freely available R-code, called SAveRUNNER (Searching off-lAbel dRUg aNd NEtwoRk), with the aim to offer a promising framework to efficiently detect putative novel indications for currently marketed drugs against diseases of interest. SAveRUNNER predicts drug-disease associations by quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-associated proteins in the human interactome through the computation of a novel network-based similarity measure, which prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases located in the same network neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: The algorithm was successfully applied to predict off-label drugs to be repositioned against the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2), and it achieved a high accuracy in the identification of well-known drug indications, thus revealing itself as a powerful tool to rapidly detect potential novel medical indications for various drugs that are worth of further investigation.

We analyzed the association of the SNPs with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of COVID-19. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2-positive and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients did not differ regarding demographics.

Two novel coronaviruses, currently placed in the Gammacoronavirus genus, appeared intermediate in this regard, as the second IDR structure could be barely discerned with a low probability of disorder. Interestingly, these two are the only coronaviruses thus far isolated from marine mammals, namely beluga whale and bottlenose dolphin, two highly related species; the N proteins of the viruses were also virtually identical, differing by a single amino acid. These two unique viruses remain phylogenetic oddities, since gammacoronaviruses are generally avian (bird) in nature. Lastly, both IDRs, regardless of the coronavirus genus in which they occurred, were rich in Ser and Arg, in agreement with their disordered structure. It is postulated that the central IDRs make cardinal contributions in the multitasking role of the nucleocapsid protein, likely requiring structural plasticity, perhaps also impinging on coronavirus host tropism and cross-species transmission.","Barik, Sailen",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,364,22

The causal agent being SARS-CoV-2, a member of the long-known Coronaviridae family, is a positive sense single-stranded enveloped virus and quite closely related to SARS-CoV. It has become the need of the hour to understand the pathophysiology of this disease, so that drugs, vaccines, treatment regimens and plausible therapeutic agents can be produced. METHODS: In this regard, recent studies uncovered the fact that the viral genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes nonstructural proteins like RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which is an important tool for its transcription and replication process. A large number of nucleic acid based anti-viral drugs are being repurposed for treating COVID-19 targeting RdRp. Few of them are in the advanced stage of clinical trials including Remdesivir. While performing close investigation of the large set of nucleic acid based drugs, we were surprised to find that the synthetic nucleic acid backbone is explored very little or rare. RESULTS: We have designed scaffolds derived from peptide nucleic acid (PNA) and subjected them for in-silico screening systematically. These designed molecules have demonstrated excellent binding towards RdRp. Compound 12 was found to possess similar binding affinity as Remdesivir with comparable pharmacokinetics. However, the in-silico toxicity prediction indicates compound 12 may be a superior molecule which can be explored further due to its excellent safety-profile with LD50 (12,000mg/kg) as opposed to Remdesivir (LD50 =1000mg/kg). CONCLUSION: Compound 12 falls in the safe category of class 6. Synthetic feasibility, equipotent binding and very low toxicity of this peptide nucleic acid derived compounds can serve as a leading scaffold to design, synthesize and evaluate many of similar compounds for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sahu, Bichismita; Behera, Santosh Kumar; Das, Rudradip; Dalvi, Tanay; Chowdhury, Arnab; Dewangan, Bhaskar; Kalia, Kiran; Shard, Amit",Current computer-aided drug design (Online),364,16

Guidance is therefore needed regarding use of agents with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in pediatrics. METHODS: A panel of pediatric infectious diseases physicians and pharmacists from 18 geographically diverse North American institutions was convened. Through a series of teleconferences and web-based surveys, a set of guidance statements was developed and refined based on review of best available evidence and expert opinion. RESULTS: Given the typically mild course of pediatric COVID-19, supportive care alone is suggested for the overwhelming majority of cases. The panel suggests a decision-making framework for antiviral therapy that weighs risks and benefits based on disease severity as indicated by respiratory support needs, with consideration on a case-by-case basis of potential pediatric risk factors for disease progression. If an antiviral is used, the panel suggests remdesivir as the preferred agent. Hydroxychloroquine could be considered for patients who are not candidates for remdesivir or when remdesivir is not available. Antivirals should preferably be used as part of a clinical trial if available. CONCLUSIONS: Antiviral therapy for COVID-19 is not necessary for the great majority of pediatric patients. For those rare children who develop severe or critical disease, this guidance offer an approach for decision-making regarding antivirals, informed by available data. As evidence continues to evolve rapidly, the need for updates to the guidance is anticipated.","Chiotos, Kathleen; Hayes, Molly; Kimberlin, David W; Jones, Sarah B; James, Scott H; Pinninti, Swetha G; Yarbrough, April; Abzug, Mark J; MacBrayne, Christine E; Soma, Vijaya L; Dulek, Daniel E; Vora, Surabhi B; Waghmare, Alpana; Wolf, Joshua; Olivero, Rosemary; Grapentine, Steven; Wattier, Rachel L; Bio, Laura; Cross, Shane J; Dillman, Nicholas O; Downes, Kevin J; Timberlake, Kathryn; Young, Jennifer; Orscheln, Rachel C; Tamma, Pranita D; Schwenk, Hayden T; Zachariah, Philip; Aldrich, Margaret; Goldman, David L; Groves, Helen E; Lamb, Gabriella S; Tribble, Alison C; Hersh, Adam L; Thorell, Emily A; Denison, Mark R; Ratner, Adam J; Newland, Jason G; Nakamura, Mari M",Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,364,28

Response to this ongoing pandemic requires extensive collaboration across the scientific community in an attempt to contain its impact and limit further transmission. Mathematical modelling has been at the forefront of these response efforts by: (1) providing initial estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction rate, R0 (of approximately 2-3); (2) updating these estimates following the implementation of various interventions (with significantly reduced, often sub-critical, transmission rates); (3) assessing the potential for global spread before significant case numbers had been reported internationally; and (4) quantifying the expected disease severity and burden of COVID-19, indicating that the likely true infection rate is often orders of magnitude greater than estimates based on confirmed case counts alone. In this review, we highlight the critical role played by mathematical modelling to understand COVID-19 thus far, the challenges posed by data availability and uncertainty, and the continuing utility of modelling-based approaches to guide decision making and inform the public health response. Unless otherwise stated, all bracketed error margins correspond to the 95% credible interval (CrI) for reported estimates.","Meehan, Michael T; Rojas, Diana P; Adekunle, Adeshina I; Adegboye, Oyelola A; Caldwell, Jamie M; Turek, Evelyn; Williams, Bridget M; Marais, Ben J; Trauer, James M; McBryde, Emma S",Paediatr Respir Rev,364,21

A few reports have showed that mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 is higher in elderly patients and other active comorbidities including cancer. To date, no effective treatment has been identified and management for critically ill patients relies on management in intensive care units. Patients with lung cancer are at risk of pulmonary complications from COVID-19. Furthermore, the use of chemotherapy might have a negative impact in patient's outcome. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of systemic anticancer treatment (SACT) has to be considered. For each patient, several factors including age and comorbidities, as well as the number of hospital visits for treatment, can influence this risk. Each hospital around the world has issued some internal policy guidelines for oncologists, aiming to limit risks during this difficult time. We hereby propose a tool to support oncologists and physicians in treatment decision for patients with lung cancer. There are several variables to consider, including the extent of the epidemic, the local healthcare structure capacity, the risk of infection to the individual, the status of cancer, patients' comorbidities, age and details of the treatment.

Here we compare characteristics in children with elevated ALT (E-ALT) in two distinct manifestations of the infection, multisystem inflammatory syndrome-children (MIS-C) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients &#8804;21 years of age with positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. E-ALT was defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 40 U/L. Bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression were obtained to describe differences in children with and without E-ALT in COVID-19 and MIS-C. RESULTS: E-ALT was detected in 36% of the 291 patients; 31% with COVID-19, and 51% with MIS-C. E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with obesity (P < .001), immunocompromised status (P = .04), and chronic liver disease (P = .01). In the regression models, E-ALT in COVID-19 was associated with higher c-reactive protein (OR 1.08, P = .01) after adjusting for common independent predictors. Children with E-ALT and MIS-C were more often boys (P = .001), Hispanic (P = .04), or Black (P < .001). In MIS-C, male gender (OR 5.3, P = .02) and Black race (OR 4.4, P = .04) were associated with increased odds of E-ALT. Children with E-ALT in both cohorts had significantly higher multiorgan dysfunction, longer hospitalization, and ICU stay. Children with MIS-C had 2.3-fold increased risk of E-ALT compared to COVID-19. No association was found between E-ALT and mortality. CONCLUSION: E-ALT with SARS-CoV-2 presents as elevated transaminases without hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Patients with either manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and E-ALT experienced more severe disease.","Perez, Adriana; Cantor, Amanda; Rudolph, Bryan; Miller, Jonathan; Kogan-Liberman, Debora; Gao, Qi; Da Silva, Bernardo; Margolis, Kara G; Ovchinsky, Nadia; Martinez, Mercedes",Liver int,364,24

While quarantine, self-isolation and shutdown laws helped to effectively contain and control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the impact of COVID-19 shutdowns on trauma care in emergency departments (EDs) remains elusive. METHODS: All ED patient records from the 35-day COVID-19 shutdown (SHUTDOWN) period were retrospectively compared to a calendar-matched control period in 2019 (CTRL) as well as to a pre (PRE)- and post (POST)-shutdown period in an academic Level I Trauma Center in Berlin, Germany. Total patient and orthopedic trauma cases and contacts as well as trauma causes and injury patterns were evaluated during respective periods regarding absolute numbers, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and risk ratios (RRs). FINDINGS: Daily total patient cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 106.94 vs. 167.54) and orthopedic trauma cases (SHUTDOWN vs. CTRL, 30.91 vs. 52.06) decreased during the SHUTDOWN compared to the CTRL period with IRRs of 0.64 and 0.59. While absolute numbers decreased for most trauma causes during the SHUTDOWN period, we observed increased incidence proportions of household injuries and bicycle accidents with RRs of 1.31 and 1.68 respectively. An RR of 2.41 was observed for injuries due to domestic violence. We further recorded increased incidence proportions of acute and regular substance abuse during the SHUTDOWN period with RRs of 1.63 and 3.22, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: While we observed a relevant decrease in total patient cases, relative proportions of specific trauma causes and injury patterns increased during the COVID-19 shutdown in Berlin, Germany. As government programs offered prompt financial aid during the pandemic to individuals and businesses, additional social support may be considered for vulnerable domestic environments.","Maleitzke, Tazio; Pumberger, Matthias; Gerlach, Undine A; Herrmann, Carolin; Slagman, Anna; Henriksen, Louise S; von Mauchenheim, Frederic; Hüttermann, Nils; Santos, Anabel N; Fleckenstein, Florian N; Rauch, Geraldine; Märdian, Sven; Perka, Carsten; Stöckle, Ulrich; Möckel, Martin; Lindner, Tobias; Winkler, Tobias",PLoS One,364,20

There is an unknown relationship of which coagulation profile parameter at presentation has an association with poor outcome in COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship between fibrinogen and FDP with poor outcome in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A systematic search of all observational studies or trials involving adult patients with COVID-19 that had any data fibrinogen or FDP on admission was carried out using the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We assessed the methodological quality assessment using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD). RESULTS: A total of 17 studies (1,654 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. It revealed a higher mean of fibrinogen levels on admission in patients with severe case compared to those with non-severe case (MDâ=â0.69, [95% CI: 0.44 to 0.94], pâ< â0.05; I2â=â72%, pâ< â0.05). Non-survivor group had a pooled higher mean difference of fibrinogen values on admission (MDâ=â0.48 [95% CI: 0.13 to 0.83], pâ< â0.05; I2â=â38%, pâ=â0.18). Higher FDP on admission was found in poor outcome (composite of severity, critically ill, and mortality) compared to good outcome (4 studies, MDâ=â4.84 [95% CI: 0.75 to 8.93], pâ< â0.05; I2â=â86%, pâ< â0.05). CONCLUSION: Elevated fibrinogen and FDP level on admission were associated with an increase risk of poor outcome in COVID-19 patients.","Nugroho, Johanes; Wardhana, Ardyan; Mulia, Eka Prasetya; Maghfirah, Irma; Rachmi, Dita",Clin Hemorheol Microcirc,364,1

Design: Retrospective cohort study of the temporal characteristics of clinical variables with time lock to mortality. Setting: Stony Brook University Hospital (New York) and Tongji Hospital. Patients: Patients with confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 using polymerase chain reaction testing. Patients from the Stony Brook University Hospital data were used for training (80%, N = 1,002) and testing (20%, N = 250), and 375 patients from the Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) data were used for testing. Intervention: None. Measurements and Main Results: Longitudinal clinical variables were analyzed as a function of days from outcome with time-lock-to-day of death (non-survivors) or discharge (survivors). A predictive model using the significant earliest predictors was constructed. Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (AUC). The predictive model found lactate dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, procalcitonin, D-dimer, C-reactive protein, respiratory rate, and white-blood cells to be early predictors of mortality. The AUC for the zero to 9 days prior to outcome were: 0.99, 0.96, 0.94, 0.90, 0.82, 0.75, 0.73, 0.77, 0.79, and 0.73, respectively (Stony Brook Hospital), and 1.0, 0.86, 0.88, 0.96, 0.91, 0.62, 0.67, 0.50, 0.63, and 0.57, respectively (Tongji Hospital). In comparison, prediction performance using hospital admission data was poor (AUC = 0.59). Temporal fluctuations of most clinical variables, indicative of physiological and biochemical instability, were markedly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: This study identified several clinical markers that demonstrated a temporal progression associated with mortality. These variables accurately predicted death within a few days prior to outcome, which provides objective indication that closer monitoring and interventions may be needed to prevent deterioration.","Chen, A.; Zhao, Z.; Hou, W.; Singer, A.

COVID-19 has highlighted the need for clear and accurate guidance on the use of aerosol-generating procedures, such as nebulization, for the treatment of patients with respiratory diseases with or without COVID-19. Despite the lack of evidence, there is heightened concern about the potential risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the form of aerosolized respiratory droplets during the nebulized treatment of patients with COVID-19. Consequently, the use of metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) has risen considerably as an alternative to nebulized therapy, which has led to inadequate supplies of MDIs in some parts of the United States. In this article, we review and discuss the role of nebulization in patients with SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment of noninfected patients with chronic respiratory diseases. The following two important questions are addressed: (1) should nebulized therapy be used in hospital or home settings by patients infected with SARS-CoV-2; and (2) should nebulized therapy be continued in patients already using it for chronic respiratory disease management in hospital or home settings?The reviews of this paper are available via the supplemental material section.","Sethi, Sanjay; Barjaktarevic, Igor Z; Tashkin, Donald P",Ther Adv Respir Dis,364,5

There is a much controversial debate about the major pathways of transmission of the virus including airborne route. The present work is a systematic literature review (SR) aimed to assess the association of air pollution especially particulate matter pollution in the transmission and acceleration of the spread of SARS-CoV-2. The systematic literature search was performed to identify the available studies published through October 31, 2020 concerning the transmission of the disease and particulate matter air pollution in four international electronic databases. From the results of the included studies, there are suggestions that atmospheric particulate matter pollution plays a role in the SARS-CoV-2 spread, but the literature has not confirmed that it enhances the transmission although some studies have proposed that atmospheric particulate matter can operate as a virus carrier, promoting its spread. Therefore, although PM concentration alone cannot be effective in spreading the COVID-19 disease, other meteorological and environmental parameters including size of particles in ambient air, weather conditions, wind speed, relative humidity (RH) and temperature are involved. Therefore, it is necessary to consider all influencing parameters to prevent the spreading of COVID-19 disease. More studies are required to strengthen the scientific evidence and support more definitive conclusions.","Maleki, Maryam; Anvari, Enayat; Hopke, Philip K; Noorimotlagh, Zahra; Mirzaee, Seyyed Abbas",Environ Res,364,20

Although antibodies that block this interaction are in emergency use as early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies, the precise determinants of neutralization potency remain unknown. We discovered a series of antibodies that potently block ACE2 binding but exhibit divergent neutralization efficacy against the live virus. Strikingly, these neutralizing antibodies can inhibit or enhance Spike-mediated membrane fusion and formation of syncytia, which are associated with chronic tissue damage in individuals with COVID-19. As revealed by cryoelectron microscopy, multiple structures of Spike-antibody complexes have distinct binding modes that not only block ACE2 binding but also alter the Spike protein conformational cycle triggered by ACE2 binding. We show that stabilization of different Spike conformations leads to modulation of Spike-mediated membrane fusion with profound implications for COVID-19 pathology and immunity.","Asarnow, Daniel; Wang, Bei; Lee, Wen-Hsin; Hu, Yuanyu; Huang, Ching-Wen; Faust, Bryan; Ng, Patricia Miang Lon; Ngoh, Eve Zi Xian; Bohn, Markus; Bulkley, David; Pizzorno, Andrés; Ary, Beatrice; Tan, Hwee Ching; Lee, Chia Yin; Minhat, Rabiatul Adawiyah; Terrier, Olivier; Soh, Mun Kuen; Teo, Frannie Jiuyi; Yeap, Yvonne Yee Chin; Seah, Shirley Gek Kheng; Chan, Conrad En Zuo; Connelly, Emily; Young, Nicholas J; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Renia, Laurent; Hanson, Brendon John; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Manglik, Aashish; Cheng, Yifan; Craik, Charles S; Wang, Cheng-I",Cell,364,22

As per the reports 2-DG is effective against SARS-COV- 2. Publication of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trial data is pending. However, it has been shown that 2-DG reduces the supplemental oxygen dependence on covid-19 infected patients and make their recovery faster. The present outbreak of Covid-19 infection due to SARS-CoV-2, a virus from the coronavirus family, has become a major menace to human being. As the understanding of the mechanism of the therapeutic action of 2-DG on SARS-CoV-2 infected hosts is missing, in this work we have studied the possible inhibitory interaction of the drug with two different pathways (a) with non-structured viral proteins involved in translation and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and (b) its inhibition mechanism of the glycolysis pathway. We have used our fully automated novel drug designing platform with state-of-the-art free energy of binding calculator PRinMTML-ESS to evaluate the role of 2-DG as an antiviral and glycolysis pathway inhibitor in SARS-CoV-2 affected humans. Docking, all atom molecular dynamic simulation and enhanced free energy sampling methods used in PRinMTML-ESS have predicted that 2-DG effectively reduced the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human cell by reducing the glycolytic flux, by competitive inhibition of glucose in binding with the enzyme hexokinase. 2-DG is generally administered in covid patient along with other antivirals and steroid, hence it can be used as a mild clinical therapy which can reduce the viral replication, inflammation when given in the earlier stage of the disease.","Boyli, Ghosh Sudip Roy Jayant K.

Simulating COVID-19 evolution in two full-scale cities with representative synthetic populations and mobility patterns, we analyze activity-based contact networks. We observe that transit contacts are scale-free in both cities, work contacts are Weibull distributed, and shopping or leisure contacts are exponentially distributed. We also investigate the impact of the transit network, finding that its removal dampens disease propagation, while work is also critical to post-peak disease spreading. Our framework, validated against existing case and mortality data, demonstrates the potential for tracking and tracing, along with detailed socio-demographic and mobility analyses of epidemic control strategies.","Kumar, Nishant; Oke, Jimi B.; Nahmias-Biran, Bat-hen",,364,16

Contact tracing using smartphone technology is a powerful tool that may be employed to limit disease transmission during an epidemic or pandemic; yet, contact tracing apps present significant privacy concerns regarding the collection of personal data such as location. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to develop an effective contact tracing smartphone app that respects user privacy by not collecting location information or other personal data. METHODS: We propose the use of an anonymized graph of interpersonal interactions to conduct a novel form of contact tracing and have developed a proof-of-concept smartphone app that implements this approach. Additionally, we developed a computer simulation model that demonstrates the impact of our proposal on epidemic or pandemic outbreak trajectories across multiple rates of adoption. RESULTS: Our proof-of-concept smartphone app allows users to create ""checkpoints"" for contact tracing, check their risk level based on their past interactions, and anonymously self-report a positive status to their peer network. Our simulation results suggest that higher adoption rates of such an app may result in a better controlled epidemic or pandemic outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed smartphone-based contact tracing method presents a novel solution that preserves privacy while demonstrating the potential to suppress an epidemic or pandemic outbreak. This app could potentially be applied to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as other epidemics or pandemics in the future to achieve a middle ground between drastic isolation measures and unmitigated disease spread.","Yasaka, Tyler M; Lehrich, Brandon M; Sahyouni, Ronald",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,364,30

Uncontrollable stress amplifies risk for maternal depression and anxiety, which are linked to adverse mother and child outcomes. This study examined change in internalizing symptoms from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant and postpartum women longitudinally, and investigated moderation by loneliness and other contextual risk factors. Methods: : 135 women (M ageâ¯=â¯31.81; 26% Latina, 55% non-Hispanic White, 11% Black; 39% low-income) enrolled in an existing prospective study completed self-report questionnaires including the EPDS and STAI-short form during early pregnancy, prior to COVID-19, and during COVID-19. Results: : Depressive symptoms were higher during COVID-19 compared to pre-COVID-19 and just as high as during early pregnancy. Anxiety symptoms were higher during COVID-19 compared to both pre-COVID-19 and early pregnancy. Higher loneliness was associated with increased depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Greater COVID-19 specific adversity was linked to greater increases in internalizing symptoms during COVID-19. Lower income-to-needs-ratio most strongly predicted symptoms during early pregnancy. Limitations: The present study is longitudinal, but the correlational nature of the data precludes causal conclusions regarding the effect of the pandemic on mental health. Conclusion: Longitudinal analyses suggest the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in increased internalizing symptoms among diverse pregnant and postpartum women. Interpersonal and contextual factors exacerbate risk and the impact of the pandemic on women's mental health. Identifying mothers at-risk for depression and anxiety may increase treatment utilization, mitigate fetal and infant exposure to maternal depression and anxiety, and help prevent adverse child outcomes.","Perzow, Sarah E D; Hennessey, Ella-Marie P; Hoffman, M Camille; Grote, Nancy K; Davis, Elysia Poggi; Hankin, Benjamin L",J Affect Disord Rep,364,16

The aim of this short report is to share our experience as a starting point for the management of the steady state of the pandemic. METHODS: The safety of the patients and department staff required a strict plan to minimize the risk of infection between operators whose absence would have made it impossible to carry out the radiotherapy treatments. The head of the radiotherapy unit and members of the Hospital Crisis Unit have put in place a series of measures to manage the emergency. RESULTS: A ""clean"" team has been established whose members are kept out of the radiotherapy unit for 2 weeks on rotation. Several separate work areas have been made in order to reduce direct contact between the staff. Each staff member has to wear protective equipment if close contact with patients is required. Before confirming a radiotherapy consult or a follow-up visit, telephone clinical and epidemiological screening is performed by nurses through a questionnaire regarding the presence of respiratory symptoms or eventual social contacts with COVID-19 positive people. Once the patients arrive in the hospital, a triage point at the entrance to the hospital performs a second screening and a temperature check. CONCLUSIONS: This management experience of a radiotherapy unit in Southern Italy could serve as a useful example for the future. In fact, in the steady state of infection many centers may face epidemiologically contagious numbers similar to those that we currently have in our region. These numbers require the maintenance of alert and precautionary measures which in our case seem to have worked.","Pezzulla, Donato; Macchia, Gabriella; Taccari, Francesco; Sticca, Giovanna; Deodato, Francesco",Int. j. gynecol. cancer,364,20

In addition to causing serious respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and lung failure, there have been conflicting reports about presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the semen of patients who were previously diagnosed with COVID-19 and possible implications for the male reproductive tract. SARS-CoV-2 may infect any cell type expressing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), including reproductive cells. Besides the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, the expression of host proteases, such as transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), is needed to cleave the viral S protein, allowing permanent fusion of the viral and host cell membranes. Here, we aimed to review the current status of the literature concerning COVID-19 and male reproduction. The lack of coexpression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the testis suggests that sperm cells may not be at increased risk of viral entry and spread. However, the presence of orchits in COVID-19 confirmed patients and compromised sex-related hormonal balance among these patients, challenges reproductive medicine. SARS-CoV-2 may use alternate receptors to enter certain cell types, or the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 may not be detected in healthy individuals. It is not yet clear what effects, if any, the COVID-19 pandemic will have on male reproduction. Further research is needed to understand the long-term impact of SARS-COV-2 on male reproductive function.","Borges, Edson; Setti, Amanda Souza; Iaconelli, Assumpto; de Almeida Ferreira Braga, Daniela Paes",Androl.

Since Taiwan has the highest incidence and prevalence of treated end-stage kidney disease worldwide, it is crucial to act in advance to prevent a potential disaster. In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implement proactive infection control measures to prevent it from spreading without sacrificing the dialysis care quality. In this article, we focused on hemodialysis vascular access (HVA) care in particular. As a life-line of hemodialysis (HD) patients, HVA care has a profound impact on the patient's quality of dialysis and life. Specifically, in our facility, the working and office areas of the HD units are separated to reduce cross-infection. All elective procedures for HVA are postponed, and operating rooms equipped with a negative-pressure anteroom are used for the suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Herein, we share how we modified our HVA care policy not only to prevent our patients from COVID-19 infection but also to maintain the quality of HVA care.","Yang, Chih-Yu; Wang, Yi-Fang; Ho, Yang; Wu, Cheng-Hsueh; Lee, Chiu-Yang; Tarng, Der-Cherng",J Chin Med Assoc,364,16

We performed a systematic and comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation of consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation within 24 hours of admission and were compared with reference values. Echocardiographic studies included left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and valve hemodynamics and right ventricular (RV) assessment, as well as lung ultrasound. A second examination was performed in case of clinical deterioration. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (32%) had a normal echocardiogram at baseline. The most common cardiac pathology was RV dilatation and dysfunction (observed in 39% of patients), followed by LV diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). Patients with elevated troponin (20%) or worse clinical condition did not demonstrate any significant difference in LV systolic function compared with patients with normal troponin or better clinical condition, but they had worse RV function. Clinical deterioration occurred in 20% of patients. In these patients, the most common echocardiographic abnormality at follow-up was RV function deterioration (12 patients), followed by LV systolic and diastolic deterioration (in 5 patients). Femoral deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in 5 of 12 patients with RV failure. CONCLUSIONS: In COVID-19 infection, LV systolic function is preserved in the majority of patients, but LV diastolic function and RV function are impaired. Elevated troponin and poorer clinical grade are associated with worse RV function. In patients presenting with clinical deterioration at follow-up, acute RV dysfunction, with or without deep vein thrombosis, is more common, but acute LV systolic dysfunction was noted in &#8776;20%.","Szekely, Yishay; Lichter, Yael; Taieb, Philippe; Banai, Ariel; Hochstadt, Aviram; Merdler, Ilan; Gal Oz, Amir; Rothschild, Ehud; Baruch, Guy; Peri, Yogev; Arbel, Yaron; Topilsky, Yan",Circulation,364,1

The practice of comparative biology can be enhanced by computational methods used for dynamic knowledge representation to visualize and interrogate the putative differences between the two systems. We present an agent-based model that encompasses and bridges the differences between bat and human responses to viral infection: the Comparative Biology Immune Agent-based Model, or CBIABM. The CBIABM examines differences in innate immune mechanisms between bats and humans, specifically regarding inflammasome activity and Type 1 Interferon dynamics, in terms of tolerance to viral infection. Simulation experiments with the CBIABM demonstrate the efficacy of bat-related features in conferring viral tolerance and also suggest a crucial role for endothelial inflammasome activity as a mechanism for bat systemic viral tolerance and affecting the severity of disease in human viral infections. We hope that this initial study will inspire additional comparative modeling projects to link, compare, and contrast immunological functions shared across different species, and in so doing, provide insight and aid in the preparation for future viral pandemics of zoonotic origin.","Cockrell, Chase; An, Gary",bioRxiv,364,15

We evaluated the specificity of the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in prepandemic sample cohorts across five sites in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Methods: Specificity of the immunoassay was evaluated using anonymised, frozen, residual serum and/or plasma samples from blood donors or routine diagnostic testing. All samples were collected before September 2019 and therefore presumed negative for SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Cohorts included samples from blood donors, pregnant women and paediatric patients. Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Overall specificities for the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay in 9575 samples from blood donors (n = 6714) and diagnostic specimens (n = 2861) were 99.82% (95% CI 99.69-99.91) and 99.93% (95% CI 99.75-99.99), respectively. Among 2256 samples from pregnant women, specificity was 99.91% (95% CI 99.68-99.99). Among 205 paediatric samples, specificity was 100% (95% CI 98.22-100). Conclusion: The Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay demonstrated a very high specificity across blood donor samples and diagnostic specimens from Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

Understanding the factors affecting the pattern and levels of expression of these genes is important for deeper understanding of SARS-CoV-2 tropism and pathogenesis. Here we explore the role of genetics and co-expression networks in regulating these genes in the airway, through the analysis of nasal airway transcriptome data from 695 children. We identify expression quantitative trait loci for both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, that vary in frequency across world populations. We find TMPRSS2 is part of a mucus secretory network, highly upregulated by type 2 (T2) inflammation through the action of interleukin-13, and that the interferon response to respiratory viruses highly upregulates ACE2 expression. IL-13 and virus infection mediated effects on ACE2 expression were also observed at the protein level in the airway epithelium. Finally, we define airway responses to common coronavirus infections in children, finding that these infections generate host responses similar to other viral species, including upregulation of IL6 and ACE2.

METHODS: The PDIS method is based on photodiagnostic physics and high resolution spectroscopy and is using calibrated spectroscopic data for the diagnostic analysis of the blood screening spectra. Using Confocal Laser Scanning Mikcroscopy the Indocyangreen-uptake of different cell lines of breast cancer cells is studied. RESULTS: The PDIS supplies calibrated diagnostic data about the presence or absence of CTCs and CTC clusters in the bloodstream with a sensitivity of 98 %. Therefore, the PDIS is suited to control the blood of cancer patients with respect of CTC and CTC clusters with an resolution of one CTC and one CTC cluster per blood volume. PDIS distinguishes the different phenotypes of CTC clusters. CONCLUSION: Circulating tumor cell slusters play a key role in the metastatic process and are formed only in solid tumors, they are appropriate objects to validate cancer treatments and to recognice cancer formation. The PDIS is a calibrated diagnostic method which allows to evaluate the results of solid tumor treatments and of chemotherapy treatments and to optimize the individual cancer treatment strategies.","Schikora, Detlef",Photodiagnosis Photodyn Ther,364,1

In conclusion, these cases represent two examples of early lung fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with different severity disease evolution and highlight the need for long-term follow-up strategies. The etiology of this fibrosis is under discussion: we suppose that it could be due to either a possible outcome of natural history of lung damage produced by ARDS, or to the lung injury related to high oxygen level or to the lung damage directly induced by viral infection or finally to the autoimmune response. At this moment, it is not possible to predict how many people will have consequences due to COVID-19 pneumonia, and therefore we believe that careful follow-up should be mandatory.","Scelfo, Chiara; Fontana, Matteo; Casalini, Eleonora; Menzella, Francesco; Piro, Roberto; Zerbini, Alessandro; Spaggiari, Lucia; Ghidorsi, Luca; Ghidoni, Giulia; Facciolongo, Nicola C",Ther Clin Risk Manag,364,10

The use of telemedicine and telehealth is frequently presented as a part of the solution to overcome these challenges. Some of the available presented solutions will only apply in an acute, local setting, whereas others might inspire the community to improve quality and cost-effectiveness of radiotherapy as well as knowledge sharing in the future.

Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) caused by L. infantum is an emergent feline disease more and more frequently reported in endemic areas. This review summarizes current knowledge focusing similarities and differences with canine leishmaniosis (CanL). Cats are infected by the same Leishmania species than dogs but prevalence of the infection is lower and cases of disease are less frequently reported. Scarce information is available on adaptive immune response of cats naturally exposed to L. infantum infection and mechanisms responsible for susceptibility or resistance of feline hosts. However, about half of clinical cases of FeL are reported in cats with possible impaired immunocompetence. Coinfections or comorbidities are frequently detected in sick cats and they can contribute to a misrepresentation of clinical FeL albeit lesions associated with the presence of the parasite have been detected in skin, lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, liver, oral mucosa, stomach, large bowel, kidney, nasal exudate, lung, eye. As for dogs, skin or mucocutaneous lesions are the most common reason for veterinary consultation and finding on physical examination in cats with leishmaniosis. Molecular investigations of Leishmania DNA and anti- Leishmania antibody detection are largely used with the same methodologies for both CanL and FeL, however few information is available about their diagnostic performance in feline hosts. Treatment of cats with clinical FeL is still empirically based and off label by using the most common drugs prescribed to dogs. Life expectancy of cats with clinical FeL is usually good unless concurrent conditions or complications occur and prognosis does not seem significantly influenced by therapy or retroviral coinfection. According to current knowledge, cats can play a role as additional reservoir host of L. infantum and, in a « One Health » perspective, preventative measures should be taken. In conclusion, albeit feline infection and the associated cat disease caused by L. infantum is increasingly reported in endemic areas and have many similarities with CanL, consolidated evidence-based knowledge is not available and we cannot exclude that important differences between dogs and cats exist about transmission, immunopathogenesis and best practice for management and prevention.","Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Persichetti, Maria Flaminia",Vet Parasitol,364,16

METHODS: A total of 939 patients, who presented to the Department for Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of Hannover Medical School during the first 4 weeks of contact prohibitions in Germany, starting from March 23, 2020 until April 19, 2020, and in comparable periods were examined. The number of patients, reason for presentation, and required treatments were documented and compared to the years 2018 and 2019. Special attention was paid to the changes in trauma cases. RESULTS: We found that the number of patients in 2020 was significantly lower (p((2019)) < 0.001, p((2018)) < 0.01), but sex and age distributions were comparable to those in the previous years. Both the absolute and relative frequencies of dental diagnoses were significantly lower in 2020 (p((2019)) < 0.001, p((2018)) < 0.001), while the proportion of patients who presented with trauma was significantly higher (p((2019)) < 0.001, p((2018)) < 0.001).

Safeguards to protect research participants include ethical guidelines [e.g. Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice (GCP)], legislation to protect participants’ privacy, research ethics committees (RECs) and informed consent. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) advises researchers to document compliance with these safeguards. Adherence to publication guidelines has been suboptimal in other specialty fields. The aim of this rapid review was to determine whether COVID-19 human research publications report compliance with these ethical safeguards. METHODS: A rapid systematic literature review was conducted in MEDLINE using the search term ‘COVID-19’. The search was performed in April 2020 with no start date and repeated to include articles published in November 2020. Filters were ‘Full free text available’ and ‘English Language’. Two reviewers assessed article title, abstracts and full texts. Non-COVID-19 articles and non-clinical studies were excluded. Independent reviewers conducted a second assessment of a random 20% of articles. The outcomes included reporting of compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and GCP, REC approval, informed consent and participant privacy. RESULTS: The searches yielded 1275 and 1942 articles of which 247 and 717 were deemed eligible, from the April search and November respectively. The majority of journals had editorial policies which purported to comply with ICMJE ethical standards. Reporting of compliance with ethical guidelines was low across all study types but was higher in the November search for case series and observational studies. Reporting of informed consent for case studies and observational studies was higher in the November search, but similar for case series. Overall, participant confidentiality was maintained but some case studies included a combination of details which would have enabled participant identification. Reporting of REC approval was higher in the November search for observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of journal’s editorial policies purported to support the ethical safeguards, many COVID-19 clinical research publications identified in this rapid review lacked documentation of these important safeguards for research participants. In order to promote public trust, ethical declarations should be included consistently.

OnTrackNY is a nationally recognized model of CSC treatment in New York state. In 2019, OnTrackNY was awarded a hub within the Early Psychosis Intervention Network (EPINET) to advance its learning health care system (LHS). The OnTrackNY network is comprised of 23 CSC teams across New York state. OnTrack Central, an intermediary organization, provides training and implementation support to OnTrackNY teams. OnTrack Central coordinates a centralized data collection protocol for quality improvement and evaluation of program fidelity and a mechanism to support practice based-research. OnTrackNY sitesâ€™ breadth coupled with OnTrack Central oversight provides an opportunity to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis in New York State. Methods : This project will examine the implications of modifications to service delivery within the OnTrackNY LHS during and after the COVID-19 crisis. We will use the Framework for Reporting Adaptations and Modifications-Enhanced (FRAME) to classify systematically, code, and analyze modifications to CSC services and ascertain their impact. We will utilize integrative mixed methods. Qualitative interviews with multi-level stakeholders (program participants, families, providers, team leaders, agency leaders, trainers (OnTrack Central), and decision-makers at the state and local levels) will be used to understand the process making decisions, information about modifications to CSC services, and their impact. Analysis of OnTrackNY program data will facilitate examining trends in team staffing and functioning, and participant service utilization and outcomes. Study findings will be summarized in a CSC Model Adaptation Guide , which will identify modifications as fidelity consistent or not, and their impact on service utilization and care outcomes. Discussion : A CSC Model Adaptation Guide will inform CSC programs, and the state and local mental health authorities to which they are accountable, regarding modifications to CSC services and the impact of these changes on care process, and participant service utilization and outcomes. The guide will also inform the development of tailored technical assistance that CSC programs may need within OnTrackNY, the EPINET network, and CSC programs nationally.

Microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays are currently used to evaluate neutralizing antibody responses against human and avian influenza viruses, including H5N1. The MN assay is somewhat labor intensive, while HI is a surrogate for neutralization. Moreover, use of replication competent viruses in these assays requires biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment. Therefore, a neutralization assay that does not require BSL-3 facilities would be advantageous. Toward this goal, we generated a panel of pseudotypes expressing influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) and developed a pseudotype-based neutralization (PN) assay. Here we demonstrate that HA/NA pseudotypes mimic release and entry of influenza virus and that the PN assay exhibits good specificity and reveals quantitative difference in neutralizing antibody titers against different H5N1 clades and subclades. Using immune ferret sera, we demonstrated excellent correlation between the PN, MN, and HI assays. Thus, we conclude that the PN assay is a sensitive and quantifiable method to measure neutralizing antibodies against diverse clades and subclades of H5N1 influenza virus.","Tsai, Cheguo; Caillet, Catherine; Hu, Hongxing; Zhou, Fan; Ding, Heng; Zhang, Guoliang; Zhou, Boping; Wang, Shixia; Lu, Shan; Buchy, Philippe; Deubel, Vincent; Vogel, Frederick R.; Zhou, Paul",Vaccine,364,27

To maximize delivery to the lungs, we formulated remdesivir as a dry powder for inhalation using thin film freezing (TFF). TFF produces brittle matrix nanostructured aggregates that are sheared into respirable low-density microparticles upon aerosolization from a passive dry powder inhaler. In vitro aerodynamic testing demonstrated that drug loading and excipient type affected the aerosol performance of remdesivir. Remdesivir combined with optimal excipients exhibited desirable aerosol performance (up to 93.0% FPF(< 5 µm); 0.82 µm mass median aerodynamic diameter). Remdesivir was amorphous after the TFF process, which benefitted drug dissolution in simulated lung fluid. TFF remdesivir formulations are stable after one month of storage at 25 °C/60% relative humidity. An in vivo pharmacokinetic evaluation showed that TFF remdesivir–leucine was poorly absorbed into systemic circulation while TFF remdesivir-Captisol(®) demonstrated increased systemic uptake compared to leucine. Remdesivir was hydrolyzed to the nucleoside analog GS-441524 in the lung, and levels of GS-441524 were greater in the lung with leucine formulation compared to Captisol(®). In conclusion, TFF technology produces high-potency remdesivir dry powder formulations for inhalation that are suitable to treat patients with COVID-19 on an outpatient basis and earlier in the disease course where effective antiviral therapy can reduce related morbidity and mortality.","Sahakijpijarn, Sawittree; Moon, Chaeho; Koleng, John J.; Christensen, Dale J.; Williams, Robert O.",Pharmaceutics,364,15

The evidence for increased transmission of infectious diseases at international sporting mass gatherings that attract many visitors from all over the world is not clear, and the evidence base for public health surveillance, epidemiology, and response at events such as the Olympics is small. However, infectious diseases are a recognised risk, and public health planning is, and should remain, a crucial part of the overall planning of sporting events. In this Series paper, we set out the planning and the surveillance systems that were used to monitor public health risks during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in the summer of 2012, and draw attention to the public health issues—infectious diseases and chemical, radiation, and environmental hazards—that arose. Although the absolute risk of health-protection problems, including infectious diseases, at sporting mass gatherings is small, the need for reassurance of the absence of problems is higher than has previously been considered; this could challenge conventional public health surveillance systems. Recognition of the limitations of health-surveillance systems needs to be part of the planning for future sporting events.","McCloskey, Brian; Endericks, Tina; Catchpole, Mike; Zambon, Maria; McLauchlin, Jim; Shetty, Nandini; Manuel, Rohini; Turbitt, Deborah; Smith, Gillian; Crook, Paul; Severi, Ettore; Jones, Jane; Ibbotson, Sue; Marshall, Roberta; Smallwood, Catherine A H; Isla, Nicolas; Memish, Ziad A; Al-Rabeeah, Abdullah A; Barbeschi, Maurizio; Heymann, David L; Zumla, Alimuddin",Lancet,364,20

METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study using claims data of the biggest German health insurance company AOK, covering 26.9 million people all over Germany. In particular, patient-related characteristics and co-medication were evaluated. A multivariable logistic regression model was adopted to identify independent predictors for the primary outcome measure of all-cause mortality or need for invasive or non-invasive ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. RESULTS: 6637 patients in 853 German hospitals were included. The primary outcome occurred in 1826 patients (27.5%). 1372 patients (20.7%) died, 886 patients (13.3%) needed respiratory support, and 53 patients (0.8%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 34 of these patients survived (64.2%). The multivariable model demonstrated that pre-existing oral anticoagulation therapy with either vitamin-K antagonists OR 0.57 (95% CI 0.40–0.83, p = 0.003) or direct oral anticoagulants OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.56–0.91, p = 0.007)—but not with antiplatelet therapy alone OR 1.10 (95% CI 0.88–1.23, p = 0.66)—was associated with a lower event rate. This finding was confirmed in a propensity match analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In a multivariable analysis, a therapy with both direct oral anticoagulants or vitamin-K antagonists—but not with antiplatelet therapy—was associated with improved clinical outcomes. ACE inhibitors did not impact outcomes. Prospective randomized trials are needed to verify this hypothesis.

The timing and content of the policy response as well as different possible explanations for what happened are considered. Undertaking a forensic analysis of policy in regard to the overall plan, monitoring and protection as well as funding and resources, the first part lays bare the slow, late and inadequate response to the risk and reality of COVID‐19 in care homes as against that in the National Health Service (NHS). A two‐pronged, multidimensional explanation is offered: structural, sectoral specificities; political and socio‐cultural factors. Amongst the relevant structural factors are the institutionalised separation from the health system, the complex system of provision and policy for adult social care, widespread market dependence. There is also the fact that logistical difficulties were exacerbated by years of austerity and resource cutting and a weak regulatory tradition of the care home sector. The effects of a series of political and cultural factors are also highlighted. As well as little mobilisation of the sector and low public commitment to and knowledge of social care, there is a pattern of Conservative government trying to divest the state of responsibilities in social care. This would support an interpretation in terms of policy avoidance as well as a possible political calculation by government that its policies towards the care sector and care homes would be less important and politically damaging than those for the NHS.","Daly, Mary",Soc Policy Adm,364,24

COVID-19 research has fewer nations and smaller teams than pre-COVID research, a trend which intensifies throughout the pandemic. The United States remains the single largest contributor to the global publication output, but contrary to China’s dominance in the initial months of the pandemic, China’s contribution falls as the national COVID-19 caseload drops.

Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by a newly emergent coronavirus, that was first recognized in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Cinesi Gómez, C.; Peñuelas Rodríguez, Ó.; Luján Torné, M.l; Egea Santaolalla, C.; Masa Jiménez, J.

For the first time it is shown that young adults recovering from SARS‐CoV‐2 have elevated resting sympathetic activity, but similar heart rate and blood pressure, compared with control subjects. Survivors of SARS‐CoV‐2 also exhibit similar sympathetic nerve activity and haemodynamics, but decreased pain perception, during a cold pressor test compared with healthy controls. Further, these individuals display higher sympathetic nerve activity throughout an orthostatic challenge, as well as an exaggerated heart rate response to orthostasis. If similar autonomic dysregulation, like that found here in young individuals, is present in older adults following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, there may be substantial adverse implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) can elicit systemic adverse physiological effects. However, the impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals remains unclear. Young adults who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 (COV+; n = 16, 8 F) visited the laboratory 35 ± 16 days following diagnosis. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) were measured in participants at rest and during a 2 min cold pressor test (CPT) and 5 min each at 30° and 60° head‐up tilt (HUT). Data were compared with age‐matched healthy controls (CON; n = 14, 9 F). COV+ participants (18.2 ± 6.6 bursts min(−1)) had higher resting MSNA burst frequency compared with CON (12.7 ± 3.4 bursts min(−1)) (P = 0.020), as well as higher MSNA burst incidence and total activity. Resting HR, SBP and DBP were not different. During CPT, there were no differences in MSNA, HR, SBP or DBP between groups. COV+ participants reported less pain during the CPT compared with CON (5.7 ± 1.8 vs. 7.2 ± 1.9 a.u., P = 0.036). MSNA was higher in COV+ compared with CON during HUT. There was a group‐by‐position interaction in MSNA burst incidence, as well as HR, in response to HUT. These results indicate resting sympathetic activity, but not HR or BP, may be elevated following SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Further, cardiovascular and perceptual responses to physiological stress may be altered, including both exaggerated (orthostasis) and suppressed (pain perception) responses, compared with healthy young adults.","Stute, Nina L.; Stickford, Jonathon L.; Province, Valesha M.; Augenreich, Marc A.; Ratchford, Stephen M.; Stickford, Abigail S.

The application of self-regulation theory and therapeutic patient education has been widely utilized in different health-related areas to help patient with a chronic disease to attain better behavioral modification. The present study aims at investigating the treatment efficacy of combining a self-regulation-based patient education module with mobile application in acne patients. Materials and Methods: This was one-grouped pretest–posttest design at a single tertiary referral center with the enrollment of 30 subjects diagnosed with acne vulgaris. Relevant information was collected before (week 0) and after (week 4) treatment in the present study, including the Acne Self-Regulation Inventory (ASRI), Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI), and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) that involved a questionnaire-based subjective evaluation of the patient’s ability in self-regulation and quality of life as well as clinical Acne Grading Scores (AGS) that objectively assessed changes in disease severity. To reinforce availability and feasibility, an individualized platform was accessible through mobile devices for real-time problem solving between hospital visits. Results: Thirty subjects completed the designed experiment. An analysis of the differences between scores of pretest and posttest of ASRI demonstrated substantial elevations (p < 0.001). The questionnaire survey of CADI and DLQI dropped significantly after the application of a self-regulation-based patient education module with a mobile application, revealing substantial reductions in both parameters (p < 0.001).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: The design was a matched case-control study. Severe COVID-19 was defined as either a positive nucleic acid test for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the national database followed by entry to a critical care unit or death within 28 days or a death certificate with COVID-19 as underlying cause. Up to 10 controls per case matched for sex, age, and primary care practice were selected from the national population register. For this analysis—based on ascertainment of positive test results up to 6 June 2020, entry to critical care up to 14 June 2020, and deaths registered up to 14 June 2020—there were 36,948 controls and 4,272 cases, of which 1,894 (44%) were care home residents. All diagnostic codes from the past 5 years of hospitalisation records and all drug codes from prescriptions dispensed during the past 240 days were extracted. Rate ratios for severe COVID-19 were estimated by conditional logistic regression. In a logistic regression using the age-sex distribution of the national population, the odds ratios for severe disease were 2.87 for a 10-year increase in age and 1.63 for male sex. In the case-control analysis, the strongest risk factor was residence in a care home, with rate ratio 21.4 (95% CI 19.1–23.9, p = 8 × 10(−644)). Univariate rate ratios for conditions listed by public health agencies as conferring high risk were 2.75 (95% CI 1.96–3.88, p = 6 × 10(−9)) for type 1 diabetes, 1.60 (95% CI 1.48–1.74, p = 8 × 10(−30)) for type 2 diabetes, 1.49 (95% CI 1.37–1.61, p = 3 × 10(−21)) for ischemic heart disease, 2.23 (95% CI 2.08–2.39, p = 4 × 10(−109)) for other heart disease, 1.96 (95% CI 1.83–2.10, p = 2 × 10(−78)) for chronic lower respiratory tract disease, 4.06 (95% CI 3.15–5.23, p = 3 × 10(−27)) for chronic kidney disease, 5.4 (95% CI 4.9–5.8, p = 1 × 10(−354)) for neurological disease, 3.61 (95% CI 2.60–5.00, p = 2 × 10(−14)) for chronic liver disease, and 2.66 (95% CI 1.86–3.79, p = 7 × 10(−8)) for immune deficiency or suppression. Seventy-eight percent of cases and 52% of controls had at least one listed condition (51% of cases and 11% of controls under age 40). Severe disease was associated with encashment of at least one prescription in the past 9 months and with at least one hospital admission in the past 5 years (rate ratios 3.10 [95% CI 2.59–3.71] and 2.75 [95% CI 2.53–2.99], respectively) even after adjusting for the listed conditions. In those without listed conditions, significant associations with severe disease were seen across many hospital diagnoses and drug categories. Age and sex provided 2.58 bits of information for discrimination. A model based on demographic variables, listed conditions, hospital diagnoses, and prescriptions provided an additional 1.07 bits (C-statistic 0.804). A limitation of this study is that records from primary care were not available. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that, along with older age and male sex, severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with past medical history across all age groups. Many comorbidities beyond the risk conditions designated by public health agencies contribute to this. A risk classifier that uses all the information available in health records, rather than only a limited set of conditions, will more accurately discriminate between low-risk and high-risk individuals who may require shielding until the epidemic is over.","McKeigue, Paul M.; Weir, Amanda; Bishop, Jen; McGurnaghan, Stuart J.; Kennedy, Sharon; McAllister, David; Robertson, Chris; Wood, Rachael; Lone, Nazir; Murray, Janet; Caparrotta, Thomas M.; Smith-Palmer, Alison; Goldberg, David; McMenamin, Jim; Ramsay, Colin; Hutchinson, Sharon; Colhoun, Helen M.",PLoS Med,364,9

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of the live variant IBV 4/91 with ORT infection. A total of 120 14-d-old broiler chickens (Cobb 500) were equally divided into 4 groups for experimental infection in a complete randomized design. Group 1 was infected with ORT strain and live infectious bronchitis vaccine (IBV 4/91) simultaneously; group 2 was infected with the bacterial strain alone; group 3 was vaccinated only with IBV 4/91, and group 4 was the non-vaccinated and non-infected control group. The respiratory signs, post-mortem lesions (tracheitis and pneumonia) and histopathological findings of lungs, trachea, and air sacs in the experimentally infected broiler chickens appeared to be more prominent in the chickens of group 1 than group 2. With respect to body weight, weight gain, feed conversion rate, and Ornithobacterium re-isolation, there was a difference (P ≤ 0.05) among the chickens of group 1 and the other groups. This reveals that the use of live infectious bronchitic vaccines, which is a common practice in the local Egyptian field of production, may concomitantly increase the pathogenicity of ORT in broiler chickens.","Ellakany, H.F.; Elbestawy, A.R.; Abd-Elhamid, H.S.; Gado, A.R.; Nassar, A.A.; Abdel-Latif, M.A.; Ghanima, I I Abo; Abd El-Hack, M.E.; Swelum, A.A.; Saadeldin, I.M.; Ba-Awadh, H.A.; Alowaimer, A.N.",Poult Sci,364,20

Various online courses were created and the utilisation by the students was analyzed. Material & methods: Examination videos, surgical images and videos were created and live lectures were held. In addition, patient cases of common otorhinolaryngological diseases were reconstructed on an interactive platform. A total of 16 cases were offered in weekly rotation. These cases are provided with gap texts, open and selection questions, links and videos and thematically appropriate digression offers. The time-consuming creation was carried out as a HTML 5 learning package with the authoring program Exelearning 2.5. Each case was to be evaluated separately after being worked on by the students. Results: The direct feedback and the evaluation results of the students on the internship and case presentations were consistently positive. However, on average only 50.72% of the registered students took part in the weekly video meetings. In the course of the semester, the willingness to participate decreased. In addition, the willingness to evaluate the patient cases was low. Discussion: With the case presentation tool, concrete patient examples can be well presented, especially when patient contact is not possible (especially in an ENT clinic due to violation of distance and hygienic rules). Even though the evaluations were positive in terms of content, the frequency of utilisation and also the motivation for feedback seems disappointing.

While the hallmarks of SARS-CoV-2 and severe COVID-19 within routine laboratory parameters are emerging, little is known about the impact of sex and age on these profiles. Methods: We performed multidimensional analysis of millions of records of laboratory parameters and diagnostic tests for 178,887 individuals, of which 33,266 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These included complete blood cell count, electrolytes, metabolites, arterial blood gases, enzymes, hormones, cancer biomarkers, and others. Results: COVID-19 induced more alterations in the laboratory parameters in males compared to females between 13 and 60 years old, in contrast to older individuals, where several parameters were altered by COVID-19 in both men and women. Biomarkers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, were increased especially in older men with COVID-19, whereas other markers such as abnormal liver function tests were common across several age groups, except for young women. Low peripheral blood basophils and eosinophils were also more common in the elderly with COVID-19. Both male and female COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) displayed alterations in the coagulation system, and higher levels of neutrophils, CRP, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), among others. Discussion: Our study uncovers the laboratory profile of a large cohort of COVID-19 patients that underly discrepancies influenced by aging and biological sex. These profiles directly link COVID-19 disease presentation to an intricate interplay between sex, age and the immune response.","ten-Caten, Felipe; Gonzalez-Dias, Patricia; Castro, Icaro; Ogava, Rodrigo; Giddaluru, Jeevan; Silva, Juan CS; Martins, Felipe; Goncalves, Andre NA; Costa-Martins, Andre G; Araujo, Jose D; Viegas, Ana C; Cunha, Fernando Q; Farsky, Sandra; Bozza, Fernando A; Levin, Anna S; Pannaraj, Pia S; Silva, Thushan I de; Minoprio, Paola; Andrade, Bruno Bezerril; Silva, Fabiano P da; Nakaya, Helder I",,364,24

Therefore, models were developed to predict high and low dengue incidence in order to provide timely forewarnings in the Philippines. METHODS: Model inputs were chosen based on studies indicating variables that may impact dengue incidence. The method first uses Fuzzy Association Rule Mining techniques to extract association rules from these historical epidemiological, environmental, and socio-economic data, as well as climate data indicating future weather patterns. Selection criteria were used to choose a subset of these rules for a classifier, thereby generating a Prediction Model. The models predicted high or low incidence of dengue in a Philippines province four weeks in advance. The threshold between high and low was determined relative to historical incidence data. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Model accuracy is described by Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), Sensitivity, and Specificity computed on test data not previously used to develop the model. Selecting a model using the F(0.5) measure, which gives PPV more importance than Sensitivity, gave these results: PPV = 0.780, NPV = 0.938, Sensitivity = 0.547, Specificity = 0.978. Using the F(3) measure, which gives Sensitivity more importance than PPV, the selected model had PPV = 0.778, NPV = 0.948, Sensitivity = 0.627, Specificity = 0.974. The decision as to which model has greater utility depends on how the predictions will be used in a particular situation. CONCLUSIONS: This method builds prediction models for future dengue incidence in the Philippines and is capable of being modified for use in different situations; for diseases other than dengue; and for regions beyond the Philippines. The Philippines dengue prediction models predicted high or low incidence of dengue four weeks in advance of an outbreak with high accuracy, as measured by PPV, NPV, Sensitivity, and Specificity.","Buczak, Anna L.; Baugher, Benjamin; Babin, Steven M.; Ramac-Thomas, Liane C.; Guven, Erhan; Elbert, Yevgeniy; Koshute, Phillip T.; Velasco, John Mark S.; Roque, Vito G.; Tayag, Enrique A.; Yoon, In-Kyu; Lewis, Sheri H.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,364,16

The main concern is the ability of immunosuppressed patients to generate sufficient immunity for antiviral protection. Here, we report on immune monitoring facilitating a successful outcome of severe SARS‐CoV‐2‐associated pneumonia, meningoencephalitis, gastroenteritis and acute kidney and pancreas graft failure in a pancreas‐kidney transplant recipient. Despite the very low numbers of circulating B‐, NK‐, and T‐cells identified in follow up, a strong SARS‐CoV‐2 reactive T‐cell response was observed. Importantly, we detected T‐cells reactive to Spike, Membrane, and Nucleocapsid proteins of SARS‐CoV‐2 with majority of T‐cells showing polyfunctional pro‐inflammatory Th1 phenotype at all analyzed time points. Antibodies against Spike protein were also detected with increasing titers in follow up. Neutralization tests confirmed their antiviral protection. A correlation between cellular and humoral immunity was observed underscoring the specificity of demonstrated data. We conclude that analyzing the kinetics of non‐specific and SARS‐CoV‐2‐reactive cellular and humoral immunity can facilitate the clinical decision on immunosuppression adjustment and allow successful outcome as demonstrated in the current clinical case.

Despite successful detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewaters sampled from multiple locations, there is still no clear idea on the minimal number of cases needed in a community to result in a positive detection of the virus in wastewaters. To address this knowledge gap, we sampled wastewaters from a septic tank and biological activated sludge tank located on-site of a hospital. The hospital is providing treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients, with the number of hospitalized patients per day known. It was observed that > 253 positive cases out of 10,000 persons are required prior to detecting SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater. There was a weak correlation between N1 and N2 gene abundances in wastewater with the number of hospitalized cases. This correlation was however not observed for N3 gene. The occurrence frequency of SARS-CoV-2 is at least 5 times lower in the partially treated wastewater than in the septic tank. Furthermore, abundance of N1 and N3 genes in the activated sludge tank were 50 and 70% of the levels detected in septic tank, suggesting poor persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 gene fragments in wastewater.","Hong, P.; Rachmadi, A.

The sensors utilize the sensitivity and surface chemistry of a two-dimensional MoS2 transducer for attachment of antibody fragments in a conformation favorable for antigen binding. Ultra-thin layers (3 nm) of amorphous MoS2 were directly sputtered over the entire sensor chip at room temperature and laser annealed to create an array of semiconducting 2H-MoS2 active sensor regions between metal contacts. The semiconducting region was functionalized with monoclonal antibody Fab (fragment antigen binding) fragments derived from whole antibodies complementary to either SARS-CoV-2 S1 spike protein or Influenza A hemagglutinin using a papain digestion to cleave the antibodies at the disulfide hinges. The high affinity for the MoS2 transducer surface with some density of sulfur vacancies for the antibody fragment base promoted chemisorption with antigen binding regions oriented for interaction with the sample. The angiostatin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein for the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, was tethered to a hexa-histidine (his6) tag at its c-terminus both for purification purposes, as well as a motif for binding to MoS2. This modified protein was also investigated as a bio-recognition element.

Acute respiratory tract infections are variable but definition of diagnostic categories based on the anatomical sites of the dominant complaints shows that signs and symptoms both overlap to a great extent and/or emerge successively. Thus, in common cold distinguishing between acute symptom-based diagnoses arising from different anatomical sites of the aerodigestive system remains elusive. Therefore, preferred symptomatic treatments should foster a resolution of all possible symptoms as opposed to an isolated treatment of a single symptom (e. g. mucus hypersecretion) according to the presumed anatomical site (i. e. acute bronchitis).","Kardos, P.; Malek, F.

Along with the typical two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) methods, approaches like pharmacophore, structure-based docking studies, and combinations of ligand- and structure-based approaches like comparative residue interaction analysis (CoRIA) and comparative binding energy analysis (COMBINE) have gained a significant popularity in the computational drug design process. A pharmacophore can be developed either in a ligand-based method, by superposing a set of active molecules and extracting common chemical features which are vital for their bioactivity; or in a structure-based manner, by probing probable interaction points between the macromolecular target and ligands. The interaction of protein and ligand molecules with each other is one of the interesting studies in modern molecular biology and molecular recognition. This interaction can well be explained with the conceptof a docking study to show how a molecule can bind to another molecule to exert the bioactivity. Docking and pharmacophore are non-QSAR approaches in in silico drug design that can support the QSAR findings. Approaches like CoRIA and COMBINE can use information generated from the ligand–receptor complexes to extract the critical clue concerning the types of significant interaction at the level of both the receptor and the ligand. Employing the abovementioned ligand- and structure-based methodologies and chemical libraries, virtual screening (VS) emerged as an important tool in the quest to develop novel drug compounds. VS serves as an efficient computational tool that integrates structural data with lead optimization as a cost-effective approach to drug discovery.","Roy, Kunal; Kar, Supratik; Das, Rudra Narayan",Understanding the Basics of QSAR for Applications in Pharmaceutical Sciences and Risk Assessment,364,9

The best characterized examples are discussed together with the use of genomic and protein engineering technologies to obtain PET hydrolase enzymes for different applications. In addition, the obstacles which are currently limiting the development of efficient PET bioprocessing are presented. By continuing to study the possible mechanisms and the structural elements of key enzymes involved in microbial PET hydrolysis, and by assessing the ability of PET hydrolase enzymes to work under practical conditions, this research will help inform large-scale waste management operations. Finally, the contribution of microbial PET hydrolases in creating a potential circular PET economy will be explored. This review combines the current knowledge on enzymatic PET processing with proposed strategies for optimization and use, to help clarify the next steps in addressing pollution by PET and other plastics.","Carr, Clodagh M.; Clarke, David J.; Dobson, Alan D.

Strategies to identify household contacts who should be isolated around index children that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 remain to be clarified. We aimed to compare contact tracing strategies around an index child positive for SARS-CoV-2 using serological rapid diagnostic testing (RDT, chromatography immunoassay). Methods: We conducted a contact tracing study in households of index cases children in the Paris region, France, between May 8 and July 27, 2020. We compared two strategies, one using SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and one combining RT-PCR and serological RDT, initiated once RDT was available. The contacts RT-PCR–/RDT+ were considered to have been previously infected and not requiring quarantine. The primary outcome was the proportion of contacts that could avoid quarantine with the two screening strategies. Results: We included 34 children as index cases. Median age was 7 years. They generated 184 contacts (111 adults, 73 children) tested by RT-PCR: 24/184 (13%) were positive. The strategy combining RDT and RT-PCR was performed in 120/184 contacts (77 adults, 43 children) of 26 index children: 16/120 (13%) were RT-PCR+ and 47/120 (39%) were RDT+. Among the 16 individuals who were RT-PCR+, 14 (87%) were also RDT+. Among the 104 individuals who were RT-PCR–, 33 were RDT+. Hence 33/120 (27%) individuals were not isolated. Conclusions: Following the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, a strategy combining serological RDT and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR enabled us to identify around one fourth of contacts with past infection and avoid unnecessary quarantine of these individuals.","Charbonnier, Lorelei; Rouprêt-Serzec, Julie; Caseris, Marion; Danse, Marion; Cointe, Aurélie; Cohen, Laure; Faye, Albert; Ouldali, Naïm; Gaschignard, Jean",Front Pediatr,364,14

Efficient eukaryotic −1 PRF requires an optimally placed stimulator structure downstream of the frameshifting site and different strategies targeting viral −1 PRF stimulators have been developed. However, accessing particular −1 PRF stimulator information represents a bottle-neck in combating the emerging epidemic viral pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Recently, an RNA hairpin upstream of frameshifting site was shown to act as a cis-element to attenuate −1 PRF with mechanism unknown. Here, we show that an upstream duplex formed in-trans, by annealing an antisense to its complementary mRNA sequence upstream of frameshifting site, can replace an upstream hairpin to attenuate −1 PRF efficiently. This finding indicates that the formation of a proximal upstream duplex is the main determining factor responsible for −1 PRF attenuation and provides mechanistic insight. Additionally, the antisense-mediated upstream duplex approach downregulates −1 PRF stimulated by distinct −1 PRF stimulators, including those of MERS-CoV, suggesting its general application potential as a robust means to evaluating viral −1 PRF inhibition as soon as the sequence information of an emerging human coronavirus is available.","Hu, Hao-Teng; Cho, Che-Pei; Lin, Ya-Hui; Chang, Kung-Yao",Nucleic Acids Res,364,11

While food insecurity is both a driver and a consequence of migration, anecdotal evidence indicates that it is also common during migration when people are ‘on the move’, although its prevalence and severity during these periods are largely undocumented. Food security monitoring is critical to ensuring the universal right to food for migrants, and instruments must be designed which capture the unique challenges faced during these ‘extra-ordinary’ periods of mobility, including in the context of emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper reviews knowledge on food security in migrants on the move and examines how active mobility intersects with food security and its measurement. Considering the potential consequences on health and wellbeing, we call for interdisciplinary research using standard instruments to document food insecurity in migrants on the move.

SHANK3 encodes its eponymous scaffolding protein at excitatory glutamatergic synapses. Altered morphology of dendrites and spines in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum have been associated with behavioral impairments in Shank3-deficient animal models. Given the attentional deficit in these animals, our study explored whether deficiency of Shank3 in a rat model alters neuron morphology and synaptic ultrastructure in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). METHODS: We assessed dendrite and spine morphology and spine density in mPFC layer III neurons in Shank3-homozygous knockout (Shank3-KO), heterozygous (Shank3-Het), and wild-type (WT) rats. We used electron microscopy to determine the density of asymmetric synapses in mPFC layer III excitatory neurons in these rats. We measured postsynaptic density (PSD) length, PSD area, and head diameter (HD) of spines at these synapses. RESULTS: Basal dendritic morphology was similar among the three genotypes. Spine density and morphology were comparable, but more thin and mushroom spines had larger head volumes in Shank3-Het compared to WT and Shank3-KO. All three groups had comparable synapse density and PSD length. Spine HD of total and non-perforated synapses in Shank3-Het rats, but not Shank3-KO rats, was significantly larger than in WT rats. The total and non-perforated PSD area was significantly larger in Shank3-Het rats compared to Shank3-KO rats. These findings represent preliminary evidence for synaptic ultrastructural alterations in the mPFC of rats that lack one copy of Shank3 and mimic the heterozygous loss of SHANK3 in Phelan–McDermid syndrome. LIMITATIONS: The Shank3 deletion in the rat model we used does not affect all isoforms of the protein and would only model the effect of mutations resulting in loss of the N-terminus of the protein. Given the higher prevalence of ASD in males, the ultrastructural study focused only on synaptic structure in male Shank3-deficient rats. CONCLUSIONS: We observed increased HD and PSD area in Shank3-Het rats. These observations suggest the occurrence of altered synaptic ultrastructure in this animal model, further pointing to a key role of defective expression of the Shank3 protein in ASD and Phelan–McDermid syndrome.","Jacot-Descombes, Sarah; Keshav, Neha U.; Dickstein, Dara L.; Wicinski, Bridget; Janssen, William G.

METHODS: The proposed treatment schemes, favoring hypofractionated schedules, and COVID-19 management strategies regarding irradiation are presented. Attendance after two months of implementation of these policies was measured and compared with that during the same period in 2019. RESULTS: A 10% reduction in the number of treated patients and a 26% reduction in the number of sessions was observed. The main impact was a decrease in the treatment of benign diseases and gastrointestinal tumors, with a general increase in breast cancer treatments. Eighteen (1.7%) patients were confirmed as having COVID-19 during radiotherapy in April and May 2020, three of whom were hospitalized, and one patient died because of COVID-19. Among the 18 patients, 12 had their treatments interrupted for at least 15 days from symptom appearance. CONCLUSION: There was a decrease in the number of treated patients in our radiotherapy department, with a greater decrease in the total number of sessions. This indicated, overall, a smaller number of fractions/patients treated, despite our efforts to maintain the treatment routine.

We divided 80 subjects into two groups, comparing MMR titers to recent COVID-19 severity levels. The MMR II group consisted of 50 subjects who would primarily have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine, and a comparison group of 30 subjects consisted of those who would primarily have MMR antibodies from sources other than MMR II, including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses. There was a significant inverse correlation (r(s) = −0.71, P < 0.001) between mumps virus titers (mumps titers) and COVID-19 severity within the MMR II group. There were no significant correlations between mumps titers and severity in the comparison group, between mumps titers and age in the MMR II group, or between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group. Within the MMR II group, mumps titers of 134 to 300 arbitrary units (AU)/ml (n = 8) were found only in those who were functionally immune or asymptomatic; all with mild symptoms had mumps titers below 134 AU/ml (n = 17); all with moderate symptoms had mumps titers below 75 AU/ml (n = 11); all who had been hospitalized and had required oxygen had mumps titers below 32 AU/ml (n = 5).

Study design: This was a prospective, cross-sectional study conducted from May 10 to May 31, 2020. Two online anonymous surveys were developed: population-based and clinical-based (children with neuropsychiatric disorders). Outcomes included emotional and behavioral symptoms, as assessed by psychometric scales (BPSC, PPSC, PSC, CES-DC and SCARED, respectively), and lifestyle changes during home confinement (i.e., physical activity, screen time, home schooling, reading). Results: The sample included 9,688 pediatric subjects, and 289 children and adolescents with a neuropsychiatric disorder. The presence of siblings was a protective factor in all ages.

Early reports from China highlighted the risks associated with performing endoscopic endonasal skull base surgery in patients with SARS-CoV-2. We present a rare complication of nasoseptal flap (NSF) necrosis associated with COVID-19, further emphasizing the challenges of performing these procedures in this era. Case Description A 78-year-old male underwent an extended endoscopic endonasal transplanum resection of a pituitary macroadenoma for decompression of the optic chiasm. The resulting skull base defect was repaired using a pedicled nasoseptal flap (NSF). The patient developed meningitis and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak on post-operative day thirteen requiring revision repair of the defect. Twelve days later, he developed persistent fevers and rhinorrhea. The patient was re-explored endoscopically, and the NSF was noted to be necrotic and devitalized with evident CSF leakage. At that time, the patient tested positive for Sars-CoV-2. Post-operatively, he developed acute respiratory distress syndrome complicated by hypoxic respiratory failure and death. Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of NSF necrosis in a patient with COVID-19. We postulate that the thrombotic complications of COVID-19 may have contributed to vascular pedicle thrombosis and NSF necrosis. Although the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 and its effect on the nasal tissues is still being elucidated, this case highlights some challenges of performing endoscopic skull base surgery in the era of COVID-19.","Talmor, Guy; Grube, Jordon G.; Eloy, Jean Anderson; Liu, James K.; Hsueh, Wayne D.",World Neurosurg,364,28

Ivermectin, an anti-helminthic drug is also being proposed for treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Ivermectin has demonstrated broad spectrum antiviral activity against both DNA and RNA viruses. Due to its potential to interfere with transport of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein to nucleus, it is being proposed to have antiviral activity against this virus as well which has been confirmed in an in-vitro study. However, in-vitro to in-vivo extrapolation studies indicate an inability to achieve the desired IC50 levels of ivermectin after oral administration of doses up to 10 times higher than the approved anti-helminthic dose. In a modelling simulation study, drug accumulation in the lungs was noticed at levels having potential antiviral activity. It is hypothesised that inhaled formulation of ivermectin may be effective against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, ivermectin administered via inhalational route needs to be explored for potential beneficial role in COVID-19 in preclinical and clinical studies.

They also experience higher mortality because of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Therefore, we have conducted a comprehensive review to examine the significance of VIT-D for public health and public mental health during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This review had three specific aims, from a global perspective to (a) create a profile of VIT-D and review the epidemiology of VIT-D deficiency, (b) explore VIT-D deficiency as risk factor for SMD and COVID-19 infections and (c) examine the effectiveness of VIT-D supplementation for both conditions. We found that, in terms of SMD, the evidence from laboratory and observational studies points towards some association between VIT-D deficiency and depression or schizophrenia. Mendelian randomisation studies, however, suggest no, or reverse, causality. The evidence from intervention studies is conflicting. Concerning COVID-19 infection, on proof of principle, VIT-D could provide a plausible defence against the infection itself and against an adverse clinical course. But data from observational studies and the first preliminary intervention studies remain conflicting, with stronger evidence that VIT-D may mitigate the clinical course of COVID-19 infection rather than the risk of infection in the first place. From a public health and public mental health point of view, based on the currently limited knowledge, for individuals with SMD, the benefits of VIT-D optimisation through supplementation seem to outweigh the risks. VIT-D supplementation, however, should not substitute for vaccination or medical care for COVID-19 infection.","Werneke, Ursula; Gaughran, Fiona; Taylor, David M.",Ther Adv Psychopharmacol,364,24

Key conclusions of the meeting were that there is a need for discussion of new opportunities for vaccination of all adults as well as for vaccination of older adults, as reflected in the recent shift by WHO to a life-course approach to immunization; that immunization in adults should be viewed in the context of a much broader model based on an individual’s abilities rather than chronological age; and that immunization beyond infancy is a global priority that can be successfully integrated with other interventions to promote healthy ageing. As WHO is looking ahead to a global Decade of Healthy Ageing starting in 2020, it will seek to define a roadmap for interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate immunization with improving access to preventive and other healthcare interventions for adults worldwide.","Teresa Aguado, M.; Barratt, Jane; Beard, John R.; Blomberg, Bonnie B.; Chen, Wilbur H.; Hickling, Julian; Hyde, Terri B.; Jit, Mark; Jones, Rebecca; Poland, Gregory A.; Friede, Martin; Ortiz, Justin R.",Vaccine,364,26

Recent evidence accumulates that adamantanes, widely used in different neurological diseases, could be repurposed for COVID-19. We hereby report on a questionnaire-based study performed to assess severity of COVID-19 in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (n=10), Parkinson's disease (n=5) or cognitive impairment (n=7). In all patients infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed by rtPCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. They were receiving treatment with either amantadine (n=15) or memantine (n=7) in stable registered doses. All of them had two-week quarantine since documented exposure and none of them developed clinical manifestations of infectious disease.

Although the course of the disease is uneventful in most cases, there is a percentage of patients who become critically ill and need admission in the intensive care unit for severe respiratory failure. Numerous of these patients undergo invasive mechanical ventilation and have an extremely high mortality rate. For these patients, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has emerged as a last standing resource. In the present study, the literature was reviewed to evaluate the worldwide data regarding the use of ECMO in the management of critically ill COVID-19 patients. ISI Thomson Web of Science was searched for articles with English language abstracts from inception to March 1, 2021, with ‘ECMO in COVID-19’ as key words. A total of 214 abstracts were screened (case reports, guidelines, reviews) and the most relevant articles were included in the present review. The use of ECMO in the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome refractory to conventional mechanical invasive ventilation is increasing. By increasing the survival rate from less than 20% to more than 50%, ECMO proved to be a valuable resource in the management of the most challenging critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Pleșoianu, Alexandru Florin; Pleșoianu, Carmen Elena; Bararu-Bojan (Bararu), Iris; Vlădeanu (Apăvăloaei), Maria-Cristina; Bojan, Andrei; Țăruș, Andrei; Tinică, Grigore",Exp Ther Med,364,1

New IBV TW-like strains have increasingly emerged in China in recent years; hence, evaluating their pathogenicity and developing a specific vaccine to guard against their potential threat to the poultry industry is important. Here, we examined the pathogenicity of a TW-like IBV strain (GD), and evaluated the protective efficacy of the QX-like strain (JS) against GD in challenge infections in chickens. The results revealed that strain-GD-infected birds experienced severe respiratory signs, renal lesions, and 30–40% mortality. The GD virus had extensive tissue tropism, especially in the trachea, lungs, kidneys, and bursa of Fabricius, and was continuously shed via the respiratory tract and cloaca. The QX-like IBV strain JS is able to completely protect chickens from challenge with the TW-like IBV GD field strain, with no clinical signs or gross lesions, decreased tissue replication rates, lower ciliostasis score, and reduced virus shedding. These findings indicate that IBV GD is highly virulent, and that QX-like JS may serve as an effective vaccine against the threat posed by IBV TW-like viruses.","Yan, Shi-hong; Chen, Yang; Zhao, Jing; Xu, Gang; Zhao, Ye; Zhang, Guo-zhong",Front Microbiol,364,17

METHODS: The CFR among the confirmed Covid-19 cases in Yemen was calculated. The data was retrieved from national Covid-19 surveillance between April 10, when the first COVID-19 case reported, and May 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 419 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported. There were 14.1% and 5.7% of cases who required intensive care and mechanical ventilators, respectively. Out of the total cases, 95 deaths were reported, giving a CFR of 22.6% which is much higher compared to other countries. CFR was significantly higher among elderly people compared to young adults and varied between governorates. Mortality was associated with pre-existing hypertension (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.58, 3.54) and diabetes (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.61).

Pregnant heifers were stratified by heifer development system, initial BW, and AI service sire and placed in an individual feeding system. Heifers were offered meadow hay (8 to 11% CP) from early November to mid-February and provided no supplement (CON; n = 37), 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried distillers grains with solubles–based supplement (HI; n = 39), or 0.83 kg/d (DM basis) of a dried corn gluten feed–based supplement (LO; n = 38). Supplements were designed to be isonitrogenous (28% CP) and isocaloric but to differ in RUP with HI (59% RUP) having greater levels of RUP than LO (34% RUP). After the individual feeding period, heifers were placed in a drylot for calving. All heifers were bred using a fixed-timed AI protocol and pairs were moved to a commercial ranch in the Nebraska Sandhills for summer grazing. Calf weaning BW did not differ (P = 0.14) based on maternal diet. However, feedlot entry BW was greater (P = 0.03) for HI compared with CON calves. Average daily gain during the initial feedlot phase tended (P = 0.10) to be greatest for calves born to CON dams and lowest for calves born to LO dams. However, overall ADG was similar (P = 0.50) for the entire feedlot period. Residual feed intake during the reimplant and total feeding period was improved in calves born to supplemented dams in yr 2 and 3 compared with calves born to CON dams. There was no difference in final BW among treatments (P = 0.71). Hot carcass weight was similar (P = 0.72) among treatments; however, steers had greater (P < 0.01) HCW than heifers. Furthermore, percent empty body fat and 12th rib fat thickness were lowest (P = 0.05 and P = 0.04) for calves born to LO dams. Tenderness measured by Warner-Bratzler shear force was increased (P = 0.03) in longissimus samples from calves from CON dams compared to calves from LO dams. Similarly, crude fat levels tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for calves from CON dams compared with calves from LO dams. Based on these data, providing RUP supplements, similar to those used in this study, to primiparous heifers in late gestation consuming ad libitum grass hay resulted in increased initial feedlot BW for HI compared to CON calves, improved feed efficiency, and altered carcass characteristics in calves born to supplemented compared with CON dams.","Summers, A.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, with its emphasis on personal protective equipment (PPE) and reducing high-risk contacts, was the catalyst needed to bring telemedicine into mainstream consciousness and acceptance. OBJECTIVES: We first review some of the key factors that precipitated this abrupt alteration of the perception of telemedicine. We then detail the creation of a department-wide telemedicine network using off-the-shelf consumer products. Our goal was to very rapidly install a system that was familiar to end-users for the purpose of reducing high-risk contacts and conserving PPE. Sourcing from the consumer realm proved to be advantageous over enterprise-level equipment when these goals were desired. DISCUSSION: After a rollout of 1.5 weeks from zero to fully operational, we showed an immediate decrease in high-risk contacts and PPE use. All 80 rooms plus all triage areas in our department were outfitted with Apple iPads running Zoom. User adoption was high and telemedicine use increased from ∼17 to ∼90 instances a day, a 429% increase. We saw a decrease in high-risk contacts of about 75%, with a concomitant cost savings in PPE. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the use of consumer products sourced from local vendors is a viable solution for telemedicine systems focusing on speed, reducing costs, and ease of deployment. Future work will focus on studying its performance characteristics vs. other systems in an evolving landscape.","Lowe, Jason; Shen, Sam",J Emerg Med,364,1

The diagnostic value of CT is unclear. We aimed to compare the performance of CT and initial RT-PCR for clinically suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epicentre—Wuhan, China. Materials and methods Patients clinically suspected of COVID-19 infection who underwent initial RT-PCR and chest CT at the same time were retrospectively enrolled. Two radiologists with specific training reviewed the CT images independently and final diagnoses of the presence or absence of COVID-19 was reached by consensus. With serial RT-PCR as reference standard, the performance of initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed. A strategy of combining initial RT-PCR and chest CT was analysed to study the additional benefit. Results 82 patients admitted to hospital between Jan 10, 2020 to Feb 28, 2020 were enrolled. 34 COVID-19 and 48 non-COVID-19 patients were identified by serial RT-PCR. The sensitivity, specificity was 79% (27/34) and 100% (48/48) for initial RT-PCR and 77% (26/34) and 96% (46/48) for chest CT. The image readers had a good interobserver agreement with Cohen's kappa of 0.69. No statistical difference was found in the diagnostic performance between initial RT-PCR and chest CT. The comprehensive strategy had a higher sensitivity of 94% (32/34). Conclusions Initial RT-PCR and chest CT had comparable diagnostic performance in identification of suspected COVID-19 patients outside the epidemic center. To compensate potential risk of false-negative PCR, chest CT should be applied for clinically suspected patients with negative initial RT-PCR.","He, Jian-Long; Luo, Lin; Luo, Zhen-Dong; Lyu, Jian-Xun; Ng, Ming-Yen; Shen, Xin-Ping; Wen, Zhibo",Respir Med,364,16

Our project originally aimed to extend findings on White women’s, Black women’s, and White men’s workplace anger by examining whether evaluations are exacerbated or buffered by invalidating or affirming comments from others. In stark contrast to previous research on gender stereotyping and anger evaluations, however, results across four studies (N = 1,095) showed that both Black and White women portrayed as experiencing anger in the workplace were evaluated more favorably than White men doing so. After Study 1’s initial failure to conceptually replicate, we investigated whether perceivers’ evaluations of women’s workplace anger could have been affected by the contemporaneous cultural event of #MeToo. Supporting this possibility, we found evaluations were moderated by news engagement and beliefs that workplace opportunities are gendered. Additionally, we found invalidating comments rarely affected evaluations of a protagonist yet affirming comments tended to favorably affect evaluations. Overall, findings suggest the need for psychologists to consider the temporary, or perhaps lasting, effects of cultural events on research outcomes.","McCormick-Huhn, Kaitlin; Shields, Stephanie A.",Front Psychol,364,29

Currently, well-known pathogens such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens type C appear to play a minor role in development of disease. Other infectious pathogens may be involved. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of selected infectious pathogens in neonatal piglets with clinical and pathological signs of enteric disease. The association between rotavirus A, Enterococcus hirae, Clostridium difficile and Clostridium perfringens type A/C and diarrhoea was investigated in a case control study on piglet level. The possible role of E. coli virulence factors was investigated in a multistep-procedure using herd-pools of E.coli isolates to screen for their presence. RESULTS: Rotavirus A was detected more often in cases (25%) than in controls (6%) (P < 0.001). The detection rate of Enterococcus hirae, Clostridium difficile and C. perfringens type A positive for beta2 genes was the same in the two groups of piglets. C. perfringens type C was not detected in the study. Investigations on E. coli virulence factors showed a high prevalence of EAST1 toxin genes (55% of tested case piglets were positive) and AIDA-1 adhesin genes (63% of toxin positive case piglets were positive) in case piglets. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of rotavirus A was statistically significantly associated with neonatal piglet diarrhoea. An aetiologic role of E. coli carrying virulence factors EAST1 and AIDA-1 needs further investigation as the study points out these two factors as possible causative factors in neonatal diarrhoea. Detection of E.hirae, C.difficile and C. perfringens type A carrying beta 2 genes was not associated with neonatal piglet diarrhoea. However, the study suggested that massive overgrowth by E. hirae could be part of the pathogenesis in some cases of neonatal diarrhoea.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy was discovered by a Japanese cardiovascular expert and classified as acquired primary cardiomyopathy by the American Heart Association (AHA) in 1990 and 2006, respectively. Regardless of the extensive research efforts, its pathophysiology is still unclear; therefore, there are no well-established guidelines specifically for treating and managing TTC patients. Increasing evidence suggests that sympatho-adrenergic stimulation is strongly associated with the pathogenesis of this disease. Under acute stressful conditions, the hyperstimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs) resulting from excessive release of catecholamines induces intracellular kinases capable of phosphorylating and activating “A Disintegrin and Metalloprotease 17” (ADAM17), a type-I transmembrane protease that plays a central role in acute myocardial inflammation and metabolic lipids dysregulation which are the main hallmarks of TTC. However, our understanding of this is limited; hence this concise review provides a comprehensive insight into the key role of ADAM17 in acute myocardial inflammation and metabolic lipids dysregulation during acute stress. Also, how the synergy of ADAM17-induced acute inflammation and lipids dysregulation causes TTC is explained.

A systems view of host response to infections provides opportunities for discovering sensitive and robust molecular diagnostics. METHODS: We combine blood transcriptomes from six independent datasets (n = 756) with a knowledge-based human protein-protein interaction network, identifies subnetworks capturing host response to each infection class, and derives common response cores separately for viral and bacterial infections. We subject the subnetworks to a series of computational filters to identify a parsimonious gene panel and a standalone diagnostic score that can be applied to individual samples. We rigorously validate the panel and the diagnostic score in a wide range of publicly available datasets and in a newly developed Bangalore-Viral Bacterial (BL-VB) cohort. FINDING: We discover a 10-gene blood-based biomarker panel (Panel-VB) that demonstrates high predictive performance to distinguish viral from bacterial infections, with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96–0.99) in eleven independent datasets (n = 898). We devise a new stand-alone patient-wise score (VB(10)) based on the panel, which shows high diagnostic accuracy with a weighted mean AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.91–0.98) in 2996 patient samples from 56 public datasets from 19 different countries. Further, we evaluate VB(10) in a newly generated South Indian (BL-VB, n = 56) cohort and find 97% accuracy in the confirmed cases of viral and bacterial infections. We find that VB(10) is (a) capable of accurately identifying the infection class in culture-negative indeterminate cases, (b) reflects recovery status, and (c) is applicable across different age groups, covering a wide spectrum of acute bacterial and viral infections, including uncharacterized pathogens. We tested our VB(10) score on publicly available COVID-19 data and find that our score detected viral infection in patient samples.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents the most common and serious complication of COVID-19. Cytokine storms are a pathophysiological feature of COVID-19 and play an important role in distinguishing hyper-inflammatory subphenotypes of ARDS. Accordingly, in this review, we focus on hyper-inflammatory host responses in ARDS that play a critical role in the differentiated development of COVID-19. Furthermore, we discuss inflammation-related indicators that have the potential to identify hyper-inflammatory subphenotypes of COVID-19, especially for those with a high risk of ARDS. Finally, we explore the possibility of improving the quality of monitoring and treatment of COVID-19 patients and in reducing the incidence of critical illness and mortality via better distinguishing hyper- and hypo-inflammatory subphenotypes of COVID-19.","Lin, Shi-hui; Zhao, Yi-si; Zhou, Dai-xing; Zhou, Fa-chun; Xu, Fang",Genes Dis,364,20

Si les signes cliniques, biologiques et scanographiques du COVID-19 ont été largement rapportés, on manque d’informations sur les patients ayant une suspicion de COVID-19 qui s’est révélée négative. L’utilisation de techniques de diagnostic avec un résultat rapide permet une orientation de plus en plus précoce, mais leur non-disponibilité et/ou les potentiels faux négatifs rendent nécessaires une meilleure distinction des patients avec une suspicion de COVID-19 non confirmée (SCNC) de ceux atteints de COVID-19. L’objectif de cette étude est de décrire et de comparer ces deux populations. Ceci doit permettre d’optimiser l’orientation et la gestion des patients suspects de COVID-19 requérant une hospitalisation pour limiter le risque de perte de chances. Matériels et méthodes Une partie des patients avec indication d’hospitalisation pour suspicion de COVID-19 a été incluse rétrospectivement, du 23 février au 28 avril 2020. Le statut de SCNC était retenu lorsque la RT-PCR COVID-19 était négative et que le diagnostic final retenu était autre. Les données cliniques, biologiques et scanographiques, ainsi que les diagnostics finaux ont été recueillis. Ces données ont été comparées à celles des patients COVID-19 hospitalisés sur la même période. Résultats Parmi les 152 patients SCNC hospitalisés inclus, la moitié avait plus de 70 ans. Les comorbidités principales étaient l’hypertension artérielle (n =63 ; 41,5 %), les maladies pulmonaires chroniques (n =32 ; 21,1 %) et les cardiopathies ischémiques (n =21 ; 13,8 %). Parmi les diagnostics finaux, 65 avaient une maladie infectieuse (42,7 %) : 38 infections respiratoires (25 %), 12 bactériémies (7,9 %) et 7 infections urinaires (4,6 %). Treize avaient une décompensation cardiaque (8,6 %). Ils avaient eu en moyenne 1,3 (0,7) RT-PCR. Comparés aux 222 patients COVID-19, les patients SCNC étaient plus souvent fumeurs (n =28 [27,2 %] vs n =8 [4,4 %], p <0,001). Ils présentaient cliniquement moins de fièvre (n =78 [51,3 %] vs n =169 [76,1 %], p <0,001), moins de toux (n =76 [50,7 %] vs n =146 [63,8 %], p <0,003) et moins de signes digestifs (n =18 [11,8 %] vs n =66 [29,7 %], p <0,001). Les taux de fibrinogène (g/L) et de CRP (mg/L) étaient significativement plus bas chez les SCNC avec des médianes respectives à 5,3 (4–6,5) vs 6,0 (5,3–6,8), p <0,001, et 57,3 (13–126) vs 83,7 (37,7–127), p =0,008. Leur taux médian de lymphocytes (G/L) était plus haut : 1,1 (0,7–1,7) vs 0,9 (0,6–1,4), p =0,03. Conclusion Il s’agit, à notre connaissance, de la première étude observationnelle comparative des patients avec indication d’hospitalisation pour suspicion de COVID-19. L’absence de symptomatologie respiratoire, de fièvre et de signes digestifs doit faire rechercher un diagnostic différentiel. Les signes respiratoires « isolés » associés au tabagisme chronique pourraient expliquer la surreprésentation des fumeurs chez des sujets fragiles faisant redouter par excès une COVID-19, plus qu’un rôle protecteur intrinsèque. La perte de chance engendrée par la suspicion de COVID-19 doit être explorée plus largement.","Eberl, I.; Rogier, T.; Sixt, T.; Moretto, F.; Abdallahoui, M.; Coussement, A.; Behague, L.; Chavanet, P.; Blot, M.; Piroth, L.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,364,22

The aim of this study was to evaluate the mental health, well-being and changes in lifestyle among intensive care unit (ICU) healthcare workers (HCW) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare these results with those of HCW in other hospital units. Another objective was to understand which associated factors aggravate their mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey collected socio-demographic data, lifestyle changes and mental health evaluations as assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 items (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 items (PHQ-9), the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI) and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) from the 28th May to 7th July 2020. The study was carried out at Geneva University Hospitals, a group of eight public hospitals in Switzerland. ICU HCW were analyzed for mental health outcomes and lifestyles changes and then compared to non-ICU HCW. A series of linear regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with mental health scores. RESULTS: A total of 3461 HCW were included in the study, with 352 ICU HCW. Among ICU HCW, 145 (41%) showed low well-being, 162 (46%) symptoms of anxiety, 163 (46%) symptoms of depression and 76 (22%) had peritraumatic distress. The mean scores of GAD-7, PHQ-9 and WHO-5 were worse in ICU HCW than in non-ICU HCW (p < 0.01). Working in the ICU rather than in other departments resulted in a change of eating habits, sleeping patterns and alcohol consumption (p < 0.01). Being a woman, the fear of catching and transmitting COVID-19, anxiety of working with COVID-19 patients, work overload, eating and sleeping disorders as well as increased alcohol consumption were associated with worse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSION: This study confirms the suspicion of a high prevalence of anxiety, depression, peritraumatic distress and low well-being during the first COVID-19 wave among HCW, especially among ICU HCW. This allows for the identification of associated risk factors. Long-term psychological follow-up should be considered for HCW.

These mutations enable the SARS-CoV-2 to evolve into new strains. Viral quasispecies emerge from de novo mutations that occur in individual patients. In combination, these sets of viral mutations provide distinct genetic fingerprints that reveal the patterns of transmission and have utility in contract tracing. METHODS: Leveraging thousands of sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we performed a viral pangenome analysis to identify conserved genomic sequences. We used a rapid and highly efficient computational approach that relies on k-mers, short tracts of sequence, instead of conventional sequence alignment. Using this method, we annotated viral mutation signatures that were associated with specific strains. Based on these highly conserved viral sequences, we developed a rapid and highly scalable targeted sequencing assay to identify mutations, detect quasispecies and identify mutation signatures from patients. These results were compared to the pangenome genetic fingerprints. RESULTS: We built a k-mer index for thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes and identified conserved genomics regions and landscape of mutations across thousands of virus genomes. We delineated mutation profiles spanning common genetic fingerprints (the combination of mutations in a viral assembly) and rare ones that occur in only small fraction of patients. We developed a targeted sequencing assay by selecting primers from the conserved viral genome regions to flank frequent mutations. Using a cohort of SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples, we identified genetic fingerprints consisting of strain-specific mutations seen across populations and de novo quasispecies mutations localized to individual infections. We compared the mutation profiles of viral samples undergoing analysis with the features of the pangenome. CONCLUSIONS: We conducted an analysis for viral mutation profiles that provide the basis of genetic fingerprints. Our study linked pangenome analysis with targeted deep sequenced SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples. We identified quasispecies mutations occurring within individual patients, mutations demarcating dominant species and the prevalence of mutation signatures, of which a significant number were relatively unique. Analysis of these genetic fingerprints may provide a way of conducting molecular contact tracing.","Lau, Billy T.; Pavlichin, Dmitri; Hooker, Anna C.; Almeda, Alison; Shin, Giwon; Chen, Jiamin; Sahoo, Malaya K.; Huang, ChunHong; Pinsky, Benjamin A.; Lee, HoJoon; Ji, Hanlee P.",medRxiv,364,21

Incorporating Apple Maps mobility data into an epidemiological model of daily deaths and hospitalizations allowed us to estimate an explicit relationship between human mobility and transmission in the United States. We find that reduced mobility explains a large decrease in the effective reproductive number attained by April 1st and further identify state-to-state variation in the inferred transmission-mobility relationship. These findings indicate that simply relaxing stay-at-home orders can rapidly lead to outbreaks exceeding the scale of transmission that has occurred to date. Our findings provide quantitative guidance on the impact policies must achieve against transmission to safely relax social distancing measures.,"Miller, A. C.; Foti, N. J.; Lewnard, J. A.; Jewell, N.

HFRT benefits include reduction in the number of clinical visits for each patient, minimizing potential exposure, and reducing stress on the limited workforce, especially in resource-limited settings as in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Recent studies for LMICs in Africa have also shown that adopting HFRT can lead to significant cost reductions and increased access to radiotherapy. We assessed the readiness of 18 clinics in African LMICs to adopting HFRT. An IRB-approved survey was conducted at 18 RT clinics across 8 African countries. The survey requested information regarding the clinic’s existing equipment and human infrastructure and current practices. Amongst the surveyed clinics, all reported to already practicing HFRT, but only 44% of participating clinics reported adopting HFRT as a common practice. Additionally, most participating clinical staff reported to have received formal training appropriate for their role. However, the survey data on treatment planning and other experience with contouring highlighted need for additional training for radiation oncologists. Although the surveyed clinics in African LMICs are familiar with HFRT, there is need for additional investment in infrastructure and training as well as better education of oncology leaders on the benefits of increased adoption of evidence-based HFRT during and beyond the COVID-19 era.","Swanson, William; Kamwa, Francesca; Samba, Richard; Ige, Taofeeq; Lasebikan, Nwamaka; Mallum, Abba; Ngoma, Twalib; Sajo, Erno; Elzawawy, Ahmed; Incrocci, Luca; Ngwa, Wilfred",Front Oncol,364,1

We conducted a systematic review to estimate global burden of all-cause and virus-specific ALRI in 5–19 years. METHODS: We searched eight databases and Google for studies published between 1995 and 2019 and reporting data on burden of all-cause ALRI or ALRI associated with influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus. We assessed risk of bias using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We developed an analytical framework to report burden by age, country and region when there were sufficient data (all-cause and influenza-associated ALRI hospital admissions). We estimated all-cause ALRI in-hospital deaths and hospital admissions for ALRI associated with respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus by region. RESULTS: Globally, an estimated 5.5 million (UR 4.0–7.8) all-cause ALRI hospital admissions occurred annually between 1995 and 2019 in 5–19 year olds, causing 87 900 (UR 40 300–180 600) in-hospital deaths annually. Influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus were associated with 1 078 600 (UR 4 56 500–2 650 200) and 231 800 (UR 142 700–3 73 200) ALRI hospital admissions in 5–19 years. Human metapneumovirus and human parainfluenza virus were associated with 105 500 (UR 57 200–181 700) and 124 800 (UR 67 300–228 500) ALRI hospital admissions in 5–14 years. About 55% of all-cause ALRI hospital admissions and 63% of influenza-associated ALRI hospital admissions occurred in those 5–9 years globally. All-cause and influenza-associated ALRI hospital admission rates were highest in upper-middle income countries, Asia-Pacific region and the Latin America and Caribbean region. CONCLUSION: Incidence and mortality data for all-cause and virus-specific ALRI in 5–19 year olds are scarce. The lack of data in low-income countries and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, South Asia, and West and Central Africa warrants efforts to improve the development and access to healthcare services, diagnostic capacity, and data reporting.","Wang, Xin; Li, You; Mei, Xin; Bushe, Erin; Campbell, Harry; Nair, Harish",BMJ Glob Health,364,29

However, the relationship between COVID-19 and acute cerebrovascular diseases is unclear. AIMS: We aimed to characterize the incidence, risk factors, clinical–radiological manifestations, and outcome of COVID-19-associated stroke. METHODS: Three medical databases were systematically reviewed for published articles on acute cerebrovascular diseases in COVID-19 (December 2019–September 2020). The review protocol was previously registered (PROSPERO ID = CRD42020185476). Data were extracted from articles reporting ≥5 stroke cases in COVID-19. We complied with the PRISMA guidelines and used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale to assess data quality. Data were pooled using a random-effect model. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Of 2277 initially identified articles, 61 (2.7%) were entered in the meta-analysis. Out of 108,571 patients with COVID-19, acute CVD occurred in 1.4% (95%CI: 1.0–1.9). The most common manifestation was acute ischemic stroke (87.4%); intracerebral hemorrhage was less common (11.6%). Patients with COVID-19 developing acute cerebrovascular diseases, compared to those who did not, were older (pooled median difference = 4.8 years; 95%CI: 1.7–22.4), more likely to have hypertension (OR = 7.35; 95%CI: 1.94–27.87), diabetes mellitus (OR = 5.56; 95%CI: 3.34–9.24), coronary artery disease (OR = 3.12; 95%CI: 1.61–6.02), and severe infection (OR = 5.10; 95%CI: 2.72–9.54). Compared to individuals who experienced a stroke without the infection, patients with COVID-19 and stroke were younger (pooled median difference = −6.0 years; 95%CI: −12.3 to −1.4), had higher NIHSS (pooled median difference = 5; 95%CI: 3–9), higher frequency of large vessel occlusion (OR = 2.73; 95%CI: 1.63–4.57), and higher in-hospital mortality rate (OR = 5.21; 95%CI: 3.43–7.90). CONCLUSIONS: Acute cerebrovascular diseases are not uncommon in patients with COVID-19, especially in those whom are severely infected and have pre-existing vascular risk factors. The pattern of large vessel occlusion and multi-territory infarcts suggests that cerebral thrombosis and/or thromboembolism could be possible causative pathways for the disease.","Nannoni, Stefania; de Groot, Rosa; Bell, Steven; Markus, Hugh S",Int J Stroke,364,1

Its empirical use has been associated with multiple cardiac adverse reactions pertaining to its ancillary multi-channel blocking properties, vaguely characterized until now. We aimed to characterize qualitatively the cardiotoxicity associated with lopinavir/ritonavir in the setting of COVID-19. Spontaneous notifications of cardiac adverse drug reactions reported to the national Pharmacovigilance Network were collected for 8 weeks since March 1st 2020. The Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance, whose scope of expertise is drug-induced long QT syndrome, analyzed the cases, including the reassessment of all available ECGs. QTc ≥ 500 ms and delta QTc > 60 ms from baseline were deemed serious. Twenty-two cases presented with 28 cardiac adverse reactions associated with the empirical use of lopinavir/ritonavir in a hospital setting. Most adverse reactions reflected lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block voltage-gated potassium channels with 5 ventricular arrhythmias and 17 QTc prolongations. An average QTc augmentation of 97 ± 69 ms was reported. Twelve QTc prolongations were deemed serious. Other cases were likely related to lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block sodium channels: 1 case of bundle branch block and 5 recurrent bradycardias. The incidence of cardiac adverse reactions of lopinavir/ritonavir was estimated between 0.3% and 0.4%. These cardiac adverse drug reactions offer a new insight in its ancillary multi-channel blocking functions. Lopinavir/ritonavir cardiotoxicity may be of concern for its empirical use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Caution should be exerted relative to this risk where lopinavir/ritonavir summary of product characteristics should be implemented accordingly.","Audrey, Fresse; Delphine, Viard; Serena, Romani; Alexandre, Gerard; Marion, Lepelley; Fanny, Rocher; Joe-Elie, Salem; Milou-Daniel, Drici",Int J Cardiol,364,1

This smartphone application virtualises incentive spirometry, a longstanding respiratory therapy technique. Objectives: Inspiratory flows were simulated using a 3 litre calibration syringe and validated using clinical reference devices. Syringe flow nozzles of decreasing diameter were applied to model the influence of mouth shape on audible sound levels generated. Methods: A library of calibrated audio inspiratory sounds was created to determine the reliability and range of inspiratory sound detection at increasing distances separating the sound source and smartphones running the app. Results: Simulated inspiratory sounds were reliably detected by the new application at higher air inflows (high, medium), using smaller mouth diameters (<25 mm) and where smartphones were held proximal (≤5 cm) to the mouth (or at distances up to 50 cm for higher airflows). Performance was comparable for popular smartphone types and using different phone orientations (i.e., held horizontally, at 45° or 90°). Conclusions: These observations inform future application refinements, including prompts to reduce mouth diameter, increase inspiratory flow and maintain proximity to the phone to optimise sound detection. This library of calibrated inspiratory sounds offers reproducible non-human reference data suitable for development, evaluation and regression testing of a therapeutic respiratory exergame application for smartphones.","Baxter, Clarence; Carroll, Julie-Anne; Keogh, Brendan; Vandelanotte, Corneel",Sensors (Basel),364,16

We herein investigated the effects of rMIKO-1 on activated macrophages and discussed its potential as a suppressor of experimental colitis. Fluorescent microscopy was used to observe the dynamic mobility of rMIKO-1 in macrophages. Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting, fluorescent immunochemical staining, flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, a polymerase chain reaction/quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and hematoxylin and eosin staining were conducted to assess the potential activity of rMIKO-1. A large amount of bleeding was observed in rats treated with 5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) alone on day 8 after treatment initiation, but not in those treated with 5% DSS plus rMIKO-1. In the in vitro assay, rMIKO-1 rapidly bound to macrophages, immediately entered cells by an unknown mechanism, and then migrated inside the nucleus. This result suggests that rMIKO-1 plays important immunological roles in the nucleus. Despite the activation of macrophages by lipopolysaccharide, the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1β, was significantly suppressed in macrophages preliminarily treated with rMIKO-1 for 1 h. Complexes of rMIKO-1 with nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB)/p65 and β-actin formed in activated macrophages, which attenuated experimental colitis in rats. These results strongly suggest that rMIKO-1 negatively regulates excessively activated macrophages through the NF-κB/p65 signaling pathway. Therefore, rMIKO-1 is a novel suppressor of experimental colitis in rats through the negative regulation of activated macrophages.","Okada, Kohki; Ikemoto, Masaki",Inflammation,364,16

With the acceleration of the Anthropocene's environmental changes, socio-ecological instabilities and the possibility of the emergence of infectious diseases merge into a background of a ´twin insurgency´. Furthermore, there is a tendency to impose economic hegemony in the current Brazilian context, corroborating discourses and pressures to a scientific simplification and denial. With this, we assert that developmental sectoral actions and monoculture of knowledge characterize an agenda of omission, that is, a process of decision making that indirectly reinforces ecological degradation and carelessness in the face of the possibility of the emergence and spreading of new diseases, such as COVID-19. Tackling the socio-ecological complexity inherent in the risk of the emergence of infectious diseases requires robust co-construction of scientific knowledge, eco-social approaches, and corresponding governance and sophisticated decision-making arrangements.","Giatti, Leandro Luiz; Ribeiro, Ricardo Agum; Nava, Alessandra Ferreira Dales; Gutberlet, Jutta",Genet Mol Biol,364,15

Severe CAC was independently associated with intubation (AOR: 4.0, CI: 1.3–13) and mortality (AOR: 5.1, CI: 1.9–15). A greater CAC score (UOR: 1.2, CI: 1.02–1.3) and number of vessels with calcium (UOR: 1.3, CI: 1.02–1.6) was associated with mortality. Visualized coronary stent or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) had no statistically significant association with intubation (AOR: 1.9, CI: 0.4–7.7) or death (AOR: 3.4, CI: 1.0–12). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients with any CAC were more likely to require intubation and die than those without CAC. Increasing CAC and number of affected arteries was associated with mortality. Severe CAC was associated with higher intubation risk. Prior CABG or stenting had no association with elevated intubation or death.","Gupta, Yogesh Sean; Finkelstein, Mark; Manna, Sayan; Toussie, Danielle; Bernheim, Adam; Little, Brent P.; Concepcion, Jose; Maron, Samuel Z.; Jacobi, Adam; Chung, Michael; Kukar, Nina; Voutsinas, Nicholas; Cedillo, Mario A.; Fernandes, Ajit; Eber, Corey; Fayad, Zahi A.; Hota, Partha",Clin Imaging,364,16

We begin by observing that the principles of risk communication are regarded as basic best practices rather than as moral rules. We argue firstly, that they nonetheless encapsulate value commitments, and secondly, that these values should more explicitly underpin communication practices in a pandemic. Our focus is to explore the values associated with the principle of communicating early and often and how use of this principle can signal respect for people’s self-determination whilst also conveying other values relevant to the circumstances. We suggest that doing this requires communication that explicitly acknowledges and addresses with empathy those who will be most directly impacted by any disease-control measures. We suggest further that communication in a pandemic should be more explicit about how values are expressed in response strategies and that doing so may improve the appraisal of new information as it becomes available.","Hooker, Claire; Leask, Julie",J Bioeth Inq,364,16

We studied the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia. DESIGN: The aim of our study was to evaluate the reduction in duration of hospitalization with adequate oxygen status. Forty-eight patients with moderate COVID-19-related pneumonia were asked to participate in the prospective case-control study; 33 patients (Cases) signed informed consent and received canakinumab (Cohort 1); 15 patients (Controls) refused to receive the experimental drug and received institutional standard of care (SoC), (Cohort 2). RESULTS: Hospital discharge within 21 days was seen in 63% of patients in Cohort 1 vs. 0% in Cohort 2 (median 14 vs 26 days, respectively; p < 0.001). There was significant clinical improvement in ventilation regimes following administration of canakinumab compared to Cohort 2 (Stuart-Maxwell test for paired data, p < 0.001). Patients treated with canakinumab experienced a significant increase in PaO(2):FiO(2) (p < 0.001) and reduction in lung damage by CT (p = 0.01), along with significant decreases in immune/inflammation markers that were not observed in Cohort 2. Only mild side effects were seen in patients treated with canakinumab; survival at 60 days was 90.0% (95% CI: 71.9-96.7) in patients treated with canakinumab and 73.3% (95% CI: 43.6-89.1) for Cohort 2. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with canakinumab in patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia rapidly restored normal oxygen status, decreased the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and was associated with earlier hospital discharge and favorable prognosis versus SoC.","Generali, Daniele; Bosio, Giancarlo; Malberti, Fabio; Cuzzoli, Antonio; Testa, Sophie; Romanini, Laura; Fioravanti, Antonio; Morandini, Alessandro; Pianta, Luca; Giannotti, Guglielmo; Viola, Erika Maria; Pier-Franceschi, Matteo Giorgi; Foramitti, Marina; Tira, Rosa Angela; Zangrandi, Ilaria; Chiodelli, Giulia; Machiavelli, Andrea; Cappelletti, Maria Rosa; Giossi, Alessia; De Giuli, Valeria; Costanzi, Chiara; Campana, Chiara; Bernocchi, Ottavia; Sirico, Marianna; Zoncada, Alessia; Molteni, Alfredo; Venturini, Sergio; Giudici, Fabiola; Scaltriti, Maurizio; Pan, Angelo",Int J Infect Dis,364,29

Anaemia is rampant, with 53% prevalence in Indian females, but iron deficiency can be present even without anaemia. Therefore, this study was planned to determine the clinical profile, red blood cell indices, and effects of iron deficiency, on the course and prognosis of heart failure in Indian females. Materials and methods: This was a hospital-based observational study, conducted at a tertiary care teaching institute in India. Data from 147 females enrolled in the study between September 2017 to March 2020 was collected out of all patients enrolled in ongoing heart failure registry at the institute. Clinical characteristics at presentation, iron profile, red blood cell indices, treatment and mortality data was collected. Results: Mean age of the subjects (n = 147) was 53.31 ± 17.1 years with 55% non-rheumatic and 45% with rheumatic heart disease. The patients with rheumatic heart disease were younger, with a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation. Non-rheumatic patients had a higher prevalence of CV risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, more patients in NYHA IV, and 83% patients had LVEF ≤40%. Anaemia was present in 49%, however iron deficiency was present in 89% (absolute iron deficiency in 80% and functional iron deficiency in 9%) with no significant difference between rheumatic and non-rheumatic group. Red blood cell indices showed no significant difference across the spectrum of iron deficiency and anaemia, except lower mean corpuscular volume in patients with both iron deficiency and anaemia. The mean survival time was 840 days, with no significant difference between groups. There was significantly higher mortality in patients with iron deficiency (log rank 0.045). Conclusion: Iron deficiency–with or without anaemia–is very high in Indian females, worsening survival in heart failure. Proper diagnosis with iron supplementation will improve the prognosis.","Deora, Surender; Sharma, Jai Bharat; Sharma, Shubham Kumar; Chaudhary, Nikhil; Kaushik, Atul; Choudhary, Rahul; Charan, Jaykaran; Kumar, Deepak; Bohra, Gopal Krishna; Singh, Kuldeep",Global cardiology science & practice,364,2

A conventional virus is made up of 2 or 3 major components. A nucleic acid genome, which can be Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) or Ribonucleic Acid (RNA), single or double-stranded, contiguous or segmented, contains all the genetic information and encodes all the virus-specific macromolecules of the pathogen. The molecular and pathogenic aspects of their biology are grouped in terms of their genomic organization. Molecular characterization of these pathogens provides an understanding of mechanisms of pathogenesis, rational drug design, molecular signatures that can be used to trace outbreaks of viral disease… An overview of the six families of DNA and 15 families of RNA viruses, based on their molecular properties and life cycles is presented. The utility and issues surrounding the use of molecular forensics and epidemiology to the world of virology are exemplified, for instance, because of rapid sequencing techniques detailed fingerprints of viruses provide important clues about their source. Like other microbial species, the analysis of viral genomic segments can provide important clues as to the relatedness and origins of infections. Given their small size and high rate of evolution, several considerations should be kept in mind when applying comparative molecular forensic analyses to viruses. The tracking of HIV infections exemplifies the successful application of molecular forensics to identify the source of a viral infection. The goal of this chapter is to provide a background in the fundamentals of human virology and provide an overview of the utility and issues surrounding the use of molecular forensics and epidemiology to the world of virology.","WILUSZ, JEFFREY",Microbial Forensics,364,8

Enzymatic digestion is a well-known method to produce protein hydrolysates; however, the type of enzyme determines the bioactive potential of the protein hydrolysates due to difference in their catalytic specificity. In this study, process optimization, production and evaluation of whole egg white protein hydrolysate (WEWPH) using pineapple bromelain through the Box-Behnken design were carried out. The design experiment (r(2) = 0.9557) displayed a significant (p < 0.01) effect of pH of egg white (9.0), hydrolysis time (24 h), and enzyme/substrate ratio (3.2 unit/g substrate) on hydrolysis and to form bioactive WEWPH. Antioxidant activity of the WEWPH was confirmed by DPPH radical scavenging assay. Gel filtration chromatography, SDS-PAGE and FTIR spectroscopy analysis of WEWPH revealed the digestion of egg white and the integrity of WEWPH in terms of secondary structure. The WEWPH exhibited strong scavenging activities of DPPH (EC(50) = 238.3 µg/ml), ABTS ABTS (EC(50) = 54.9 µg/ml), peroxyl (EC(50) = 391.6 µg/ml) and superoxide radicals. The WEWPH also displayed reducing power and singlet oxygen quenching activity. These results reveal that the bioactive WEWPH could be a promising ingredient in health food and nutraceuticals.

Historical trends in Quebec and implications for Canada”, we assessed public health investments since the establishment of the Nova Scotia provincial health authority in 2015. We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015−2016 to 2019–2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5–6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015–2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health work, and the need for a pandemic recovery plan that prioritizes investment in all areas of public health in Nova Scotia.","Caldwell, Hilary A.

G6PD deficient individuals are at high risk of severe hemolysis when given anti-malarial drugs such as primaquine, quinine, other sulphonamide-containing medicines, and chloroquine, which has recently been shown to be potent for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). We evaluated the geographical accessibility to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana, a malaria-endemic country. Methods: We obtained the geographic information of 100 randomly sampled clinics previously included in a cross-sectional survey. We also obtained the geolocated data of all public hospitals providing G6PD deficiency testing services in the region. Using ArcGIS 10.5, we quantified geographical access to G6PD deficiency screening test and identified clinics as well as visualize locations with poor access for targeted improvement. The travel time was estimated using an assumed speed of 20 km per hour. Findings: Of the 100 clinics, 58% were Community-based Health Planning and Services facilities, and 42% were sub-district health centers. The majority (92%) were Ghana Health Service facilities, and the remaining 8% were Christian Health Association of Ghana facilities. Access to G6PD deficiency screening test was varied across the districts, and G6PD deficiency screening test was available in all eight public hospitals. This implies that the health facility-to-population ratio for G6PD deficiency testing service was approximately 1:159,210 (8/1,273,677) population. The spatial analysis quantified the current mean distance to a G6PD deficiency testing service from all locations in the region to be 34 ± 14 km, and travel time (68 ± 27 min). The estimated mean distance from a clinic to a district hospital for G6PD deficiency testing services was 15 ± 11 km, and travel time (46 ± 33 min). Conclusion: Access to POC testing for G6PD deficiency in Ghana was poor. Given the challenges associated with G6PD deficiency, it would be essential to improve access to G6PD deficiency POC testing to facilitate administration of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine to pregnant women, full implementation of the malaria control program in Ghana, and treatment of COVID-19 patients with chloroquine in malaria-endemic countries. To enable the World Health Organization include appropriate G6PD POC diagnostic tests in its list of essential in-vitro diagnostics for use in resource-limited settings, we recommend a wider evaluation of available POC diagnostic tests for G6PD deficiency, particularly in malaria-endemic countries.","Kuupiel, Desmond; Adu, Kwame M.; Bawontuo, Vitalis; Adogboba, Duncan A.; Drain, Paul K.; Moshabela, Mosa; Mashamba-Thompson, Tivani P.",Diagnostics (Basel),364,15

As there are few readily available animal models that accurately mimic human disease, it has been a challenge to ethically determine what optimum treatment strategies can be used for this disease. We used in-vitro and human ex-vivo explant cultures to investigate the effect of two immunomodulatory agents, interferon alpha and cyclosporine, singly and in combination, on MERS-CoV replication. In both culture systems the combined treatment was more effective than either agent used alone in reducing MERS-CoV replication. PCR SuperArray analysis showed that the reduction of virus replication was associated with a greater induction of interferon stimulated genes. As these therapeutic agents are already licensed for clinical use, it may be relevant to investigate their use for therapy of human MERS-CoV infection.","Li, H.S.; Kuok, Denise I.T.; Cheung, M.C.; Ng, Mandy M.T.; Ng, K.C.; Hui, Kenrie P.Y.; Peiris, J.S.Malik; Chan, Michael C.W.; Nicholls, John M.",Antiviral Res,364,21

The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic variability of SARS-CoV-2 in Jordan, with a special focus on the UK variant of concern. A total of 579 SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected in Jordan were subjected to maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Genetic lineage assignment was undertaken using the Pango system. Amino acid substitutions were investigated using the Protein Variation Effect Analyzer (PROVEAN) tool. A total of 19 different SARS-CoV-2 genetic lineages were detected, with the most frequent being the first Jordan lineage (B.1.1.312), first detected in August 2020 (n = 424, 73.2%). This was followed by the second Jordan lineage (B.1.36.10), first detected in September 2020 (n = 62, 10.7%), and the UK variant of concern (B.1.1.7; n = 36, 6.2%). In the spike gene region, the molecular signature for B.1.1.312 was the non-synonymous mutation A24432T resulting in a deleterious amino acid substitution (Q957L), while the molecular signature for B.1.36.10 was the synonymous mutation C22444T. Bayesian analysis revealed that the UK variant of concern (B.1.1.7) was introduced into Jordan in late November 2020 (mean estimate); four weeks earlier than its official reporting in the country. In Jordan, an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases due to B.1.1.7 lineage coincided with the new year 2021. The highest proportion of phylogenetic clustering was detected for the B.1.1.7 lineage. The amino acid substitution D614G in the spike glycoprotein was exclusively present in the country from July 2020 onwards. Two Jordanian lineages dominated infections in the country, with continuous introduction/emergence of new lineages. In Jordan, the rapid spread of the UK variant of concern should be monitored closely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 mutants appeared to be related to the founder effect; nevertheless, the biological impact of certain mutations should be further investigated.","Sallam, Malik; Mahafzah, Azmi",Pathogens,364,16

It played an important role in the beginning to identify all contacts and minimise the spread of the infection. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was carried out of contact tracing records during the one-month period, starting from the onset of the first lockdown in India. The largest wave of 372 contacts was analysed in detail to find out the association between the result of COVID-19 test and various factors (age, gender, type of contact). RESULTS: A total of 372 contacts (214 males and 158 females) were traced and around 21% contacts were tested positive on COVID-19 RT-PCR test. Chi-square test didn't find the significant difference between COVID-19 test result and proportions of male and female contacts, χ2 (1) 0.033, p = 0.855. Female positive contacts had lower mean age compared to male positive contacts, though not statistically significant, t (75) = - 1.809, p = 0.0745. No difference was found in either median or mean age of contacts with respect to COVID-19 test result. Odds of tested COVID-19 positive among household contacts much higher than community contacts, OR = 24.52, 95% CI 12.45–48.29, p < 0.05. CONCLUSION: No difference was noted in the rate of contracting infection with respect to age and gender of contacts.

In 2019, governments in Canada and globally were poised to take legislative action to curb the use of single‐use plastics, with strong public support. However, the COVID‐19 pandemic has since disrupted those initiatives as well as the public sentiment underlying them. The aim of our study is to measure changes in Canadian consumers’ attitudes toward single‐use plastic food packaging, from Summer 2019 to Summer 2020. The methodology relies on two, representative surveys of the Canadian population, carried out in May 2019 (n = 1,094) and in June 2020 (n = 977). Our measures explored potential impacts on consumer perceptions, driven both by new food safety concerns during the pandemic and also by increased price consciousness during a time of economic recession. We found that 55% of respondents were more concerned about food safety since COVID‐19, and that 50% of respondents had become more price conscious when buying groceries. However, we found only a slight decline in motivation to reduce plastics – though with a sharper reduction among males. A stronger shift was seen in attitudes towards policy, where our results show a clear decline in support for tighter regulations or bans on single‐use plastics, along with an increase in consumers’ willingness to pay for biodegradable alternatives. These findings suggest a more difficult road ahead for legislative approaches, but also potential opportunities for market‐based strategies and innovations in the food sector.","Kitz, Robert; Walker, Tony; Charlebois, Sylvain; Music, Janet",Int J Consum Stud,364,20

It remains unclear whether Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), a population with existing inequalities in COVID-19 infection and mortality, are willing to get the vaccine, and the factors associated with vaccine willingness. Given this imperative, we used data from a national, cross-sectional, community-based survey called COVID-19 Effects on the Mental and Physical Health of AAPI Survey Study (COMPASS), an ongoing survey study that is available in English and Asian languages (i.e., Simplified or Traditional Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese) to examine vaccine willingness among AAPI.

In this mixed-methods study we examine changes in older adults’ loneliness due to social distancing, explore variability in perceptions, and identify whether such changes differ by rurality. METHODS: A Midwestern sample of 76 older adults aged 70–97 (mean age = 82; 74% female; 95% White; 39% rural) completed a phone interview about their experiences with social distancing due to COVID-19. Interviews were conducted during early weeks of regional social distancing. Participants completed retrospective and current assessments of loneliness, including providing explanations of their responses. RESULTS: On average, loneliness increased during early social distancing, yet variability was evident. Those experiencing increased loneliness described a feeling of loss or lack of control, whereas those experiencing stability in loneliness identified adaptability in social connection modes or feeling accustomed to social isolation. Rural older adults experienced a significantly smaller increase in loneliness than their nonrural counterparts. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest nuanced experiences among older adults, but generally negative implications for loneliness.

The fear of painful needles is one of the primary reasons most people avoid getting vaccinated. Therefore, developing an alternative pain-free method of vaccination using microneedles has been a significant research area. Microneedles comprise arrays of micron-sized needles that offer a pain-free method of delivering actives across the skin. Apart from being pain-free, microneedles provide various advantages over conventional vaccination routes such as intramuscular and subcutaneous. Microneedle vaccines induce a robust immune response as the needles ranging from 50 to 900 μm in length can efficiently deliver the vaccine to the epidermis and the dermis region, which contains many Langerhans and dendritic cells. The microneedle array looks like band-aid patches and offers the advantages of avoiding cold-chain storage and self-administration flexibility. The slow release of vaccine antigens is an important advantage of using microneedles. The vaccine antigens in the microneedles can be in solution or suspension form, encapsulated in nano or microparticles, and nucleic acid-based. The use of microneedles to deliver particle-based vaccines is gaining importance because of the combined advantages of particulate vaccine and pain-free immunization. The future of microneedle-based vaccines looks promising however, addressing some limitations such as dosing inadequacy, stability and sterility will lead to successful use of microneedles for vaccine delivery. This review illustrates the recent research in the field of microneedle-based vaccination.","Menon, Ipshita; Bagwe, Priyal; Gomes, Keegan Braz; Bajaj, Lotika; Gala, Rikhav; Uddin, Mohammad N.; D’Souza, Martin J.; Zughaier, Susu M.",Micromachines (Basel),364,16

Therefore, reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR) was used to detect viral RNA in respiratory secretions. A single‐tube nested RT‐PCR that used primers from a conserved F gene sequence was developed using a “hanging droplet” to physically separate outer and inner primer pairs during the first round of the PCR reaction. This was accomplished by placing the inner primers in a 5 μL droplet on the underside on the reaction tube cap and mixing after the first round of PCR. As few as 0.05 pfu of virus could be detected and gave positive results with RSV strains that represented the major groups and subgroups of RSV grown in tissue culture. The nested PCR was ∼100‐fold more sensitive than standard single primer PCR reactions and equivalent to standard two‐tube nested PCR. Viral RNA was detected in nasopharyngeal samples from 12 of 15 culture positive illnesses and in 5 of 17 culture‐negative, seropositive illnesses despite specimen volumes less than 1 μL in some samples. The method was also positive in 14 of 25 elderly volunteers inoculated with a live attenuated RSV vaccine candidate, only one of whom was culture positive. Use of a nested RT‐PCR significantly improves the ability to detect RSV in respiratory samples and should improve the ability to rapidly diagnose RSV infection in adults, especially in the elderly.

The global data of COVID-19 showed that men have a higher mortality rate than women. We further observed that the proportion of mortality of female increases starting from around the age of 55 significantly. Thus, sex is an essential factor associated with COVID-19 mortality, and sex related genetic factors could be interesting mechanisms and targets for COVID-19 treatment. However, the associated sex factors and signaling pathways remain unclear. Here, we propose to uncover the potential sex associated factors using systematic and integrative network analysis. The unique results indicated that estrogen hormones (ER), e.g., estrone and estriol, 1) interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, 2) can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 caused inflammation and immune response signaling in host cells; and 3) estrogen hormone is associated with the distinct fatality rates between male and female COVID-19 patients. Specifically, a high level of estradiol protecting young female COVID-19 patients, and estrogen loss to an extremely low level in females after about 55 years of age causing the increased fatality rate of women. In conclusion, estrogen hormone, interacting with ESR1/2 receptors, is an essential sex factor that protects COVID-19 patients by inhibiting inflammation and immune response caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Medications perturb the down-stream of ESR1/ESR2 to inhibit the inflammation and immune response can be effective or synergistic combined with other existing drugs for COVID-19 treatment.","Li, Fuhai; Boon, Adrianus C.M.; Michelson, Andrew P.; Foraker, Randi E.; Zhan, Ming; Payne, Philip R.O.",Res Sq,364,1

Moreover, zinc may also prevent viral entry, suppress viral replication, and mitigate the damages due to oxidative stress and hyperinflammatory reaction in patients with respiratory infections. Hinokitiol (β-thujaplicin) is a natural monoterpenoid and is considered as a safe zinc ionophore to help zinc transport into cells. It has been widely used in skin and oral care, and therapeutic products for its potent antiviral, antimicrobial, antifungal, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer applications.

There is an urgent need for the development of inexpensive, safe, and effective therapeutics to prevent and treat these viral infections. Considering that hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), the most studied zinc ionophore drug for COVID-19, is linked to potentially serious side effects, we propose the implementation of hinokitiol as a zinc ionophore and anti-infective agent for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 and other viral infections.","Hoang, Ba X.; Han, Bo",Med Hypotheses,364,1

Providing at least 30 min for lunch periods and providing recess before lunch were reported by less than half of schools. About 50% of schools reported using only one or fewer meal promotional strategies (such as taste tests) throughout the school year. Use of more promotional strategies was associated with less reported food waste in a multivariable regression model accounting for school demographic characteristics.
