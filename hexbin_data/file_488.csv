This study aimed to conduct a systematic review by collecting and reviewing all the published knowledge about the epidemiology of RSV in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Therefore, we systematically searched four databases; Embase, Medline, Scopus, and Cochrane databases from 2001 to 2019 to collect all the information related to the RSV prevalence, genotype distribution, and seasonality in children in MENA region. Our search strategy identified 598 studies, of which 83 met our inclusion criteria, which cover the past 19 years (2000–2019). Odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated to measure the association between RSV prevalence, gender, and age distribution. An overall prevalence of 24.4% (n = 17,106/69,981) of respiratory infections was recorded for RSV. The highest RSV prevalence was reported in Jordan (64%, during 2006–2007) and Israel (56%, 2005–2006). RSV A subgroup was more prevalent (62.9%; OR = 2.9, 95%CI = 2.64–3.13) than RSV B. RSV was most prevalent in children who were less than 12 months old (68.6%; OR = 4.7, 95%CI = 2.6–8.6) and was higher in males (59.6%; OR = 2.17, 95%CI = 1.2–3.8) than in female infants. Finally, the highest prevalence was recorded during winter seasons in all countries, except for Pakistan. RSV prevalence in the MENA region is comparable with the global one (24.4% vs. 22%). This first comprehensive report about RSV prevalence in the MENA region and our data should be important to guide vaccine introduction decisions and future evaluation.","Yassine, Hadi M.; Sohail, Muhammad U.; Younes, Nadin; Nasrallah, Gheyath K.",Microorganisms,488,1

Triage via telemedicine could deter unnecessary ED transfers. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention for emergency triage in an independent living community. METHODS: In the intervention community, a 950-resident independent senior living community, when a resident called for help, emergency medical technician–trained staff could engage an emergency medicine physician via telemedicine to assist with management and triage. We compared trends in the proportion of calls resulting in transport to the ED (ie, primary outcome) in the intervention community to two control communities. Secondary outcomes were telemedicine use and posttransport disposition. Semistructured focus groups of residents and staff were conducted to examine attitudes toward the intervention. Qualitative data analysis used thematic analysis. RESULTS: Although the service was offered at no cost to residents, use was low and we found no evidence of fewer ED transfers. The key barrier to program use was resistance from frontline staff members, who did not view telemedicine triage as a valuable tool for emergency response, instead perceiving it as time-consuming and as undermining their independent judgment. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement of, and acceptance by, frontline providers is a key consideration in using telemedicine triage to reduce unnecessary ED transfers.","Carolan, Kelsi; Grabowski, David C; Mehrotra, Ateev; Hatfield, Laura A",J Med Internet Res,488,1

Metallo-β-lactamases genes have disseminated in hospitals and all parts of the world and became a public health concern. There is no inhibitor for New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 and other metallo-β-lactamases classes, so metallo-β-lactamases inhibitor drugs became an urgent need. In this study, multi-steps virtual screening was done over the NPASS database with 35,032 natural compounds. At first Captopril was extracted from 4EXS PDB code and use as a template for the first structural screening and 500 compounds obtained as hit compounds by molecular docking. Then the best ligand, i.e. NPC120633 was used as templet and 800 similar compounds were obtained. As a final point, ten compounds i.e. NPC171932, NPC100251, NPC18185, NPC98583, NPC112380, NPC471403, NPC471404, NPC472454, NPC473010 and NPC300657 had proper docking scores, and a 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation was performed for calculation binding free energy of each compound with New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase. Protein sequence alignment, 3D conformational alignment, pharmacophore modeling on all New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase variants and all types of metallo-β-lactamases were done. Quantum chemical perspective based on the fragment molecular orbital (FMO) method was performed to discover conserved and crucial residues in the catalytic activity of metallo-β-lactamases. These residues had similar 3D coordinates of spatial location in the 3D conformational alignment. So it is posibble that all types of metallo-β-lactamases can inhibit by these ten compounds. Therefore, these compounds were proper to mostly inhibit all metallo-β-lactamases in experimental studies.","Salari-jazi, Azhar; Mahnam, Karim; Sadeghi, Parisa; Damavandi, Mohamad Sadegh; Faghri, Jamshid",Sci Rep,488,1

However, the potential roles of sarcinae as commensals or pathogens remain unclear. Here, we investigate a lethal disease of unknown etiology that affects sanctuary chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Sierra Leone. The disease, which we have named “epizootic neurologic and gastroenteric syndrome” (ENGS), is characterized by neurologic and gastrointestinal signs and results in death of the animals, even after medical treatment. Using a case-control study design, we show that ENGS is strongly associated with Sarcina infection. The microorganism is distinct from Sarcina ventriculi and other known members of its genus, based on bacterial morphology and growth characteristics. Whole-genome sequencing confirms this distinction and reveals the presence of genetic features that may account for the unusual virulence of the bacterium. Therefore, we propose that this organism be considered the representative of a new species, named “Candidatus Sarcina troglodytae”. Our results suggest that a heretofore unrecognized complex of related sarcinae likely exists, some of which may be highly virulent. However, the potential role of “Ca. S. troglodytae” in the etiology of ENGS, alone or in combination with other factors, remains a topic for future research.","Owens, Leah A.; Colitti, Barbara; Hirji, Ismail; Pizarro, Andrea; Jaffe, Jenny E.; Moittié, Sophie; Bishop-Lilly, Kimberly A.; Estrella, Luis A.; Voegtly, Logan J.; Kuhn, Jens H.; Suen, Garret; Deblois, Courtney L.; Dunn, Christopher D.; Juan-Sallés, Carles; Goldberg, Tony L.",Nat Commun,488,1

This study aimed to assess the relationship between carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and eosinophils in ABPA patients. We describes a case of a 50-year-old patient who was diagnosed with ABPA presenting with high level of CEA and eosinophils. Besides,we used immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence to identify eosinophils and CEA in sections which were obtained by Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial lung biopsy aspiration (EBUS-TBLB). The sections were then visualized using confocal microscopy. We also retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 37 ABPA patients between January 2013 and December 2019 in our hospital. We found the patient whose serum CEA levels were consistent with eosinophils during the follow-up (r = 0.929, P = 0.022). The positive expression of CEA and abnormal expression of eosinophils was higher in the ABPA tissue compared to the normal lung tissue. The co-localization was represented as pixels containing both red and green color in the image (with various shades of orange and yellow) which signified that eosinophils were immunohistochemically positive for CEA. Patients with higher levels of eosinophils had higher levels of CEA in the serum (P < 0.001). The results of Pearson correlation analysis showed that the levels of eosinophils were positively correlated with serum CEA levels (r = 0.459 and r = 0.506, P = 0.004 and P = 0.001). Serum CEA level is elevated in ABPA patients. The elevated serum CEA level was shown to be normalized after treatment. Increased CEA levels in ABPA patients may be positively correlated with eosinophil levels, and eosinophils may be served as CEA-secreting cells in patients with ABPA.","Yang, Yanfei; Gao, qiqi; Jin, Yangyi; Qi, Mengdie; Lu, Guohua; HequanLi",Sci Rep,488,7

In addition to secreted ligands, recent reports implicated release of small RNAs in regulating gene expression across tissue boundaries. Here, we show that the conserved poly-U specific endoribonuclease ENDU-2 in C. elegans is secreted from the soma and taken-up by the germline to ensure germline immortality at elevated temperature. ENDU-2 binds to mature mRNAs and negatively regulates mRNA abundance both in the soma and the germline. While ENDU-2 promotes RNA decay in the soma directly via its endoribonuclease activity, ENDU-2 prevents misexpression of soma-specific genes in the germline and preserves germline immortality independent of its RNA-cleavage activity. In summary, our results suggest that the secreted RNase ENDU-2 regulates gene expression across tissue boundaries in response to temperature alterations and contributes to maintenance of stem cell immortality, probably via retaining a stem cell specific program of gene expression.","Qi, Wenjing; Gromoff, Erika D.

Among the other approaches, a vaccine targeting the adhesion proteins of M. gallisepticum would be a promising candidate in controlling the infection. Thus, the present study is aimed to design a multi-epitope vaccine candidate using cytoadhesion proteins of M. gallisepticum through an advanced immunoinformatics approach. As a result, the multi-epitope vaccine was constructed, which comprised potential T-cell and B-cell binding epitopes with appropriate adjuvants. The designed multi-epitope vaccine represented high antigenicity with viable physiochemical properties. The prospective three-dimensional structure of the epitope was predicted, refined, and validated. The molecular docking analysis of multi-epitope vaccine candidates with the chicken Toll-like receptor-5 predicted effective binding. Furthermore, codon optimization and in silico cloning ensured high expression. Thus, the present finding indicates that the engineered multi-epitope vaccine is structurally stable and can induce a strong immune response. Furthermore, the multi-epitope vaccine is suggested to be a suitable vaccine candidate for the M. gallisepticum infection due to its effective binding capacity and precise specificity.","Mugunthan, Susithra Priyadarshni; Harish, Mani Chandra",ACS Omega,488,1

The authors’ intention was to understand the state of the HI field in Saudi Arabia by exploring publication trends and their alignment with national goals. METHODS: A scoping review was performed to identify HI publications from Saudi Arabia in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. We analyzed publication trends based on topics, keywords, and how they align with the Ministry of Health's (MOH's) “digital health journey” framework. RESULTS: The total number of publications included was 242. We found 1 (0.4%) publication in 1995–1999, 11 (4.5%) publications in 2000–2009, and 230 (95.0%) publications in 2010–2019. We categorized publications into 3 main HI fields and 4 subfields: 73.1% (n=177) of publications were in clinical informatics (85.1%, n=151 medical informatics; 5.6%, n=10 pharmacy informatics; 6.8%, n=12 nursing informatics; 2.3%, n=4 dental informatics); 22.3% (n=54) were in consumer health informatics; and 4.5% (n=11) were in public health informatics. The most common keyword was “medical informatics” (21.5%, n=52). MOH framework–based analysis showed that most publications were categorized as “digitally enabled care” and “digital health foundations.” CONCLUSIONS: The years of 2000–2009 may be seen as an infancy stage of the HI field in Saudi Arabia. Exploring how the Saudi Arabian MOH's e-Health initiatives may influence research is valuable for advancing the field.

To examine migratory birds as potential carriers of ESBL-producing E. coli and E. coli-carrying antibiotic resistance genes, 55 PCR-positive E. coli isolates were screened using the disk diffusion method, double-disk synergy test, and further polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Genes encoding resistance to tetracycline [tetA, 100% (35/35); tetB, 31.43% (11/35)], fluoroquinolone [qnrA, 35.71% (10/28); qnrB, 25% (7/28)], and streptomycin [aadA1, 90.24% (37/41)] were detected in the isolated E. coli. Of the 55 E. coli isolates, 21 (38.18%) were ESBL producers, and all of them were multidrug resistant. All the ESBL-producing E. coli isolates harbored at least two or more beta-lactamase genes, of which bla(TEM), bla(CMY), bla(CTX-M), and bla(SHV) were detected in 95.24%, 90.48%, 85.71%, and 42.86% of isolates, respectively.

In adults, ZIKV is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome. There are no approved antiviral therapies against either virus. Effective antiviral compounds are urgently needed. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) are a specific class of nitrogen-containing compounds produced by plants of the Amaryllidaceae family with numerous biological activities. Recently, the AA lycorine was shown to present strong antiflaviviral properties. Previously, we demonstrated that Crinum jagus contained lycorine and several alkaloids of the cherylline, crinine, and galanthamine types with unknown antiviral potential. In this study, we explored their biological activities. We show that C. jagus crude alkaloid extract inhibited DENV infection. Among the purified AAs, cherylline efficiently inhibited both DENV (50% effective concentration [EC(50)], 8.8 μM) and ZIKV replication (EC(50), 20.3 μM) but had no effect on HIV-1 infection. Time-of-drug-addition and -removal experiments identified a postentry step as the one targeted by cherylline. Consistently, using subgenomic replicons and replication-defective genomes, we demonstrate that cherylline specifically hinders the viral RNA synthesis step but not viral translation. In conclusion, AAs are an underestimated source of antiflavivirus compounds, including the effective inhibitor cherylline, which could be optimized for new therapeutic approaches.","Ka, Seydou; Merindol, Natacha; Sow, Aïssatou Aïcha; Singh, Amita; Landelouci, Karima; Plourde, Mélodie B.; Pépin, Geneviève; Masi, Marco; Di Lecce, Roberta; Evidente, Antonio; Seck, Matar; Berthoux, Lionel; Chatel-Chaix, Laurent; Desgagné-Penix, Isabel",,488,13

Its genome encodes a polyprotein that can be further processed into structural and non-structural proteins. ZIKV protease is an important target for antiviral development due to its role in cleaving the polyprotein to release functional viral proteins. The viral protease is a two-component protein complex formed by NS2B and NS3. Structural studies using different approaches demonstrate that conformational changes exist in the protease. The structures and dynamics of this protease in the absence and presence of inhibitors were explored to provide insights into the inhibitor design. The dynamic nature of residues binding to the enzyme cleavage site might be important for the function of the protease. Due to the charges at the protease cleavage site, it is challenging to develop small-molecule compounds acting as substrate competitors. Developing small-molecule compounds to inhibit protease activity through an allosteric mechanism is a feasible strategy because conformational changes are observed in the protease. Herein, structures and dynamics of ZIKV protease are summarized. The conformational changes of ZIKV protease and other proteases in the same family are discussed. The progress in developing allosteric inhibitors is also described. Understanding the structures and dynamics of the proteases are important for designing potent inhibitors.","Li, Qingxin; Kang, Congbao",Biomedicines,488,1

WNN adopts the network structure of BPNN in order to get faster training speed. WNN adopts the wavelet function as an activation function, whose form is similar to the radial basis function of RBFNN, in order to solve the local minimum problem. Secondly, WNN-based Convolutional wavelet neural network (CWNN) method is proposed, in which the fully connected layers (FCL) of CNN is replaced by WNN.

This study aimed to explore the urban–rural differences in patterns and associated factors of multimorbidity in China and to provide scientific reference for the development of health management strategies to reduce health inequality between urban and rural areas. Methods: A cross-sectional study, which used a multi-stage random sampling method, was conducted effectively among 3,250 participants in the Shanxi province of China. The chi-square test was used to compare the prevalence of chronic diseases among older adults with different demographic characteristics. The Apriori algorithm and multinomial logistic regression were used to explore the patterns and associated factors of multimorbidity among older adults, respectively. Results: The findings showed that 30.3% of older adults reported multimorbidity, with significantly higher proportions in rural areas. Among urban older adults, 10 binary chronic disease combinations with strong association strength were obtained. In addition, 11 binary chronic disease combinations and three ternary chronic disease combinations with strong association strength were obtained among rural older adults. In rural and urban areas, there is a large gap in patterns and factors associated with multimorbidity. Conclusions: Multimorbidity was prevalent among older adults, which patterns mainly consisted of two or three chronic diseases. The patterns and associated factors of multimorbidity varied from urban to rural regions.

Multiple studies have been performed with the intent to determine the optimal strategy to combat, and ultimately prevent, trauma induced coagulopathy. This chapter discusses the risks and benefits of resuscitation protocols utilizing plasma. Plasma is the aqueous portion of blood that contains coagulation factors, fibrinolytic proteins, albumin, immunoglobulins, and up to 6000 other proteins. Multiple methods of collection and storage have been developed, each one affecting the plasma and its proteins differently. Once collected, plasma can be frozen for storage. If frozen within 8 h, the product is labelled as fresh frozen plasma (FFP). If frozen more than 6 h, but less than 24 h, it is labelled as plasma frozen within 24 h (FP24). When FFP and FP24 are mobilized from the blood bank, they are thawed in a water bath to create thawed plasma (TP) which can be stored in liquid form for up to 4 days prior to transfusion. Liquid plasma (LQP) is derived from whole blood and is never frozen. It can be stored for up to 30 days by some reports prior to transfusion. Each of these forms of plasma has been extensively studied for efficacy of coagulation and are all useful in the resuscitation of a traumatically injured patient. There is much more than coagulation factors in plasma that are useful to patients. Studies looking at the endotheliopathy associated with hemorrhagic shock have shown a decrease in the inflammatory response, promotion of endothelial repair, and decreased edema. Transfusion protocols utilizing plasma at the time of presentation have shown a decrease in the amount of blood products transfused, as well as an improvement in mortality. Transfusion ratios of platelets–red blood cells–plasma units in a 1:1:1 ratio have shown a significant improvement in mortality at 3 h post-admission over 1:1:2. There has not been an increase in the incidence of adverse events with the increase usage of plasma. The early administration of plasma to the massively hemorrhaging traumatically injured patient improves mortality, decreases total blood product usage, and promotes the resolution of trauma induced endotheliopathy without increasing adverse events.","Lawless, Ryan A.; Holcomb, John B.",Trauma Induced Coagulopathy,488,14

Smartphones enable collection of voice signal on a daily basis, and thus, the amount of data available for analysis is quickly growing. At the same time, even though the collected data are crisp, there is a lot of imprecision related to the extraction of acoustic features, as well as to the assessment of patients’ mental state. In this paper, we address this problem and perform an advanced approach to feature selection. We start from the recursive feature elimination, then two alternative approaches to clustering (fuzzy clustering and self organizing maps) are performed. Finally, taking advantage of the partially assumed labels about the state of a patient derived from psychiatric assessments, we calculate the degree of agreement between clusters and labels aiming at selection of most adequate subset of acoustic parameters. The proposed method is preliminary validated on the real-life data gathered from smartphones of bipolar disorder patients.","Kamińska, Olga; Kaczmarek-Majer, Katarzyna; Hryniewicz, Olgierd",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,488,24

However, little evidence has shown that DRL can be successfully applied to real-life human-centric tasks such as education or healthcare. Different from classic game-playing where the RL goal is to make an agent smart, in human-centric tasks the ultimate RL goal is to make the human-agent interactions productive and fruitful. Additionally, in many real-life human-centric tasks, data can be noisy and limited. As a sub-field of RL, batch RL is designed for handling situations where data is limited yet noisy, and building simulations is challenging. In two consecutive classroom studies, we investigated applying batch DRL to the task of pedagogical policy induction for an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS), and empirically evaluated the effectiveness of induced pedagogical policies. In Fall 2018 (F18), the DRL policy is compared against an expert-designed baseline policy and in Spring 2019 (S19), we examined the impact of explaining the batch DRL-induced policy with student decisions and the expert baseline policy. Our results showed that 1) while no significant difference was found between the batch RL-induced policy and the expert policy in F18, the batch RL-induced policy with simple explanations significantly improved students’ learning performance more than the expert policy alone in S19; and 2) no significant differences were found between the student decision making and the expert policy. Overall, our results suggest that pairing simple explanations with induced RL policies can be an important and effective technique for applying RL to real-life human-centric tasks.","Sanz Ausin, Markel; Maniktala, Mehak; Barnes, Tiffany; Chi, Min",Artificial Intelligence in Education,488,24

Particularly at risk are developing countries whose health systems may be less well equipped to detect quickly and respond effectively to the importation of new infectious diseases. This chapter examines what might have been the economic consequences if the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic had been imported to a small Asia-Pacific country. Hypothetical outbreaks in two countries were modelled. The post-importation estimations were carried out with two linked models: a stochastic disease transmission (SEIR) model and a quarterly version of the multi-country GTAP model, GTAP-Q. The SEIR model provided daily estimates of the number of persons in various disease states. For each intervention strategy the stochastic disease model was run 500 times to obtain the probability distribution of disease outcomes. Typical daily country outcomes for both controlled and uncontrolled outbreaks under five alternative intervention strategies were converted to quarterly disease-state results, which in turn were used in the estimation of GTAP-Q shocks to country-specific health costs and labour productivity during the outbreak, and permanent reductions in each country’s population and labour force due to mortality. Estimated behavioural consequences (severe reductions in international tourism and crowd avoidance) formed further shocks. The GTAP-Q simulations revealed very large economic costs for each country if they experienced an uncontrolled Ebola outbreak, and considerable economic costs for controlled outbreaks in Fiji due to the importance of the tourism sector to its economy. A major finding was that purely reactive strategies had virtually no effect on preventing uncontrolled outbreaks, but pre-emptive strategies substantially reduced the proportion of uncontrolled outbreaks, and in turn the economic and social costs.","Geard, Nicholas; Giesecke, James A.; Madden, John R.; McBryde, Emma S.; Moss, Robert; Tran, Nhi H.",Environmental Economics and Computable General Equilibrium Analysis,488,24

This was followed by a decrease in overall spending of 25%–30% during the second half of March coinciding with the disease spreading, with only food delivery and grocery spending as major exceptions to the decline. Spending responded most strongly in states with active shelter-in-place orders, though individuals in all states had sizable responses.

During the Trump era, U.S–China relations have become definitively more competitive, and the U.S. is disillusioned with China’s internal development. Consequently, the ideological factor becomes more pronounced in the bilateral relationship, and a certain degree of ideological competition may be inevitable. But this is and will likely remain limited in scope and intensity because neither side is bent on an ideological crusade or a Cold War-style ideological conflict. The current situation may best be characterized as a “security dilemma” in the ideological domain. It does not have to lead to the worst possible outcome that neither desires, but preventing such an outcome requires better understanding of each other’s intentions, increased appreciation for the impact of one’s own actions on the other’s insecurity, refraining from utilizing ideology for domestic mobilization, and prioritizing putting one’s own house in order.","Jie, Dalei",China Int Strategy Rev.,488,1

This paper selects Guangdong Province, China, for a case study. It utilizes big data on population migration and the geospatial analysis technique to develop a model to achieve spatiotemporal analysis of COVID-19 risk. The model takes into consideration the risk differential between the source cities of population migration as well as the heterogeneity in the socioeconomic characteristics of the destination cities of population migration. It further incorporates a time-lag process based on the time distribution of the onset of the imported cases. In theory, the model will be able to predict the evolutional trend and spatial distribution of the COVID-19 risk for a certain time period in the future and provide support for advanced planning and targeted prevention measures. The research findings indicate the following: (1) The COVID-19 epidemic in Guangdong Province reached a turning point on January 29, 2020, after which it showed a gradual decreasing trend. (2) Based on the time-lag analysis of the onset of the imported cases, it is common for a time interval to exist between case importation and illness onset, and the proportion of the cases with an interval of 1–14 days is relatively high. (3) There is evident spatial heterogeneity in the epidemic risk; the risk varies significantly between different areas based on their imported risk, susceptibility risk, and ability to prevent the spread. (4) The degree of connectedness and the scale of population migration between Guangdong’s prefecture-level cities and their counterparts in the source regions of the epidemic, as well as the transportation and location factors of the cities in Guangdong, have a significant impact on the risk classification of the cities in Guangdong. The first-tier cities — Shenzhen and Guangzhou — are high-risk regions. The cities in the Pearl River Delta that are adjacent to Shenzhen and Guangzhou, including Dongguan, Foshan, Huizhou, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, are medium-risk cities. The eastern, northern, and western parts of Guangdong, which are outside of the metropolitan areas of the Pearl River Delta, are considered to have low risks. Therefore, the government should develop prevention and control measures that are specific to different regions based on their risk classification to enable targeted prevention and ensure the smooth operation of society.","Ye, Yuyao; Wang, Changjian; Zhang, Hong’ou; Yang, Ji; Liu, Zhengqian; Wu, Kangmin; Deng, Yingbin",J,488,1

Consequently, the lost livelihood, clogged income stream, exhausted savings, burden of debt have imbued psychological distress among them. This study has analyzed the association of social distancing and lockdown constraints to psychological outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety issues, financial stress, lack of social support, and loneliness) among transgender people amid COVID-19. Transgender participants (N = 150, mean age = 42.5) were selected through snowball sampling from India who responded to the questionnaire through both online platform and offline modes. Findings show that there is positive association between any two of the variables and the degree of association is quite reasonable with the range from 0.534 to 0.945. Further, in order to evaluate the hypothesis a series of regression analysis is conducted. Results highlight the negative impact of social distancing and lockdown constraints on psychology of transgender individuals.","Priyadarshini, Sugyanta; Swain, Sukanta Chandra",J,488,16

Is there evidence that the unprecedented federal government response to help small businesses—the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and the related COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL)—which had a stated goal of helping disadvantaged groups, was disbursed evenly to minority communities? In this descriptive research note, we provide the first detailed analysis of how the 2020 PPP and EIDL funds were disbursed across minority communities in the country. From our analysis of data on the universe of loans from these programs and administrative data on employer firms, we generally find a slightly positive relationship between PPP loan receipt per business and the minority share of the population or businesses, although funds flowed to minority communities later than to communities with lower minority shares. PPP loan amounts per employee, however, are negatively related to the minority share of the population. The EIDL program, in contrast, both in numbers per business and amounts per employee, was distributed positively to minority communities.","Fairlie, Robert; Fossen, Frank M.",Small Bus Econ,488,22

The goal of this commentary is to leverage collaborations between universities to complement online learning offered by the parent university (university where student is registered for a degree) with the face to face learning offered by the collaborative university (university with low spatial proximity to the student’s home where he or she enrolls as exchange student). This helps the student to enhance the value of education in a blended mode (i.e., a mix of online and face to face learning) thereby reducing the psychological distance from online education. The collaboration has several implementation issues, but they could be overcome through active government support at an international level and the establishment of common academic frameworks to assist greater understanding between universities globally, improved flexibility of decision-making at university level and joint recognition of online learning. Long-term collaborations as a “new-normal” practice will be beneficial to transform the educational world into truly virtual single entities.

Data was gathered under following parameters: 1-Number of hospital visits, 2-Number of fracture clinic appointments, 3-Number of admissions and 4- Time to definite management. Simple data analysis was done to calculate means of all the parameters. The average time to definite Management for distal radius fractures dropped from 2.78 to 0.86 days. For the same cases a dip in number of hospital visits was noted, from 2.72 to 2.09. Mean admissions for these patients dropped from 0.12 to 0.09. The results quiet evidently show that early orthopaedic input reduced hospital visits, hospital admissions and time to definite management for distal radius fracture cases.

OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether morphological or skill-related factors measured in the pre-season could predict injuries sustained in-season. METHOD: In our cohort study, 77 under-18 (U18), U19, U21 and senior elite netball players underwent pre-season testing including anthropometry, balance, flexibility, explosive power, upper and lower body strength, core strength, speed and agility testing. A questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, elite-level experience and injury history. Injuries in pre-season, training and matches were recorded during the subsequent 2017–2018 season using an injury profile sheet. RESULTS: Amongst the 77 players who underwent pre-season fitness tests, 33 players (42.9%) had at least one injury. Regarding player morphology, a significant association of body mass and body fat percentage with injury risk was found in a simple logistic regression. In a multiple logistic regression analysis, only fat percentage (p = 0.0508) remained a significant predictor of injury at the 10% significance level, with higher fat percentage being associated with lower injury risk. CONCLUSION: Heavier players and players with a higher fat percentage had a decreased injury risk. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As a result of the apparent protective effect of heavier weight of players, referees should more strictly enforce the no-contact rule in netball. Further research on functional movement screening as a tool for potential prediction of injury in netball is recommended.","Sinclair, Colleen J.; Coetzee, Frederik F.; Schall, Robert",S Afr J Physiother,488,24

The students were asked to complete a weekly online survey to evaluate their learning, the practitioner’s teaching, and the platform. Results revealed that ICLHE may not work well in a distance learning situation due to decreasing motivation, greater distraction, lack of actual interaction, peer pressure, teacher monitoring, and practitioner’s fatigue.

Accordingly, health benefits could partly depend on the effect of such interventions that influence the biodiversity and functionality of intestinal microbiota. In the present review, we first discuss the physiological effects of aging on the gut microbiota, immune system, and skeletal muscle. Secondly, we describe human epidemiological evidence about the associations between physical activity and fitness and the gut microbiota composition in older adults. The third part highlights the relevance and restorative mechanisms of immune protection through physical activity and specific exercise interventions during aging. Fourth, we present important research findings on the effects of exercise and protein as well as other nutrients on skeletal muscle performance in older adults. Finally, we provide nutritional recommendations to prevent malnutrition and support healthy active aging with a focus on gut microbiota. Key nutrition-related concerns include the need for adequate energy and protein intake for preventing low muscle mass and a higher demand for specific nutrients (e.g., dietary fiber, polyphenols and polyunsaturated fatty acids) that can modify the composition, diversity, and metabolic capacity of the gut microbiota, and may thus provide a practical means of enhancing gut and systemic immune function.","Strasser, Barbara; Wolters, Maike; Weyh, Christopher; Krüger, Karsten; Ticinesi, Andrea",Nutrients,488,20

This article is about reconceptualizing and reconfiguring employment-based parental leave policies in Canada both during and after COVID-19. Informed by theoretical insights from the fields of care economies, feminist political economy, and care and social reproduction and by national and international parental leave research, we argue that it is time to reconceptualize parental leave benefits not only as employment policy but also as a care and social protection policy. To make this shift, we explore three topic areas: a mixed system of parental benefits that combine employment-based and citizenship-based entitlements, connections between policy design and gender equality, and the need for robust intersectional data to track which Canadian families are receiving parental benefits.","Doucet, Andrea; Mathieu, Sophie; McKay, Lindsey",,488,24

Despite significant progress since the emergence of this disease, efficacious therapeutics are still urgently required. Infection is associated with a broad spectrum of symptoms and varying disease severity. In severe cases, a multi‐organ disease is apparent, involving the respiratory, coagulation, immune and cardiac systems. A central tenant of severe disease is an excessive immune response to infection leading to a cytokine storm and associated organ and tissue damage. Immunological therapies capable of attenuating the cytokine storm may therefore provide novel treatment options, and the present study explored whether mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the amniotic fluid (AF) and their derivatives, through their immunomodulatory, anti‐oxidant, and regenerative functions, could provide such an option. Next Generation Sequencing analysis of MSCs isolated from human AF identified a plethora of molecules with the potential to positively influence the prognosis in SARS‐Cov‐2 infection patients. These included mRNAs involved in the regulation of several immune pathways that are basis of the impaired immune response and cytokine storm caused seen in SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive patients, such as: HIF‐1, IL‐17, Toll‐like receptors, RAP1, TNF, WNT, PI3K‐Akt and NF‐kappa B signalling. AF‐MSCs also contained bioactive molecules involved in respiratory endothelial protection and repair, such as VEGF, IL‐1, TGF‐β1, EGFR, in extracellular matrix re‐organization or associated with cardiac muscle cell function. Analysis of non‐coding RNAs identified the presence of microRNAs that regulate macrophage polarization (towards an anti‐inflammatory phenotype) and attenuate inflammation, as well as regulate the host response to viral infection. Among those, exosomal miRNAs have been also identified. Building upon these observations, further efforts will be made to elucidate the potential therapeutic use of AF‐MSCs and their derivatives in combating the immune‐related side effects of SARS‐CoV‐2. The successful incorporation of such an MSC‐based therapy into the treatment regimen of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients has significant potential to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID‐19.","Vaiasicca, Salvatore; Corradetti, Bruna",FASEB J,488,1

Identifying new non-invasive biomarkers for SS diagnosis remains a challenge, and alterations in saliva composition reported in patients turn this fluid into a source of potential biomarkers. Among these, proteases are promising candidates since they are involved in several key physio-pathological processes. This study evaluated differentially expressed proteases in SS individuals’ saliva using synthetic fluorogenic substrates, zymography, ELISA, and proteomic approaches. Here we reported, for the first time, increased activity of the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase-4/CD26 (DPP4/CD26) in pSS saliva, the expression level of which was corroborated by ELISA assay. Gelatin zymograms showed that metalloproteinase proteolytic band profiles differed significantly in intensity between control and SS groups. Focusing on matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression, an increased tendency in pSS saliva (p = 0.0527) was observed compared to the control group. Samples of control, pSS, and sSS were analyzed by mass spectrometry to reveal a general panorama of proteases in saliva. Forty-eight protein groups of proteases were identified, among which were the serine proteases cathepsin G (CTSG), neutrophil elastase (ELANE), myeloblastin (PRTN3), MMP9 and several protease inhibitors. This work paves the way for proteases to be explored in the future as biomarkers, emphasizing DPP4 by its association in several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Stress scale was associated to specific coping strategies and was higher for women, patients in first IVF treatment, had compromised income and younger than 38yo. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: In March 2020, due to the COVID–19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV–2 virus, human reproduction societies, have recommended discontinuation of reproductive care, except for the most urgent cases. After few months, the treatments were resumed following proper safety guidelines. Infertility diagnostic and treatments are severe stressors, causing anxiety, depression and general emotional distress. The disruption of treatments and the pandemic uncertain scenario in all life aspects, certainly have a great impact on mental health of ART patients. There is an urge need to assess the level of stress and coping strategies in this population to offer suitable support and care. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Prospective, Brazilian multicentric study (6 clinics of ART located in São Paulo, Campinas, Belo Horizonte and Brasilia), with the application of an anonymous online survey of stress scale and 14 coping strategies to 1500 patients (male and female) that had their treatments interrupted or unable to start during the months of March, April and May 2020. The online survey was sent during the months of August/September and responses were collected until early October/2020. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The stress scale level was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale protocol (PSS), and coping strategies using the Brief COPE scale protocol. Social-demographic variables (gender, age, city of residence, marital status, time of infertility, previous IVF treatments and financial impact) were included in the survey. Marginal statistical analyses were performed accordingly (t test, Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, chi-square test) and a linear regression model was carried out to calculate the effect of COPE strategies on stress scale. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Survey’s response rate was 44.4% (n = 666). The majority were women (83.3%), married (93.2%, mean of 9,41±4,76 years), deal with infertility for 2–5 years (51.5%), had done a previous IVF treatment (61.4%, mean of 2,33 treatments) and had a work activity (83.9%). Almost 40% had their income compromised by the pandemic. Mean age was 38.47±4.99 years (≥38 yo = 59%). Stress scale was higher for women (p < 0.0001), patients that were in their first IVF treatment (p = 0.011), had their income compromised (p = 0.001) and were younger than 38yo (p < 0.0001). The most frequent coping strategies (score 5–8) were planning (87.7%), active coping (83%), positive reframing (72.1%) and religion (71.7%). Women used more emotional support, religion, venting (all p < 0.0001) and self-distraction (p = 0.002) as coping strategies than men. Younger patients (<38yo) reported more use of substances (p = 0.002) and self-distraction (p = 0.001) than older patients. Lower income was associated with denial (p = 0.002) and less use of religion (p < 0.0001) and patients that were about to start their 1st treatment used more venting (p < 0.0001) and denial (p = 0.003) than recurrent patients. The linear regression analysis showed that higher stress was associated to planning, religion, self-blame, venting, self-distraction and behavioral disengagement and lower stress scale to active coping, emotional support, positive reframing and acceptance. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This study was performed in Brazil, one of the most affected countries by the COVID–19 outbreak, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Another limitation was the impossibility to compare the stress scale and coping strategies findings in this population prior to the pandemic. Wider implications of the findings: Being a woman and have a compromised income were expected stressor factors. Surprisingly, first IVF attempt and younger patients showed higher stress scale and the use of psychological defense mechanisms, such as the use of substances, denial and self-distraction. Continuous emotional support should be offer for all ART patients.

These increases in local Na(+) levels boost proinflammatory and antimicrobial macrophage activity and can favor polarization of T cells towards a proinflammatory Th17 phenotype. Although neutrophils play an important role in fighting intruding invaders, the impact of increased Na(+) on the antimicrobial activity of neutrophils remains elusive. Here we show that, in neutrophils, increases in Na(+) (high salt, HS) impair the ability of human and murine neutrophils to eliminate Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. High salt caused reduced spontaneous movement, degranulation and impaired production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) while leaving neutrophil viability unchanged. High salt enhanced the activity of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38/MAPK) and increased the interleukin (IL)-8 release in a p38/MAPK-dependent manner. Whereas inhibition of p38/MAPK did not result in improved neutrophil defense, pharmacological blockade of the phagocyte oxidase (PHOX) or its genetic ablation mimicked the impaired antimicrobial activity detected under high salt conditions. Stimulation of neutrophils with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) overcame high salt-induced impairment in ROS production and restored antimicrobial activity of neutrophils. Hence, we conclude that high salt-impaired PHOX activity results in diminished antimicrobial activity.

Parallel to other studies, we used the new device for selected patients who were no optimal candidates for established techniques like neurosurgical clipping or endovascular coiling. We aimed to report the angiographic and clinical results of WEB implantations or combinations between WEB and coiling or intracranial stents. METHODS We reviewed the records of n = 23 interventions in 22 patients with unruptured wide-neck aneurysms (UIA) who were assigned for aneurysm treatment with the use of the WEB or adjunctive techniques. Interventional procedures and clinical and angiographic outcomes are reported for the periprocedural phase and in mid-term FU. RESULTS Of the included 22 patients, six patients needed additional coiling, intracranial stenting, or implantation of a flow diverter. WEB implantation was technically feasible in 22 out of the 23 interventions. Follow-up angiographic imaging proved total or subtotal occlusion of the aneurysm in 19 of 22 cases. Two minor recurrences remained stable during a period of 15 months. One patient with a partially thrombosed giant MCA aneurysm had a major recurrence and was retreated with a second WEB in combination with coiling. CONCLUSION Despite of unfavorable anatomic conditions, broad-based and large UIA endovascular treatment with the WEB and adjunctive techniques was feasible with a low risk of complications and promising occlusion rates in mid-term follow-up.","Lescher, Stephanie; du Mesnil de Rochemont, Richard; Berkefeld, Joachim",Neuroradiology,488,1

The current trends resulting from anthropocene defaunation suggest that in the future they, along with other small mammals, are likely to become the dominant mammals in almost all human-modified environments. Recent intricate studies on bat-borne emerging diseases have highlighted that many gaps exist in our understanding of the zoonotic transmission of rodent-borne pathogens. This has emphasized the need for scientists interested in rodent-borne diseases to integrate rodent ecology into their analysis of rodent-borne pathogen transmission in order to identify in more detail the mechanisms of spillover and chains of transmission. Further studies are required to better understand the true impact of rodent abundance and the importance of pathogen sharing and circulation in multi-host- multi-pathogen communities. We also need to explore in more depth the roles of generalist and abundant species as the potential links between pathogen-sharing, co-infections and disease transmission.","Bordes, Frédéric; Blasdell, Kim; Morand, Serge",Integrative zoology,488,1

OBJECTIVE To summarize clinical characteristics and outcomes among pregnant women hospitalized with COVID-19. SEARCH STRATEGY Relevant databases were searched up until May 29, 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA Case series/reports of hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS PRISMA guidelines were followed. Methodologic quality was assessed via NIH assessment tools. MAIN RESULTS Overall, 63 observational studies of 637 women (84.6% in third trimester) with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included. Most (76.5%) women experienced mild disease. Maternal fatality, stillbirth, and neonatal fatality rates were 1.6%, 1.4%, and 1.0%, respectively. Older age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and raised serum D-dimer and interleukin-6 were predictive of poor outcomes. Overall, 33.7% of live births were preterm, of which half were iatrogenic among women with mild COVID-19 and no complications. Most women underwent cesarean despite lacking a clear indication. Eight (2.0%) neonates had positive nasopharyngeal swabs after delivery and developed chest infection within 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS Advanced gestation, maternal age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and a combination of elevated D-dimer and interleukin-6 levels are predictive of poor pregnancy outcomes in COVID-19. The rate of iatrogenic preterm birth and cesarean delivery is high; vertical transmission may be possible but has not been proved.","Turan, Ozlem; Hakim, Amir; Dashraath, Pradip; Jeslyn, Wong Jing Lin; Wright, Alison; Abdul Kadir, Rezan",International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics,488,31

METHODS Eighty-five patients with 94 HCC with complete ablation judged on conventional side-by-side interpretation of pre-RFA and post-RFA CT at the time of RFA were included in this retrospective study. CT data was retrospectively used to create fusion images of pre-RFA and post-RFA CT using automatic rigid registration and manual correction referring to intrahepatic structures and hepatic contours around a tumor. Clinical factors including a minimal ablative margin (MAM) measured on fusion images were examined to prove risk factors for local tumor progression (LTP). RESULTS LTP was observed in 13 (13.8%) tumors with a median follow up of 21.0 months (range, 2-75). The mean MAM on the fusion image was 1.4 ± 3.1 mm and 23 tumors (24.5%) were judged to be protruding from the ablation zone. Multivariate analysis revealed that protruding from the ablation zone was the only significant factor for LTP (hazard ratio, 7.09; 95% confidential interval, 2.26-22.3; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Some HCC were assessed as incomplete ablation on the CT fusion images, although considered completely ablated on side-by-side images at the time of treatment, and incomplete ablation was revealed to be the only independent risk factor for LTP. The CT fusion imaging enables quantitative and accurate evaluation of treatment effect of RFA.","Makino, Yuki; Imai, Yasuharu; Igura, Takumi; Hori, Masatoshi; Fukuda, Kazuto; Sawai, Yoshiyuki; Kogita, Sachiyo; Ohama, Hideko; Matsumoto, Yasushi; Nakahara, Masanori; Zushi, Shinichiro; Kurokawa, Masanori; Isotani, Keisuke; Takamura, Manabu; Fujita, Norihiko; Murakami, Takamichi",Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,488,1

Females represent a unique subset of patients with PAD, who differ from males in important ways: they have smaller diameter vessels, undergo lower extremity bypass less frequently and experience higher rates of graft occlusion, amputation and mortality than males. Females also trend towards higher rates of major coronary events and cardiovascular mortality. Current guidelines recommend monoantiplatelet therapy (MAPT) for secondary prevention in patients with symptomatic PAD. However, indications for more intensive antithrombotic therapy in this cohort-especially among females who are frequently under-represented in randomised controlled trials (RCTs)-remain unclear. As newer antithrombotic therapies emerge, some RCTs have demonstrated differential effects in females versus males. A systematic review is needed to quantify the rates of arterial thromboembolic and bleeding events with different antithrombotic regimens in females with symptomatic PAD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will search MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials for published RCTs that include females with symptomatic PAD and compare full dose anticoagulation±antiplatelet therapy, dual pathway inhibition or dual antiplatelet therapy with MAPT. Title, abstract and full-text screening will be conducted in duplicate by three reviewers. Authors will be contacted to obtain sex-stratified outcomes as needed. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data will be extracted by independent reviewers and confirmed by a second reviewer. Quantitative synthesis will be conducted using Review Manager (RevMan) V.5 for applicable outcomes data. Planned subgroup analysis by PAD severity, vascular intervention and indication for antithrombotics will be conducted where data permits. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval is waived as the study does not involve primary data collection.

A poly(methyl-2-cyanoacrylate) film containing 2 μm boron-doped, calcined, porous silica microshells was developed as an ultrasound imaging marker for multiple medical devices. A macrophase separation drove the gas-filled porous silica microshells to the top surface of the polymer film by controlled curing of the cyanoacrylate glue and the amount of microshell loading. A thin film of polymer blocked the wall pores of the microshells to seal air in their hollow core, which served as an ultrasound contrast agent. The ultrasound activity disappeared when curing conditions were modified to prevent the macrophase segregation. Phase segregated films were attached to multiple surgical tools and needles and gave strong color Doppler signals in vitro and in vivo with the use of a clinical ultrasound imaging instrument. Postprocessing of the simultaneous color Doppler and B-mode images can be used for autonomous identification of implanted surgical items by correlating the two images. The thin films were also hydrophobic, thereby extending the lifetime of ultrasound signals to hours of imaging in tissues by preventing liquid penetration. This technology can be used as a coating to guide the placement of implantable medical devices or used to image and help remove retained surgical items.","Yang, Jian; Wang, James; Ta, Casey N; Ward, Erin; Barback, Christopher V; Sung, Tsai-Wen; Mendez, Natalie; Blair, Sarah L; Kummel, Andrew C; Trogler, William C",ACS applied materials & interfaces,488,24

Furthermore, they are habitually exposed to large fluctuations in blood flow during physical and sedentary activities. Low-flow-mediated constriction (L-FMC) and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) provide indices of endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction and vasodilation, respectively. Age and sex both impact upper-limb FMD. However, it is unclear whether these factors also influence popliteal endothelial-dependent function. Popliteal endothelial function was compared between younger and older males and females (n=14 per group) matched for age- and sex-specific relative aerobic fitness levels (each group's normative percentile: ~45%). Nitroglycerin-mediated dilation (NMD) was also assessed as a measure of endothelial-independent vasodilation. Ageing reduced relative popliteal FMD in both males (older: 4.3±1.8% versus younger 5.7±1.9%) and females (older: 2.9±1.8% versus younger: 6.1±1.6%, both: P<0.046). FMD was also lower in older females versus older males (P=0.04). Popliteal NMD findings followed the same pattern as FMD. Compared to younger adults, relative L-FMC responses were blunted among older males (older: -1.2±1.1% versus younger: -2.2±1.0%) and females (older: -1.0±1.2% versus younger: -2.1±1.3%, both P<0.03) with no sex-differences observed in either age group (all, P>0.60). The adverse age- and sex-related (older adults only) declines in popliteal FMD were mediated, in part, by reduced vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to nitric oxide. Endothelial-dependent vasoconstriction was also attenuated with age, but unaffected by sex. Despite similar normative aerobic fitness percentiles (~45%), older adults exhibited attenuated popliteal endothelial function than their younger counterparts. This was particularly evident in older females who exhibited the lowest endothelial-dependent vasodilatory responses.","O'Brien, Myles W; Johns, Jarrett A; Petterson, Jennifer L; Mekary, Said; Kimmerly, Derek S",Experimental gerontology,488,12

METHODS This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Patients (aged ≥ 40 years with baseline FEV1 ≤ 65% predicted, FEV1 > 0.50 L, FEV1/FVC ≤ 70%, and ≥ 15 pack-year smoking history) received arformoterol (n = 420) or placebo (n = 421) for 1 year. The primary assessment was time from randomization to respiratory death or first COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization. RESULTS Among 841 patients randomized, 103 had ≥ 1 primary event (9.5% vs 15.0%, for arformoterol vs placebo, respectively). Patients who discontinued treatment for any reason (39.3% vs 49.9%, for arformoterol vs placebo, respectively) were followed for up to 1 year postrandomization to assess for primary events. Fewer patients receiving arformoterol than placebo experienced COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations (9.0% vs 14.3%, respectively). Twelve patients (2.9%) receiving arformoterol and 10 patients (2.4%) receiving placebo died during the study. Risk for first respiratory serious adverse event was 50% lower with arformoterol than placebo (P = .003). Numerically more patients on arformoterol (13; 3.1%) than placebo (10; 2.4%) experienced cardiac serious adverse events; however, time-to-first cardiac serious adverse event was not significantly different. Improvements in trough FEV1 and FVC were greater with arformoterol (least-squares mean change from baseline vs placebo: 0.051 L, P = .030 and 0.075 L, P = .018, respectively). Significant improvements in quality of life (overall St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire and Clinical COPD Questionnaire) were observed with arformoterol vs placebo (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Arformoterol demonstrated an approximately 40% lower risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalization over 1 year vs placebo.

The move from the use of only hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis to continuous venovenous hemofiltration with or without dialysis (continuous renal replacement therapy, CRRT) has become a mainstay in many intensive care units. The move to CRRT is the result of greater clinical experience as well as advances in equipment, solutions, vascular access, and anticoagulation. CRRT is the mainstay of dialysis in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for critically ill children who often have hemodynamic compromise. The advantages of this modality include the ability to promote both solute and fluid clearance in a slow continuous manner. Though data exist suggesting that approximately 25% of children in any PICU may have some degree of renal insufficiency, the true need for RRT is approximately 4% of PICU admissions. This article will review the history as well as the progress being made in the provision of this care in children.","John, Jacob C; Taha, Sara; Bunchman, Timothy E",Kidney research and clinical practice,488,16

The main reasons are: genetic testing, availability of breast reconstruction, more often use of preoperative breast MRI, improvement of postoperative aesthetic results and reimbursement of breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to analyze the indication of CPM, it's evolution and the surgical techniques used for this type of surgery. Materials and methods: This prospective study enrolled patients with unilateral breast cancer for which conservative treatment was not an option and underwent CPM concomitant with therapeutic mastectomy, using different techniques, followed by immediate breast reconstruction using alloplastic materials. Results: A total of 45 patients with unilateral breast cancer underwent therapeutic mastectomy and CPM followed by immediate breast reconstruction, between January 2015-December 2020. The mean age was 43.5 years, 64,44% patients had stage I and II breast cancer and 22,22% were triplenegative. The indications for CPM were: pathogenic mutation of BRCA or of other genes associated with high risk of breast cancer, strong family history, suspicious findings on breast MRI, extended micro-calcifications, dense breasts, and extreme anxiety. Conclusions: A growing rate of bilateral mastectomy for unilateral breast cancer was observed. Availability of immediate breast reconstruction and reimbursement plays an important role for patients in choosing CPM. Factors associated with CPM include: young age, pathogenic BRCA mutation, significant family history and triple-negative disease. The rate of immediate postoperative complications was low. CPM is a valid option to reduce the risk of contralateral breast cancer and to achieve a good aesthetic outcome for patients with unilateral breast cancer with high risk of contralateral breast cancer.","Noditi, Aniela; Caragheorghe, George; Stoleru, Smaranda; Blidaru, Alexandru; Bordea, Cristian Ioan",Chirurgia,488,27

The burden of malnutrition remains high (e.g. childhood stunting, anaemia in women of reproductive age) or are increasing (e.g. overweight and obesity). A range of coordinated actions are required to improve this situation, including increasing local food production and consumption. The aim of this review was to provide a systematic and comprehensive overview of recently published research into the health, social, economic, and environmental impacts of community food production initiatives (CFPIs) in Kenya, Cameroon and South Africa. Methods We searched eight electronic databases covering health, social, environmental, economic and agricultural sciences. Primary research studies published from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 were considered. Data on geographic location, study design, type of CFPI and the impacts assessed were abstracted from eligible articles. Findings We identified 4828 articles, 260 of which required full-text review and 118 met our eligibility criteria. Most research was conducted in Kenya (53.4%) and South Africa (38.1%). The categories of CFPIs studied were (in order of decreasing frequency): crop farming, livestock farming, unspecified farming, fisheries, home / school gardens, urban agriculture, and agroforestry. The largest number of studies were on the economic and environmental impacts of CFPIs, followed by their health and social impacts. The health impacts investigated included food security, nutrition status and dietary intake. One study investigated the potential impact of CFPIs on non-communicable diseases. Over 60% of studies investigated a single category of impact. Not one of the studies explicitly used a theoretical framework to guide its design or interpretation. Conclusions Our findings on research studies of CFPIs suggest the need for a greater focus on interdisciplinary research in order to improve understanding of the relationships between their health, environmental, economic, and social impacts. Greater use of explicit theoretical frameworks could assist in research design and interpretation, helping to ensure its relevance to informing coordinated intersectoral interventions and policy initiatives.","Hutton, Gráinne B; Brugulat-Panés, Anna; Bhagtani, Divya; Mba Maadjhou, Camille; Birch, Jack M; Shih, Hueyjong; Okop, Kufre; Muti, Monica; Wadende, Pamela; Tatah, Lambed; Mogo, Ebele; Guariguata, Leonor; Unwin, Nigel",Journal of global health reports,488,1

BACKGROUND. An increase in frequency of acute ischemic strokes has been observed among patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes in patients presenting with acute neurologic symptoms. METHODS. This retrospective case-control study included patients for whom a code for stroke was activated from March 16 to April 30, 2020, at any of six New York City hospitals that are part of a single health system. Demographic data (age, sex, and race or ethnicity), COVID-19 status, stroke-related risk factors, and clinical and imaging findings pertaining to stroke were collected. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate the association between COVID-19 and stroke subtypes. RESULTS. The study sample consisted of 329 patients for whom a code for stroke was activated (175 [53.2%] men, 154 [46.8%] women; mean age, 66.9 ± 14.9 [SD] years). Among the 329 patients, 35.3% (116) had acute ischemic stroke confirmed with imaging; 21.6% (71) had large vessel occlusion (LVO) stroke; and 14.6% (48) had small vessel occlusion (SVO) stroke. Among LVO strokes, the most common location was middle cerebral artery segments M1 and M2 (62.0% [44/71]). Multifocal LVOs were present in 9.9% (7/71) of LVO strokes. COVID-19 was present in 38.3% (126/329) of the patients. The 61.7% (203/329) of patients without COVID-19 formed the negative control group. Among individual stroke-related risk factors, only Hispanic ethnicity was significantly associated with COVID-19 (38.1% of patients with COVID-19 vs 20.7% of patients without COVID-19; p = 0.001). LVO was present in 31.7% of patients with COVID-19 compared with 15.3% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.001). SVO was present in 15.9% of patients with COVID-19 and 13.8% of patients without COVID-19 (p = 0.632). In multivariate analysis controlled for race and ethnicity, presence of COVID-19 had a significant independent association with LVO stroke (odds ratio, 2.4) compared with absence of COVID-19 (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION. COVID-19 is associated with LVO strokes but not with SVO strokes. CLINICAL IMPACT. Patients with COVID-19 presenting with acute neurologic symptoms warrant a lower threshold for suspicion of large vessel stroke, and prompt workup for large vessel stroke is recommended.","Kihira, Shingo; Schefflein, Javin; Mahmoudi, Keon; Rigney, Brian; N Delman, Bradley; Mocco, J; Doshi, Amish; Belani, Puneet",AJR.

Based on the highest amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by human fibroblasts grown on n-BG coatings (0-1.245 mg/cm(2)), decellularized trabecular bone samples (porosity: 43-81%) were coated with n-BG particles. Grown on n-BG particles at a coating density of 0.263 mg/cm(2), human fibroblasts produced 4.3 times more VEGF than on uncoated controls. After 8 weeks of implantation in Sprague-Dawley rats, both uncoated and n-BG-coated samples were well infiltrated with newly formed tissue (47-48%) and blood vessels (3-4%). No significant differences were found in cellularization and vascularization between uncoated bone scaffolds and n-BG-coated scaffolds. This finding indicates that the decellularized bone itself may exhibit growth-promoting properties induced by the highly interconnected pore microarchitecture and/or proteins left behind on decellularized scaffolds. Even if we did not find proangiogenic effects in n-BG-coated bone scaffolds, a bioactive coating is considered to be beneficial to impart osteoinductive and osteoconductive properties to decellularized bone. n-BG-coated bone grafts have thus high clinical potential for the regeneration of complex tissue defects given their ability for recellularization and neovascularization.","Gerhardt, L-C; Widdows, K L; Erol, M M; Nandakumar, A; Roqan, I S; Ansari, T; Boccaccini, A R",Journal of biomedical materials research.

As a key to tracing the disease and to implement strategies aimed at breaking the chain of disease transmission, extensive testing for SARS-CoV-2 was suggested. Although nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs are the most commonly used biological samples for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, they have a number of limitations related to sample collection and healthcare personnel safety. In this context, saliva is emerging as a promising alternative to nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. Saliva collection, being a non-invasive approach with possibility for self-collection, circumvents to a great extent the limitations associated with the use of nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. In addition, various salivary biomarkers including the salivary metabolomics offer a high promise to be useful for better understanding of COVID-19 and possibly in the identification of patients with various degrees of severity, including asymptomatic carriers. This review summarises the clinical and scientific basis for the potential use of saliva for COVID-19 diagnosis and disease monitoring. Additionally, we discuss saliva-based biomarkers and their potential clinical and research applications related to COVID-19.","Sapkota, Dipak; Søland, Tine Merete; Galtung, Hilde Kanli; Sand, Lars Peter; Giannecchini, Simone; To, Kelvin K W; Mendes-Correa, Maria Cassia; Giglio, Daniel; Hasséus, Bengt; Braz-Silva, Paulo Henrique",Journal of clinical pathology,488,1

Objective To evaluate the rates of cesarean delivery for nulliparous, term, singleton, vertex (NTSV) births in California in the context of a statewide multifaceted intervention designed to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery. Design, Setting, and Participants Observational study of cesarean delivery rates from 2014 to 2019 among 7 574 889 NTSV births in the US and at 238 nonmilitary hospitals providing maternity services in California. From 2016 to 2019, California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative partnered with Smart Care California to implement multiple approaches to decrease the rates of cesarean delivery. Hospitals with rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births were invited to join 1 of 3 cohorts for an 18-month quality improvement collaborative between July 2016 and June 2019. Exposures Within the collaborative, multidisciplinary teams implemented multiple strategies supported by mentorship, shared learning, and rapid-cycle data feedback. Partnerships among nonprofit organizations, state governmental agencies, purchasers, and health plans addressed the external environment through transparency, award programs, and incentives. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the change in cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California and a difference-in-differences analysis was performed to compare cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births in California vs the rates in the rest of the US. A mixed multivariable logistic regression model that adjusted for patient-level and hospital-level confounders also was used to assess the collaborative and the external statewide actions. The cesarean delivery rates for NTSV births at hospitals participating in the collaborative were compared with the rates from the nonparticipating hospitals and the rates in the participating hospitals prior to participation in the collaborative. Results A total of 7 574 889 NTSV births occurred in the US from 2014 to 2019, of which 914 283 were at 238 hospitals in California. All California hospitals were exposed to the statewide actions to reduce the rates of cesarean delivery, including the 149 hospitals that had baseline rates of cesarean delivery greater than 23.9% for NTSV births, of which 91 (61%) participated in the quality improvement collaborative. The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California decreased from 26.0% (95% CI, 25.8%-26.2%) in 2014 to 22.8% (95% CI, 22.6%-23.1%) in 2019 (relative risk, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.89). The rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in the US (excluding California births) was 26.0% in both 2014 and 2019 (relative risk, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.996-1.005). The difference-in-differences analysis revealed that the reduction in the rate of cesarean delivery for NTSV births in California was 3.2% (95% CI, 1.7%-3.5%) higher than in the US (excluding California). Compared with the hospitals and the periods not exposed to the collaborative activities, and after adjusting for patient characteristics and time using a modified stepped-wedge analysis, exposure to collaborative activities was associated with a lower odds of cesarean delivery for NTSV births (24.4% vs 24.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.85-0.89]). Conclusions and Relevance In this observational study of NTSV births in California from 2014 to 2019, the rates of cesarean delivery decreased over time in the setting of the implementation of a coordinated hospital-level collaborative and statewide initiatives designed to support vaginal birth.","Rosenstein, Melissa G; Chang, Shen-Chih; Sakowski, Christa; Markow, Cathie; Teleki, Stephanie; Lang, Lance; Logan, Julia; Cape, Valerie; Main, Elliott K",JAMA,488,27

DESIGN A retrospective analysis of the Extended Prevalence of Infection in the ICU Study (EPIC II). Demographic, physiological, infection-related and therapeutic data were collected. Patients were grouped as having Candida, Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and combined Candida/bacterial bloodstream infection. Outcome data were assessed at intensive care unit and hospital discharge. SETTING EPIC II included 1265 intensive care units in 76 countries. PATIENTS Patients in participating intensive care units on study day. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS Of the 14,414 patients in EPIC II, 99 patients had Candida bloodstream infections for a prevalence of 6.9 per 1000 patients. Sixty-one patients had candidemia alone and 38 patients had combined bloodstream infections. Candida albicans (n = 70) was the predominant species. Primary therapy included monotherapy with fluconazole (n = 39), caspofungin (n = 16), and a polyene-based product (n = 12). Combination therapy was infrequently used (n = 10). Compared with patients with Gram-positive (n = 420) and Gram-negative (n = 264) bloodstream infections, patients with candidemia were more likely to have solid tumors (p < .05) and appeared to have been in an intensive care unit longer (14 days [range, 5-25 days], 8 days [range, 3-20 days], and 10 days [range, 2-23 days], respectively), but this difference was not statistically significant. Severity of illness and organ dysfunction scores were similar between groups. Patients with Candida bloodstream infections, compared with patients with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bloodstream infections, had the greatest crude intensive care unit mortality rates (42.6%, 25.3%, and 29.1%, respectively) and longer intensive care unit lengths of stay (median [interquartile range]) (33 days [18-44], 20 days [9-43], and 21 days [8-46], respectively); however, these differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION Candidemia remains a significant problem in intensive care units patients. In the EPIC II population, Candida albicans was the most common organism and fluconazole remained the predominant antifungal agent used. Candida bloodstream infections are associated with high intensive care unit and hospital mortality rates and resource use.","Kett, Daniel H; Azoulay, Elie; Echeverria, Pablo M; Vincent, Jean-Louis",Critical care medicine,488,23

The integrity of RNA pseudoknot stability and structure in the -1 RF site is important for efficient -1 RF. Thus, small molecules interacting with high affinity and selectivity with the RNA pseudoknot in the -1 RF site of SARS-CoV (SARS-pseudoknot) would disrupt -1 RF and be fatal to viral infectivity and production. To discover ligands for the SARS-pseudoknot by virtual screening, we constructed a 3D structural model of the SARS-pseudoknot and conducted a computational screening of the chemical database. After virtual screening of about 80,000 compounds against the SARS-pseudoknot structure, high-ranked compounds were selected and their activities were examined by in vitro and cell-based -1 RF assay. We successfully identified a novel ligand 43 that dramatically inhibits the -1 RF of SARS-CoV.

Physicians are being called upon to be both managers-able to set processes and structures-and leaders-capable of creating vision and inspiring action. Although these skills may have been previously considered as just nice to have, they are now as central to being a physician as physiology and biochemistry. While traditionally only selected physicians have received management training, either through executive or joint degree programs, the authors argue that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of all physicians learning management and leadership skills. Training should emphasize skills related to interpersonal management, systems management, and communication and planning; be seamlessly integrated into the medical curriculum alongside existing content; and be delivered by existing faculty with leadership experience. While leadership programs, such as the Pediatric Leadership for the UnderServed Program at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Clinical Process Improvement Leadership Program at Mass General Brigham, may include project work, instruction by clinical leaders, and content delivered over time, examples of leadership training that seamlessly blend biomedical and management training are lacking. The authors present the Leader and Leadership Education and Development curriculum used at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, which is woven through 4 years of medical school, as an example of leadership training that approximates many of the principles espoused here. The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the logistical capabilities of health care systems and the entire United States, revealing that management and leadership skills-often viewed as soft skills-are a matter of life and death. Training all physicians in these skills will improve patient care, the well-being of the health care workforce, and health across the United States.","Rotenstein, Lisa S; Huckman, Robert S; Cassel, Christine K",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,488,1

Early identification of po-AKI patients using the novel urinary biomarkers insulin-like growth factor-binding-protein 7 (IGFBP7) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2) might help in early identification of individuals at risk of AKI and enable timely introduction of preventative or therapeutic interventions with the aim of reducing the incidence of po-AKI. We investigated whether biomarker-based monitoring would allow for early detection of po-AKI in patients undergoing abdominal aortic interventions. METHODS In an investigator-initiated prospective single-center observational study in a tertiary care academic center, adult patients with emergency/ elective abdominal aortic repair were included. Patients were tested for concentrations of urinary (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) at baseline, after surgical interventions (PO), and in the mornings of the first postoperative day (POD1). The primary endpoint was a difference in urinary (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) levels at POD1 in patients with/ without po-AKI (all KDIGO stages, po-AKI until seven days after surgery). Secondary endpoints included sensitivity/ specificity analyses of previously proposed cut-off levels and clinical outcome measures (e.g. need for renal replacement therapy). RESULTS 93 patients (n = 71 open surgery) were included. Po-AKI was observed in 33% (31/93) of patients. Urinary (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) levels at POD1 did not differ between patients with/ without AKI (median 0.39, interquartile range [IQR] 0.13-1.05 and median 0.23, IQR 0.14-0.53, p = .11, respectively) and PO (median 0.2, IQR 0.08-0.42, 0.18, IQR 0.09-0.46; p = .79). Higher median (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) levels were noted in KDIGO stage 3 pAKI patients at POD1 (3.75, IQR 1.97-6.92; p = .003). Previously proposed cutoff levels (0.3, 2) showed moderate sensitivity/ specificity (0.58/0.58 and 0.16/0.98, respectively). CONCLUSION In a prospective monocentric observational study in patients after abdominal aortic repair, early assessment of urinary (TIMP-2) x (IGFBP7) did not appear to have adequate sensitivity/ specificity to identify patients that later developed postoperative AKI.

Navigated bronchoscopy has developed fast since the introduction of virtual bronchoscopy with integrated electromagnetic sensors in the late 1990s. The purposes of the review are to give an overview and update of the technological components of navigated bronchoscopy, an assessment of its clinical usefulness, and a brief assessment of the commercial platforms for navigated bronchoscopy. METHODS We performed a literature search with relevant keywords to navigation and bronchoscopy and iterated on the reference lists of relevant papers, with emphasis on the last 5 years. RESULTS The paper presents an overview of the components necessary for performing navigated bronchoscopy, assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of different approaches, and an analysis of the commercial systems. We were able to identify 4 commercial platforms and 9 research and development groups with considerable activity in the field. Finally, on the basis of our findings and our own experience, we provide a discussion on navigated bronchoscopy with focus on the next steps of development. CONCLUSIONS The literature review showed that the peripheral diagnostic accuracy has improved using navigated bronchoscopy compared with traditional bronchoscopy. We believe that there is room for improvement in the diagnostic success rate by further refinement of methods, approaches, and tools used in navigated bronchoscopy.","Reynisson, Pall J; Leira, Håkon O; Hernes, Toril N; Hofstad, Erlend F; Scali, Marta; Sorger, Hanne; Amundsen, Tore; Lindseth, Frank; Langø, Thomas",Journal of bronchology & interventional pulmonology,488,1

PURPOSE Nearly half of intensive care unit (ICU) patients will develop delirium. Antipsychotics are used routinely for the management of ICU delirium despite limited reliable data supporting this approach. The unwarranted continuation of antipsychotics initiated for ICU delirium is an emerging transitions of care concern, especially considering the adverse event profile of these agents. We sought to evaluate the magnitude of this issue across 6 centers in New Jersey and describe risk factors for continuation. METHODS This multicenter, retrospective study examined adult ICU patients who developed ICU delirium from June 2016 to June 2018. Patients were included in the study if they received at least 3 doses of antipsychotics while in the ICU with presence of either a clinical diagnosis of delirium or a positive Confusion Assessment Method score. Patients were excluded if they were on an antipsychotic before ICU admission. RESULTS Of the 300 patients included and initiated on antipsychotics for ICU delirium, 157 (52.3%) were continued on therapy upon transfer from the ICU to another level of inpatient care. The number of patients continued on newly initiated antipsychotics further increased to 183 (61%) upon discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSION The continuation of antipsychotics for the management of delirium during transitions of care was a common practice across ICUs in New Jersey. Several risk factors for continuation of antipsychotics were identified.

To the best of our knowledge, the combination of these two clinical entities as a result of a motor vehicle accident has not been previously reported. CASE PRESENTATION A 32-year-old Indian man was brought to our emergency department after being involved in a road traffic accident. He described a temporary loss of consciousness and had multiple tender bruises at his right upper anterior abdominal wall and left lumbar region. An initial examination revealed blood pressure of 99/63 mmHg, heart rate of 107 beats/minute, and oxygen saturation of 93 % on room air. His clinical parameters stabilized after initial resuscitation. A computed tomographic scan revealed a rupture of the left diaphragm as well as extensive disruptions of the left upper anterior abdominal wall. We performed exploratory laparoscopic surgery with the intention of primary repair. The diaphragmatic and abdominal wall defect was primarily closed, followed by reinforcement with PROLENE onlay mesh. The patient's postoperative recovery was complicated by infected hematomas over both flanks that were managed with ultrasound-guided percutaneous drainage. He was discharged well despite a prolonged hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS We present a complex form of injuries managed successfully via a laparoscopic approach. Meticulous attention to potential complications in both the acute and convalescent phases is important for achieving a successful outcome following surgery.","Siow, Sze Li; Wong, Chee Ming; Hardin, Mark; Sohail, Mushtaq",Journal of medical case reports,488,12

One of many negative impacts may be on animal reproduction. Elevated ambient temperature unfavourably influences reproductive processes in mammals. High temperature can affect reproductive processes such as follicle development and may alter follicular fluid concentrations of amino acids, fatty acids, minerals, enzymes, antioxidants defence and growth factors. These impacts may lead to inferior oocyte competence and abnormal granulosa cell (GCs) function. Mammalian oocytes are enclosed by GCs that secret hormones and signalling molecules to promote oocyte competence. GCs are essential for proper follicular development, oocyte maturation, ovulation, and luteinization. Many environmental stressors, including thermal stress, affect GC function and alter oocyte development and growth. Several studies documented a link between elevated ambient temperature and increased generation of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can damage DNA, reduce cell proliferation, and induce apoptosis in GCs, thus altering oocyte development. Additionally, thermal stress induces upregulation of thermal shock proteins, such as HSP70 and HSP90. This review provides an update on the influence of thermal stress on GCs of mammals. Discussions include impacts to steroidogenesis (estradiol and progesterone), proliferation and cell cycle transition, apoptosis, oxidative stress (ROS), antioxidants related genes, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and endoplasmic reticulum responses.","Abdelnour, Sameh A; Swelum, Ayman A; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E; Khafaga, Asmaa F; Taha, Ayman E; Abdo, Mohamed",Journal of thermal biology,488,5

Surgical robots with impressive dexterity and precise dissection skills have been developed to help surgeons perform operations. The objective of this study was to determine the impact on short-term outcomes of robot-assisted thoracoscopic radical esophagectomy performed on patients in the prone position for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, including its impact on RLNP. METHODS A single-institution nonrandomized prospective study was performed. The patients (n = 36) with resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma were divided into two groups: patients who agreed to robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy with total mediastinal lymphadenectomy performed in the prone position (n = 16, robot-assisted group) without insurance reimbursement, and those who agreed to undergo the same operation without robot assistance but with health insurance coverage (n = 20, control group). These patients were observed for 30 days following surgery to assess short-term surgical outcomes, including the incidence of vocal cord palsy, hoarseness, and aspiration. RESULTS Robot assistance significantly reduced the incidence of vocal cord palsy (p = 0.018) and hoarseness (p = 0.015) and the time on the ventilator (p = 0.025). There was no in-hospital mortality in either group. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to patient background, except for the use of preoperative therapy (robot-assisted group <control, p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in estimated blood loss, operating time, number of dissected lymph nodes, completeness of resection, or the incidence of the other complications, except for anastomotic leakage (p = 0.038). CONCLUSION Robot-assisted thoracoscopic esophagectomy with total mediastinal lymphadenectomy is feasible and safe. This method shows promise in preventing RLNP.","Suda, Koichi; Ishida, Yoshinori; Kawamura, Yuichiro; Inaba, Kazuki; Kanaya, Seiichiro; Teramukai, Satoshi; Satoh, Seiji; Uyama, Ichiro",World journal of surgery,488,16

In mammalian cells, viral infections initiate the expression of interferons (IFNs) in the host that in turn activate an antiviral defense program to restrict viral replications by induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs), which are largely regulated by the IFN-regulatory factor (IRF) family and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family transcription factors. The mechanisms of action of IRFs and STATs involve several post-translational modifications, complex formation, and nuclear translocation of these transcription factors. However, many viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV), have evolved strategies to evade host defense, including alteration in IRF and STAT post-translational modifications, disturbing the formation and nuclear translocation of the transcription complexes as well as proteolysis/degradation of IRFs and STATs. In this review, we discuss and summarize the molecular mechanisms by which how viral components may target IRFs and STATs to antagonize the establishment of antiviral host defense. The underlying host-viral interactions determine the outcome of viral infection. Gaining mechanistic insight into these processes will be crucial in understanding how viral replication can be more effectively controlled and in developing approaches to improve virus infection outcomes.","Chiang, Hao-Sen; Liu, Helene Minyi",Frontiers in immunology,488,19

RECENT FINDINGS Positional components are nearly ubiquitous among diagnoses of dizziness, so it can be challenging to classify patients with episodic positional dizziness simply based on the history of present illness. Overreliance on the presence of a report of positional components has likely resulted in misapplication or misinterpretation of positional testing and negative experiences with maneuvers to treat positional dizziness. The prototypical episodic positional dizziness disorder is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by free-floating particles in a semicircular canal that move in response to gravity. The diagnosis is made by identifying the characteristic patterns of nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Particle repositioning for BPPV is supported by randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and practice guidelines. Other disorders that can present with episodic positional dizziness are migraine dizziness, central lesions, and light cupula syndrome. SUMMARY Episodic positional dizziness is a common presentation of dizziness. Neurologists should prioritize identifying and treating BPPV; doing so provides an important opportunity to deliver effective and efficient care. Providers should also recognize that positional components are common in most causes of dizziness and, therefore, should not over-rely on this part of the history of presentation when considering the diagnosis and management plan.","Kerber, Kevin A",Continuum,488,1

However, detailed catalogs of the relevant vascular anatomy are scarce. We present our experience with macaque vessel patterns as determined by digital subtraction angiography of 34 different monkeys. We retrospectively analyzed digital subtraction angiograms obtained during experimental internal carotid artery (ICA) catheterization and subsequent injection of 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Results were catalogued according to vascular distribution and variants observed. Macaque monkeys have a bovine aortic arch. The carotid vessels generally bifurcate, but are occasionally observed to divide into three vessels. The external carotid gives rise primarily to two trunks: an occipital branch and a common vessel that subsequently gives off the lingual, facial, and superior thyroid arteries. The internal maxillary artery may be present as a terminal branch of the external carotid or as a branch of the occipital artery. The ICA is similar in course to that of the human. The anterior circle of Willis was intact in all monkeys in our study. Its primary difference from that of the human is the union of the bilateral anterior cerebral arteries as a single (azygous) median vessel. Macaque cervical carotid and circle of Willis arterial anatomy differs from humans in a couple of specific patterns. Knowledge of these differences and similarities between human and macaque anatomy is important in developing endovascular macaque models of human diseases, such as ischemic stroke.","Kumar, Nishant; Lee, John J; Perlmutter, Joel S; Derdeyn, Colin P",Anatomical record,488,1

However, it remains unknown whether the complexity of the procedure allows its duplication in other non-pioneer centers. We attempt to address this issue by presenting our cumulative experience with RARC and intracorporeal neobladder formation. METHODS We retrospectively identified 62 RARCs in 50 men and 12 women (mean age 63.6 years) in two tertiary centers. Intracorporeal Studer neobladders were created, duplicating the steps of standard open surgery. Perioperative and postoperative variables and complications were analyzed using standardized tools. Functional and oncological results were assessed. RESULTS The mean operative time was 476.9 min (range, 310 to 690) and blood loss was 385 ml (200 to 800). The mean hospital stay was 16.7 (12 to 62) days with no open conversion. Perioperative complications were grade II in 15, grade III in 11, and grade IV in 5 patients. The mean nodal yield was 22.9 (8 to 46). Positive margins were found in in 6.4%. The 90- and 180-day mortality rates were 0% and 3.3%. The average follow-up was 37.3 months (3 to 52). Continence was achieved in 88% of patients. The cancer-specific survival rate and overall survival rate were 84% and 71%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A RARC with intracorporeal neobladder creation is safe and reproducible in 'non-pioneer' tertiary centers with robotic expertise with acceptable operative time and complications. Further standardization of RARC with intracorporeal diversion is a prerequisite for its widespread use.","Schwentner, Christian; Sim, Allen; Balbay, Mevlana Derya; Todenhöfer, Tilman; Aufderklamm, Stefan; Halalsheh, Omar; Mischinger, Johannes; Böttge, Johannes; Rausch, Steffen; Bier, Simone; Stenzl, Arnulf; Gakis, Georgios; Canda, Abdullah Erdem",World journal of surgical oncology,488,1

This tight cerebral vascular endothelium regulates selective diffusion and active transport of endogenous molecules and xenobiotics into and out of the brain parenchyma. In this study, glutathione targeted PEGylated (GSH-PEG) liposomes were designed to deliver amyloid-targeting antibody fragments across the BBB into the brain. Two different formulations of GSH-PEG liposomes based on 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) and egg-yolk phosphatidylcholine (EYPC) were produced. Both formulations encapsulate 15kDa amyloid beta binding llama single domain antibody fragments (VHH-pa2H). To follow the biodistribution of VHH-pa2H rather than the liposome, the antibody fragment was labeled with the radioisotope indium-111. To prolong the shelf life of the construct beyond the limit of radioactive decay, an active-loading method was developed to efficiently radiolabel the antibody fragments after encapsulation into the liposomes, with radiolabeling efficiencies of up to 68% after purification. The radiolabeled liposomes were administered via a single intravenous bolus injection to APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and their wildtype littermates. Both GSH-PEG DMPC and GSH-PEG EYPC liposomes significantly increased the standard uptake values (SUV) of VHH-pa2H in the blood of the animals compared to free VHH-pa2H. Encapsulation in GSH-PEG EYPC liposomes resulted in the highest increase in SUV in the brains of transgenic animals. Overall, these data provide evidence that GSH-PEG liposomes may be suitable for specific delivery of single domain antibody fragments over the BBB into the brain.","Rotman, Maarten; Welling, Mick M; Bunschoten, Anton; de Backer, Maaike E; Rip, Jaap; Nabuurs, Rob J A; Gaillard, Pieter J; van Buchem, Mark A; van der Maarel, Silvère M; van der Weerd, Louise",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,488,16

OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether weekly serial measurements of the TIE index can predict the success in prolonged weaning. METHODS A prospective observational study in which the subjects who started the weaning process off mechanical ventilation underwent weekly measurements of the TIE index. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the accuracy of the TIE index as a predictor of weaning success. A multivariate Cox regression model was developed to test the association of TIE index values of ≥1.0 cm H2O/s with a failure of weaning. RESULTS Seventy subjects were selected. Their median (IQR) age was 72 (62-78) y, the median (IQR) duration of mechanical ventilation was 17.5 (14-28) d, and the median (IQR) APACHE II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score was 28 (24-31). Thirty-five of the 70 subjects (50%) died, 22 of them after successful weaning. A total of 224 tests were performed over 56 d. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the TIE index was 0.93. In the analysis of the probability of success during the follow-up (Kaplan-Meier method), a significant difference was obtained in favor of those with a TIE index of ≥ 1.0 cm H2O/s (53% vs 32%, P = .030). In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, values of the TIE index ≥ 1.0 cm H2O/s revealed an inverse, strong, and independent association with failure (hazard ratio 0.36, 95% CI 0.15-0.91; P = .030). The following variables were also found to have an independent but direct association with failure: age and length of time before weaning.

METHODS From October 2005 to August 2008, 214 patients with different degrees of obesity underwent LSG. During surgery, each patient received saline with methylene blue by way of nasogastric tube and had a drain placed. All patients underwent radiologic study with liquid barium sulphate on postoperative day 3. RESULTS Seven patients developed gastric leak. Leak in two patients (28.6%) was diagnosed by upper gastrointestinal tract (UGI) study. Two patients had type I leak (28.6%), and five patients had type II leak (71.4%). Four patients underwent reoperation. Three patients were managed medically with enteral or parenteral feeding; the drain was maintained in situ; and collections were drained by percutaneous punctions guided by computed axial tomography. Mean hospital length of stay was 28.8 days, and time to leakage closure was 43 days after surgery.

COVID-19 has affected the capability of health care experts to treat patients face to face. One initiative to improve the efficacy and convenience of patient care despite the physical distancing limitations has been the application of ""virtual clinics"" (VCs) as a treatment modality. This study was aimed to investigate the use of VCs as a tool of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This study was conducted in the ambulatory care setting at King Abdullah Specialized Children Hospital in Riyadh. Respondents were selected from different groups of health care providers. The study was a hospital-based cross-sectional design using an electronic survey. Results: In total, 277 surveys were collected. Principal findings showed the deployment of VCs by 67.2% (n = 186) of providers. Among these providers, 54.3% were female, and only 18.8% of providers were aged >54 years. 98.1% of the respondents have started running VCs since the COVID-19 outbreak, with 47.2% of respondents running between 51 and 100 VCs per month, and the majority (74%) were spending 6-15 min per patient visit. Chronically ill patients constituted 57.7% of the patient's population served. Almost 95% of respondents used electronic prescriptions during their VCs. Most providers (98.1%) used the telephone/mobile as a means of communication with the patient during these VCs. A total of 75.5% of VCs were integrated with electronic health records such as appointment scheduling (77.9%), and 88.3% of the providers were satisfied with their VCs. The major opportunity seen by providers was reducing appointment waiting times (73.4%). The major success metric seen in VCs was increased patient satisfaction as reported by providers (67.9%). In contrast, the major challenge seen was the lack of face-to-face interaction and physical examination (86.8%). Conclusion: VCs are one way of centering the health system around the patient, but careful attention is needed to integrate these services with the current health care delivery system in place and ensure quality care to the patients.","Eddine, Inaam Shehabe; Zedan, Haya S",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,488,33

Serologic tests are widely accepted and used to detect anti-PEDV antibodies that could indicate PEDV infection or vaccination. In this study, PEDV recombinant S1 protein (rS1) was expressed with the Bac-to-Bac system and purified by nickel-affinity chromatography. An indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on rS1 (rS1-ELISA) was then developed and optimized by checkerboard assays with serial dilutions of antigen and serum. Serum samples from 453 domestic pigs and 42 vaccinated pigs were analyzed by the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test and rS1-ELISA. Taking IFA as a gold standard, rS1-ELISA produced a high sensitivity (90.7%) and specificity (94.6%) by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. In addition, ROC analysis also revealed that rS1-ELISA was consistent with IFA (area under the curve 0.9583 ± 0.0082). This rS1-ELISA was then applied to antibody detection in inactivated PEDV vaccinated pigs. The antibody could be detected 2-4 weeks after the first inoculation. These results indicated that the rS1-ELISA established in this study provides a promising and reliable tool for serologic detection of anti-PEDV IgG antibodies in infected or vaccinated pigs.","Shan, Ying; Liu, Yajie; Liu, Ziqi; Li, Guowei; Chen, Cong; Luo, Hao; Chen, Yunlu; Guo, Ningning; Shi, Xingfen; Zhang, Xian; Fang, Weihuan; Li, Xiaoliang",Canadian journal of microbiology,488,1

Considering the complexity of disease transmission dynamics in cities, stochastic epidemic models include uncertainty in their treatment of the problem, allowing the estimation of the probability of an outbreak, the distribution of epidemic magnitudes, and their expected duration. In this sense, we propose a kinetic Monte Carlo epidemic model that focuses on demography and on age-structured mobility data to simulate the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak in the capital of Brazil, Brasilia, under several scenarios of mobility restriction. We show that the distribution of epidemic outcomes can be divided into short-lived mild outbreaks and longer severe ones. We demonstrate that quarantines have the effect of reducing the probability of a severe outbreak taking place but are unable to mitigate the magnitude of these outbreaks once they happen. Finally, we present the probability of a particular trajectory in the epidemic progression resulting in a massive outbreak as a function of the cumulative number of cases at the end of each quarantine period, allowing for the estimation of the risk associated with relaxing mobility restrictions at a given time.","de Sousa, Leonardo Evaristo; Neto, Pedro Henrique de Oliveira; Filho, Demetrio Antônio da Silva",Physical review.

One challenge is the development of a simulation-based test, which can be used as an assessment tool. The study objective was to establish validity evidence for a virtual reality simulator test of a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy of a right upper lobe. METHODS Participants with varying experience in VATS lobectomy were included. They were familiarized with a virtual reality simulator (LapSim®) and introduced to the steps of the procedure for a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy. The participants performed two VATS lobectomies on the simulator with a 5-min break between attempts. Nineteen pre-defined simulator metrics were recorded. RESULTS Fifty-three participants from nine different countries were included. High internal consistency was found for the metrics with Cronbach's alpha coefficient for standardized items of 0.91. Significant test-retest reliability was found for 15 of the metrics (p-values <0.05). Significant correlations between the metrics and the participants VATS lobectomy experience were identified for seven metrics (p-values <0.001), and 10 metrics showed significant differences between novices (0 VATS lobectomies performed) and experienced surgeons (>50 VATS lobectomies performed). A pass/fail level defined as approximately one standard deviation from the mean metric scores for experienced surgeons passed none of the novices (0 % false positives) and failed four of the experienced surgeons (29 % false negatives). CONCLUSION This study is the first to establish validity evidence for a VATS right upper lobe lobectomy virtual reality simulator test. Several simulator metrics demonstrated significant differences between novices and experienced surgeons and pass/fail criteria for the test were set with acceptable consequences. This test can be used as a first step in assessing thoracic surgery trainees' VATS lobectomy competency.","Jensen, Katrine; Bjerrum, Flemming; Hansen, Henrik Jessen; Petersen, René Horsleben; Pedersen, Jesper Holst; Konge, Lars",Surgical endoscopy,488,25

Here, an updated and expanded evidence-based guideline is presented. METHODS Literature databases and other sources of information were searched for studies that could inform on ten formulated questions on symptoms, serology, HLA genetics, and histopathology. Eligible articles were assessed using QUADAS2. GRADE provided a basis for statements and recommendations. RESULTS Various symptoms are suggested for case finding, with limited contribution to diagnostic accuracy. If CD is suspected, measurement of total serum IgA and IgA-antibodies against transglutaminase 2 (TGA-IgA) is superior to other combinations. We recommend against deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies (DGP-IgG/IgA) for initial testing. Only if total IgA is low/undetectable an IgG based test is indicated. Patients with positive results should be referred to a paediatric gastroenterologist/specialist. If TGA-IgA is ≥10 times the upper limit of normal (10xULN) and the family agrees, the no-biopsy diagnosis may be applied, provided endomysial antibodies (EMA-IgA) will test positive in a second blood sample. HLA DQ2-/DQ8 determination and symptoms are not obligatory criteria. In children with positive TGA-IgA <10xULN at least 4 biopsies from the distal duodenum and at least one from the bulb should be taken. Discordant results between TGA-IgA and histopathology may require re-evaluation of biopsies. Patients with no/mild histological changes (Marsh 0/I) but confirmed autoimmunity (TGA-IgA/EMA-IgA+) should be followed closely. CONCLUSIONS CD diagnosis can be accurately established with or without duodenal biopsies if given recommendations are followed.","Husby, Steffen; Koletzko, Sibylle; Korponay-Szabó, Ilma; Kurppa, Kalle; Mearin, M Luisa; Ribes-Koninckx, Carmen; Shamir, Raanan; Troncone, Riccardo; Auricchio, Renata; Castillejo, Gemma; Christensen, Robin; Dolinsek, Jernej; Gillett, Peter; Hróbjartsson, Asbjørn; Koltai, Tunde; Maki, Markku; Nielsen, Sabrina Mai; Popp, Alina; Bucharest,; Størdal, Ketil; Werkstetter, Katharina; Wessels, Margreet",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,488,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS A single-center, randomized, clinical trial was conducted with 52 patients (36 female, 16 male) who expected severe postoperative sequelae as a result of the extraction of impacted mandibular third molars. The patients were randomized into three groups. In the preoperative submucosal corticosteroid injection group (n = 16), 8 mg/2 ml dexamethasone 21-phosphate was administered near operated sites. In the postoperative therapeutic elastic bandage application group (n = 19), Kinesio tapes were applied to operated sites. Paracetamol 500 mg was prescribed for the patients in the corticosteroid and elastic bandage application groups. In the postoperative non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug group (n = 17), 25 mg dexketoprofen trometamol was prescribed. Maximal mouth opening, swelling, pain, and Oral Health Impaction Profile scores were quantified preoperatively and postoperatively on the second and seventh days. Additionally, all patients were asked to evaluate the postoperative period by the Postoperative Symptom Severity Scale. RESULTS Analysis of the obtained data revealed that on the second postoperative day, postoperative edema and trismus were significantly lower in the submucosal corticosteroid (p = 0.025, p = 0.03) and therapeutic elastic bandage (p = 0.032, p = 0.014) groups, and the patients in these groups had a more comfortable postoperative period than the group prescribed a postoperative non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (p = 0.016). CLINICAL RELEVANCE In oral surgery, postoperative elastic bandage application can provide results similar to those of preoperative submucosal corticosteroid injection with respect to inflammatory symptoms and quality of life.

However, glycan analysis has always been a challenge. Here, we would like to present new techniques for glycan fingerprinting based on enzymatic fluorescent labeling and gel electrophoresis. The method is illustrated on SARS2 spike (S) glycoproteins. SARS2, a novel coronavirus and the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic, has had significant social and economic impacts since the end of 2019. To obtain the N-glycan fingerprint of an S protein, glycans released from the protein are first labeled through enzymatic incorporation of fluorophore-conjugated sialic acid or fucose, then separated by SDS-PAGE, and finally visualized with a fluorescent imager. To identify the labeled glycans of a fingerprint, glycan standards and glycan ladders are enzymatically generated and run alongside the samples as references. By comparing the mobility of a labeled glycan to that of a glycan standard, the identity of glycans maybe determined. O-glycans can also be fingerprinted. Due to the lack of an enzyme for broad O-glycan release, O-glycans on the S protein can be labeled with fluorescent sialic acid and digested with trypsin to obtain labeled glycan peptides that are then separated by gel electrophoresis. Glycan fingerprinting could serve as a quick method for globally assessing the glycosylation of a specific glycoprotein.","Wu, Zhengliang L; Ertelt, James M",Scientific reports,488,24

METHODS We retrospectively reviewed patients treated with an EFD for BTAs at our institution between 2013 and 2019 to standard coiling from the same period (control group). Patient demographics, aneurysm characteristics, procedural data, complications and clinical and angiographic outcome were compared between groups. RESULTS Twenty-three (56%) patients were treated with an EFD and eighteen (44%) patients were treated with coiling. Average aneurysm size was 8 mm in the EFD group and 6.9 mm in the coiling group, respectively (P = 0.2). Average fluoroscopy time, treatment DAP and air kerma were 33 min, 76 Gycm2 and 1.7 Gy in the EFD group and 81 min, 152 Gycm2 and 3.8 Gy in the coiling group, respectively (P < 0.001). In the EFD group, clinically relevant thromboembolic complications occurred in one patient (4%) vs. in 5 patients (28%) in the coiling group (P = 0.07). In each group, 4 patients had an unfavourable outcome at discharge (P = 0.7). Adequate occlusion rates were 96% in the EFD group and 100% and coiling group.

The anti-tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) demonstrates non-specific protective innate immune-boosting effects. Here, we determined if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion in a retrospective observational study of a diverse cohort of health care workers (HCWs). METHODS We assessed SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and collected medical questionnaires, including BCG vaccination status and pre-existing demographic and clinical characteristics, from an observational cohort of HCWs in a multi-site Los Angeles healthcare organization. We used multi-variate analysis to estimate if history of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection and seroconversion. RESULTS Of the 6,201 HCWs, 29.6% reported a history of BCG vaccination whereas 68.9% did not receive BCG vaccination. Seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG as well as incidence of self-reported clinical symptoms associated with COVID-19 were significantly decreased among HCWs with a history of BCG vaccination compared to those without BCG vaccination. After adjusting for age and sex, we found that history of BCG vaccination, but not meningococcal, pneumococcal or influenza vaccination, was associated with decreased SARS-CoV-2 IgG seroconversion. CONCLUSIONS History of BCG vaccination was associated with decreased seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and reduced reported COVID-19-related clinical symptoms in this cohort of HCWs. Therefore, large randomized prospective clinical trials of BCG vaccination are urgently needed to confirm if BCG vaccination can induced a protective effect against SARS-CoV2 infection.

Inhaled epoprostenol sodium (PGI2) and NO are administered for pulmonary hypertension after cardiothoracic surgery. This prospective study provides the first comparative evaluation of the effects of inhaled PGI2 and NO on pulmonary hemodynamics, systemic hemodynamics, and gas exchange in patients developing residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA. METHODS Thirteen patients were randomized to receive either NO (n = 6) or PGI2 (n = 7) inhalation when pulmonary hypertension persisted after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured before inhalation of the agent (T0); 30 min (T1), 3 h (T2), and 6 h after inhalation (T3); and the next morning (T4). The NO dose was started at 20 ppm and gradually tapered until extubation, and PGI2 was administered at a dose of 10 ng kg-1 min-1. RESULTS In both groups, mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) significantly decreased over time until T4 (mean PAP: p < 0.0001; PVR: p = 0.003), while mean systemic arterial blood pressure significantly increased (p = 0.028). There were no significant between-group differences in patient characteristics, cardiac index, left atrial pressure, or ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fraction of inspired oxygen. There were no in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS Both inhaled PGI2 and NO significantly reduced PAP and PVR without adverse effects on systemic hemodynamics in patients who developed residual pulmonary hypertension after PEA.

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) analyses of several B-NHL repositories revealed a conserved positive correlation between YY1 and survivin, both highly expressed, especially in aggressive B-NHLs. Further validation experiments performed in Raji Burkitt's lymphomas cells, demonstrated that YY1 silencing was associated with survivin downregulation and sensitized the cells to apoptosis. Overall, our results revealed that: (1) YY1 and survivin are positively correlated and overexpressed in B-NHLs, especially in BLs; (2) YY1 strongly binds to the survivin promoter, hence survivin may be suggested as YY1 transcriptional target; (3) YY1 silencing sensitizes Raji cells to drug-induced apoptosis via downregulation of survivin; (4) both YY1 and survivin are potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for the treatment of resistant/relapsed B-NHLs.","Vivarelli, Silvia; Falzone, Luca; Ligresti, Giovanni; Candido, Saverio; Garozzo, Adriana; Magro, Gaetano Giuseppe; Bonavida, Benjamin; Libra, Massimo",International journal of molecular sciences,488,1

It uniquely contributes to the growth-poverty-inequality discourse by using per capita consumption expenditure growth (poverty), Gini index (inequality) and GDP growth (economic growth). It is a comparative analysis of 58 Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and Latin American (LAC) countries (from 2000 to 2015) to determine whether economic growth reduces the incidence of poverty and if its interaction with income inequality enhances or alters its impact on poverty. Consistent findings from a multi-analytical approach using pooled ordinary least squares, fixed effects and system GMM reveal that: (1) economic growth exhibit poverty-reduction properties; (2) the growth rate of inequality intensifies poverty, (3) inequality aggravates the impact of growth on poverty, and (4) the growth-poverty-inequality trilemma differs across income groups and regional samples. Furthermore, this study submits that the interaction of income inequality dampens the positive impact of economic growth on the incidence of poverty and supports the argument that the extent of inequality lessens the effect of inclusiveness. Hence, income inequality is a crucial determinant of poverty. Policy implications are discussed.","Adeleye, Bosede Ngozi; Gershon, Obindah; Ogundipe, Adeyemi; Owolabi, Oluwarotimi; Ogunrinola, Ifeoluwa; Adediran, Oluwasogo",Heliyon,488,16

In this systematic review, we aimed to determine how antibiotic allergy labels influence 3 domains: antibiotic use and exposure, clinical outcomes, and healthcare-related costs. DESIGN We performed a systematic review to identify studies reporting outcomes in patients with antibiotic allergy labels compared to nonallergic counterparts. The search included PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EBSCO, Cochrane Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened studies for inclusion and abstracted data. Studies were graded using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. Study outcomes included antibiotic use, clinical outcomes, and economic outcomes. RESULTS In total, 41 studies met our criteria for inclusion. These studies varied in medical specialty, patient population, healthcare delivery system, and design, but most were conducted among adults age >18 years (85%) in the inpatient setting (82.5%). Among 34 studies examining antibiotic exposure, 32 (94%) found that patients with antibiotic allergy labels received more broad-spectrum antibiotics. Moreover, 31 studies examined clinical outcomes such as length of hospitalization, ICU admission, hospital readmission, multidrug-resistant or opportunistic infection, or mortality, and 27 (87%) found that allergy-labeled patients had at least 1 negative outcome. Of 9 studies examining healthcare costs, 7 (78%) found that allergy-labeled patients incurred significantly higher drug or hospital-related costs. CONCLUSIONS Antibiotic allergy labels have negative effects on antibiotic use, clinical outcomes, and economic outcomes in a variety of clinical settings and populations.","Krah, Nathan M; Jones, Trahern W; Lake, Joanita; Hersh, Adam L",Infection control and hospital epidemiology,488,4

The location and properties of the FPs in the spike (S) glycoproteins of different coronaviruses (CoV) have not yet been determined. Through amino acid sequence analysis of S proteins of representative CoVs, we identified a common region as a possible FP (pFP) that shares the characteristics of FPs of class I viral fusion proteins, including high Ala/Gly content, intermediate hydrophobicity, and few charged residues. To test the hypothesis that this region contains the CoV FP, we systemically mutated every residue in the pFP of Middle East respiratory syndrome betacoronavirus (MERS-CoV) and found that 11 of the 22 residues in the pFP (from G953 to L964, except for A956) were essential for S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and virus entry. The synthetic MERS-CoV pFP core peptide (955IAGVGWTAGL964) induced extensive fusion of liposome membranes, while mutant peptide failed to induce any lipid mixing. We also selectively mutated residues in pFPs of two other β-CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Although the amino acid sequences of these two pFPs differed significantly from that of MERS-CoV and each other, most of the pFP mutants of SARS-CoV and MHV also failed to mediate membrane fusion, suggesting that these pFPs are also the functional FPs. Thus, the FPs of 3 different lineages of β-CoVs are conserved in location within the S glycoproteins and in their functions, although their amino acid sequences have diverged significantly during CoV evolution. IMPORTANCE Within the class I viral fusion proteins of many enveloped viruses, the FP is the critical mediator of fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes leading to virus infection. FPs from within a virus family, like influenza viruses or human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), tend to share high amino acid sequence identity. In this study, we determined the location and amino acid sequences of the FPs of S glycoproteins of 3 β-CoVs, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and MHV, and demonstrated that they were essential for mediating cell-cell fusion and virus entry. Interestingly, in marked contrast to the FPs of influenza and HIV, the primary amino acid sequences of the FPs of β-CoVs in 3 different lineages differed significantly. Thus, during evolution the FPs of β-CoVs have diverged significantly in their primary sequences while maintaining the same essential biological functions. Our findings identify a potential new target for development of drugs against CoVs.","Ou, Xiuyuan; Zheng, Wangliang; Shan, Yiwei; Mu, Zhixia; Dominguez, Samuel R; Holmes, Kathryn V; Qian, Zhaohui",Journal of virology,488,7

Once an emerging epidemic is detected, public health authorities will attempt to mitigate the epidemic by, among other measures, reducing further spread as much as possible. Scarce and/or costly control measures such as vaccines, anti-infective drugs, and social distancing must be allocated while epidemiological characteristics of the disease remain uncertain. Here we present first principles for allocating scarce resources with limited data. We show that under a broad class of assumptions, the simple rule of targeting intervention measures at the group with the highest risk of infection per individual will achieve the largest reduction in the transmission potential of a novel infection. For vaccination of susceptible persons, the appropriate risk measure is force of infection; for social distancing, the appropriate risk measure is incidence of infection. Unlike existing methods that rely on detailed knowledge of group-specific transmission rates, the method described here can be implemented using only data that are readily available during an epidemic, and allows ready adaptation as the epidemic progresses. The need to observe risk of infection helps to focus the ongoing planning and design of new infectious disease surveillance programs; from the presented first principles for allocating scarce resources, we can adjust the prioritization of groups for intervention when new observations on an emerging epidemic become available.","Wallinga, Jacco; van Boven, Michiel; Lipsitch, Marc",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,488,31

Estimating the quality of life of women affected with severe preeclampsia could provide direction for further interventions. However, the current measurement of the quality of life has not been culturally adapted and validated for this population. This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and test the reliability and validity of the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life-Bref Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) in southern Ethiopia among women with severe preeclampsia. METHODS An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted in southern Ethiopia in selected hospitals with randomly recruited women with severe preeclampsia. Cultural adaptation and validation techniques were used to translate and adapt the WHOQOL-BREF scale. Face, content validity, forward and backward translations, and synthesis were computed using an expert panel. The scale was pretested and adjusted accordingly. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and test-retest reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient = ICC) were examined. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was computed to test the fit of the structure to the local setting before conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Multiple methods for determining the number of factors extracted (scree test, eigenvalues) were used. We compared the original English structure with the new structure in the study setting and extracted a new structure using EFA. RESULTS The internal consistency reliabilities ranged from 0.8045 to 0.9123 indicating good-to-excellent reliability. The item‑level content validity ranged from 0.86 to 1.00; the scale‑level content validity index was 0.97. In CFA, the model fit indices were unacceptable (Comparative Fit Index (CFI = 0.87), Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA = 0.23), Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR = 0.38), Tucker Lewis Index (TLI = 0.85) and (PCLOSE = 0.00). Three new factor structures were extracted using EFA for current research with a total variance was 91%. CONCLUSIONS The failure of the original scale in this study population highlights the importance of culturally adapting tool to local settings. EFA confirmed a three-factor structure, inconsistent with the original English structure.","Jikamo, Birhanu; Adefris, Mulat; Azale, Telake; Alemu, Kassahun",Health and quality of life outcomes,488,1

Developing an evaluation tool is essential to ensure that individuals reach a certain level of competence prior to performing this procedure independently. To achieve standardization and wide implementation, an assessment tool must be reflective of practice across many institutions. STUDY DESIGN The purpose of this study is to validate two procedure-specific evaluation tools for laparoscopic colorectal surgery that were developed using innovative consensus methodology. Two procedure-specific rating scales for laparoscopic right and sigmoid colectomy were created using the Delphi method. Nine novice and nine expert laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy videos were prospectively collected, and nine novice and ten expert laparoscopic right colectomy videos were recorded. The experts rated the videos using the procedure-specific technical skills evaluation tool for either laparoscopic right colectomy or laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy. RESULTS There were statistically significant differences between the expert and novice scores on the laparoscopic right colectomy evaluation tool: the median score of novices was 63.8% and the expert score was 73.1% (p = 0.02). Similarly, there was a significant difference between the median novice score on the sigmoid tool (58.6%) compared with the median expert score (70.7%) (p = 0.003). Cronbach's alpha was 0.82 for the right colectomy evaluation tool and 0.79 for the sigmoid rating scale. CONCLUSIONS The procedure-specific evaluation tools for laparoscopic right and sigmoid colectomy demonstrate strong reliability and construct validity, and have the potential to be used for technical skills assessment and feedback.","Palter, Vanessa N; Grantcharov, Teodor P",Surgical endoscopy,488,1

The experiment was a completely randomized design with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments and four replicates per treatment. A basal diet [10% barley silage, 87% dry-rolled barley grain, and 3% vitamin and mineral supplement, dry matter (DM) basis] and a DDGS diet (as per basal diet with 25% of wheat DDGS replacing an equal portion of barley grain) were supplemented with ROD extract at 0 and 1% (DM basis), respectively. The experimental period was 17 d, consisting 10 days of adaptation and 7 days of data and sample collection. The substitution of wheat DDGS for barley grain did not affect gas production; disappearances of DM, organic matter, and crude protein; total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production; and microbial protein production. However, replacing barley grain with wheat DDGS increased (P = 0.01) fermenter pH and molar proportion of branched-chain VFA, switched (P = 0.06) the fermentation pattern to higher acetate production due to increased (P = 0.01) disappearance of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and decreased (P = 0.08) methane (CH4) production. In the basal barley diet, the ROD extract increased the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio (P = 0.08) and reduced the disappearance of starch (P = 0.06) with no effect on any other variables. No effects of ROD in the DDGS diet were observed. The number of operational taxonomic unit (OTUs) and the Shannon diversity index of the microbial community had little variation among treatments. Taxonomic analysis revealed no effect of adding the ROD extract on the relative abundance of bacteria at the phylum level with either the basal diet or DDGS diet, while at the genus level, the microbial community was affected by the addition of both DDGS and the ROD extract. Prevotella and Fibrobacter were the most abundant genera in the basal diet; however, Treponema became the most abundant genus with the addition of the ROD extract. These results indicated that the substitution of wheat DDGS for barley grain may mitigate enteric CH4 emissions. The trend of reduced starch fermentability and increased NDF disappearance with the addition of ROD extract suggests a reduced risk of rumen acidosis and an improvement in the utilization of fiber for cattle-fed high-grain diet.","Gomaa, Walaa Mohamed Sayed; Saleem, Atef Mohamed; Ran, Tao; Jin, Long; Samir, Mohamed; McGeough, Emma J; Ominski, Kim; Chen, Lingyun; Yang, Wenzhu",Frontiers in veterinary science,488,19

To explore the diversity of deltacoronaviruses in animals in the Middle East, we tested fecal samples from 1,356 mammals and birds in Dubai, The United Arab Emirates. Four novel deltacoronaviruses were detected from eight birds of four species by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR): FalCoV UAE-HKU27 from a falcon, HouCoV UAE-HKU28 from a houbara bustard, PiCoV UAE-HKU29 from a pigeon, and QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 from five quails. Complete genome sequencing showed that FalCoV UAE-HKU27, HouCoV UAE-HKU28, and PiCoV UAE-HKU29 belong to the same CoV species, suggesting recent interspecies transmission between falcons and their prey, houbara bustards and pigeons, possibly along the food chain. Western blotting detected specific anti-FalCoV UAE-HKU27 antibodies in 33 (75%) of 44 falcon serum samples, supporting genuine infection in falcons after virus acquisition. QuaCoV UAE-HKU30 belongs to the same CoV species as porcine coronavirus HKU15 (PorCoV HKU15) and sparrow coronavirus HKU17 (SpCoV HKU17), discovered previously from swine and tree sparrows, respectively, supporting avian-to-swine transmission. Recombination involving the spike protein is common among deltacoronaviruses, which may facilitate cross-species transmission.

This is because: (1) ruptured bAVMs have not been considered as catastrophic as ruptured cerebral aneurysms, (2) surgical resection is aided by waiting for brain edema to resolve and clot to liquefy and (3) fear exists that partially treated bAVMs may be more dangerous than those untreated. The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of acute embolization in patients with ruptured bAVMs. METHODS 21 consecutive patients who underwent acute embolization of ruptured bAVMs from 2007 to 2011 were retrospectively reviewed. All treatments consisted of embolization exclusively using Onyx liquid embolic agent. Neurological outcomes were assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at hospital discharge following initial treatment. RESULTS Nine patients (43%) were male, mean age was 38 years (range 8-75) and initial embolization was performed at a median of 4 days after ictus (mean 5.8, range 0-19). Spetzler-Martin grades ranged from I to VI (mean 3, median 3). In seven patients (33%) the AVM was completely occluded with a single treatment. With subsequent embolizations, complete occlusion occurred in four additional patients (19%). Six patients (29%) had post-embolization AVM resection and one patient (5%) had post-embolization gamma knife irradiation. None has suffered subsequent hemorrhages (mean follow-up 7.5 months).

In this study, we prepared core-shell particles using a melanin precursor polymer, that is, polytyrosine (PTy), as a shell layer by the oxidative polymerization of tyrosine ethyl ester (Ty) in the presence of cerium oxide (CeO2) core particles. Inspired by skin tanning, irradiating the CeO2@PTy core-shell particles with UV or natural sunlight caused melanization by extending the π-conjugated length of PTy, producing colloidal particles with the ability to absorb light. The pellet samples consisting of CeO2@PTy particles appeared whitish because of multiple scattered light. In contrast, the light absorption capacity of CeO2@PTy UV or CeO2@PTy Sun particles after light irradiation suppressed scattered light, dramatically improving the visibility of the structural color of the pellet samples made from these particles. Thus, a new method has been developed to control the visualization of structural colors to the human eye by irradiating the melanin precursor polymer with light.","Okoshi, Taku; Iwasaki, Takeshi; Takahashi, Shimon; Iwasaki, Yasuhiko; Kishikawa, Keiki; Kohri, Michinari",Biomacromolecules,488,26

In threshold-tracking SICI (T-SICI), stimulus intensity is instead adjusted repeatedly to maintain a constant MEP and inhibition is measured as the relative threshold increase. T-SICI is emerging as a useful diagnostic test, but its relationship to conventional amplitude SICI (A-SICI) is unclear. OBJECTIVE To compare T-SICI and its reliability with conventional A-SICI measurements. METHODS In twelve healthy volunteers (6 men, median age 30 years), conventional and T-SICI were recorded at conditioning stimuli (CS) of 50-80% resting motor threshold (RMT) and interstimulus interval of 2.5 ms. Measurements were repeated on the same day and at least a week later by a single operator. RESULTS Across the CS range, mean group T-SICI showed a strong linear relationship to the mean group values measured by conventional technique (y = 29.7-0.3x, R2 = 0.99), but there was considerable interindividual variability. At CS 60-80% RMT, T-SICI had excellent intraday (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC, 0.81-0.92) and adequate-to-excellent interday (ICC 0.61-0.88) reproducibility. Conventional SICI took longer to complete (median of 5.8 vs 3.8 min, p < 0.001) and tended to have poorer reproducibility (ICC 0.17-0.42 intraday, 0.37-0.51 interday). With T-SICI, smaller sample sizes were calculated for equally powered interventional studies. CONCLUSION The close relationship between conventional and T-SICI suggests that both techniques reflect similar cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Threshold-tracking measurements of SICI may be able to improve reproducibility, to shorten acquisition time and to reduce sample sizes for interventional studies compared with the conventional technique.","Samusyte, Gintaute; Bostock, Hugh; Rothwell, John; Koltzenburg, Martin",Brain stimulation,488,1

However, most studies have focused on the behavioral effects of induction and recovery, without addressing the effect of anesthetic on neural activity. This study investigated the neural response of anterior lateral line afferent fibers in the oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, during exposure to incremental increases of AQUI-S 20E (0.001-0.006%), to determine if eugenol (the active ingredient of AQUI-S 20E) influences neural activity of the fish lateral line system. Ventilation rate significantly decreased following AQUI-S 20E exposure with the surgical plane of anesthesia reached at 0.003%, characterized by shallow ventilation, equilibrium loss, and no response to tactile stimuli. Spontaneous and evoked firing rates of anterior lateral line fibers also significantly decreased following exposure, although the effect was transitory as neural activity recovered in the majority of fibers (70%) within 30 min of anesthetic withdrawal. While AQUI-S 20E proved effective in inducing the surgical plane of anesthesia without compromising survival, it is not recommended for acute neural preparations due to its depression of neural activity. However, the depression of lateral line sensitivity at low concentrations could play a role in reducing the stress response during fish transport.","Putland, Rosalyn; Rogers, Loranzie; Giuffrida, Beth; Mensinger, Allen",Fish physiology and biochemistry,488,1

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, controlled, blocked (horse) design. ANIMALS Adult horses (n = 6). METHODS Each horse received bilateral, tenoscopic-guided ALSDFT desmotomy with a SaberRF and tenotomy knife, randomly assigned to left, or right limb. The desmotomy duration and intraoperative hemorrhage grades were recorded. Postoperatively, the grades for surgical incision, carpal sheath effusion, carpal range of motion, flexion pain, and lameness were recorded. Light microscopy using hematoxylin and eosin, and viability staining were performed on the ALSDFT, flexor carpi radialis tendon, radial head of the deep digital flexor tendon, and the deep digital flexor tendon. Variables were compared between desmotomy methods with a paired t-test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, or a repeated measures mixed model. Statistical significance was set at P < .05. RESULTS Desmotomy of the ALSDFT was completed in all horses. Only mild hemorrhage was observed and not different between methods (SaberRF 2/5 limbs; tenotomy knife 5/6 limbs, P = .078). Carpal sheath effusion was greater for SaberRF at Day 1 (P = .019) but not different from tenotomy knife at any later time. There was no significant difference between methods for viability staining or other measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Tenoscopic-guided ALSDFT desmotomy with the SaberRF probe showed no difference in measured outcomes to sharp transection with a tenotomy knife and minimal collateral tissue damage was observed.","Nelson, Brad B; Kawcak, Chris E; Ehrhart, E J; Goodrich, Laurie R",Veterinary surgery : VS,488,1

METHODS In an effort to increase screening rates and ensure equal access with respect to race/ethnicity, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene formed a coalition of stakeholders in 2003, with its primary focus on colonoscopy, to develop and implement strategies across the city to achieve this goal. RESULTS From a screening colonoscopy rate of only 42% in 2003, these concerted efforts contributed to achieving a screening rate of 62% by 2007 and a screening rate of almost 70% in 2014 with the elimination of racial and ethnic disparities. CONCLUSIONS This article provides details of how this program was successfully conceived, implemented, and sustained in the large urban population of New York City. The authors hope that by sharing the many elements involved and the lessons learned, they may help other communities to adapt these experiences to their own environments so that CRC screening rates can be maximized.

Concerns have been raised about the impact of ablation scars on the left atrium. This study aimed to examine the impact of ablation on left atrial dimension and systolic function after modified endoscopic procedures with echocardiographic measurement. METHODS Of 107 patients undergoing modified endoscopic ablation, 58 had paroxysmal AF and 49 had persistent or long-standing AF. The procedure was performed on the beating heart through three ports on the left chest wall. Three circular and two linear lesions were made on the left atrium. The left atrial appendage was excised by stapler. Echocardiography was performed preoperatively and at the 2-year follow-up. RESULTS Most patients (86.9%) patients were in sinus rhythm (SR) postoperatively. Fourteen patients (5 with paroxysmal AF and 9 with persistent/long-standing AF) failed to maintain SR. Echocardiographic data indicated that the left atrial diameter decreased only in the patients with postoperative SR but continued to increase in patients with fail SR maintenance. Left atrial function was also improved after the procedure, especially in patients with preoperative nonparoxysmal AF or with postoperative SR maintenance. Furthermore, left atrial function in patients who failed to restore SR was not worsened even with left atrial appendage excision. CONCLUSIONS Modified endoscopic procedure for AF improved post-procedural left atrial function of patients with SR maintenance.

Our aim was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of flow diversion treatment of distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients with distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms treated from January 2014 to October 2017 were evaluated retrospectively with prospectively maintained data. Treatment was performed only for unruptured or recanalized aneurysms after coiling. Technical feasibility, procedural complications, aneurysm occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale), and clinical outcome were evaluated. RESULTS Fifteen patients were included in the study, with 17 distal anterior cerebral artery saccular aneurysms treated with flow-diverter stents. Mean aneurysm size was 4.25 ± 3.9 mm; range, 2-9 mm. Flow diversion was used as retreatment among 6 previously coiled aneurysms (5 ruptured and coiled in the acute phase, and 1 unruptured and recanalized). Stent deployment was technically successful in all cases. During the perioperative period, 1 patient experienced a transient minor stroke (6%), whereas 2 patients reported acute in-stent thrombosis with disabling ischemic complications (13%). Fourteen patients and 16 aneurysms were available during a mean radiologic follow-up of 12 months (range, 3-24 months). Overall, 12 (75%) aneurysms were completely occluded (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale score D), 1 aneurysm (6%) showed near-complete occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale score C), and 3 aneurysms (19%) were incompletely occluded (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale, score B). All 6 aneurysms previously coiled were completely occluded after flow diversion, whereas 70% of aneurysms treated with flow diverters alone showed complete/near-complete occlusion (O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale C-D). There were no cases of aneurysm rupture, in-stent occlusion, or retreatment during long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Treatment of distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms with flow-diverter stents is feasible and effective, with high rates of aneurysm occlusion. Flow diversion plus coiling, in the retreatment of lesions previously coiled, allowed higher rates of occlusion compared with flow diverters alone. However, the risk of ischemic complications is not negligible, and flow-diversion treatment should be evaluated only for aneurysms not amenable to simple coil embolization.","Cagnazzo, F; Cappucci, M; Dargazanli, C; Lefevre, P-H; Gascou, G; Riquelme, C; Bonafe, A; Costalat, V",AJNR.

Some of the affected children need surgery with ventilation tubes in the tympanic membrane to reduce ear complaints and to improve hearing, middle ear function, and health-related quality of life. This is one of the most common ambulatory surgeries performed on children. Postoperative controls are needed to assess that the tubes are functional, to evaluate whether hearing loss has been improved, and to handle potential complications. The follow-up may continue for years and are usually done by otolaryngologists. Nevertheless, there exist no evidence-based guidelines concerning the level of expertise needed for postoperative controls of the ventilation tubes. The aim of this protocol is to describe the ConVenTu study that evaluates whether postoperative controls performed by general practitioners (GPs) represent a safe and sufficient alternative to controls performed by otolaryngologists. METHODS/DESIGN Multicenter randomized non-inferiority study conducted in clinical settings in seven hospitals located in Norway. Discharged children with ventilation tubes, aged 3-10 years, are allocated randomly to receive postoperative controls by either an otolaryngologist at the hospital where they had ventilation tube surgery or their regular GP. Study participants are enrolled consecutively until 200 patients are included in each group. Two years after surgery, we will compare the pure tone average of hearing thresholds (primary endpoint) and middle ear function, complication rate, health-related quality of life and the parents' evaluations of the postoperative care (secondary endpoints). DISCUSSION This protocol describes the first randomized non-inferiority study of GPs performing postoperative controls after surgery with ventilation tubes. Results from this study may be utilized for deriving evidence-based clinical practice guidelines of the level of postoperative controls after ventilation tube surgery which is safe and sufficient.

I then propose that the federal government organize a national effort for ventilators to be exchanged between states to take advantage of the inter-temporal differences in demand peaks. I evaluate versions of this proposal, including use of the national stockpile, to estimate the number of lives that could be saved, and observe that it is potentially substantial.

Objective To perform a systematic review to evaluate the evidence on effectiveness and feasibility of different processes used for decontaminating N95 respirators. Evidence Review A search of PubMed and EMBASE (through January 31, 2021) was completed for 5 types of respirator-decontaminating processes including UV irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist-heat incubation, microwave-generated steam, and ethylene oxide. Data were abstracted on process method, pathogen removal, mask filtration efficiency, facial fit, user safety, and processing capability. Findings Forty-two studies were included that examined 65 total types of masks. All were laboratory studies (no clinical trials), and 2 evaluated respirator performance and fit with actual clinical use of N95 respirators. Twenty-seven evaluated UV germicidal irradiation, 19 vaporized hydrogen peroxide, 9 moist-heat incubation, 10 microwave-generated steam, and 7 ethylene oxide. Forty-three types of N95 respirators were treated with UV irradiation. Doses of 1 to 2 J/cm2 effectively sterilized most pathogens on N95 respirators (>103 reduction in influenza virus [4 studies], MS2 bacteriophage [3 studies], Bacillus spores [2 studies], Escherichia virus MS2 [1 study], vesicular stomatitis virus [1 study], and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus/SARS-CoV-1 [1 study]) without degrading respirator components. Doses higher than 1.5 to 2 J/cm2 may be needed based on 2 studies demonstrating greater than 103 reduction in SARS-CoV-2. Vaporized hydrogen peroxide eradicated the pathogen in all 7 efficacy studies (>104 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 [3 studies] and >106 reduction of Bacillus and Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores [4 studies]). Pressurized chamber systems with higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide caused FFR damage (6 studies), while open-room systems did not degrade respirator components. Moist heat effectively reduced SARS-CoV-2 (2 studies), influenza virus by greater than 104 (2 studies), vesicular stomatitis virus (1 study), and Escherichia coli (1 study) and preserved filtration efficiency and facial fit for 11 N95 respirators using preheated containers/chambers at 60 °C to 85 °C (5 studies); however, diminished filtration performance was seen for the Caron incubator. Microwave-generated steam (1100-W to 1800-W devices; 40 seconds to 3 minutes) effectively reduced pathogens by greater than 103 (influenza virus [2 studies], MS2 bacteriophage [3 studies], and Staphylococcus aureus [1 study]) and maintained filtration performance in 10 N95 respirators; however, damage was noted in least 1 respirator type in 4 studies. In 6 studies, ethylene oxide preserved respirator components in 16 N95 respirator types but left residual carcinogenic by-product (1 study). Conclusions and Relevance Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, vaporized hydrogen peroxide, moist heat, and microwave-generated steam processing effectively sterilized N95 respirators and retained filtration performance. Ultraviolet irradiation and vaporized hydrogen peroxide damaged respirators the least. More research is needed on decontamination effectiveness for SARS-CoV-2 because few studies specifically examined this pathogen.","Schumm, Max A; Hadaya, Joseph E; Mody, Nisha; Myers, Bethany A; Maggard-Gibbons, Melinda",JAMA,488,1

The pressure on resources is expected to increase with the continuing rise of cardiovascular disease, other chronic diseases and extended life expectancy, while expenditure is constrained. The objective of this review is to assess if home-based solutions for measuring chemical cardiac biomarkers can mitigate or reduce the continued rise in the costs of ACS treatment. A systematic review was performed considering published literature in several relevant public databases (i.e., PUBMED, Cochrane, Embase and Scopus) focusing on current biomarker practices in high-risk patients, their cost-effectiveness and the clinical evidence and feasibility of implementation. Out of 26,000 references screened, 86 met the inclusion criteria after independent full-text review. Current clinical evidence highlights that home-based solutions implemented in primary and secondary prevention reduce health care costs by earlier diagnosis, improved patient outcomes and quality of life, as well as by avoidance of unnecessary use of resources. Economical evidence suggests their potential to reduce health care costs if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio or the willingness-to-pay does not surpass £20,000/QALY or €50,000 limit per 20,000 patients, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of these solutions increases when applied to high-risk patients.","Redón, Pau; Shahzad, Atif; Iqbal, Talha; Wijns, William",Sensors,488,12

METHODS This was an ecological study, based on secondary data on incidence and mortality rates for COVID-19. Data were analyzed at the state level, having the Gini coefficient as the main independent variable. Records of twelve days were used, spaced one week each, between April 21th and June 7th, 2020. The weekly variation in the rates was calculated through Prais-Winsten regression, aiming at measuring the evolution of the pandemic in each FU. Spearman's correlation test was used to assess correlation between the rates and their weekly evolution and the independent variables. Lastly, a spatial dependence diagnosis was conducted, and a Spatial Regression lag model was used when applicable. RESULTS Incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 increased in all Brazilian FUs, being more pronounced among those with greater economic inequality. Association between Gini coefficient and COVID-19 incidence and mortality rates remained even when demographic and spatial aspects were taken into account.

The concept was developed in reaction to the recent AI surge and corresponding demand for foundational teaching on the subject to a broad and diverse audience, with on-site teaching of small classes in mind and designed to build on the specific strengths in motivational public speaking of the lecturers. The research question and focus of our evaluation is to what extent the concept serves this purpose, specifically taking into account the necessary but unforeseen transfer to ongoing hybrid and fully online teaching since March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution is two-fold: besides (i) presenting a general didactic concept for tertiary engineering education in AI and ML, ready for adoption, we (ii) draw conclusions from the comparison of qualitative student evaluations (n = 24–30) and quantitative exam results (n = 62–113) of two full semesters under pandemic conditions with the result of previous years (participants from Zurich, Switzerland). This yields specific recommendations for the adoption of any technical curriculum under flexible teaching conditions—be it on-site, hybrid, or online. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

However, these symptoms are among the psychiatric symptoms that are often overlooked. This study evaluates the relationship between somatization symptoms and empathy skills during the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: The study has a descriptive cross-sectional design. The study sample consists of a total of 1029 people, 658 of whom are healthcare workers and 371 of whom are non-health workers. The study used the measurement tools of Somatization Scale, Empathy Quotient Scale, Perception of COVID-19 (sub-dimension;dangerousness, contagiousness), and Avoidance Attitudes from COVID-19 (subdimension;behavioral avoidance, cognitive avoidance). Results: There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of marital status (p&lt;0.001). The perception that the COVID-19 may lead to dangerous outcomes was an important variable that predicted healthcare workers' somatization symptoms (p&lt;0.001). There was no significant relationship between somatization symptoms and the perception of COVID-19 dangerousness in non-healthcare workers (p=0.097). An increased risk perception associated with COVID-19 both in healthcare workers and other workers was found to have a reducing effect on the empathy ability of individuals. Conclusion: The vicious circle between somatization symptoms and perception of danger is a serious problem for healthcare workers. Increasing perception of the dangerousness associated with COVID-19 in both healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers has decreased the empathy ability of individuals. This may disrupt interpersonal relationships in the later stages of the pandemic.","Koc, M.; Seyran, F.; Genis, B.; Sirin, B.; Gurhan, N.; Cosar, B.",Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences,488,26

AIM: The study aimed to describe the characteristics and appraise potential risk factors of COVID-19 transmission among HCWs who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in one of Cairo University Hospitals. METHOD: Cross-sectional descriptive analysis of confirmed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive versus negative cases for COVID-19. RESULTS: Through March–June 2020, (145/846;17%) suspected HCWs were tested for COVID-19 by PCR;out of them (70/145;48.3%) were confirmed as positive, these positive cases represented (70/846;8.3%) of all HCWs of the hospital. About 33% of confirmed COVID-19 positive HCWs acquired the infection from the healthcare while only (13/70;19%) from community settings, and no clear exposure data were identified in (34/70;48%) of cases. Most of symptomatic cases showed a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 versus asymptomatic cases, p < 0.001. There was no statistical significance regarding gender, age, presence of comorbidity, workload or the type of acquisition.

We show that in the integrable setting, linear anisotropic osmosis minimises an energy that involves a suitable quadratic form which models local directional structures. In our shadow removal applications we estimate the local structure via a modified tensor voting approach (Moreno, 2012) and use this information within an anisotropic diffusion inpainting that resembles edge-enhancing anisotropic diffusion inpainting (Weickert, 2006, Gali\'c, 2008). Our numerical scheme combines the nonnegativity preserving stencil of Fehrenbach and Mirebeau (Fehrenbach, 2014) with an exact time stepping based on highly accurate polynomial approximations of the matrix exponential. The resulting anisotropic model is tested on several synthetic and natural images corrupted by constant shadows.

Effective PrEP requires daily PrEP adherence, but little is known about maternal PrEP continuation and risk factors that influence optimal PrEP use. Methods: The PrEP in pregnancy and postpartum (PrEP-PP) study is an ongoing cohort study that enrolled consenting pregnant, HIV-uninfected women at first antenatal care (ANC) visit, followed through 12-months postpartum. HIV-uninfected women and girls >16-years who were eligible for the study received HIV prevention counseling and were offered PrEP. Interviewers collected socio-demographic, behavioral data from participants at each visit. We analyzed the proportion of women who initiated PrEP and the proportion who continued on PrEP after 3-months with associated correlates, including side effects whilst on PrEP, by estimating the prevalence ratio (95% CI) adjusting for a priori confounders. Results: Between August 2019 and February 2021, we enrolled 891 pregnant women (median gestation=21wks; age=26yrs). Following PrEP counseling, 90% of women initiated PrEP at their first ANC visit (n=801); 60% were married or cohabiting. Three-quarters of women on PrEP returned for a repeat prescription at 1-month; 62% returned at 3-months. One-third of women on PrEP reported a side effect, mostly nausea/vomiting, dizziness, and headache. Women on PrEP in the 1st or 2nd trimester had higher odds of reporting side effects (aOR=2.61; 95%CI=1.17-5.84) vs. postpartum women. Women who reported side effects continued with PrEP less than those who did not report side effects (aPR=0.88; 95% CI=0.78-0.99) adjusting for covariates. Women who had >1 previous pregnancy (aPR=0.76;95%CI=0.59-1.00) or were postpartum (aPR=0.86;95%CI=0.75-0.99) continued less than women who were primigravid or pregnant. Women who reported having an HIV+ partner (aPR= 1.70;95% CI=1.55-1.86) or unknown partner serostatus (aPR=1.14;95%CI=1.01-1.29) were more likely to continue on PrEP than those who had HIV-negative partners. Conclusion: PrEP initiation and early continuation were high in ANC in this setting. Being postpartum and experiencing side effects were associated with lower PrEP continuation, presenting an opportunity for improved clinical management and counseling during pregnancy of nausea/vomiting to address early, transient side effects. Interventions for postpartum women on PrEP are urgently needed.","Joseph Davey, D. L.; Mvududu, R.; Mashele, N.; Lesosky, M.; Bekker, L.-G.; Khadka, N.; More, J.; Gorbach, P.; Coates, T.

We hypothesized that Machine Learning (ML) models could be used to predict risks at different stages of management (at diagnosis, hospital admission and ICU admission) and thereby provide insights into drivers and prognostic markers of disease progression and death. MethodsFrom a cohort of approx. 2.6 million citizens in the two regions of Denmark, SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed on subjects suspected for COVID-19 disease; 3944 cases had at least one positive test and were subjected to further analysis. A cohort of SARS- CoV-2 positive cases from the United Kingdom Biobank was used for external validation. FindingsThe ML models predicted the risk of death (Receiver Operation Characteristics - Area Under the Curve, ROC-AUC) of 0.904 at diagnosis, 0.818, at hospital admission and 0.723 at Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. Similar metrics were achieved for predicted risks of hospital and ICU admission and use of mechanical ventilation. We identified some common risk factors, including age, body mass index (BMI) and hypertension as driving factors, although the top risk features shifted towards markers of shock and organ dysfunction in ICU patients. The external validation indicated fair predictive performance for mortality prediction, but suboptimal performance for predicting ICU admission. InterpretationML may be used to identify drivers of progression to more severe disease and for prognostication patients in patients with COVID-19. Prognostic features included age, BMI and hypertension, although markers of shock and organ dysfunction became more important in more severe cases.

The main aim of this study was to understand the reasons for the non-enforcement of the anti-tobacco legislation. To do this, we created two different questionnaires, one for smokers and one for non-smokers, and we collected epidemiological data, data about the attitudes of Greeks towards smoking, second-hand smoke, and the smoke-free legislation, as well as data about some relevant behavioural patterns. In total 597 non-smoker questionnaires and 366 smoker questionnaires were collected, with the mean age of the participants being 40 years old. The majority of people claimed that smoke disturbs them and, interestingly, smokers responded that they consider disturbing others with their smoke, and especially when children are present. Additionally, smokers said they would slightly reduce going out if the smoke-free legislation was strictly enforced, while non-smokers would respectively slightly increase going out. Based on this observation and given the higher proportion of non-smokers than smokers, we can assume that there will be no negative impact to the eating and drinking establishments, as many people were speculating, but to the opposite, there might even be a small benefit from the implementation of smoke-free measures. Since 2019 the relevant legislation has been enforced, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the long-term implementation and the true outcomes of the relevant legislation are more difficult to study.","Passa, A.; Agtzidis, I.; Tsaousidou, M.; Fekete Passa, K.",,488,25

The objective of this study was to assess the detection of influenza D virus (IDV) in bovine respiratory tract samples using two sequencing platforms (MiSeq and Nanopore (GridION)), and species-specific qPCR. An IDV-specific qPCR was performed on 232 samples (116 nasal swabs and 116 tracheal washes) that had been previously subject to virome sequencing using MiSeq. Nanopore sequencing was performed on 19 samples positive for IDV by either MiSeq or qPCR. Nanopore sequence data was analyzed by two bioinformatics methods: What’s In My Pot (WIMP, on the EPI2ME platform), and an in-house developed analysis pipeline. The agreement of IDV detection between qPCR and MiSeq was 82.3%, between qPCR and Nanopore was 57.9% (in-house) and 84.2% (WIMP), and between MiSeq and Nanopore was 89.5% (in-house) and 73.7% (WIMP). IDV was detected by MiSeq in 14 of 17 IDV qPCR-positive samples with Cq (cycle quantification) values below 31, despite multiplexing 50 samples for sequencing. When qPCR was regarded as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of MiSeq sequence detection were 28.3% and 98.9%, respectively. We conclude that both MiSeq and Nanopore sequencing are capable of detecting IDV in clinical specimens with a range of Cq values. Sensitivity may be further improved by optimizing sequence data analysis, improving virus enrichment, or reducing the degree of multiplexing.","Zhang, Maodong; Huang, Yanyun; Godson, Dale L.; Fernando, Champika; Alexander, Trevor W.; Hill, Janet E.",bioRxiv,488,20

However, due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an expansion of telehealth and allowance for billable services for pharmacists. Objectives: The objective of this study was to complete a retrospective review to assess reimbursement of clinical services provided by pharmacists via telehealth during the pandemic in a primary care setting. Methods: A report was generated which identified patients 18 years and older, who were provided services by pharmacists within a primary care group via telehealth during March to July 2020 in New York. It identified patients with an appointment type code of “PharmD Telemed 30” or “PharmD TM Follow UP 15,” including Medicare Annual Wellness Visits or AWVs (G0438-G0439) with procedural codes, and incident-to CPT codes (99211-99214). Information received included medical record number, name, date of birth, carrier plan name, billed procedure code and description, carrier payment amount, and patient responsible amount. Results: A total of 485 patients were provided services during the timeframe. There were 223 encounters billed for the 99 211 CPT code, 156 of which received payment from insurers with an average of $20.14. For initial and subsequent AWVs there were a total of 48 and 150 encounters, respectively, billed by the pharmacists. Forty-one of the encounters billed as a G0438 received payment from insurers with an average of $175.75. One hundred thirty-three of the encounters billed as a G0439 received payment from insurers with an average payment of $114.09. Conclusion: The results of this study provided insight into whether specific services or insurances should be targeted for payment of services. Expansion of these services could show improvement in patient care and can assist in gathering outcomes to better support pharmacists gaining provider status on the state and national level.","Murray, B.

Whether CNNs could also inform the epidemiology of COVID-19 analysing street images has been understudied, though it could identify high-risk places and relevant features of the built environment. We trained CNNs to classify bus stops (Lima, Peru) into moderate or extreme COVID-19 risk. Methods: We used five images per bus stop. The outcome label (moderate or extreme) for each bus stop was extracted from the local transport authority. We used transfer learning and updated the output layer of five CNNs: NASNetLarge, InceptionResNetV2, Xception, ResNet152V2, and ResNet101V2. We chose the best performing network which was further tuned to increase performance. Results: There were 1,788 bus stops (1,173 moderate and 615 extreme), totalling 8,940 images. NASNetLarge outperformed the other CNNs except in the recall metric for the extreme label: 57% versus 59% in NASNetLarge and ResNet152V2, respectively. NASNetLarge was further tuned and reached: training loss of 0.50; training accuracy of 75%; precision, recall and F1 score for the moderate label of 80%, 83% and 82%, respectively; these metrics for the extreme label were 65%, 51% and 63%.

The recent development of real-time EEG-triggered transcranial magnetic stimulation (EEG-TMS) allows studying this relationship in a causal fashion. Specifically, it has been shown that corticospinal excitability is higher during the scalp surface negative EEG peak compared to the positive peak of µ-oscillations in sensorimotor cortex, as indexed by larger motor evoked potentials (MEPs) for fixed stimulation intensity. Objective We further characterize the effect of µ-rhythm phase on the MEP input-output (IO) curve by measuring the degree of excitability modulation across a range of stimulation intensities. We furthermore seek to optimize stimulation parameters to enable discrimination of functionally relevant EEG-defined brain states. Methods A real-time EEG-TMS system was used to trigger MEPs during instantaneous brain-states corresponding to µ-rhythm surface positive and negative peaks with five different stimulation intensities covering an individually calibrated MEP IO curve in 15 healthy participants. Results MEP amplitude is modulated by µ-phase across a wide range of stimulation intensities, with larger MEPs at the surface negative peak. The largest relative MEP-modulation was observed for weak intensities, the largest absolute MEP-modulation for intermediate intensities. These results indicate a leftward shift of the MEP IO curve during the µ-rhythm negative peak. Conclusion The choice of stimulation intensity influences the observed degree of corticospinal excitability modulation by µ-phase.

In the present work, we have examined the unevenness of global distribution of Covid-19 incidences till 18th June 2021 in terms of the economic condition of countries. Subsequently, we have tried to identify the main underlying factors behind unequal Covid-19 cases. Our analysis suggests that the degree of Isolation, the diffusion of coronavirus (interconnectivity), and the percentage of elderly people in the population are the main causes of the different unequal spread of Covid-19 cases in different countries.

Existing workflows process vessel tracks to identify fishing activity and integrate information on species vulnerability. However, there are significant data integration challenges across the data sources needed for an integrated impact assessment due to heterogeneous nomenclatures, data accessibility issues, geographical and computational scalability of the processes, and confidentiality and transparency towards decision making authorities. This paper presents an Open Science data integration approach to use vessel tracking data in integrated impact assessments. Our approach combines heterogeneous knowledge sources from fisheries, biodiversity, and environmental observations to infer fishing activity and risks to potentially impacted species. An Open Science e-Infrastructure facilitates access to data sources and maximises the reproducibility of the results and the method's reusability across several application domains. Our method's quality is assessed through three case studies: The first demonstrates cross-dataset consistency by comparing the results obtained from two different vessel data sources. The second performs a temporal pattern analysis of fishing activity and potentially impacted species over time. The third assesses the potential impact of reduced fishing pressure on marine biodiversity and threatened species due to the 2020 COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. The method is meant to be integrated with other systems through its Open Science-oriented features and can rapidly use new sources of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data. Other systems can use it to (i) classify vessel activity in data-limited scenarios, (ii) identify bycatch species (when catchability data are available), and (iii) study the effects of fisheries on habitats and populations’ growth.","Coro, Gianpaolo Ellenbroek Anton Pagano Pasquale",Ecological Informatics,488,16

A case study is conducted on the structural analysis of the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and the human cell receptor ACE2. Although the surface domains of both spike proteins are highly similar, their receptor binding domains(RBDs) and the O-linked glycan domains are structurally different. Statistically, the outer surface of ACE2 displays less correlation with the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 than that of SARS-CoV. The O-linked glycan domain of SARS-CoV-2 is highly positively charged, which may promote binding to negatively charged human cells.

The idea of using audio-based processing methods to evaluate cough events, one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, in terms of their frequency, severity and characterization has become a promising possible solution. In addition to physical distancing measures, the vast majority of the health authority also recommends the adoption of face coverings (i.e. masks) while in the presence of others and covering one's cough with a bent elbow. The covering of cough events may present an issue when evaluating recordings using pre-existing cough analysis tools. This paper presents a modeling approach used to characterize the effects of both coughing while wearing a mask and coughing into a bent elbow. These two models were then applied to an existing dataset for evaluating the influence of the face coverings on selected data features that have been used for differentiating wet and dry cough types. It was found that one of the features (number of peaks in the energy spectrum) did not change after mask and elbow modeling, however the second feature (power ratio) was greatly affected and was unable to differentiate between the cough types. The application of these models are therefore recommended when using classification tools that were designed using uncovered clear cough sounds in order to ensure that they will be robust to the presence of face coverings. © 2021 IEEE.","Cohen-Mcfarlane, M.; Xi, P.; Wallace, B.; Valdes, J.

We exposed human bronchial epithelial cell (NCI-H292) to cigarette smoke and to aerosol from ENDS. All the exposure were conducted at air-liquid interface to assess cytotoxicity effects of smoke and aerosol. Moreover, we aimed to assess different inflammatory mediators release (IL-6, IL-8 and MMP-1) from cells exposed to whole smoke and to smoke without particulate matter (vapor phase). We were able to replicate the results obtained in the original studies on cytotoxicity confirming that almost 80% of the cytotoxic effect of smoke is due to the vapor phase of smoke. Moreover, our results substantiated the reduced cytotoxic effects of ENDS aerosol in respect to cigarette smoke. However, our data are significantly different from the original ones in terms of inflammatory and remodeling activity triggered by smoke. Taken all together, the data obtained independently in different laboratories clearly demonstrate the reduced toxicity of ENDS products compared to cigarettes and thus providing a valuable tool to the harm reduction strategies in smokers.","Caruso, Massimo; Emma, Rosalia; Distefano, Alfio; Rust, Sonja; Poulas, Konstantinos; Zadjali, Fahad; Boffo, Silvia; Volarevic, Vladislav; Mesiakaris, Konstantinos; Tobi, Mohammed Al; Giordano, Antonio; Arsenijevic, Aleksandar; Zuccarello, Pietro; Ferrante, Margherita; Polosa, Riccardo; Volti, Giovanni Li",bioRxiv,488,11

The aim of our study was to identify environmental and behavioral risk factors of these diseases among schoolchildren in Metro Manila, Philippines. We analyzed data from a multistage cluster sample of grade 5-10 students to investigate WaSH facilities and hygiene practices. Outcomes were self-reported diarrhea and STH infection and observed malnutrition (stunting, undernutrition, over-nutrition); we used logistic regression models to explore correlates. We included 1,558 students from 15 schools in 3 cities. Over 14% (212) of students experienced diarrhea only, 29.7% (438) experienced STH infection only, and 14% (207) experienced both diarrhea and STH infection. Over 15% (227) of students were stunted, ~6% (87) were undernourished, and 21% (306) were over-nourished. While diarrhea was associated with poor handwashing, avoiding school restrooms, and lack of a restroom cleaning policy, STH infection was associated with the dissatisfaction of students with school restrooms. Risk of having both diarrhea and STH infection increased when school restrooms lacked water or were unclean. Being only stunted was associated with diarrhea, while being both stunted and undernourished was associated with STH infection. These findings demonstrate that adequate water supply and cleanliness of school WaSH facilities must be achieved and maintained to prevent disease. Future school-based WaSH interventions are recommended to provide clean WaSH facilities that have water, promote handwashing, and discourage avoidance of school toilets.","Sangalang, S. O.; Prado, N.

Patients were allocated to either an intervention arm consisting of kinesiologist supervised high intensity interval training (HIIT) at 2 sessions per week for a total of 12 weeks;or a control arm of home exercise guided by an informative pamphlet. All patients were evaluated at baseline, 6 and 12 weeks by a kinesiologist. Quality of life (QoL) exercise surveys and measurement of strength were measured. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled between January 2018 and March 2020. The study was interrupted due to COVID-19. Thirty-two patients were included in the exercise program and 28 patients in the control group. Both groups were balanced in respect to baseline characteristics. A total of 32 (53%) patients went off protocol, 13 (18%) patients stopped due to symptomatic disease progression which included 2 (3%) deaths, 2 (3%) stopped due to COVID-19 preoccupations and the remaining patients withdrew for other reasons. 42 (70%) patients were evaluated at 6- weeks and 28 (47%) completed the 12-week follow-up, with equal distribution in each group. There were no significant difference at 12 weeks in the physical assessment nor the overall QoL scores between both groups: FACT-L on 135 points (+4.1 vs +1.7, p = 0.342) and FACIT on 52 points (+3 vs -0.2, p = 0.832).

Results: Of the 1,290 total treatment cycles identified in 301 unique patients, 1,102 cycles (85.4%) were R-CHOP +/- R, 105 (8.1%) were R-ICE, 71 (5.5%) were R-GEMOX, and 12 (0.9%) were R-DHAP. We found that 144 cycles (11.2%) were subject to dosing adjustments. The cohort of patients that received dose adjustments was comprised of 104 unique patients, of which 87 (60.4%) were male and 57 (39.6%) were female. Average age at diagnosis was 64 years old (Range: 22-91). Our cohort represented greater than 10 different lymphoma subtypes, most commonly Diffuse Large B-cell lymphoma (66.3%), Follicular lymphoma (14.5%), and Peripheral T-cell lymphomas (7.7%). We examined the basis for each dose adjustment by reviewing the clinical records from visits immediately preceding the dose adjusted cycle. Of the 144 dose adjustments, 11% of cycles contained dose increases due to a well-tolerated previous dose noted in the clinical assessment based on a combination of laboratory findings, interim history, and physical exam. The remaining 89% of adjustments (n=128) were dose reductions. The decision to dose reduce was most commonly informed by the clinical history (n=104, 81%). The clinical history was dichotomized into newly reported patient symptoms (69/104) or interim complications (35/104), usually infectious (n=26). Clinical assessments utilized laboratory findings as a rationale for dose reductions in 33/128 (26%) of cycles, most of which were secondary to myelosuppression (28/33 cycles). In contrast, only 7/128 dose reductions were based on physical exam findings alone, all of which were due to a change in patient body weight. As patients are routinely weighed immediately prior to chemotherapy administration, effectively no dose modifications (0/144) were exclusively based on abnormal physical exam finding during a pre-infusion assessment. Conclusions: The inability to perform a complete physical exam is a notable limitation of telemedicine initiatives. However, in an unselected group of lymphoma patients treated with immunochemotherapy, who subsequently had dose reductions to their regimens, we have found that all of the dose modifications were based on laboratory findings or the patient history, both of which are amenable to virtual visits. In stark contrast, no dose modifications were prompted by an abnormal physical exam finding alone. While further studies are needed, the data reviewed supports the implementation of telemedicine initiatives in lymphoma patients undergoing immunochemotherapy during the pandemic and potentially long term.

In face of these, both institutions and individuals must adapt. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, suddenness, scale, and impacts of which are unprecedented as compared to its counterparts in history, we first propose transferable measures and methods that can be used to quantify and geovisualize COVID-19 and subsequent events' impacts on metro riders' travel behaviors. Then we operationalize and implement those measures and methods with empirical data from Hong Kong, a metropolis heavily reliant on transit/metro services. We map out where those impacts were the largest and explores its correlates. We exploit the best publicly available data to assemble probable explanatory variables and to examine quantitatively whether those variables are correlated to the impacts and if so, to what degree. We find that both macro- and meso-level external/internal events following the COVID-19 outbreak significantly influenced of metro riders' behaviors. The numbers of public rental housing residents, public and medical facilities, students' school locations, residents’ occupation, and household income significantly predict the impacts. Also, the impacts differ across social groups and locales with different built-environment attributes. This means that to effectively manage those impacts, locale- and group-sensitive interventions are warranted.","Zhou, Jiangping Wu Jiangyue Ma Hanxi",Applied Geography,488,1

Most of the countries face a tough time fighting against this virus outbreak. Even developed countries are struggling to deal with this virus outbreak. Common problem countries face is a lack of medical staff and medical equipment. Machine learning has the potential to play an important role in a different area of medical facilities. With the help of the machine learning model, an effective diagnostic tool can be built which helps in the time of scarcity of medical staff. However medical data is imbalanced and this skew nature of data prevent machine learning algorithm from achieving high accuracy. To deal with this problem of imbalanced data, we proposed a modified decision tree algorithm that uses a minority sensitive Gini index called Mgini. In an imbalanced dataset of COVID-19, it is important to focus on the reduction of overall misclassification cost instead of trying improvement in accuracy value. Mgini is useful splitting criteria when the misclassification cost of the minority sample is huge as compared to the majority class. The use of this proposed new Gini index as a splitting criterion in the decision tree reduces the misclassification cost. Mgini based decision tree has higher accuracy and low misclassification cost as compare to the traditional Gini index based CART algorithm. Our proposed cost-sensitive approach improves imbalanced data classification without the use of data level sampling techniques.","Barot, P. A.; Jethva, H.

This study examined water chemical quality deterioration in ten large buildings after prolonged stagnation caused by the closure of a university campus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume-based and constant-duration flushing protocols were implemented to replace stagnant water with fresh drinking water. The effectiveness of the developed water flushing protocols was examined by monitoring the disinfectant residuals, heavy metal concentrations and temperature for water samples collected from the buildings' point of entry (POE) and select water fixtures. More than 14 m(3) of water were flushed in all ten large buildings. The results demonstrated a significantly greater average total chlorine residual concentration in POE water samples collected after flushing (1.1 mg L-1) compared to the stagnant condition (0.6 mg L-1). For water samples collected from fixtures during the extended stagnation, chlorine was absent in 71% of samples from academic buildings and 69% of samples from athletic buildings. The effectiveness of flushing practices is underscored by increasing the median total chlorine concentration from <0.1 to 1.0 mg L-1 in academic buildings and from <0.1 to 0.75 mg L-1 in athletic buildings. Furthermore, the concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Cu had decreased following the water flushing, but the concentration of Fe had increased in some buildings.

The justification for doing so is broadly consequentialist. The public health costs of not shutting down are so great that potential benefits from allowing businesses to open are dwarfed. Operating within this consequentialist framework, this paper identifies an underappreciated set of social costs that are a product of the present public policy that pairs mandated shutdowns with government subsidies. Such policy is prone to being an instance of what Robert Higgs calls the ratchet effect. Given that ratchets tend to be both costly and sticky, it is best to avoid allowing them to come into existence. This paper identifies a way of circumventing this particular ratchet;namely, by replacing governmental subsidies with support from private charitable funds like The Barstool Fund.","Carroll, Jeffrey",Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics,488,22

However, many clinical practices have cited a lack of model interpretability as reason to delay the use of ""black-box"" deep neural networks in clinical workflows. Saliency maps, which ""explain"" a model's decision by producing heat maps that highlight the areas of the medical image that influence model prediction, are often presented to clinicians as an aid in diagnostic decision-making. In this work, we demonstrate that the most commonly used saliency map generating method, Grad-CAM, results in low performance for 10 pathologies on chest X-rays. We examined under what clinical conditions saliency maps might be more dangerous to use compared to human experts, and found that Grad-CAM performs worse for pathologies that had multiple instances, were smaller in size, and had shapes that were more complex. Moreover, we showed that model confidence was positively correlated with Grad-CAM localization performance, suggesting that saliency maps were safer for clinicians to use as a decision aid when the model had made a positive prediction with high confidence. Our work demonstrates that several important limitations of interpretability techniques for medical imaging must be addressed before use in clinical workflows.","Saporta, A.; Gui, X.; Agrawal, A.; Pareek, A.; Truong, S.

In a FASN-dependent manner, Alk-4 selectively labeled the cellular protein interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) at its palmitoylation sites, and the HIV-1 matrix protein at its myristoylation site. Alk-4 metabolic labeling also enabled biotin-based purification and identification of more than 200 FASN-dependent acylated cellular proteins.

A small staff contingent of 60 personnel from US Naval Hospital (USNH) Guam was tasked with the medical care of 4,079 sailors who were placed in single room quarantine amongst 11 hotels across the island of Guam. With the assistance of the Defense Digital Service, the USNH Guam staff implemented a web-based symptom checker, which allowed for monitoring of developing COVID symptoms, and selective testing of symptomatic individuals. Materials and Methods: Sailors from the TR were placed in quarantine or isolation cohorts upon debarking the ship. Sailors not positive for COVID-19 were quarantined amongst 11 hotels on Guam. Sailors positive for COVID-19 were isolated aboard Naval Base Guam (NBG). A retrospective cohort analysis and subgroup analyses were performed on symptom data obtained from sailors in quarantine. The sailors recorded their symptoms and temperature in a web-based symptom checker that assigned a symptom severity score (SSS). Sailors with a SSS >50 were evaluated by a medical provider and re-tested. Data were collected from 4 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. Sailors required two negative tests to exit quarantine and re-embark the ship. The time course, and most common cluster of symptoms associated with a positive COVID-19 PCR test were determined retrospectively after data collection. Results: The web-based symptom checker was successful in establishing daily positive contact and symptom monitoring of susceptible individuals in quarantine. 4,079 sailors in quarantine maintained positive contact with medical staff via the symptom checker, with at least 81% of the sailors recording their symptoms on a daily basis. Individuals with high symptom scores were quickly identified and underwent further evaluation and repeat COVID-19 testing. A cohort of 331 sailors tested positive for COVID-19 while in quarantine and recorded symptoms in the symptom checker before and after a positive COVID-19 test. In this cohort, the most frequent symptoms reported prior to a positive test were headache, anosmia, followed by cough. The symptom of anosmia was reported more frequently in sailors positive for COVID-19, compared to a cohort of matched controls. A small medical staff was able to monitor developing symptoms in a large quarantined population, while efficiently allocating resources, preserving personal protective equipment (PPE), and maintaining isolation and social distancing protocols. Conclusions and Relevance: The application provided a tool for broad health surveillance over a large population while maintaining strict quarantine and social distancing protocols. Highly symptomatic sailors were quickly identified, triaged, and transferred to a higher level of care if indicated. The symptom checker and predictive model generated from the data can be utilized by military and civilian public health officials to triage large populations and make rapid decisions on isolation measures, resource allocation, selective testing.","Fenequito, R.

We hypothesized that telemedicine (TM) could be a well-accepted mode of health-care delivery minimizing the risk of exposure to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), while maintaining disease control in these patients. Objectives: To evaluate the short-term patient satisfaction, compliance, disease control and infection risk of TM compared with standard in-person follow-up (FU) for patients with LN during COVID-19. Methods: This was a single-center randomized-controlled study. Consecutive patients followed at the LN clinic were randomized to either TM (TM group) or standard FU (SF group) in a 1:1 ratio. Patients in the TM group received scheduled follow-ups via videoconferencing. SF group patients continued conventional in-person outpatient care. The 6-month data were compared. Results: From June to December 2020, 122 patients were randomized (TM: 60, SF: 62) and had attended at least 2 FU visits. There were no baseline differences, including SLEDAI-2k and proportion of patients in lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS), between the 2 groups except a higher physician global assessment score (PGA) in the TM group (mean 0.67±0.69 vs 0.45±0.60, p=0.003) (Table 1). The mean FU duration was 19.8±4.5 weeks. When comparing the most recent visit, the mean waiting time between entering the clinic waiting room (virtual or real) and seeing a rheumatologist (virtual or in-person) was significantly shorter in the TM group (22.5±28.6 vs 68.9±40.7 minutes, p< 0.001) (Figure 1A). The mean overall patient satisfaction score was higher in the TM group (mean 2.19±0.61 vs 1.89±0.78, p=0.042). The results of the post-consultation satisfaction questionnaire are shown in Figure 1B. The number of visits was similar in the two groups (TM: 3.1±1.3 vs SF: 3.0±1.2, p=0.981). However, there was a trend suggesting that alternative mode of FU was requested more frequently in the TM group than the SF group (TM: 12/60, 20.0% and SF: 5/62, 8.1%;p=0.057). More patients in the TM group had hospitalization (15/60, 25.0% vs 7/62, 11.3%;p=0.049) within the FU period, which was no longer statistically significant after adjusting for the baseline PGA. The proportions of patients remained in LLDAS were similar in the 2 groups (TM: 75.0% vs SF: 74.2%, p=0.919). None of the patients had COVID-19. Conclusion: TM resulted in better patient satisfaction and could achieve similar disease control in patients with LN in the short-term when compared to standard care.","So, H.; Chow, E.; Li, T.

Following this stage, the CE is thought to be ejected, leaving behind a compact binary (or a merger product). Although extensively studied, the CEE process is still little understood, and although most binaries have non-negligible eccentricity, the effect of initial eccentricity on the CEE has been little explored. Moreover, most studies assume a complete circularization of the orbit by the CE onset, while observationally such eccentricities are detected in many post-CE binaries. Here we use smoothed particle hydro-dynamical simulations (SPH) to study the evolution of initially eccentric ($0\le e\le0.95$) CE-systems. We find that initially eccentric binaries only partially circularize. In addition, higher initial eccentricity leads to a higher eccentricity following the end of the inspiral phase, with eccentricities as high as 0.18 in the most eccentric cases, and even higher if the initial peri-center of the orbit is located inside the star (e.g. following a kick into an eccentric orbit, rather than a smooth transition). CEE of more eccentric binaries leads to enhanced dynamical mass-loss of the CE compared with more circular binaries, and depends on the initial closest approach of the binary. We show that our results and the observed eccentricities of post-CE binaries suggest that the typical assumptions of circular orbits following CEE might potentially be revised. We expect post-CE eccentricities to affect the delay time distributions of various transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational-wave sources by up to tens of percents.","Glanz, Hila; Perets, Hagai B.",,488,29

Against the contemporary context in which the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically altered the ways that musicians can gather and make music together, we consider the question of research on music from interdisciplinary perspectives and the varied positions of researchers, musicians and community members. © 2021 The Australian National University.","Curran, G.; Radhakrishnan, M.",Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology,488,22

However, it remains unknown whether distinct microglia subpopulations or states contribute to different stages of pain development and maintenance. We show, using single-cell RNA-sequencing, that nerve injury induces the generation of a male-specific inflammatory microglia subtype, and demonstrate increased proliferation of microglia in males as compared to females. We also show time- and sex-specific transcriptional changes in different microglial subpopulations following injury. Apolipoprotein E (Apoe) is the top upregulated gene in microglia at chronic time points after nerve injury in mice and polymorphisms in the APOE gene in humans are associated with chronic pain. Single-cell analysis of human spinal cord microglia reveals a subpopulation with a disease-related transcriptional signature. Our data provide a detailed analysis of transcriptional states of mouse and human spinal cord microglia, and identify a previously unrecognized role for ApoE in neuropathic pain.","Tansley, Shannon; Uttam, Sonali; Ureña Guzmán, Alba; Yaqubi, Moein; Pacis, Alain; Parisien, Marc; Rabau, Oded; Haglund, Lisbet; Ouellet, Jean; Santaguida, Carlo; Ragoussis, Jiannis; Zhang, Ji; Salter, Michael W; Diatchenko, Luda; Healy, Luke M.; Mogil, Jeffrey S.; Khoutorsky, Arkady",bioRxiv,488,9

In mission-critical applications such as translating official documents, incorrect translation can have unpleasant or sometimes catastrophic consequences. This motivates recent research on testing methodologies for machine translation systems. Existing methodologies mostly rely on metamorphic relations designed at the textual level (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or syntactic level (e.g., the distance between grammar structures) to determine the correctness of translation results. However, these metamorphic relations do not consider whether the original and translated sentences have the same meaning (i.e., Semantic similarity). Therefore, in this paper, we propose SemMT, an automatic testing approach for machine translation systems based on semantic similarity checking. SemMT applies round-trip translation and measures the semantic similarity between the original and translated sentences. Our insight is that the semantics expressed by the logic and numeric constraint in sentences can be captured using regular expressions (or deterministic finite automata) where efficient equivalence/similarity checking algorithms are available. Leveraging the insight, we propose three semantic similarity metrics and implement them in SemMT. The experiment result reveals SemMT can achieve higher effectiveness compared with state-of-the-art works, achieving an increase of 21% and 23% on accuracy and F-Score, respectively. We also explore potential improvements that can be achieved when proper combinations of metrics are adopted. Finally, we discuss a solution to locate the suspicious trip in round-trip translation, which may shed lights on further exploration.","Cao, Jialun; Li, Meiziniu; Li, Yeting; Wen, Ming; Cheung, Shing-Chi",,488,23

Here we investigate, within a reaction-diffusion setting, a family of new models for an endemic SIR (susceptible-infective-removed) infectious disease for which no vaccine is available and individuals' responses to the infection threat are entirely based on changes either in their social behaviour or in their mobility behaviour, that is avoiding to visit sites with a large infection prevalence. First, we derive general conditions for the onset of Turing patterns for a general family of spatially inhomogeneous SIR models with a prevalence-dependent contact rate and constant recruitment. Then, we characterize our main family of models where the behavioural response also includes a spatial component, and show the condition bringing to the mitigation, or even the destruction, of Turing patterns. The same conditions can allow the transition from Turing-Hopf spatio-temporal patterns to pure Hopf temporal patterns. The same is also done for two SIS models. These results bring an inference of interest: the reduction of spatial clustering typically observed during the course of an epidemics might be related to a combination of agents' spontaneous social and spatial distancing. To validate our theoretical results and further explore other spatio-temporal effects of the proposed spatial behavioural responses, numerical simulations of a specific instance of the above-mentioned family of SIR models have been performed.

This response has led to the emergence of literature about the impact of COVID-19 on the stakeholders of the tourism industry, thereby contributing to the industry. Nonetheless, the criteria factors and investigated practices for the implementation of decision-making by stakeholders in the tourism industry have not been fully explored. This study adopts Teorija Rezhenija Izobre-tatelskikh Zadach (TRIZ) principles and Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods to construct a gap model of tourism stakeholders (GMTS) which solves the tourism industry decision-making problem under COVID-19. With a research background in Taiwan’s tourism industry stakeholders made up of 15 expert participants, GMTS identified 11 criteria factors, of which the three most important criteria factors provide decision-making directions. The causal relationship between these criteria factors was examined, and a causal diagram was drawn to clarify the most important criteria factors. This research examined the criteria factor implementation perspective. Travel “bubble zones” that ensure both “safety and quality” were concluded upon under government policies in the countries and regions of the world. Furthermore, the tourism industry is responsible for the overall “planning and management” of the travel “bubble zones”. Therefore, the “quality management” criteria factor provides important key decision-making for tourism stakeholders. The research indicates that it is recommended to attach importance to the “quality management” of the international travel “bubble zone” as the priority decision-making criteria factor under the pandemic. Furthermore, conversion policies and tourism regulations are secondary criteria factors for improvement;when these two criteria factors are immediately improved, other criteria factors will be affected simultaneously and the degree of improvement will be weakened. In addition, GMTS was developed for the tourism industry. The article also provides research literature and practice implications for stakeholders in the tourism industry, thereby providing insight for tourism to obtain a clear understanding of how to prepare for the implementation of sustainable development.","Chang, Dong-Shang Wu Wei-De",Sustainability,488,29

To achieve that aim, the objectives are to: identify the critical pandemic impact (CPI) of COVID-19 on AEC organizations;compare the CPI between the different organization characteristics;and analyze the interrelationships between the CPI. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review of 519 articles and in-depth interviews with 40 AEC practitioners were carried out, yielding 12 COVID-19 impacts. Then, data on the 12 impact’s criticality were collected through a survey among AEC practitioners. In total, 127 valid responses were received and analyzed using mean ranking analysis, analysis of variance and Spearman’s correlation. The findings were also compared with pandemic impacts from prior works. Findings: Five CPI exist among the 12 impacts, namely, “reduced construction productivity,” “reduced foreign investment in the construction industry,” “reduced demand on construction-related works,” “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced number of public projects.” “Reduced foreign investment in the construction industry” and “reduced demand on construction-related works” significantly impact small-medium enterprises than large enterprises. Also, “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced construction productivity” are recurring impacts in all countries compared. Finally, moderate relationships exist between “reduced foreign investment in the construction industry” and “reduced demand on construction-related works” and “disruption in the supply chain” and “reduced construction productivity.” Originality/value: The findings can be used to prioritize available resources in developing short-term responses for COVID-19. Also, action plans can be developed to mitigate the CPI from recurring. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","King, S. S.; Rahman, R. A.; Fauzi, M. A.; Haron, A.

We determined SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in the influent of 12 wastewater treatment plants from August 2020 to January 2021. Technical replicates for N1 gene concentrations showed a relative standard deviation of 24%, suggesting it is possible to track relatively small (similar to 30%) changes in SARS-CoV-2 concentrations over time. COVID-19 cases were correlated significantly (rho >= 0.70) to wastewater SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations across large and small service areas, with weaker relationships (rho >= 0.59) in two communities. SARS-CoV-2 concentrations normalized to per capita slightly improved correlations to COVID-19 incidence, but normalizing to a spiked recovery control (BCoV) or a fecal marker (PMMoV or HF183) reduced correlations for a number of plants. Daily sampling demonstrated that a minimum of two samples collected per week were needed to maintain accuracy in trend analysis.

This study aims to use the dynamic capability view (DCV) theory to analyze how three key supply chain capabilities – organizational flexibility, integration and agility – should be combined to obtain the desired supply chain performance. Design/methodology/approach: The authors designed a conceptual model in which the relationships between these three key capabilities and supply chain performance were hypothesized. The model was first tested through partial least square regression using survey data collected from 98 members of the Peruvian coffee supply chain. A fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was conducted to uncover how DCs could be combined in successful supply chain configurations. Findings: The authors show that organizational flexibility is a driver of higher agility in agri-food supply chains, together with external and internal supply chain integration, that have a direct impact on agility, which positively affects supply chain performance. Higher levels of supply chain agility are necessary but insufficient to guarantee high performance, as sufficiency is reached when both integration (internal and/or external) and agility are present. Originality/value: This study represents a pioneering attempt to apply the DCV theory to agri-food supply chains – characterized by many sources of uncertainty. All the DCs are included within the same model and the joint use of PLS regression and fsQCA provides evidence about the relationships between DCs and how they can empower agri-food supply to obtain the desired performance. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ramos, E.; Patrucco, A.

In Costa Rica during the year 2020, a predominant genotype carrying the mutation T1117I in the spike (S:T1117I) was previously identified. To investigate the possible effects of this mutation on the function of the spike, i.e. the biology of the virus, different bioinformatic pipelines based on phylogeny, natural selection and co-evolutionary models, molecular docking and epitopes prediction were implemented. Results of the phylogeny of sequences carrying the S:T1117I worldwide showed a polyphyletic group, with the emergency of local lineages. In Costa Rica, the mutation is found in the lineage B.1.1.389 and it is suggested to be a product of positive/adaptive selection. Different changes in the function of the spike protein and more stable interaction with a ligand (nelfinavir drug) were found. Only one epitope out 742 in the spike was affected by the mutation, with some different properties, but suggesting scarce changes in the immune response and no influence on the vaccine effectiveness. Jointly, these results suggest a partial benefit of the mutation for the spread of the virus with this genotype during the year 2020 in Costa Rica, although possibly not strong enough with the introduction of new lineages during early 2021 which became predominant later. In addition, the bioinformatics pipeline offers an integrative and exhaustive in silico strategy to eventually study other mutations of interest for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other pathogens.

Moreover, when cases are more than health care providers' capacity, it is important to follow up cases at home. In this paper, we present a complete system that enables healthcare providers to follow up with patients with respiratory-related diseases at home. The aim is to evaluate the use of a mobile phone's accelerometer to capture respiration waveform from different patients using mobile phones. Whereas measurements are performed by patients themselves from home, and not by professional health care personnel, the signals captured by mobile phones are subjected to many unknowns. Therefore, the validity of the signals has to be evaluated first and before any processing. Proper signal processing algorithms can be used to prepare the captured waveform for RR computations. A validity check is considered at different stages using statistical measures and pathophysiological limitations. In this paper, a mobile application is developed to capture the accelerometer signals and send the data to a server at the health care facility. The server has a database of each patient's signals considering patient privacy and security of information. All the validations and signal processing are performed on the server side. The patient's condition can be followed up over a few days and an alarm system may be implemented at the server-side in case of respiration deterioration or when there is a risk of a patient's need for hospitalization. The risk is determined based on respiration signal features extracted from the received respiration signal including RR, and Autoregressive (AR) moving average (ARMA) model parameters of the signal. Results showed that the presented method can be used at a larger scale enabling health care providers to monitor a large number of patients.","Al-Zaben, A.; Al-Ebbini, L. M.

Consequently, diverse distance measures are developed and used in determining the similarity and dissimilarity between IFSs. In the existing methods, the distance measures are calculated based on the geometry of the IFSs. However, the IFSs hold information about the elements in a set. As such, some of the existing distance measures are misleading and unreasonable. Hence, in this paper, a nonlinear distance formula is devised to follow the problem definition. Further, by explicitly proving the distance properties, it is being established that the distance formula is a distance measure. Further, theories for the construction of distance measures are developed. The convex combination of two distance measures is also a distance measure is being proved explicitly. Furthermore, based on the proposed distance measures, similarity measures have been developed. Aside from that, an intriguing idea has been introduced, namely, that an infinite number of distance measures can be constructed from a given pair of distance measures. Additionally, the proposed distance and similarity measures are applied to a variety of problems, including medical diagnosis, pattern recognition, and a MADM problem in COVID-19 face mask selection, where the legitimacy and applicability of the proposed advanced distance measure is demonstrated.","Gohain, B.; Dutta, P.; Gogoi, S.; Chutia, R.",International Journal of Intelligent Systems,488,28

Prosumption represents a new message creation and delivery paradigm, where anyone can seamlessly shift from consumer to contributor, to creator. Central to this is the idea of creating ‘use-value’ and re-orientating ‘exchange value’. Perhaps an overlooked facet, but one deeply engrained in its manifestation is that prosumption is inherently relational, involving micro-interaction between consumer and producer.

We attempted to resolve this paradox by testing five hypotheses in online, non-clinical samples (Nstudy 1=123, Nstudy 2=177, Nstudy 3=217). We replicated the intercorrelation of washing and hoarding tendencies in all studies, despite observing non-clinical individual differences. Both washing and hoarding were associated with anxiety, depression, and fears of social rejection and failure, but they were also distinguishable. Compulsive washing was associated with greater anxiety, disgust, perceptions of infection vulnerability, and the desire to organize a cluttered space, whereas hoarding was associated with reduced concerns about germs and full or cluttered spaces and higher concerns about assault, threats to safety, and insects. A third study tested and confirmed the hypothesis that washing and hoarding may be related because they are adaptive in combination during stressful conditions, like a global pandemic. During COVID-19, washing and hoarding tendencies were even more strongly interrelated, and disease-avoidant behaviors like wearing a mask and avoiding people increased with washing tendencies but decreased with hoarding tendencies. Overlapping psychopathological states can be distinguished even in non-clinical samples through psychopathological profiles and the content of concerns—that shift with one's context. Treatment may benefit from not only working to cease undesirable behaviors but also from ameliorating root fears and anxieties that are dissociable by condition and individual but not always linked to the behavioral expression.","Liu, Tingting Ackerman Joshua M.; Preston, Stephanie D.",Journal of Behavioral and Cognitive Therapy,488,28

Methods: We searched seven databases, three preprint platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google from December 1, 2019, to March 2, 2021, to collect evidence of remdesivir, glucocorticoid, and IVIG which were used in children and adolescents with COVID-19. Findings: A total of six cohort studies and one case series study were included in this systematic review. In terms of remdesivir, the meta-analysis of single-arm cohort studies have shown that, after the treatment, 37.1% (95%CI, 0.0% to 74.5%) experienced adverse events, 5.9% (95%CI, 1.5% to 10.2%) died, 37.2% (95%CI, 0% to 76.0%) needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). As for glucocorticoids, the results of the meta-analysis showed that the fixed-effect summary odds ratio (OR) for the association with mortality was 2.79 (95%CI, 0.13 to 60.87), and the mechanical ventilation rate was 3.12 (95%CI, 0.80 to 12.08) for glucocorticoids compared with the control group. In terms of IVIG, the two included cohort studies showed that for MIS-C patients with more severe clinical symptoms, IVIG combined with methylprednisolone could achieve better clinical efficacy than IVIG alone.

Methods: This nationwide cross-sectional web-based study was conducted from April 19 to May 12, 2020 in Iran. The data collection tools were the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Depression Center for Epidemiologic Studies’ Depression Scale questionnaires. Each province in Iran was assumed as a cluster, and generalized estimating equations models were used to determine the demographic variables that were related to depression symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak. Results: In this study, 73.5% and 41.4% of the participants had poor sleep quality and had depression symptoms, respectively. Perceived income, hours spent outdoors, the number of people with COVID-19 that were acquainted with, and a history of depression significantly were related to sleep quality. Also, gender, age, having a child, education level, economic status, and a history of depression were significantly associated with having depression symptoms. Conclusions: Most participants had poor sleep quality, and less than half had depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. These problems can disturb daily routines, cut social ties, and increase worries and fears of the future.

The motifs reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations and can be tried as putative therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic) packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is transported into spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of viruses with icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences. Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of numerous molecular mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.","Chechetkin, Vladimr R.; Lobzin, Vasily V.",,488,16

In recent times AUC has found broad application in the biopharmaceutical industry as a first-principle means for quantitatively characterizing biopharmaceuticals. Boundary sedimentation velocity AUC (SV-AUC) analysis is widely used to assess protein aggregation, fragmentation and conformational variants in the same solvents used during drug development and production. SV-AUC is especially useful for the analysis of drug substance, drug product and dosing solution, where other techniques may exhibit solvent matrix issues or concentration limitations. Recently, the only manufacturer of the analytical ultracentrifuge, released its newest (third generation) analytical ultracentrifuge, the Optima, in early 2017 to replace its aging 2nd generation XL series ultracentrifuges. However, SV-AUC data from four Optima units used in conducting characterization work on adeno-associated virus (AAV) has shown evidence of sample convection. Further investigation reveals that this problem arises from the temperature control system design, which is prone to producing destabilizing temperature induced density gradients that can lead to density inversions. The observed convection impacts both the qualitative and quantitative data generated by the Optima. The problem is intermittent and variable in severity within a given Optima unit and between Optima units. This convection appears to be mainly associated with low rotor speeds and dilute samples in dilute solvents, such as AAV samples in formulation buffers containing relatively low concentrations of salts, sugars, etc. Under these conditions it is found that a sufficiently robust stabilizing density gradient is not always present during sedimentation, making the sample susceptible to convection by localized density inversions. Because SV-AUC is used as an analytical tool in making critical decisions in the development and quality control of biotherapeutics, it is imperative to alert users about this potential problem. In general special attention to data quality needs to be made by those researchers working with very large biopharmaceutical particles (e.g. gene therapy products that involve viral vectors or nanoparticles), where the conditions leading to convection are most likely to occur. It is important to note that the XL series analytical ultracentrifuges do not suffer from this problem, indicating that this problem is unique to the Optima. Attributes that reveal the presence of this problem and strategies for its elimination or minimization are provided.","Berkowitz, Steven A.; Laue, Thomas",bioRxiv,488,23

The data-driven approach is applied by installing the voltage and current sensors, collecting the associated mass data and processing them under normal and abnormal (angular misalignment) conditions. Two categories of features are extracted from the dynamic resistance (DR) and the voltage and current ones that are decomposed by wavelet transform (WT). The DR features are extracted from the DR profile and some critical features are selected by a t-test methodology. In the case of the WT-based features, the critical ones are selected by a max-relevance and min-redundancy (mRMR) and a sequential backward selection (SBS) wrapper. Consequently, three types of critical feature sets, such as DR features, WT features, and hybrid features combining those, are prepared to train machine learning-based models. Support vector machine (SVM) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) are applied to establish the diagnosis models, and the diagnostic accuracy and robustness are evaluated. Finally, the software for the on-line monitoring and diagnosis for angular misalignment of robot spot-welding system is developed and demonstrates its real-time applicability in an industrial site.","Lee, Jiwoong; Noh, Inwoong; Jeong, Sang Ik; Lee, Yongho; Lee, Sang Won",Procedia Manufacturing,488,20

Furthermore, low-income households often find it challenging to fulfill their energy and protein needs. It is becoming a severe issue when the Covid-19 break in Indonesia and puts many essential animal protein commodities into an excellent uncertainty condition. Although it is accepted that the effectiveness of population growth, none have assessed the relationship with the price volatility that was formed by the Covid-19 issue. This research aims to develop an econometric model on essential animal food demand and how their price volatility trend during Covid-19. The Linear Expenditure System (LES) was chosen as an approach to describing the demand for food commodities from essential animal protein sources using SUSENAS data for the 2019 enumeration period, while the ARCH/GARCH model was used as an approach to describe the pattern of price volatility using set of consumer price data from January 2010 until August 2020 enumeration period. This research shows that the price elasticity of the essential animal protein sources of food commodities shows that all commodities are inelastic. At the same time, changes in the relationship between essential animal food commodities reflect an overall shift in the consumption of society towards essential animal food commodities themselves. On the other hand, there is a specific movement in price volatility toward an explosive term, which led to a great uncertainty that will face both of consumers and producers in the future.","Laili, F.; Anindita, R.; Baladina, N.",IOP Conference Series.

Despite this, tensions exist between approaches to care and its value in HEIs. The neoliberalism underpinning HEIs results in the practice of care often being minimised. This is problematic as care is significant for its impact on student experiences. To demonstrate care, beyond simply service delivery, it is critical to develop a relational approach, especially for students who are already part of equity groups. The care demonstrated for these students has become more critical during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this paper focuses on Pacific and International students. We discuss the challenges negotiating how to demonstrate care when care is undefined and undervalued. Adding to the complexity, gaps continue in practice despite broad statements made by HEIs regarding cultural inclusivity. We describe our experiences as care practitioners before and during the pandemic in HEIs in Aotearoa New Zealand and the United States (U.S.), what informs our practice, and how we negotiate barriers. Employing talanoa and thematic analysis, we identified commonalities in our experiences. There was a clear gap in institutional definitions of care and understanding approaches by care practitioners. For us, a strong relational approach to care is paramount to effective practice, and even more so during a pandemic;however, this is contrasted by the many tensions described. Finally, we recognise the opportunities that arose from the pandemic for innovation focusing on student equity, which must continue post-pandemic.

Theories of events inevitably begin with rupture. An event depends on the experience that the ground has dramatically shifted. Yet the ambiguity of rupture in climate change—which cannot be experienced in any one instance—makes climate change more difficult to emplot. Moreover, it is an event defined as much by how actors see the future unfolding as by its present or past. Tying the theory of events with that of future-making, we focus on three important forms of eventfulness that we find in the current climate change debate: scientific modes of eventfulness, the radical eventfulness of groups such as Extinction Rebellion, and what we call the “sensible” eventfulness of European Union and United Nations functionaries, as it is gleaned from climate change documents such as the European Green Deal. As we show, each form of eventfulness constructs a different temporal landscape, populated by different actors and actions, entailing different stances towards the future and different kinds of projects. Focusing on the tensions within each form, we then show that understanding these forms of eventfulness can also help us understand how different actors fused climate change to other events, such as that of the global Covid-19 epidemic.","Tavory, Iddo Wagner-Pacifici Robin",Poetics,488,1

The disease, now known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has spread rapidly around the world causing a pandemic. This survey presents basic information on the structure and replication cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Fundamental discoveries in genetics and molecular biology of the virus paved the way to design and development of molecules that would act as potential therapeutic agents for COVID-19. The virus belongs to the β-coronavirus 2B lineage. Comparison of the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence and other available β-coronavirus genomes suggests that it may have evolved naturally from the RaTG13 bat strain of coronaviruses. The virus has a positivesense single-stranded RNA that acts as mRNA following cellular entry and is completely dependent on the translation machinery of the host cell. The genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2 comprises 14 open reading frames (ORFs). Two main ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encompass two-thirds of the genome and are translated to polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab, respectively. These polyproteins are processed by viral proteases (papain-like protease and chymotrypsin-like protease), to produce 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp). The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four major structural proteins: Spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N), and seven accessory proteins. SARS-CoV-2 infects human cells by binding to its receptor, i.e. angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) at the cell surface through the receptor binding domain of its S protein. Following the entry into the host cell, the genetic material is released into the cytoplasm, and the synthesis of viral proteins necessary for the further process of replication and translation takes place. After mature virus particles are formed, they travel in Golgi vesicles to the host cell membrane where they are released into extracellular space by exocytosis. With the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the world, thousands of mutations have been identified, some of which have relatively high incidences. The following proteins exhibited the highest mutation density: N, S, Nsp2, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp6, Nsp7, Nsp12, Nsp13, Orf3 and Orf8. The changes in SARS-CoV-2 proteins caused by mutations can not only affect virus transmission, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity, but also give rise to false negative diagnoses and drug resistance. © 2021 Polish Pharmaceutical Society.

Design/methodology/approach Data were collected from 468 businesses, and various multivariate statistical techniques were used. Initially a factor analysis was conducted, organising variables into five factors. A discriminant analysis, performed with the five factors, allowed discriminating firms based on whether they internationalise or not. A linear regression was performed in order to estimate the contribution of each factor in the business performance. Findings The results suggest the existence of additional variables for measuring the complexity. From the factorial analysis it is possible to conclude that business complexity can be explained by size, indebtedness and profitability, internationalisation, number of employees, and age and leverage. Total assets, indebtedness and age are the variables that contribute the most to business performance. On the other hand, indebtedness, internationalisation, age and leverage are the independent variables that most contribute to explain business performance. Originality/value This paper presents advances in two ways. First, it proposes measures of complexity (highly debatable in the literature). It also proposes internationalisation as an explanation of complexity. Second, this paper sheds light on businesses decisions to grow, taking into account how complexity may affect performance.","Pereira, J.; Braga, V.; Correia, A.; Salamzadeh, A.",Journal of Entrepreneurship and Public Policy,488,28

Boards of Directors are under great pressure to be transparent and accountable. In the same background, given the current socioeconomic context, due to the crisis generated by the new Coronavirus (CoVid-19) pandemic, the banking sector is under analogous levels of scrutiny, subject to a similar regulatory backlash. In this context, banks must not fail to fulfil the expectations of policy makers in particular, and society in general. The Code of Corporate Governance (CCG) issued by the Bucharest Stock Exchange (BSE) aims at creating an internationally attractive capital market in Romania, based on best practices, transparency and trust – pillars that encourage companies to build a strong relationship with their shareholders and other stakeholders, by an effective and transparent communication, as well as openness towards all potential investors. This paper aims to highpoint the degree of compliance of the banks listed on the BSE with the principles and provisions stipulated by the CCG in force. As such, the assessment consisted in measuring the corporate governance quality and effectiveness in the main Romanian banks: Banca Transilvania, BRD, Erste Group and Patria Bank. Evaluating corporate governance eminence is constructed by using the score function method in regards to disclosure and transparency practices, as proposed by BSE. In this respect, an investigation was performed, focusing on the mode in which the principles enforced by the BSE are respected. This goal is important due to the current sensitive socioeconomic environment, which, undoubtedly, makes the corporate governance in the banking sector a controversial subject. In this framework, valuable conclusions were reached, regarding a satisfactory compliance level with the CCG issued by BSE.

Monolayers of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected to stably express human ACE and bradykinin B2 receptors coupled to green fluorescent protein (B2GFP) or to express only coupled B2GFP receptors. We used 2 ACE-resistant bradykinin analogues to activate the B2 receptors. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to analyze the peptides cleaved by ACE on cell monolayers and found that Ang 1-9 was hydrolyzed 18x slower than Ang I and &30% slower than Ang 1-7. Ang 1-7 was cleaved to Ang 1-5. Although micromol/L concentrations of slowly cleaved substrates Ang 1-7 and Ang 1-9 inhibit ACE, they resensitize the desensitized B2GFP receptors in nmol/L concentration, independent of ACE inhibition. This is reflected by release of arachidonic acid through a mechanism involving cross-talk between ACE and B2 receptors. When ACE was not expressed, the Ang 1-9, Ang 1-7 peptides were inactive. Inhibitors of protein kinase C-alpha, phosphatases and Tyr-kinase blocked this resensitization activity, but not basal B2 activation by bradykinin. Ang 1-9 and Ang 1-7 enhance bradykinin activity, probably by acting as endogenous allosteric modifiers of the ACE and B2 receptor complex. Consequently, when ACE inhibitors block conversion of Ang I, other enzymes can still release Ang I metabolites to enhance the efficacy of ACE inhibitors.","Chen, Zhenlong; Tan, Fulong; Erdös, Ervin G; Deddish, Peter A",Hypertension,488,19

To do this, the antigenic sequence Asp-Leu-Pro-Pro-Asn-Ser-Asp-Val-Val-Asp, from a coronavirus, was inserted genetically in the permissive site around amino acid position 153 of the LamB protein (maltose and lambda phage receptor) of Escherichia coli. When the hybrid lamB gene is transcribed, the epitope becomes presented on the surface of the bacterial cells in a configuration available to specific antibodies. To validate this notion in nonenteric bacteria, the expression and correct processing of LamB were confirmed by coupling the lamB gene to the salicylate-responsive Psa1 promoter of the NAH7 (naphthalene degradation) plasmid in Pseudomonas putida. Subsequently, a hybrid lamB gene carrying the sequence of the coronavirus antigen was placed downstream of the m-toluate-responsive Pm promoter of the TOL (toluene degradation) plasmid. Exposure of the epitope on the Pseudomonas cell surface was monitored through fluorescence of whole cells treated with a monoclonal antibody against the heterologous antigen. Fluorescence emission was dependent on the presence of m-toluate in the medium, thus permitting detection of the Pm promoter switching on by simple optical inspection of individual cells, even in situations when these are a very minor component of a complex bacterial community.","Cebolla, A; Guzmán, C; de Lorenzo, V",Applied and environmental microbiology,488,1

Coronavirus replication and transcription are highly specialized processes of cytoplasmic RNA synthesis that localize to virus-induced membrane structures and were recently proposed to involve a complex enzymatic machinery that, besides RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and protease activities, also involves a series of RNA-processing enzymes that are not found in most other RNA virus families. Here, we characterized the enzymatic activities of a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV helicase (nonstructural protein [nsp] 13), a superfamily 1 helicase with an N-terminal zinc-binding domain. We report that nsp13 has both RNA and DNA duplex-unwinding activities. SARS-CoV nsp13 unwinds its substrates in a 5'-to-3' direction and features a remarkable processivity, allowing efficient strand separation of extended regions of double-stranded RNA and DNA. Characterization of the nsp13-associated (deoxy)nucleoside triphosphatase ([dNTPase) activities revealed that all natural nucleotides and deoxynucleotides are substrates of nsp13, with ATP, dATP, and GTP being hydrolyzed slightly more efficiently than other nucleotides. Furthermore, we established an RNA 5'-triphosphatase activity for the SARS-CoV nsp13 helicase which may be involved in the formation of the 5' cap structure of viral RNAs. The data suggest that the (d)NTPase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase activities of nsp13 have a common active site. Finally, we established that, in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, nsp13 localizes to membranes that appear to be derived from the endoplasmic reticulum and are the likely site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis.","Ivanov, Konstantin A; Thiel, Volker; Dobbe, Jessika C; van der Meer, Yvonne; Snijder, Eric J; Ziebuhr, John",Journal of virology,488,20

Case 1 involved a 7-week-old, male short-haired Chihuahua, which had become lethargic 24 hours after purchase from a pet store. Within 72 hours, the puppy began to vomit, had diarrhea, and was admitted to the veterinary clinic, where it was placed on IV fluids. The parvovirus Cite test was negative. The puppy died within 12 hours of admission and was submitted for diagnostic workup. Gross pathology revealed an enteritis suggestive of CPV-2. Histopathology on intestines showed scattered dilated crypts with necrotic cellular debris and neutrophils. There was moderate depletion and necrosis of lymphoid follicles. Electron microscopy (EM) on intestinal contents was positive for coronavirus and negative for parvovirus. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on gut sections was positive for CCV and negative for CPV-2. Case 2 was an 8-week-old, male Shih Tzu, which was admitted to the veterinary clinic exhibiting symptoms of severe gastroenteritis with abdominal pain. The referring veterinarian euthanized the puppy, and the entire body was submitted for diagnostic evaluation. Necropsy revealed a severe ileo-cecal intussusception and segmental necrotic enteritis of the small intestine. Electron microscopy of the intestinal contents was positive for coronavirus and negative for parvovirus. Immunohistochemistry on sections of affected gut were positive for CCV and negative for CPV-2. These cases emphasize the importance of pursuing a diagnosis of CCV in young puppies when CPV-2 disease has been ruled out by IHC.","Evermann, J F; Abbott, J R; Han, S","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",488,1

February 2013, an elderly man, who visited Pakistan and KSA, was confirmed as MRS-CoV in UK. A team visited Mirpur to assess current and past SARI trends in major indoor facilities, to explore possible contact of the patient with known or suspected SARI case during his stay in Pakistan and enlist close contacts. METHODS Review of indoor records in hospitals, interviews with relatives & physicians and active contact tracing using operational case definition. RESULTS Arrived on 16th December 2012, mostly stayed at daughter's house, visited by relatives, on 19th January, left for KSA accompanied by daughter, developed fever with chills and body aches on 23rd January. On 28th January, arrived London, admitted at City Hospital, Birmingham, subsequently shifted to Manchester Hospital on 6th February 2013, diagnosed as MERS-CoV, expired on 19th February. His son having underlying condition, confirmed as MERS-CoV on 13th February, and expired on 17th February. Daughter developed mild respiratory symptoms, confirmed as MERS-CoV on 16th Feb and recovered. Both have been infected by the Index case. The review of indoor record did not reveal any significant change in SARI trends, the cumulative number of cases for the January -February 2012 and 2013 was 291 and 294 respectively indicating no difference. During his stay in Pakistan, he didn't meet any suspected/ill person. Close contacts were observed and investigated for MERS-CoV, all remained healthy.

METHODS We collected data from 400 toilet facilities that were open to the public: all those in three contiguous city council territories (228) and a further convenience sample of 172 around other parts of New Zealand. Comparisons were made with the data on the same facilities included in a 2012/2013 survey. RESULTS Of the toilets in this survey, 2.5% had no water for handwashing and 14.8% had no soap. There was COVID-19-related health messaging signage in 19.5% of toilets, with posters of the COVID-19 QR code used for contact tracing in 12.3%, and generic handwashing signage in 1.8%. The handwashing water had 'no-touch' activation at 28.0% of toilets, and 18.5% of toilets had no-touch bowl flushing. Toilet bowl lids were not present at 32.8%, and 2.3% of toilets had damage that would impair their functionality (eg, broken toilet seats). This new survey found significantly increased provision of soap (risk ratio = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.25 to 1.72), but no increased provision of water, at the 128 sites that had also been examined in the previous survey. CONCLUSIONS Although handwashing is probably a much less critical COVID-19 control intervention than reducing aerosol transmission, it should still be strongly supported. Yet this survey found multiple deficiencies with handwashing amenities at public toilets and only modest improvements since a previous survey.","Wilson, Nick; Thomson, George",The New Zealand medical journal,488,1

It spread rapidly, in part due to contaminated livestock trailers. The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of an accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for inactivating PEDV in the presence of feces on metal surfaces, such as those found in livestock trailers. Three-week-old barrows were inoculated intragastrically with 5 mL of PEDV-negative feces for the negative control, 5 mL of untreated PEDV-positive feces for the positive control, and 5 mL or 10 mL of PEDV-positive feces that was subjected to treatment with a 1:16 or 1:32 concentrations of accelerated hydrogen peroxide disinfectant for a contact time of 30 min at 20°C. These pigs served as a bioassay to determine the infectivity of virus following treatment. Rectal swabs collected from the inoculated pigs on days 3 and 7 post-inoculation were tested by using PEDV-specific real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the proportion of pigs in each group that became infected with PEDV was assessed. None of the pigs used for the bioassay in the 4 treatment groups and the negative control group became infected with PEDV, which was significantly different from the positive control group (P < 0.05) in which all pigs were infected. The results suggest that the application of the accelerated hydrogen peroxide under these conditions was sufficient to inactivate the virus in feces found on metal surfaces.","Holtkamp, Derald J; Myers, Jacqueline; Thomas, Paul R; Karriker, Locke A; Ramirez, Alejandro; Zhang, Jianqiang; Wang, Chong",Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,488,2

This study was aimed to assess the clinical preference of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag chemiluminescence immunoassay. Methods An upper respiratory specimen was collected in a series of patients referred to the Laboratory Medicine service of Pederzoli Hospital (Peschiera del Garda, Verona, Italy) for screening or diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nasopharyngeal samples were assayed with DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test and Altona Diagnostics RealStar® SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit. Results The final study population consisted of 421 patients (median age, 48 years; 227 women), 301 (71.5%) with positive result of molecular testing, and 126 (29.9%) with cycle threshold (Ct) values of both E and S genes <29.5, thus reflecting higher infectivity. The area under the curve of DiaSorin LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 Ag test 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79-0.86) for sample positivity and 0.98 for higher sample infectivity (95% CI, 0.97 to 0.99). The optimal cut-off for sample positivity was 82 TCID50/mL (0.78 sensitivity, 0.73 specificity and 77% diagnostic accuracy), whilst that for identifying samples associated with a high infective risk was 106 TCID50/mL (0.94 sensitivity, 0.96 specificity and 95% diagnostic accuracy). Conclusion The performance of this chemiluminescence immunoassay would not permit it to replace molecular testing for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2, but may enable rapid and efficient detection of subjects with high SARS-CoV-2 viral load, who are responsible for the largest proportion of infectious clusters.","Salvagno, Gian Luca; Gianfilippi, Gianluca; Fiorio, Giacomo; Pighi, Laura; De Nitto, Simone; Henry, Brandon M; Lippi, Giuseppe",EJIFCC,488,15

As certain affected neurons depend on trophic factors such as neurotrophins (NTs), impairment in NT function has been suggested to be a component of neuronal damage associated with such disorders. Age-related neurodegenerative diseases are also characterised by high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in the CNS. Because TNFalpha receptors and certain NT receptors share a high degree of homology and are capable of activating similar signalling pathways, one possibility is that altered cytokine levels may affect NT function in the aged or diseased CNS. Here we wish briefly to review the evidence suggesting a role for cytokine and NT in the onset of age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. We propose that cytokine/NT interactions may alter neuronal homeostasis, thus possibly contributing to some of the neuronal degeneration occurring during such age-associated CNS diseases.","Macdonald, N J; Decorti, F; Pappas, T C; Taglialatela, G",Journal of anatomy,488,26

This article paints a more complex picture by distinguishing between a first and second phase of the pandemic. The initial spread of infections and its correlation with socio-economic factors depends on how the virus first entered a country. The second phase of the pandemic begins when individuals start taking precautionary measures and governments implement lockdowns. In this phase the spread of the virus depends on the ability of individuals to socially distance themselves, which is to some extent socially stratified. METHODS: We analyse the geographical distribution of known cumulative cases and fatalities per capita in an ecological analysis across local districts in Germany distinguishing between the first and the second phase of the pandemic. RESULTS: In Germany, the virus first entered via individuals returning from skiing in the Alps and other international travel. In this first phase we find a positive association between the wealth of a district and infection rates and a negative association with indicators of social deprivation. During the second phase and controlling for path dependency, districts with a higher share of university-educated employees record fewer new infections and deaths and richer districts record fewer deaths, districts with a higher unemployment rate record more deaths. CONCLUSION: The social stratification of Covid-19 changes substantively across the two phases of the pandemic in Germany.

Those features are equally found in metal organic frameworks (MOFs), defined as modular materials built from metal-nodes connected through organic-ligands. Because of the electronic and structural complexity of MOFs, the computational description of their excited states is a formidable challenge for which two different approaches have been usually followed: the solid state and the molecular perspective. The first consists in analysing the frontier electronic bands and crystal orbitals of the electronic ground state (GS) in periodic boundary conditions, while the latter points to an accurate computation of the excited states in representative clusters at the molecular level. Herein, we apply both approaches to evaluate the optical absorption properties of three experimentally reported Ti(iv) mononuclear MOFs with in silico metal substitutions with Zn(ii), Cd(ii), Fe(ii), Ru(ii) and Zr(iv) ions, thus covering d10, d6 and d0 electronic configurations of 1st and 2nd row TMCs in MOFs.

METHODS: Risk of metachronous carcinogenesis was evaluated in 88 patients with intramucosal esophageal carcinoma (without history of metachronous esophageal or head and neck squamous cell carcinomas) who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection from 2007 to 2008 and were endoscopically observed for > 3 years. Histologically, the papillary vessel is defined as the clock gear-like structure composed of capillaries directly penetrating the epithelium (starting from the lamina propria) and covering at least two-thirds of it, around which the tumor cells are arranged in a spiral pattern. RESULTS: Median endoscopic follow-up period was 11.0 years. Cumulative 2-, 5-, and 10-year metachronous esophageal carcinoma rates were 11.4%, 20.6%, and 39.3%, respectively. Stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis identified multiple Lugol-voiding lesions (LVLs) as the single significant independent predictor.

There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a similar entity in adults (MIS-A). We report a case of a young adult with a hyperinflammatory systemic syndrome with end-organ lesions and a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods and Procedures: The patient developed end-organ lesions in the respiratory, cardiovascular, digestive, haematological and mucocutaneous systems. A wide diagnostic work-up did not find any specific aetiology (autoimmunity, neoplastic or infectious). There was evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection with positive autoimmune titres (positive IgG). A presumptive diagnosis of MIS-A was made and treatment with corticosteroids was introduced with improvement. Discussion: COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults is still an unknown entity with no diagnostic criteria or treatment guidelines. Much of what is known is inferred from what we already know about MIS-C. There have been several reported cases with severity ranging from mild to severe. The mechanisms behind this condition are still largely unknown. More evidence is needed to establish diagnosis and treatment. LEARNING POINTS: COVID-19-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults is a new entity with few case reports.Awareness is important for early diagnosis and treatment.","Pombo, F.; Seabra, C.; Soares, V.; Sa, A.

However, most of these studies only examined narrative coherence after the stressor had already occurred. Given the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 in March 2020 in Belgium and the presence of data obtained two years before (February 2018), we could use our baseline narrative coherence data to predict emotional well-being and perceived social support in the midst of the pandemic. In a sample of emerging adults (NT1 = 278, NT2 = 198), higher baseline coherence of narratives about positive autobiographical experiences predicted relative increases in emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the relation between the coherence of positive narratives and emotional well-being was partially mediated by perceived social support. These findings suggest that narrative coherence could be an enhancement factor for adaptive emotional coping with stressful situations, in part by evoking more supportive social reactions. This study demonstrates the importance of researching cognition (narrative coherence) and emotion (well-being) to shed light on pressing societal matters such as the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Bijttebier, Patricia; Fivush, Robyn; Hermans, Dirk",Cogn Emot,488,25

A prolonged incubation period, atypical IC symptoms, and originally altered results of laboratory and instrumental diagnosis are characteristic of recipients due to immunosuppression. In 2020, the coronavirus infection (COVID-19) rapidly spread worldwide, and timely diagnosis and searching for effective treatments for this disease became a major challenge. From January 2010 through July 2020, 148 patients received orthotopic heart transplants at the V.A. Almazov National Medical Research Center; 34 of these patients died by the present time and were excluded from this analysis. 114 patients were included into the retrospective evaluation of results. These patients had been a part of the group followed up at the Center for more than a month.Results From March through July 2020, 12 (10.5â%) of 114 CT recipients were infected with the virus SARS-CoV-2. In 75â% (n=9) of the sick patients, the COVID-19 infection developed after more than one year after CT. From the first day of clinical symptoms, mycophenolic acid/everolimus were temporarily suspended. The outpatient treatment was started on the first day and included an antiviral therapy (oseltamivir), mucolytics (bromhexine), vitamin C, and anticoagulants. If the disease onset was associated with pyretic fever the empiric antibacterial levofloxacin treatment was administered due to a high risk of mixed infection. Hospitalized patients with moderately severe COVID-19 (n=3) were treated with oxygen inhalation through nasal cannula and prone position with a positive effect.Conclusion Remote counseling of patients after CT and consistency of the outpatient treatment with recommendations of managing transplant physicians provided timely diagnosis of IC, early administration of treatment, and the absence of COVID-19 complications. Reducing the regimen of immunosuppressive therapy (antiproliferative agents) for up to 14 days facilitated infection control and was not associated with acute rejection crisis and/or impairment of the transplant function.","Simonenko, M A; Fedotov, P A; Sazonova, Yu V; Monosova, K I; Sitnikova, M Yu; Nikolaev, G V; Gordeev, M L; Karpenko, M A",Kardiologiia,488,24

Anticipating an unsustainable burden on the health service, the UK Government introduced numerous legislative measures culminating in the Coronavirus Act, which interfere with existing legislation and rights. However, the existing standards and legal frameworks relevant to critical care clinicians are not extinguished, but anticipated to adapt to a new context. This new context influences the standard of care that can be reasonably provided and yields many human rights considerations, for example, in the use of restraints, or the restrictions placed on patients and visitors under the Infection Prevention and Control guidance. The changing landscape has also highlighted previously unrecognised legal dilemmas. The perceived difficulties in the provision of personal protective equipment for employees pose a legal risk for Trusts and a regulatory risk for clinicians. The spectre of rationing critical care poses a number of legal issues. Notably, the flux between clinical decisions based on best interests towards decisions explicitly based on resource considerations should be underpinned by an authoritative public policy decision to preserve legitimacy and lawfulness. Such a policy should be medically coherent, legally robust and ethically justified. The current crisis poses numerous challenges for clinicians aspiring to remain faithful to medicolegal and human rights principles developed over many decades, especially when such principles could easily be dismissed. However, it is exactly at such times that these principles are needed the most and clinicians play a disproportionate role in safeguarding them for the most vulnerable.","Coghlan, N; Archard, D; Sipanoun, P; Hayes, T; Baharlo, B",Anaesthesia,488,24

It is a life-threatening condition exclusive to children with no effective treatment. Methods: In this study, we used system-level and vaccinomics approaches to design a polyvalent vaccine for RSV, which could stimulate the immune components of the host to manage this infection. Our framework involves data accession, antigenicity and subcellular localization analysis, T cell epitope prediction, proteasomal and conservancy evaluation, host-pathogen-protein interactions, pathway studies, and in silico binding affinity analysis. Results: We found glycoprotein (G), fusion protein (F), and small hydrophobic protein (SH) of RSV as potential vaccine candidates. Of these proteins (G, F, and SH), we found 9 epitopes for multiple alleles of MHC classes I and II bear significant binding affinity. These potential epitopes were linked to form a polyvalent construct using AAY, GPGPG linkers, and cholera toxin B adjuvant at N-terminal with a 23.9 kDa molecular weight of 224 amino acid residues. The final construct was a stable, immunogenic, and nonallergenic protein containing cleavage sites, TAP transport efficiency, posttranslation shifts, and CTL epitopes. The molecular docking indicated the optimum binding affinity of RSV polyvalent construct with MHC molecules (-12.49 and -10.48 kcal/mol for MHC classes I and II, respectively). This interaction showed that a polyvalent construct could manage and control this disease. Conclusion: Our vaccinomics and system-level investigation could be appropriate to trigger the host immune system to prevent RSV infection.","Naqvi, Syeda Tahira Qousain; Yasmeen, Mamoona; Ismail, Mehreen; Muhammad, Syed Aun; Nawazish-I-Husain, Syed; Ali, Amjad; Munir, Fahad; Zhang, QiYu",Biomed Res Int,488,22

Based on this model, the software allows to evaluate the efficacy of user-defined, arbitrary NPI and testing strategies in reducing the transmission potential in different contexts.

METHODS: A national sample of 6,607 adults (4.4% who reported testing positive for COVID-19, 25.3% testing negative, and 70.3% untested) were recruited an online platform andcompleted the Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2, PTSD-Checklist for DSM-5, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification-Consumption scale, and an item assessing SI in May-June 2020. A series of multivariable analyses were conducted. RESULTS: In the total sample, 35.3% screened positive for current AUD, 33.6% for MDD, 33.6% for GAD, 24.6% for SI, and 20.2% for CS. Past 2-week SI (adjusted odds ratios [AORs]= 1.49-12.06), number of close friends (AORs= 1.40-2.72), history of AUD (AORs= 1.15-1.92), history of anxiety disorder (AORs= 1.07-2.63), and younger age (AORs= 0.97-0.98) were significantly associated with screening positive for MDD, GAD, CS, and AUD. COVID-19 status was not independently associated with these conditions, but the combination of testing positive for COVID-19, meeting criteria for AUD, and screening positive for MDD, GAD, or CS predicted a 96% probability for SI. CONCLUSION: Predisposing factors are stronger predictors of psychological distress than personal COVID-19 infection or exposure. The additive effects of COVID-19 infection, alcohol use, and psychiatric problems in predicting SI suggest screening, monitoring, and treating these conditions in population-based prevention and treatment efforts may be important.","Tsai, Jack; Elbogen, Eric B; Huang, Minda; North, Carol S; Pietrzak, Robert H",J Affect Disord,488,7

We discuss how such a programme might be organised, arguing that frequent testing and rapid reporting of results are particularly important. We highlight studies demonstrating that polymerase chain reaction testing of pooled samples can be undertaken with acceptable loss of sensitivity, and advocate such an approach where test capacity is limited. We provide an approach to calculating the most efficient pool size.

In this paper, we discuss use of an external emergency department (ED) site by a hospital system based in Charlotte, North Carolina to address concerns of a local surge similar to those seen around the country. OBJECTIVE: Demonstrate how expansion of ED facilities can increase efficiency of care for patients while also improving safety for clinicians, staff, and non-infected patients. METHODS: We describe development and implementation of our external ED drive-through testing sites during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from three external ED sites in the Atrium Health system between March 15th and April 15th, 2020. Patients were included if they were seen at one of the sites and tested for COVID-19. There were no exclusion criteria. We analyzed the data to identify any differences in patient demographics between sites. RESULTS: We saw 580 patients across the three sites, 302 of whom met criteria for COVID-19 testing. The majority of patients tested were Caucasian females. The majority who tested positive, however, were males. Thirteen patients were redirected into the hospital ED for further medical evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: External expansion of the ED is an important strategy that can allow hospitals to accommodate potentially infectious patients while maintaining appropriate isolation and rapid throughput. Proper implementation of the right system to meet hospital-specific needs can prove effective for the healthcare system.","Bradley, Keegan; Constantine, Tyler; Morel, Benjamin; Waggy, Catherine; O039,; Bryon, Stephanie; Barnard, Kathy; Callaway, David",J. emerg. med,488,16

This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong adaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a key milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g., Covid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses against CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate protection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response system. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that exploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e., the human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation requirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is derived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled effect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can help to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune response means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the other hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine development efforts. Our proposal has been evaluated using CoVs immune response dataset, with results showing an average IFNs activation prediction accuracy of 90%, compared to 85% using feed-forward neural networks.","Henna, Shagufta",,488,24

SGs contain a large set of proteins, as well as mRNAs that have been stalled in translation as a result of stress-induced polysome disassembly. Despite the fact that SGs have been extensively studied for many years, their function is still not clear. They presumably help the cell to cope with the encountered stress, and facilitate the recovery process after stress removal upon which SGs disassemble. Aberrant formation of SGs and impaired SG disassembly majorly contribute to various pathological phenomena in cancer, viral infections, and neurodegeneration. The assembly of SGs is largely driven by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), however, the molecular mechanisms behind that are not fully understood. Recent studies have proposed a novel mechanism for SG formation that involves the interplay of a large interaction network of mRNAs and proteins. Here, we review this novel concept of SG assembly, and discuss the current insights into SG disassembly.","Hofmann, Sarah; Kedersha, Nancy; Anderson, Paul; Ivanov, Pavel",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,488,24

The pandemic has had an inevitable negative impact on education globally. This paper critiques the South African Department of Basic Education's opening of schools at the beginning of severe winter in June 2020 based on the claim of having the capacity to implement preventive measures against the spread of COVID-19 in schools. Using literature, government statements and constitutional frameworks, we argue that it was unrealistic, irrational and contradictory to open schools when the government was decongesting other public sectors and at a time when the country was in severe cold season, which is suitable for the survival of the corona virus. We note that schools opened when the COVID-19 infections and fatalities were heightening in the country, when winter was at its doorsteps and personal protective equipments (PPEs) were inadequately supplied in schools. We also argue that it was a myth that children are safe from COVID-19 and saving the school calendar at the expense of human life was catastrophic and therefore schools should not have opened in the severe winter, without a cure or vaccine for the COVID-19. © 2021 Sciendo.

Diagnosis of suspected cases is confirmed by nucleic acid assays with real-time PCR, using respiratory samples. Serology tests are comparatively easier to perform, but their utility may be limited by the performance and the fact that antibodies appear later during the disease course. We aimed to describe the performance data on serological assays for COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of multiple reports and kit inserts on the diagnostic performance of rapid tests from various manufacturers that are commercially available were performed. Only preliminary data are available currently. RESULTS: From a total of nine rapid detection test (RDT) kits, three kits offer total antibody detection, while six kits offer combination SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG detection in two separate test lines. All kits are based on colloidal gold-labeled immunochromatography principle and one-step method with results obtained within 15 minutes, using whole blood, serum or plasma samples. The sensitivity for both IgM and IgG tests ranges between 72.7% and 100%, while specificity ranges between 98.7% to 100%. Two immunochromatography using nasopharyngeal or throat swab for detection of COVID-19 specific antigen are also reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: There is much to determine regarding the value of serological testing in COVID-19 diagnosis and monitoring. More comprehensive evaluations of their performance are rapidly underway. The use of serology methods requires appropriate interpretations of the results and understanding the strengths and limitations of such tests.","Zainol Rashid, Z; Othman, S N; Abdul Samat, M N; Ali, U K; Wong, K K",Malays J Pathol,488,9

The significance of the expansion and diversification of RhlE-like proteins for bacterial fitness has not yet been established. Here, we study the two RhlE homologs present in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We show that, in the course of evolution, RhlE1 and RhlE2 have diverged in their biological functions, molecular partners and RNA-dependent enzymatic activities. Whereas RhlE1 is mainly needed for growth in the cold, RhlE2 also acts as global post-transcriptional regulator, affecting the level of hundreds of cellular transcripts indispensable for both environmental adaptation and virulence. The global impact of RhlE2 is mediated by its unique C-terminal extension, which supports the RNA unwinding activity of the N-terminal domain as well as an RNA-dependent interaction with the RNase E endonuclease and the cellular RNA degradation machinery. Overall, our work reveals how the functional and molecular divergence between two homologous RNA helicases can contribute to bacterial fitness and pathogenesis.","Hausmann, Stéphane; Gonzalez, Diego; Geiser, Johan; Valentini, Martina",Nucleic acids res,488,16

OBJECTIVES: To determine the predictors of severe COVID-19 disease requiring admission to an ICU by comparing patients who were ICU admitted to non-ICU groups. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted for the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients who were admitted to six Saudi Ministry of Health's hospitals in Alahsa, between March 1, 2020, and July 30, 2020, by reviewing patient's medical records retrospectively. RESULTS: This cohort included 1014 patients with an overall mean age of 47.2 ± 19.3 years and 582 (57%) were males. A total of 205 (20%) of the hospitalized patients were admitted to the ICU. Hypertension, diabetes and obesity were the most common comorbidities in all study patients (27.2, 19.9, and 9%, respectively). The most prevalent symptoms were cough (47.7%), shortness of breath (35.7%) and fever (34.3%). Compared with non-ICU group, ICU patients had older age (p &#8804; 0.0005) and comprised a higher proportion of the current smokers and had higher respiratory rates (p &#8804; 0.0005), and more percentage of body temperatures in the range of 37.3-38.0 °C (p &#8805; 0.0005); and had more comorbidities including diabetes (p &#8804; 0.0005), hypertension (p &#8805; 0.0005), obesity (p = 0.048), and sickle cell disease (p = 0.039). There were significant differences between the non-ICU and ICU groups for fever, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, vomiting, dizziness; elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, alanine aminotransferase and alkaline aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and ferritin, and decreased hemoglobin; and proportion of abnormal bilateral chest CT images (p < 0.05). Significant differences were also found for multiple treatments (p < 0.05). ICU patients group had a much higher mortality rate than those with non-ICU admission (p &#8804; 0.0005). CONCLUSION: Identifying key clinical characteristics of COVID-19 that predict ICU admission and high mortality can be useful for frontline healthcare providers in making the right clinical decision under time-sensitive and resource-constricted environment.","Alhumaid, Saad; Al Mutair, Abbas; Al Alawi, Zainab; Al Salman, Khulud; Al Dossary, Nourah; Omar, Ahmed; Alismail, Mossa; Al Ghazal, Ali M; Jubarah, Mahdi Bu; Al Shaikh, Hanan; Al Mahdi, Maher M; Alsabati, Sarah Y; Philip, Dayas K; Alyousef, Mohammed Y; Al Brahim, Abdulsatar H; Al Athan, Maitham S; Alomran, Salamah A; Ahmed, Hatim S; Al-Shammari, Haifa; Elhazmi, Alyaa; Rabaan, Ali A; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Al-Omari, Awad",Eur J Med Res,488,1

However, apprehension exists that variants of concern (VOCs) may evade vaccine protection, due to evidence of reduced neutralization of the VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 by vaccine sera in laboratory assays. We performed a matched cohort study to examine the distribution of VOCs in infections of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccinees from Clalit Health Services (Israel) using viral genomic sequencing, and hypothesized that if vaccine effectiveness against a VOC is reduced, its proportion among breakthrough cases would be higher than in unvaccinated controls. Analyzing 813 viral genome sequences from nasopharyngeal swabs, we showed that vaccinees who tested positive at least 7 days after the second dose were disproportionally infected with B.1.351, compared with controls. Those who tested positive between 2 weeks after the first dose and 6 days after the second dose were disproportionally infected by B.1.1.7. These findings suggest reduced vaccine effectiveness against both VOCs within particular time windows. Our results emphasize the importance of rigorously tracking viral variants, and of increasing vaccination to prevent the spread of VOCs.","Kustin, Talia; Harel, Noam; Finkel, Uriah; Perchik, Shay; Harari, Sheri; Tahor, Maayan; Caspi, Itamar; Levy, Rachel; Leshchinsky, Michael; Ken Dror, Shifra; Bergerzon, Galit; Gadban, Hala; Gadban, Faten; Eliassian, Eti; Shimron, Orit; Saleh, Loulou; Ben-Zvi, Haim; Keren Taraday, Elena; Amichay, Doron; Ben-Dor, Anat; Sagas, Dana; Strauss, Merav; Shemer Avni, Yonat; Huppert, Amit; Kepten, Eldad; Balicer, Ran D; Netzer, Doron; Ben-Shachar, Shay; Stern, Adi",Nat. med,488,16

SARS-CoV-2 was found to cause the severe respiratory syndrome, and on January 22, 2020 first human-to-human transmission was reported. We aimed to reveal the complete genomes of 19 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Denizli province and identify Turkish patients' genetic similarities. METHODOLOGY: 15 samples with the highest viral loads resulting from RT-PCR were selected for NGS analysis. Fifteen SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences were then subjected to phylogenetic analysis and uploaded to the GISAID database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the Neighbor-Joining method using MEGAX software. RESULTS: Whole-genome sequencing of the viral RNA samples revealed 32 missense, 21 synonymous, and 4 non-coding alleles. In all samples c.1-25C>T (5'UTR), c.14144C>T (ORF1ab), c.2772C>T (ORF1ab) and c.1841A>G(S) mutations were detected. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of the present study's genomes are in 20B clade while the two are in 20A. The phylogenetic tree constructed with all complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes of Turkey showed that the viruses were spread nearly homogenous on eastern (around Kars) and western (around Istanbul) sides. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we reported the viral genomes in Denizli comprehensively for the first time. We identified 11 rare missense mutations in the virus compared to the reference genome. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that while most of our isolates were similar to European sequences, some had different sublineages depending on their genomic variants.","Tokgun, Onur; Caliskan, Ahmet; Coskun, Cagil; Tokgun, Pervin Elvan; Akca, Hakan",J Infect Dev Ctries,488,24

There are currently over 1.6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide which has resulted in more the 100,000 deaths. As these numbers grow daily, hospitals are being forced to reuse surgical masks in hopes of conserving their dwindling supply. Since COVID-19 will most likely have effects that last for many months, our nationwide shortage of masks poses a long term issue that must be addressed immediately. METHODS: Based on a previous study by Quan et al., a salt-based soaking strategy has been reported to enhance the filtration ability of surgical masks. We propose a similar soaking process which uses materials widely available in anyone's household. We tested this method of pretreating a variety of materials with a salt-based solution by a droplet test using fluorescently stained nanoparticles similar in size to the COVID-19 virus. RESULTS: In this study, we found that paper towels and surgical masks pretreated with the salt-based solution showed a noticeable increase in filtration of nanoparticles similar in size to the COVID-19 virus. We also show that the TWEEN20 used by Quan et al. is not a critical component for the solution, and using salt alone in solution still provides a dramatically increased level of protection. CONCLUSIONS: We believe this method will allow for healthcare workers to create a disposable added layer of protection to their surgical masks, N95s, or homemade masks by using household available products. Adoption of this method may play an essential role in ensuring the safety of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic and any pandemics that may arise in the future.","Carnino, Jonathan M; Ryu, Sunhyo; Ni, Kareemah; Jin, Yang",Am J Infect Control,488,16

Several studies have been conducted to decide whether the chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans of patients indicate COVID-19. While these efforts resulted in successful classification systems, the design of a portable and cost-effective COVID-19 diagnosis system has not been addressed yet. The memory requirements of the current state-of-the-art COVID-19 diagnosis systems are not suitable for embedded systems due to the required large memory size of these systems (e.g., hundreds of megabytes). Thus, the current work is motivated to design a similar system with minimal memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a diagnosis system using a Raspberry Pi Linux embedded system. First, local features are extracted using local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm. Second, the global features are extracted from the chest X-ray or CT scans using multi-channel fractional-order Legendre-Fourier moments (MFrLFMs). Finally, the most significant features (local and global) are selected. The proposed system steps are integrated to fit the low computational and memory capacities of the embedded system. The proposed method has the smallest computational and memory resources,less than the state-of-the-art methods by two to three orders of magnitude, among existing state-of-the-art deep learning (DL)-based methods.","Hosny, Khalid M; Darwish, Mohamed M; Li, Kenli; Salah, Ahmad",PLoS One,488,33

While tools for risk assessment have recently been developed, no safety guideline has been proposed to protect against it. We here build on models of airborne disease transmission in order to derive an indoor safety guideline that would impose an upper bound on the ""cumulative exposure time,"" the product of the number of occupants and their time in an enclosed space. We demonstrate how this bound depends on the rates of ventilation and air filtration, dimensions of the room, breathing rate, respiratory activity and face mask use of its occupants, and infectiousness of the respiratory aerosols. By synthesizing available data from the best-characterized indoor spreading events with respiratory drop size distributions, we estimate an infectious dose on the order of 10 aerosol-borne virions. The new virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]) is thus inferred to be an order of magnitude more infectious than its forerunner (SARS-CoV), consistent with the pandemic status achieved by COVID-19. Case studies are presented for classrooms and nursing homes, and a spreadsheet and online app are provided to facilitate use of our guideline. Implications for contact tracing and quarantining are considered, and appropriate caveats enumerated. Particular consideration is given to respiratory jets, which may substantially elevate risk when face masks are not worn.","Bazant, Martin Z; Bush, John W M",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,488,16

Coronavirus disease 2019, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), remains an ongoing global pandemic. It is an urgent challenge to clarify the innate recognition mechanism to control this virus. Here we show that retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) sufficiently restrains SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells in a type I/III interferon (IFN)-independent manner. RIG-I recognizes the 3' untranslated region of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome via the helicase domains, but not the C-terminal domain. This new mode of RIG-I recognition does not stimulate its ATPase, thereby aborting the activation of the conventional mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein-dependent pathways, which is in accordance with lack of cytokine induction. Nevertheless, the interaction of RIG-I with the viral genome directly abrogates viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediation of the first step of replication. Consistently, genetic ablation of RIG-I allows lung cells to produce viral particles that expressed the viral spike protein. By contrast, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity was restored by all-trans retinoic acid treatment through upregulation of RIG-I protein expression in primary lung cells derived from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Thus, our findings demonstrate the distinctive role of RIG-I as a restraining factor in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human lung cells.","Yamada, Taisho; Sato, Seiichi; Sotoyama, Yuki; Orba, Yasuko; Sawa, Hirofumi; Yamauchi, Hajime; Sasaki, Michihito; Takaoka, Akinori",Nat. immunol,488,20

To address this issue, re-use of surgical face masks and filtering facepiece respirators has been recommended; prior decontamination is paramount to their re-use. AIM: We aim to provide information on the effects of three decontamination procedures on porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV)-contaminated masks and respirators, presenting a stable model for infectious coronavirus decontamination of these typically single-use-only products. METHODS: Surgical masks and filtering facepiece respirator coupons and straps were inoculated with infectious PRCV and submitted to three decontamination treatments, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, vaporized H2O2, and dry heat treatment. Viruses were recovered from sample materials and viral titres were measured in swine testicle cells. FINDINGS: UV irradiation, vaporized H2O2 and dry heat reduced infectious PRCV by more than three orders of magnitude on mask and respirator coupons and rendered it undetectable in all decontamination assays. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of stable disinfection of face masks and filtering facepiece respirators contaminated with an infectious SARS-CoV-2 surrogate using UV irradiation, vaporized H2O2 and dry heat treatment. The three methods permit demonstration of a loss of infectivity by more than three orders of magnitude of an infectious coronavirus in line with the United States Food and Drug Administration policy regarding face masks and respirators. It presents advantages of uncomplicated manipulation and utilization in a BSL2 facility, therefore being easily adaptable to other respirator and mask types.","Ludwig-Begall, L F; Wielick, C; Dams, L; Nauwynck, H; Demeuldre, P-F; Napp, A; Laperre, J; Haubruge, E; Thiry, E",J. hosp. infect,488,13

The severity of COVID-19 is related, in a large measure, to the extent of pulmonary involvement. The role of chest CT imaging in the management of patients with COVID-19 has evolved since the onset of the pandemic. Specifically, the description of CT scan findings, use of chest CT imaging in various acute and subacute settings, and its usefulness in predicting chronic disease have been defined better. We performed a review of published data on CT scans in patients with COVID-19. A summary of the range of imaging findings, from typical to less common abnormalities, is provided. Familiarity with these findings may facilitate the diagnosis and management of this disease. A comparison of sensitivity and specificity of chest CT imaging with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing highlights the potential role of CT imaging in difficult-to-diagnose cases of COVID-19. The usefulness of CT imaging to assess prognosis, to guide management, and to identify acute pulmonary complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection is highlighted. Beyond the acute stage, it is important for clinicians to recognize pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities, progressive fibrotic lung disease, and vascular changes that may be responsible for persistent respiratory symptoms.

Published guidelines point out that low dose and short duration systemic glucocorticoid therapy may be considered for patients with rapidly progressing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) while the evidence is still limited. Methods: We comprehensively searched electronic databases and supplemented the screening by conducting a manual search. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucocorticoids in children and adults with COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and conducted meta-analyses of the main indicators that were identified in the studies. Results: Our search retrieved 23 studies, including one RCT and 22 cohort studies, with a total of 13,815 patients. In adults with COVID-19, the use of systemic glucocorticoid did not reduce mortality [risk ratio (RR) =2.00, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.69 to 5.75, I2=90.9%] or the duration of lung inflammation [weighted mean difference (WMD) =-1 days, 95% CI: -2.91 to 0.91], while a significant reduction was found in the duration of fever (WMD =-3.23 days, 95% CI: -3.56 to -2.90). In patients with SARS, glucocorticoids also did not reduce the mortality (RR =1.52, 95% CI: 0.89 to 2.60, I2=84.6%), duration of fever (WMD =0.82 days, 95% CI: -2.88 to 4.52, I2=97.9%) or duration of lung inflammation absorption (WMD =0.95 days, 95% CI: -7.57 to 9.48, I2=94.6%). The use of systemic glucocorticoid therapy prolonged the duration of hospital stay in all patients (COVID-19, SARS and MERS). Conclusions: Glucocorticoid therapy was found to reduce the duration of fever, but not mortality, duration of hospitalization or lung inflammation absorption. Long-term use of high-dose glucocorticoids increased the risk of adverse reactions such as coinfections, so routine use of systemic glucocorticoids for patients with COVID-19 cannot be recommend.","Lu, Shuya; Zhou, Qi; Huang, Liping; Shi, Qianling; Zhao, Siya; Wang, Zijun; Li, Weiguo; Tang, Yuyi; Ma, Yanfang; Luo, Xufei; Fukuoka, Toshio; Ahn, Hyeong Sik; Lee, Myeong Soo; Luo, Zhengxiu; Liu, Enmei; Chen, Yaolong; Zhou, Chenyan; Peng, Donghong",Ann.

Results showed that, compared to participants with no or mild mental health-related symptoms, participants with moderate to severe depressive symptoms suffered from greater psychological effects of the pandemic and the lockdown (fear, anxiety, sadness, sleep quality, loss of daily routine). However, health risk behaviors (smoking, drinking, non-compliance with lockdown and barrier gestures) and perceived vulnerability did not differ between the participant groups, although more severely depressed participants tended to be less respectful of health guidelines. In addition, the most heightened effects on the depressed participants were boredom and the feeling of social isolation, which was not compensated by the search for social affiliation. Supporting people with depression should be a public health priority because they suffer psychologically more than others from the pandemic and the lockdown.","Martinelli, Natalia; Gil, Sandrine; Chevalère, Johann; Belletier, Clément; Dezecache, Guillaume; Huguet, Pascal; Droit-Volet, Sylvie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),488,14

We propose a network dynamics model of epidemic transmission introducing a heterogeneous control factor. The proposed model applied the classical susceptible- exposed-infectious-recovered model to the network based on effective distance and was modified by introducing a heterogeneous control factor with temporal and spatial characteristics. International aviation data were approximately used to estimate the flux fraction matrix, and the effective distance was calculated. Through parameter estimation and simulation, the theoretical values of the modified model fit well with practical values. By adjusting the parameters and observing the change of the results, we found that the modified model is more in line with the actual needs and has higher credibility in the comprehensive analysis. The assessment shows that the number of confirmed cases worldwide will reach about 20 million optimistically. In severe cases, the peak value will exceed 80 million, and the late stage of the epidemic shows a long tail shape, lasting more than one and a half years. The effective way to control the global epidemic is to strengthen international cooperation and to impose international travel restrictions and other measures.","Sheng, Huaxiong; Wu, Lin; Wu, Tingting; Peng, Bo",J. med. virol,488,24

Periodic assessment of R can inform public health strategies during long-standing epidemics such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) situation. This is especially relevant for large and resource-poor countries such as India, which may require differential intervention strategies in different regions. However, the complexity of the calculation involved often proves to be a barrier for calculation of R. This communication proposes a simpler data collection and analytical method - involving a combination approach instead of full-fledged primary data collection - to estimate R for public health decision-making. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Data from available sources (time series data of new cases at population level) can be combined with some primary data (time interval between infection of index and secondary cases in family clusters) that can be collected with little resources. These data can then be fed into an approximation-based method (Wallinga and Lipsitch) for R calculation at the state/regional levels. The calculations can be repeated every fortnight using newly available data. RESULTS: The value of R, estimated using the proposed method, from subsequent periods can be used for assessing the status of the epidemic and values from subsequent periods can be compared for decision-making regarding implementation/modification of control measures. CONCLUSIONS: The approximate R may be a little inaccurate but can still prove useful for rough estimation of epidemic evolution and for comparison between different periods, as the extent of error in R values across different periods is likely to be similar. Thus, the approximate R may not only be used to estimate the epidemic change in smaller geographies such as states/regions but also used for making appropriate changes to public health measures for managing a pandemic such as COVID-19.","Das, A",Public Health,488,16

STUDY DESIGN: The study used qualitative, semistructured interviews. METHODS: The study involved thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. Thirty semistructured telephone interviews with parents of children between 4 and 18 years. RESULTS: We found four themes relating to symptom attribution ('normalising symptoms', 'err on the side of caution', 'experience of temperature', 'symptoms not normal for us'). In general, parents were more likely to attribute symptoms to COVID-19 if a temperature was present or the symptoms were perceived as 'unusual' for their family. Four themes relating to self-isolation ('difficult to prevent contact with children', 'isolation would be no different to lockdown life', 'ability to get food and supplies', 'limited space'). Parents believed they would find isolation within the household difficult or impossible if they had dependent children, had limited space or could not shop for groceries. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight complexities in symptom perception, attribution and household isolation. We suggest that they can be overcome by (a) providing better guidance on what symptoms require action, (b) providing guidance as to how to prevent infection within the household and (c) by supporting families with grocery shopping through a potential second or third wave.","Hodson, A; Woodland, L; Smith, L E; Rubin, G J",Public Health,488,1

This syndrome has been named COVID-19 for CoronaVIrus Disease 2019 by the World Health Organization. The starting point of the epidemic is the city of Wuhan (China), where the virus is said to have been transmitted from animals to humans before inter-human transmission. This is the third epidemic caused by a coronavirus after those of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) started in 2012. COVID-19 has rapidly spread to China and is currently spreading all over the world. The infection mainly affects patients over 40 years of age and mortality is increased in the presence of comorbidities. Children are pauci- or asymptomatic. The diagnosis is most often based on the detection of the viral genome in the nasopharynx by molecular biology methods. In the absence of specific anti-viral molecules, treatment is currently mainly symptomatic. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic is more difficult to control than what the first data suggested. The key strategy to SARS-CoV-2 is to limit its transmission. Preventive measures are mainly based on the application of adequate hand hygiene measures and disinfection of the environment, as well as measures of social distance aimed at limiting contacts in the population and protecting populations at risk.","Davenne, E; Giot, J B; Huynen, P",Rev Med Liege,488,17

Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses assessed scale structure. Factor analysis stratified by depression was used to assess measurement invariance. Linear regression models examined COVID-19-related worry determinants. The CoV-Wo scale exhibited good reliability (alpha = 0.80) and a two-factor structure: health (alpha = 0.83) and resources (alpha = 0.71). The full scale and both subscales were higher among participants who stopped working due to COVID-19 and those with depression. Perception of quality medical care if infected with COVID-19 was associated with reduced worry.

Very short answer questions (VSAQs) are a reliable and discriminatory alternative that encourage learners to use more authentic clinical reasoning strategies compared to SBAQs. However, the challenge of marking VSAQs has limited their integration into TBL; we therefore explored the feasibility of VSAQs within a TBL session. METHODS: An online platform was developed to allow immediate marking of VSAQs during the TBL sessions. As part of the readiness assurance process, students completed VSAQs and SBAQs, which were marked in real time. RESULTS: Instructors were able to mark all VSAQs during the individual readiness assurance test (iRAT), which facilitated the provision of immediate feedback during the team readiness assurance test (tRAT). The mean time to mark five VSAQs was 422 seconds (SD 73 seconds). For VSAQs, the number of attempts to reach the correct answer ranged from 1 to 38, compared to 1 to 4 for SBAQs. In total, 71.6% of students agreed that using VSAQs in TBL helped to emphasise group discussions. DISCUSSION: The wide range of attempts at, and students' perspectives of VSAQs are suggestive of their positive impact on student discussion during TBL. We demonstrate how new technology allows VSAQs to be feasibly integrated into TBL with the potential to enrich group discussions.","Millar, Kate R; Reid, Michael D; Rajalingam, Preman; Canning, Claire A; Halse, Omid; Low-Beer, Naomi; Sam, Amir H",Clin. teach,488,26

Our objective was to provide a detailed clinical description of an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that occurred after a sporting and social event during the early days of the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive study of a curling bonspiel in Edmonton held on Mar. 11-14, 2020. We used standardized interviews between Apr. 17 and May 5, 2020, to collect demographic data, travel history, symptoms (type, onset and duration), self-reported testing results for SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and clinical outcomes. We also obtained results of convalescent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G serology. RESULTS: All 73 curlers (55 active health care workers) who participated in the bonspiel were interviewed for the study. Convalescent SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin G serology was completed in 62 (85%) participants. Of the 73 participants (55 [75%] male, median age 51 [range 26-79] yr, 58 [79%] physicians), 40 curlers (55%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR; an additional 16 participants developed symptoms but had negative swabs or were not tested (14 were probable cases), for a 74% attack rate (confirmed or probable cases). Anosmia with ageusia or dysgeusia occurred in 39 of 54 (72%) confirmed or probable cases. The clinical course was mild in most participants (1 emergency visit, no hospital admissions). Transmission likely occurred from multiple individuals with minor nonspecific symptoms during the event, possibly during shared meals. INTERPRETATION: The 74% attack rate (confirmed or probable cases) highlights the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 during sporting and social events. This reinforces the need for public health measures (masking, physical distancing and limiting the size of social gatherings) during future waves of COVID-19 in Canada.","Burak, Kelly W; Law, Sampson; Rice, Chris; Hu, Jia; Fung, Christopher I; Woo, Allan K H; Fonseca, Kevin; Lang, Amanda L S; Kanji, Jamil N; Meatherall, Bonnie L",CMAJ Open,488,24

Typical CT findings are bilateral ground glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral and lower lobes distribution. COVID-19 causes mild symptoms in most cases, however it may progress to severe pneumonia leading to ARDS and death, especially in those with advanced age and comorbid diseases. There is no specific effective antiviral treatment for COVID-19. A number of in vitro effective agents have been identified. These agents such as chloroquine phosphate/hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir are widely used in the treatment of the disease. Convalescent plasma therapy and the cytokine inhibitory agents such as tocilizumab, used to treat disease-induced cytokine storm, are particularly preferred in the treatment severe cases.","Yildiz, Pinar Aysert; Dizbay, Murat",Gazi Med.

As the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of COVID-19, may be difficult to stop in these settings, we propose that the existing COVID-19 prevention strategies aimed at reducing overall transmission are complemented with more targeted strategies to protect people at risk of severe COVID-19 disease.

The current project explored what caused U.S. adults' fear of COVID-19 and how they regulated fear using a longitudinal two-wave survey on a national-representative sample (N = 315). Results showed that participants' media exposure frequency and their perceived valence of interpersonal communication predicted their fear of COVID-19 at both waves, and fear at wave 1 further motivated higher frequency of media and interpersonal communication as well as strengthened perceptions that their interpersonal conversations emphasized the danger aspect of COVID-19 at wave 2. Counterarguing was effective in down-regulating individuals' fear, which in turn further encouraged more subsequent use of such strategy. Avoidance used in wave 1 predicted counterarguing at wave 2, while counterarguing employed in wave 1 predicted the subsequent use of reappraisal. Individuals may choose to use counterarguing as a maladaptive coping strategy to control their fear, and they tend to shift from one emotion regulation strategy to another as the pandemic progresses.","Li, Ruobing",Health Commun,488,22

During the COVID-19 pandemic, most non-urgent clinical activities for HHT outpatients were suspended. We conducted an analytical observational cohort study to evaluate whether medical and psychological support, provided through remote consultation during the COVID-19 pandemic, could reduce the complications of HHT. Methods: A structured regimen of remote consultations, conducted by either video-calls, telephone calls, or e-mails, was provided by a multidisciplinary group of physicians to a set of patients of our HHT center. The outcomes considered were: number of emergency room visits/hospitalizations, need of blood transfusions, need of iron supplementation, worsening of epistaxis, and psychological status. Results: The study included 45 patients who received remote assistance for a total of eight months. During this period, 9 patients required emergency room visits, 6 needed blood transfusions, and 24 needed iron supplementation. This was not different from what was registered among the same 45 patients in the same period of the previous year. Remote care also resulted in better management of epistaxis and improved quality of life, with the mean epistaxis severity score and the Euro-Quality of Life-Visual Analogue Scale that were significantly better at the end than at the beginning of the study. Discussion: Remote medical care might be a valid support for HHT subjects during periods of suspended outpatient surveillance, like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gaetani, Eleonora Agostini Fabiana Di Martino Luigi Occhipinti Denis Passali Giulio Cesare Santantonio Mariaconsiglia Marano Giuseppe Mazza Marianna Pola Roberto HHT on behalf of the Multidisciplinary Gemelli Group for",Journal of Clinical Medicine,488,17

This study aimed to identify major challenges associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials among healthcare workers and staff in Uganda. Methods-a rapid exploratory survey was conducted over 5 weeks among 260 respondents (66% male) from healthcare centers across the country using an online questionnaire. Twenty-seven questions assessed knowledge, confidence, and trust scores on COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials from participants in 46 districts in Uganda. Results-we found low levels of knowledge (i.e., confusing COVID-19 with Ebola) with males being more informed than females (OR = 1.5, 95% CI: 0.7-3.0), and mistrust associated with policy decisions to promote herbal treatments in Uganda and the rushed international clinical trials, highlighting challenges for the upcoming Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccinations. Knowledge, confidence and trust scores were higher among the least educated (certificate vs. bachelor degree holders). We also found a high level of skepticism and possible community resistance to DNA recombinant vaccines, such as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Preference for herbal treatments (38/260; 14.6%, 95% CI: 10.7-19.3) currently being promoted by the Ugandan government raises major policy concerns. High fear and mistrust for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials was more common among wealthier participants and more affluent regions of the country. Conclusion-our study found that knowledge, confidence, and trust in COVID-19 vaccines was low among healthcare workers in Uganda, especially those with higher wealth and educational status. There is a need to increase transparency and inclusive participation to address these issues before new trials of COVID-19 vaccines are initiated.","Kasozi, Keneth Iceland; Laudisoit, Anne; Osuwat, Lawrence Obado; Batiha, Gaber El-Saber; Al Omairi, Naif E; Aigbogun, Eric; Ninsiima, Herbert Izo; Usman, Ibe Michael; DeTora, Lisa M; MacLeod, Ewan Thomas; Nalugo, Halima; Crawley, Francis P; Bierer, Barbara E; Mwandah, Daniel Chans; Kato, Charles Drago; Kiyimba, Kenedy; Ayikobua, Emmanuel Tiyo; Lillian, Linda; Matama, Kevin; Nelly Mak, Shui Ching; Onanyang, David; Pius, Theophilus; Nalumenya, David Paul; Ssebuufu, Robinson; Rugambwa, Nina Olivia; Musoke, Grace Henry; Bardosh, Kevin; Ochieng, Juma John; Ssempijja, Fred; Kyamanywa, Patrick; Tumwine, Gabriel; Alzahrani, Khalid J; Welburn, Susan Christina",,488,1

We report a post-hoc analysis of the efficacy of the adenoviral vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222), against this variant. METHODS: Volunteers (aged &#8805;18 years) who were enrolled in phase 2/3 vaccine efficacy studies in the UK, and who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 or a meningococcal conjugate control (MenACWY) vaccine, provided upper airway swabs on a weekly basis and also if they developed symptoms of COVID-19 disease (a cough, a fever of 37·8°C or higher, shortness of breath, anosmia, or ageusia). Swabs were tested by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for SARS-CoV-2 and positive samples were sequenced through the COVID-19 Genomics UK consortium. Neutralising antibody responses were measured using a live-virus microneutralisation assay against the B.1.1.7 lineage and a canonical non-B.1.1.7 lineage (Victoria). The efficacy analysis included symptomatic COVID-19 in seronegative participants with a NAAT positive swab more than 14 days after a second dose of vaccine. Participants were analysed according to vaccine received. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1 - relative risk (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vs MenACWY groups) derived from a robust Poisson regression model. This study is continuing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04400838, and ISRCTN, 15281137. FINDINGS: Participants in efficacy cohorts were recruited between May 31 and Nov 13, 2020, and received booster doses between Aug 3 and Dec 30, 2020. Of 8534 participants in the primary efficacy cohort, 6636 (78%) were aged 18-55 years and 5065 (59%) were female. Between Oct 1, 2020, and Jan 14, 2021, 520 participants developed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 1466 NAAT positive nose and throat swabs were collected from these participants during the trial. Of these, 401 swabs from 311 participants were successfully sequenced. Laboratory virus neutralisation activity by vaccine-induced antibodies was lower against the B.1.1.7 variant than against the Victoria lineage (geometric mean ratio 8·9, 95% CI 7·2-11·0). Clinical vaccine efficacy against symptomatic NAAT positive infection was 70·4% (95% CI 43·6-84·5) for B.1.1.7 and 81·5% (67·9-89·4) for non-B.1.1.7 lineages. INTERPRETATION: ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 showed reduced neutralisation activity against the B.1.1.7 variant compared with a non-B.1.1.7 variant in vitro, but the vaccine showed efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2.

These issues are summarized in three categories: first, stigmatization due to lack of knowledge about the source of infection; second, speculations and their consequences around lack of knowledge about transmission; and finally, the concern regarding miscommunication during such a crisis. Most of these concerns emerge from press and social media coverage of the episode. The Ebola outbreak response is an example of how social scientists and anthropologists can work with other experts to solve questions of public health importance.

Endowing robots with such an ability has applications in many domains such as domestic services, logistics, or manufacturing. Yet, it is a challenging manipulation task due to the large diversity of geometry and topology of everyday objects. In this paper, we propose a system that takes partial point clouds of an object and a supporting item as input and learns to decide where and how to hang the object stably. Our system learns to estimate the contact point correspondences between the object and supporting item to get an estimated stable pose. We then run a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to refine the predicted stable pose. Then, the robot needs to find a collision-free path to move the object from its initial pose to stable hanging pose. To this end, we train a neural network based collision estimator that takes as input partial point clouds of the object and supporting item. We generate a new and challenging, large-scale, synthetic dataset annotated with stable poses of objects hung on various supporting items and their contact point correspondences. In this dataset, we show that our system is able to achieve a 68.3% success rate of predicting stable object poses and has a 52.1% F1 score in terms of finding feasible paths.

It correlates with different phenotypes ranging from an acute febrile illness to severe respiratory problems. Often, patients with COVID-19 suffer from metabolic disorders, and this can result in a more severe clinical course. COVID-19 might also co-occur with other common diseases in different settings. In tropical countries, COVID-19 has already affected thousands of local populations. Tropical diseases such as dengue and tuberculosis can modify the clinical presentation of COVID-19 and result in difficulty in the diagnosis and treatment of the patients. The complexity of concurrence between COVID-19 and tropical diseases is, thus, a matter of concern in tropical medicine.

However, previous studies have not compared B-mode sonographic images (BSIs) and EBUS elastography images (EEIs) with final pathological diagnoses in radiologically normal-sized (computed tomography [CT]-negative) LNs. METHODS: Consecutive patients with CT-negative LNs, who received EBUS-TBNA, were retrospectively reviewed. Images of BSIs and EEIs of each LN were stored and independently evaluated. EEIs were assessed by calculating the stiffness area ratio (SAR, blue/overall areas). The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to calculate the cutoff value for the SAR. Diagnostic test parameters were evaluated for each EBUS finding. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients (149 LNs) were enrolled, and the median SAR of malignant LNs was significantly higher than that of benign LNs (0.58 vs. 0.32, P < 0.001). At the SAR cutoff of 0.41, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy rate (DAR) of elastography were 88.2%, 80.2%, 78.9%, 89.0%, and 83.9%, respectively. The logistic regression analysis showed that elastography was the strongest predictor of malignancy (odds ratio, 18.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.48-52.6; P < 0.001). The highest NPV (96.6%) was achieved with a combination of BSIs and EEIs. CONCLUSIONS: EBUS elastography predicted malignant LNs with a high DAR and NPV in CT-negative LNs. The NPV was highest when EEIs were combined with BSIs. Therefore, the combined evaluation of CT-negative LNs using EEIs and BSIs may help bronchoscopists perform EBUS-TBNA more efficiently. KEY POINTS: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Endobronchial ultrasound elastography accurately predicted malignancy with a high diagnostic accuracy rate and negative predictive value in radiologically normal-sized lymph nodes. The additional use of B-mode sonographic features resulted in a higher negative predictive value.

Given its potential for providing evidence of causality in complex systems, QCA is increasingly used in evaluative research to examine the uptake or impacts of public health interventions. We map this emerging field, assessing the strengths and weaknesses of QCA approaches identified in published studies, and identify implications for future research and reporting. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched for peer-reviewed studies published in English up to December 2019 that had used QCA methods to identify the conditions associated with the uptake and/or effectiveness of interventions for public health. Data relating to the interventions studied (settings/level of intervention/populations), methods (type of QCA, case level, source of data, other methods used) and reported strengths and weaknesses of QCA were extracted and synthesised narratively. RESULTS: The search identified 1384 papers, of which 27 (describing 26 studies) met the inclusion criteria. Interventions evaluated ranged across: nutrition/obesity (n = 8); physical activity (n = 4); health inequalities (n = 3); mental health (n = 2); community engagement (n = 3); chronic condition management (n = 3); vaccine adoption or implementation (n = 2); programme implementation (n = 3); breastfeeding (n = 2), and general population health (n = 1). The majority of studies (n = 24) were of interventions solely or predominantly in high income countries. Key strengths reported were that QCA provides a method for addressing causal complexity; and that it provides a systematic approach for understanding the mechanisms at work in implementation across contexts. Weaknesses reported related to data availability limitations, especially on ineffective interventions. The majority of papers demonstrated good knowledge of cases, and justification of case selection, but other criteria of methodological quality were less comprehensively met. CONCLUSION: QCA is a promising approach for addressing the role of context in complex interventions, and for identifying causal configurations of conditions that predict implementation and/or outcomes when there is sufficiently detailed understanding of a series of comparable cases. As the use of QCA in evaluative health research increases, there may be a need to develop advice for public health researchers and journals on minimum criteria for quality and reporting.","Hanckel, Benjamin; Petticrew, Mark; Thomas, James; Green, Judith",BMC Public Health,488,20

We aimed to determine the association between the levels of serum heavy metals, hs-CRP, vitamins, and curry intake and to predict risks of MetS based on marginal effects. A data set of 60,256 Koreans aged ≥ 15 years between 2009 and 2017 was used to obtain information on sociodemographic, lifestyle, family history characteristics, MetS, food intake survey, and serum heavy metals. Daily intake of vitamins was measured by a one-day 24 h recall, and curry consumption was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire. Serum heavy metal levels were quantified by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry and using a mercury analyzer. We found that vitamin B1, B2, B3, C, and A intakes were significantly lower in subjects with than without MetS. In contrast, serum levels of Pb, Hg, Cd, vitamin A, E, and hs-CRP were significantly higher in subjects with MetS. The risk of MetS was significantly lower for high curry consumers than low curry consumers (adjusted odds ratio 0.85, 95%CI 0.74–0.98). The risks of MetS were reduced by 12% and 1%, when vitamin B1 and C intakes increased by one mg, respectively, but were increased by 14%, 3%, and 9%, when serum levels of Pb, Hg, and hs-CRP increased by one unit. These results show that the potential health benefits resulting from vitamin and curry intakes could protect the public against the dual burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Further studies are required to reduce risk factors associated with serum heavy metal levels and to determine whether interactions between vitamin and curry consumption influence the presence of MetS.","Hai Nguyen, Duc Oh Hojin",Antioxidants,488,12

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, acupuncture has been used as a complementary treatment for COVID-19 in China. However, the underlying mechanism of acupuncture treatment of COVID-19 remains unclear. Based on bioinformatics/topology, this paper systematically revealed the multi-target mechanisms of acupuncture therapy for COVID-19 through text mining, bioinformatics, network topology, etc. Two active compounds produced after acupuncture and 180 protein targets were identified. A total of 522 Gene Ontology terms related to acupuncture for COVID-19 were identified, and 61 pathways were screened based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Our findings suggested that acupuncture treatment of COVID-19 was associated with suppression of inflammatory stress, improving immunity and regulating nervous system function, including activation of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, calcium signaling pathway, cancer pathway, viral carcinogenesis, Staphylococcus aureus infection, etc. The study also found that acupuncture may have additional benefits for COVID-19 patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease and obesity. Our study revealed for the first time the multiple synergistic mechanisms of acupuncture on COVID-19. Acupuncture may play an active role in the treatment of COVID-19 and deserves further promotion and application.

SARS-CoV-2 shares many similarities with SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A viral replication complex containing non-structural proteins (nsps) is the toolbox for RNA replication and transcription of both coronaviruses. In both cases, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the coronaviral replication complex dictates the primary polymerase activity by cooperating with cofactors. The higher transmissibility and mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 are related to its higher RNA replication activity compared to SARS-CoV. The discrepancy between the RNA replication efficiency of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can be understood by exploring interactions within their viral replication complexes. Our modeling of molecular interactions within the viral replication complexes of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 using molecular dynamics simulations suggests that in contrast to SARS-CoVnsp12, SARS-CoV2nsp12 prefers helices as the dominant interacting secondary motifs. The relative differences in nonbonded interactions between nsps could suggest viral RNA replication ability in coronaviruses.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shifa International Hospital (SIH), Islamabad from March to June 2020. METHODOLOGY: After IRB approval, 112 patients were consecutively enrolled, having laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and hospitalised in SIH. Patients' demographics and clinical data were retrieved from Radiology Information System (RIS). Chest radiographs (CXR) were retrieved from picture archive and communication system (PACS). CXR severity scoring was determined by three radiologists, and results were analysed. RESULTS: Lung opacities (98.2%), involvement of both lungs (96.4%), both peripheral and central region involvement (62.5%) and upper/mid/lower zone distribution (61.6%) were the most frequent findings. Males affected more than females with a mean age of 58.9 ± 13.1 years. Zonal involvement, density and extent of opacities peaked on 10-13th day of illness. In the last CXR, opacities showed decrease in extent as well as density, reduction in zonal involvement, and few having mixed interstitial thickening/fibrosis. One hundred and five out of 112 (93.8%) patients had residual radiographic abnormalities on discharge. CONCLUSION: Serial chest radiography can be used to monitor disease progression and temporal changes after initial HRCT. Patients who have CXR severity score of 4 or more at the time of admission, is a red flag for prolonged hospital stay and possible intubation. Severity of CXR findings peaked at 10-13 days.

The S1 domains of the two appeared to share the cellular receptor ACE2, but revealed a much higher S1-ACE2 binding affinity. As seen in many other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also shows respiratory infection, but the basic reproductive number (R0) in transmission and the clinical latency are quite dissimilar from those of SARS-or MERS-CoVs. Many scientists infer that the time point of cross-barrier transfer from bats to mediate animals or to humans should be a rather recent event based on the full-length genome analyses obtained from the very first patients.

In this study, we estimate this undetected fraction of the population by a modeling and simulation approach. We employ an epidemic model SIPHERD in which three categories of infection carriers, symptomatic, purely asymptomatic, and exposed are considered with different transmission rates that are taken dependent on the social distancing conditions, and the detection rate of the infected carriers is taken dependent on the tests done per day. The model is first validated for Germany and South Korea and then applied for prediction of the total number of confirmed, active and dead, and daily new positive cases in the United States. Our study predicts the possible outcomes of the infection if social distancing conditions are relaxed or kept stringent. We estimate that around 30.1 million people are already infected, and in the absence of any vaccine, 66.2 million (range: 64.3-68.0) people, or 20% (range: 19.4-20.5) of the population will be infected by mid-February 21 if social distancing conditions are not made stringent.

Our goal was to capture the properties of synergic behavior in football, using spatiotemporal data from one match of the 2018 FIFA WORLD CUP RUSSIA, to explore the application of player-ball-goal angles in cluster phase analysis. Linear mixed effects models were used to test the statistical significance of different effects, such as: team, half(-time), role and pitch zones. Results showed that the cluster phase values (synchronization) for the home team, had a 3.812×10-2±0.536×10-2 increase with respect to the away team (X2(41)=259.8,&nbsp;p<0.001) and that changing the role from with ball to without ball increased synchronization by 16.715×10-2±0.283×10-2 (X2(41)=12227.0,&nbsp;p<0.001). The interaction between effects was also significant. The player-team relative phase, the player-ball-goal angles relative frequency and the team configurations, showed that variations of synchronization might indicate critical performance changes (ball possession changes, goals scored, etc.). This study captured the ongoing player-environment link and the properties of team synergic behavior, supporting the use of sensor-based data computations in the development of relevant indicators for tactical analysis in sports.","Carrilho, Daniel; Santos Couceiro, Micael; Brito, João; Figueiredo, Pedro; Lopes, Rui J; Araújo, Duarte",,488,6

It would also create infrastructure that could rapidly identify potential threats or harms that could occur as a consequence of changes in the AI ecosystem, such as the emergence of strategically transformative capabilities, or the deployment of harmful systems. We begin by outlining the problem which motivates this proposal: in brief, traditional governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the speed of progress in AI. We then present our proposal for addressing this problem: governments must invest in measurement and monitoring infrastructure. We discuss this proposal in detail, outlining what specific things governments could focus on measuring and monitoring, and the kinds of benefits this would generate for policymaking.

Almost all of these vaccines have been designed to induce antibodies targeting spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in expectation of neutralizing activities. However, non-neutralizing antibodies are at risk of causing antibody-dependent enhancement. Further, the longevity of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies is very short. Therefore, in addition to antibody-induced vaccines, novel vaccines on the basis of SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) should be considered in the vaccine development. Here, we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2. Eighty-two peptides were firstly predicted as epitope candidates on bioinformatics. Fifty-four in 82 peptides showed high or medium binding affinities to HLA-A*02:01. HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice were then immunized with each of the 54 peptides encapsulated into liposomes. The intracellular cytokine staining assay revealed that 18 out of 54 peptides were CTL epitopes because of the induction of IFN-Î³-producing CD8+ T cells. In the 18 peptides, 10 peptides were chosen for the following analyses because of their high responses. To identify dominant CTL epitopes, mice were immunized with liposomes containing the mixture of the 10 peptides. Some peptides were shown to be statistically predominant over the other peptides. Surprisingly, all mice immunized with the liposomal 10 peptide mixture did not show the same reaction pattern to the 10 peptides. There were three response patterns, suggesting the existence of an immunodominance hierarchy following peptide vaccination, which may provide us more variations in the epitope selection for designing CTL-based COVID-19 vaccines.IMPORTANCE For the development of vaccines based on SARS-CoV-2-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), we attempted to identify HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL epitopes derived from the non-structural polyprotein 1a of SARS-CoV-2.

TBT has been also reported to enhance anxiety in several fish species, whereas the mechanism underlying remains largely unknown. To investigate the disruption of TBT on fish anxiety and the mechanisms possibly involved, adult male zebrafish (Danio rerio) were treated with TBT (100 and 500 ng/L) for 28 days and anxiety behavior was further investigated using a novel tank dive test. Result showed that TBT treatment significantly enhanced the total time of the fish spent in the lower half, delayed the onset time to the higher half of the tank and increased the total duration of freezing of the fish, indicating an enhanced anxiety in TBT-treated fish. Accordingly, TBT sharply elevated the cortisol levels in plasma in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated cortisol level might be involved in the enhanced anxiety. Although the expression of crha was significantly increased and crhbp was significantly decreased in the brain of TBT-treated fish which is consistent to the elevated cortisol level, the expressions of actha and acthb were sharply down-regulated. In contrast, the expressions of genes responsible for the synthesis and action of serotonin (5-HT) (pet1, thp2 and htr1aa), dopamine (DA) (th1, slc6a3, drd2a and drd2b) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (gad2 and gabrg2) were all significantly inhibited. The down-regulation of these pivotal genes acting in 5-HT, DA and GABA neurotransmitter systems in response to TBT corresponded well with the TBT-enhanced anxiety in fish. It was thus strongly suggested that these neurotransmitters might be also involved in TBT-enhanced anxiety in adult male zebrafish. The present study extended our understanding of the neurotoxicity of TBT on the anxiety control and behavioral modulation in fish.","Tu, Xin; Li, Ying-Wen; Chen, Qi-Liang; Shen, Yan-Jun; Liu, Zhi-Hao",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,488,6

Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated.

These disparities persist despite controlling for variables such as socioeconomic status, education levels, and geographical location. Pregnancy-related deaths in Black women are largely cardiovascular in etiology, and while these complications also occur in women of other ethnic backgrounds, they often are more severe and more deadly in Black women. This population often lacks adequate prenatal care likely because they face personal and structural barriers. Reversal of barriers during the prenatal period, the implementation of medical protocols during delivery, and the assurance of close follow-up during the postpartum year are vital in improving outcomes. This article will detail seven specific concerns within perinatal care and pregnancy-related death, and offer potential solutions to addressing them. Pregnancy-related death in Black women is not as an isolated event, but rather is one adverse outcome that exists on a broad spectrum of adverse outcomes. Now is the time to reckon with the reality that our nation's Black women are dying at a disproportionate rate compared to women of other ethnicities due to pregnancy-related complications and suffering lifelong consequences even if they escape this fatal outcome. This is a call to action to understand this deeply devastating, multi-factorial issue so we may strive to eliminate this highly preventable and tragic event altogether.","Crandall, Katherine",Womens Health (Lond),488,20

Because of inherent differences between internal infrastructures, the systems deployed in developed countries may not be amenable to developing ones. Besides, the traffic systems of developing countries are not well-studied in the literature to the best of our knowledge. For example, it is yet to explore how a developed country's lane-based traffic flow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally experiences non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed traffic simulator 'RoadBird', we investigate outcomes of both lane-based and non-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing and developed countries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted from the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh) considering different scenarios such as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or heterogeneous traffic, with or without pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate different car-following and lane-changing models to mimic traffic behaviors and investigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains an open research question, our experimental evidences indicate: (i) lane-based approaches will not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted non-lane-based scenarios; and (ii) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system performance in lane-based scenarios while having heavy mixed traffic. Nonetheless, we reveal several new insights for on-road experiences both in developing and developed countries.","Mushfiq, Md.

The spike protein expressed on the surface of this virus is highly glycosylated and plays an essential role during the process of infection. We conducted a comprehensive mass spectrometric analysis of the N-glycosylation profiles of the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins using signature ions-triggered electron-transfer/higher-energy collision dissociation (EThcD) mass spectrometry. The patterns of N-glycosylation within the recombinant ectodomain and S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were characterized using this approach. Significant variations were observed in the distribution of glycan types as well as the specific individual glycans on the modification sites of the ectodomain and subunit proteins. The relative abundance of sialylated glycans in the S1 subunit compared to the full-length protein could indicate differences in the global structure and function of these two species. In addition, we compared N-glycan profiles of the recombinant spike proteins produced from different expression systems, including human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells and Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9) insect cells. These results provide useful information for the study of the interactions of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins and for the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics.","Wang, Dongxia; Baudys, Jakub; Bundy, Jonathan L; Solano, Maria; Keppel, Theodore; Barr, John R",Anal Chem,488,1

This impact has been drastic on the supplier side and, as a consequence of disruptions, strong reductions of production have been estimated. Such a circumstance forces companies to propose innovative best practices of supply chain risk management aimed at facing vulnerability generated by COVID-19 and pursuing industrial improvements in manufacturing and production environments. As a part of supply chain strategy, supplier selection criteria should be revised to include pandemic-related risks. This article aims to propose an answer to such a problem. In detail, a comprehensive tool designed as a hybrid combination of multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods is suggested to manage important stages connected to the production development cycle and to provide companies with a structured way to rank risks and easily select their suppliers. The main criteria of analysis will be first identified from the existent literature. Risks related to COVID-19 will be then analysed in order to elaborate a comprehensive list of potential risks in the field of interest. The Best Worst Method (BWM) will be first used to calculate criteria weights. The Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (FTOPSIS) will be then applied to rank and prioritize risks affecting suppliers. The effectiveness of the approach will be tested through a case study in the sector of automotive industry. The applicability of the designed MCDM framework can be extended also to other industrial sectors of interest. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

The consequences of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in infants remain unknown. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 have adverse brain development. METHODS: This multicenter observational study was conducted at two designated maternal and children's hospitals in Hubei Province, mainland China from February 1, 2020 to May 15, 2020. Neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 were enrolled. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, and volumes of grey and white matters, and physical growth parameters were observed at 44 weeks corrected gestational age. RESULTS: Of 72 neonates born to mothers with COVID-19, 8 (11%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, 8 (11%) were critically ill, and no deaths were reported. Among the eight neonates that underwent brain MRI at corrected gestational age of 44 weeks, five neonates were diagnosed with COVID-19. Among these five neonates, three presented abnormal MRI findings including abnormal signal in white matter and delayed myelination in newborn 2, delayed myelination and brain dysplasia in newborn 3, and abnormal signal in the bilateral periventricular in newborn 5. The other three neonates without COVID-19 presented no significantly changes of brain MRI findings and the volumes of grey matter and white matter compared to those of healthy newborns at the equivalent age (P > 0.05). Physical growth parameters for weight, length, and head circumference at gestational age of 44 weeks were all above the 3rd percentile for all neonates. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the neonates born to mothers with COVID-19 had abnormal brain MRI findings but these neonates did not appear to have poor physical growth. These findings may provide the information on the follow-up schedule on the neonates exposed to SARS-CoV-2, but further study is required to evaluate the association between the abnormal MRI findings and the exposure to SARS-CoV-2.","Zeng, Ling-Kong; Zhu, Hua-Ping; Xiao, Tian-Tian; Peng, Si-Cong; Yuan, Wen-Hao; Shao, Jian-Bo; Wang, Lai-Shuan; Xiao, Fei-Fan; Xia, Shi-Wen; Lee, Shoo K; Yan, Kai; Zhou, Wen-Hao",World j. pediatr,488,24

They will use these skills for clinical decisions, translate research findings to clinical practice, and educate their patients. Research also plays an essential role in the selection process for many residency programs, and it has only become more critical over time. Therefore, research activities are a central component of medical schools' curriculum throughout the 4 years. One of the research opportunities offered to medical students is their participation in a research summer internship. Nevertheless, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, summer 2020 was impacted by the rapid shut down of academic and research activities to minimize infection. In this article, the authors describe the methodology changes to maintain the summer research internship offering amongst the coronavirus pandemic compared to the previous 6 years (2014-2019). Students answered a survey to assess their insight regarding general aspects of the summer research internship, structure, mentorship, faculty, and research skills development. Overall, students had a positive perception of all the survey areas, especially in mentor performance and research skills development.

In this systematic literature review, we analyzed different perspectives concerning this situation, aiming to provide recommendations that could guide surgeons and entities toward screening, elective and emergency surgeries, decision making, and operating room management. A computerized search in PubMed, Scopus, and Scientific Electronic Library Online (SciELO) for relevant literature up to April 4, 2020, was performed. Articles were included if they were related to surgery dynamics in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 281 articles found in our initial search and 15 articles from alternative sources, 39 were included in our review after a systematic evaluation. Concerning preoperative testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, 29 (74.4%) articles recommended some kind of screening. Another major suggestion was postponing all (or at least selected) elective operations (29 articles, 74.4%). Several additional recommendations with respect to surgical practice or surgical staff were also assessed and discussed, such as performing laparoscopic surgeries and avoiding the use of electrocauterization. On the basis of the current literature, we concluded that any surgery that can be delayed should be postponed. COVID-19 screening is strongly recommended for all surgical cases. Moreover, surgical staff should be reduced to the essential members and provided with institutional psychological support.","Hojaij, Flávio Carneiro; Chinelatto, Lucas Albuquerque; Boog, Gustavo Henrique Pereira; Kasmirski, Júlia Adriana; Lopes, João Vitor Ziroldo; Sacramento, Fernando Mauad",Clinics (Sao Paulo),488,28

Prognostic tools may be useful in crisis conditions as risk stratification can help determine resource allocation. One published tool, the Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage Severity Score, seems particularly promising because of its predictive ability and ease of application at the bedside. We sought to understand the performance of a modified version of this score (mPRIEST) in our institution for identifying patients with a greater than minimal risk for adverse outcome (death or organ support) at 30 days after index visit. METHODS: Consecutive visits at two northern Manhattan EDs with a new diagnosis of symptomatic COVID-19 were identified between November and December of 2020. Demographic variables and clinical characteristics were obtained from chart review. Outcomes were obtained from chart review and follow-up phone call. RESULTS: Outcomes were available on 306 patients. The incidence of death or mechanical ventilation at 30 days for patients in patients with mPRIEST above the threshold value was 43/181 (23.8%), and for patients below 1/125 (0.8%). The sensitivity of the score for adverse outcome was 97.7% (95% CI: 93.3% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: This data suggests the mPRIEST score, which can be calculated from clinical variables alone, has potential for use in EDs to identify patients at very low risk for adverse outcomes within 30 days of COVID diagnosis. This should be confirmed in larger formal validation studies in diverse settings.","Suh, Edward H; Lang, Kendrick J; Zerihun, Lillian M",Am J Emerg Med,488,20

METHODS: This article includes the analysis and evaluation of studies and recommendations from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) that have examined the psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics on people and their impact on the further course. RESULTS: Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics. Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread. Hereby, strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, that include the suppression of fear, can trigger a vicious circle in which fear and suppression mutually reinforce each other. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge to governments, health systems and people, with an uncertain outcome, which is associated with a significant burden of mental health in the population.

In this study, we determined whether symptomatic respiratory viral infections after lung transplantation induce circulating exosomes that contain lung-associated self-antigens and assessed whether these exosomes activate immune responses to self-antigens. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from lung transplant recipients with symptomatic lower- and upper-tract respiratory viral infections and from non-symptomatic stable recipients. Exosomes were isolated via ultracentrifugation; purity was determined using sucrose cushion; and presence of lung self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens for rhinovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were determined using immunoblot. Mice were immunized with circulating exosomes from each group and resulting differential immune responses and lung histology were analyzed. RESULTS: Exosomes containing self-antigens, 20S proteasome, and viral antigens were detected at significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) in serum of recipients with symptomatic respiratory viral infections (nâ¯=â¯35) as compared with stable controls (nâ¯=â¯32). Mice immunized with exosomes from recipients with respiratory viral infections developed immune responses to self-antigens, fibrosis, small airway occlusion, and significant cellular infiltration; mice immunized with exosomes from controls did not (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomes isolated from lung transplant recipients diagnosed with respiratory viral infections contained lung self-antigens, viral antigens, and 20S proteasome and elicited immune responses to lung self-antigens that resulted in development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction in immunized mice.","Gunasekaran, Muthukumar; Bansal, Sandhya; Ravichandran, Ranjithkumar; Sharma, Monal; Perincheri, Sudhir; Rodriguez, Francisco; Hachem, Ramsey; Fisher, Cynthia E; Limaye, Ajit P; Omar, Ashraf; Smith, Michael A; Bremner, Ross M; Mohanakumar, Thalachallour",J Heart Lung Transplant,488,33

Yet, little is known about the physiological costs of cooperation, which may be detrimental to direct fitness. Oxidative stress, the imbalance between reactive oxygen species (by-products of energy production) and antioxidant protection, may represent such a cost when cooperative behaviours are energetically demanding. Oxidative stress can lead to the accumulation of cellular damage, compromising survival and reproduction, thus mediating the trade-off between these competing life-history traits. Here, we experimentally increased energetically demanding cooperative contributions in captive Damaraland mole-rats (Fukomys damarensis). We quantified oxidative stress-related effects of increased cooperation on somatic and germline tissues, and the trade-off between them. Increased cooperative contributions induced oxidative stress in females and males, without increasing somatic damage. Males accumulated oxidative damage in their germline despite an increase in antioxidant defences. Finally, oxidative damage accumulation became biased towards the germline, while antioxidant protection remained biased towards the soma, suggesting that males favour the maintenance of somatic tissues (i.e. survival over reproduction). Our results show that heightened cooperative contributions can ultimately affect direct fitness through oxidative stress costs, which may represent a key selective pressure for the evolution of cooperation.","Mendonça, Rute; Vullioud, Philippe; Katlein, Nathan; Vallat, Armelle; Glauser, Gaétan; Bennett, Nigel C; Helfenstein, Fabrice",Proc Biol Sci,488,7

The tracing of confirmed cases and the prediction of the local dynamics of contagion through early indicators are crucial measures to a successful fight against emerging infectious diseases (EID). The proposed framework is model-free and applies Early Warning Detection Systems (EWDS) techniques to detect changes in the territorial spread of infections in the very early stages of onset. This study uses publicly available raw data on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 mainly sourced from the database of the Italian Civil Protection Department. Two distinct EWDS approaches, the Hub-Jones (H&J) and Strozzi-Zaldivar (S&Z), are adapted and applied to the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. They promptly generate warning signals and detect the onset of an epidemic at early surveillance stages even if working on the limited daily available, open-source data. Additionally, EWDS S&Z criterion is theoretically validated on the basis of the epidemiological SIR. Discussed EWDS successfully analyze self-accelerating systems, like the SARS-CoV-2 scenario, to precociously identify an epidemic spread through the calculation of onset parameters. This approach can also facilitate early clustering detection, further supporting common fight strategies against the spread of EIDs. Overall, we are presenting an effective tool based on solid scientific and methodological foundations to be used to complement medical actions to contrast the spread of infections such as COVID-19.","Vianello, Chiara; Strozzi, Fernanda; Mocellin, Paolo; Cimetta, Elisa; Fabiano, Bruno; Manenti, Flavio; Pozzi, Rossella; Maschio, Giuseppe",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,488,16

METHODS: We investigated the spatial and temporal patterns of annual dengue incidence in Nepal from 2010 to 2019, and the impacts of seasonal meteorological conditions (mean maximum, minimum temperature and precipitation) and elevation on those patterns. RESULTS: More than 25 000 laboratory-confirmed dengue cases were reported from 2010 to 2019. Epidemiological trends suggest that dengue epidemics are cyclical with major outbreaks occurring at 2- to 3-y intervals. A significant negative relationship between dengue incidence and increasing elevation (metres above sea level) driven by temperature was observed (p<0.05) with dengue risk being greatest below 500 m. Risk was moderate between 500 and 1500 m and decreased substantially above 1500 m. Over the last decade, increased nightly temperatures during the monsoon months correlated with increased transmission (p<0.05). No other significant relationship was observed between annual dengue cases or incidence and climatological factors. CONCLUSIONS: The spatial analysis and interpretation of dengue incidence over the last decade in Nepal confirms that dengue is now a well-established public health threat of increasing importance, particularly in low elevation zones and urbanised areas with a tropical or subtropical climate. Seasonal variations in temperature during the monsoon months are associated with increased transmission.","Gyawali, Narayan; Johnson, Brian J; Dixit, Sameer M; Devine, Gregor J",Trans. R. Soc. Trop.

We consider several different models of epidemic spread over networks, including SIS/SIR/SEIR models as well as a new model of COVID-19 transmissions with symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. We provide two efficient algorithms which can efficiently compute the optimal lockdown, with one of our algorithms having a running time which explicitly scales only linearly in the number of edges in the network and is applicable to the vast majority of epidemic models we have tested. Our second algorithm has an explicit scaling which is cubic in the number of nodes in the network, but is applicable without any assumptions. We further demonstrate a number of previously-unknown counter-intuitive phenomena by numerically computing the optimal lockdown on a number of test cases. For example, we show that in a variety of random graph models, node centrality and population have little effect on the value of a lockdown at a node unless they take on extreme values. Most surprisingly, we use publicly available data on inter-county travel frequencies to analyze a model of COVID-19 spread in the 62 counties of New York State; we compute that an optimal stabilizing shutdown based on the state of the epidemic in April 2020 would have reduced activity more stringently outside of New York City compared to within it, even though the epidemic was much more prevalent in New York City at that point.","Ma, Qianqian; Liu, Yang-Yu; Olshevsky, Alex",,488,2

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, belongs to the genus of betacoronaviruses which also includes SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV; causative agents for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012, respectively. Studies demonstrating the neural invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo are still scarce, although such characteristics of certain other betacoronaviruses are well demonstrated in the literature. Based on the recent evidence for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptors in specific components of the human nervous and vascular tissue, a neural (olfactory and/or vagal), and a hematogenous-crossing the blood-brain barrier, routes have been proposed. The neurological symptoms in COVID-19 may also arise as a consequence of the ""cytokine storm"" (characteristically present in severe disease) induced neuroinflammation, or co-morbidities. There is also a possibility that, there may be multiple routes of SARS-CoV-2 entry into the brain, or multiple mechanisms can be involved in the pathogenesis of the neurological symptoms. In this review article, we have discussed the possible routes of SARS-CoV-2 brain entry based on the emerging evidence for this virus, and that available for other betacoronaviruses in literature.","Kumar, Ashutosh; Pareek, Vikas; Prasoon, Pranav; Faiq, Muneeb A; Kumar, Pavan; Kumari, Chiman; Narayan, Ravi K",J Neurosci Res,488,16

Herein, we describe a multiplexed bioluminescent repair reporter (BLRR) for non-invasive monitoring of DSB repair pathways in living cells and animals. The BLRR approach employs secreted Gaussia and Vargula luciferases to simultaneously detect homology-directed repair (HDR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), respectively. BLRR data are consistent with next-generation sequencing results for reporting HDR (R2 = 0.9722) and NHEJ (R2 = 0.919) events. Moreover, BLRR analysis allows longitudinal tracking of HDR and NHEJ activities in cells, and enables detection of DSB repairs in xenografted tumours in vivo. Using the BLRR system, we observed a significant difference in the efficiency of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing with guide RNAs only 1-10 bp apart. Moreover, BLRR analysis detected altered dynamics for DSB repair induced by small-molecule modulators. Finally, we discovered HDR-suppressing functions of anticancer cardiac glycosides in human glioblastomas and glioma cancer stem-like cells via inhibition of DNA repair protein RAD51 homolog 1 (RAD51). The BLRR method provides a highly sensitive platform to simultaneously and longitudinally track HDR and NHEJ dynamics that is sufficiently versatile for elucidating the physiology and therapeutic development of DSB repair.","Chien, Jasper Che-Yung; Tabet, Elie; Pinkham, Kelsey; da Hora, Cintia Carla; Chang, Jason Cheng-Yu; Lin, Steven; Badr, Christian E; Lai, Charles Pin-Kuang",Nucleic acids res,488,1

These patients, therefore, require specific advice regarding isolation and changes to their usual treatment schedules. Their disease can also be associated with significant burden, and they necessitate life-long and regular access to therapy, and regular follow-up consultations and hospital visits. The current COVID-19 pandemic is therefore presenting many challenges for these patients, their families, and health-care professionals. AREAS COVERED: This review provides an overview of the reported COVID-19 cases in the literature in patients with certain benign hematological disorders including thalassemia, sickle cell disease, hemophilia, immune thrombocytopenia, venous thromboembolism, and aplastic anemia. The review also outlines some recommendations on how to manage these patients if they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. To review the literature on benign hematological disorders and COVID-19, a bibliographic search was performed using PubMed for articles published between January 2020 and June 2020.

As a large London transplant center serving a diverse patient population, we report the outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort of 2848 kidney and/or pancreas transplant patients. METHODS: Data were obtained retrospectively for all transplant patients who attended hospital during the peak of the pandemic and had a positive nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 test. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty percent were treated as outpatients, 59% were admitted to the general ward, and 21% required intensive care. Treatment consisted of reduced immunosuppression, antibiotics for pneumonia or sepsis, and other supportive treatments. Within our cohort, 12 patients died (18%), with an overall mortality of 0.4%. Predictive risk factors for COVID-19 severity were explored. CONCLUSIONS: Severe disease was associated with lower hemoglobin prior to COVID-19 diagnosis and lower lymphocyte count at the time of diagnosis but not age, sex, ethnicity, or preexisting comorbidities. Lower glomerular filtration rate and higher C-reactive protein were associated with more severe disease.

The mean value of the FSFI satisfaction score differs from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p=0.012). The mean satisfaction score before COVID-19 was 3.47, and after COVID-19 was 2.93. The score of the subgroups of FSFI did not differ from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p>0.050). The median value of SF-36 pain differs from COVID-19 before and after diagnosis (p=0.008). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the frequency of sexual intercourse, sexual satisfaction in women decreased after COVID-19 disease, and the quality of life scores did not change in a statistically significant way.","Kaya, Yeliz; Kaya, Coskun; Tahta, Tugba; Kartal, Tugba; Tokgöz, V Yavuz",Int J Clin Pract,488,1

COVID-19 is particularly notorious as the onset of symptoms in infected patients are usually delayed and there exists a large number of asymptomatic carriers. In order to prevent overwhelming of medical facilities and large fatality rate, early stage testing and diagnosis are key requirements. In this article, we discuss the methodologies from the group testing literature and its relevance to COVID-19 diagnosis. Specifically, we investigate the efficiency of group testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for COVID-19. Group testing is a method in which multiple samples are pooled together in groups and fewer tests are performed on these groups to discern all the infected samples. We study the effect of dilution due to pooling in group testing and show that group tests can perform well even in the presence of dilution effects. We present multiple group testing algorithms that could reduce the number of tests performed for COVID-19 diagnosis. We analyze the efficiency of these tests and provide insights on their practical relevance. With the use of algorithms described here, test plans can be developed that can enable testing centers to increase the number of diagnosis performed without increasing the number of PCR tests. The codes for generating test plans are available online at [1].","Theagarajan, Lakshmi N.",,488,21

Since proximity data can be collected by personal mobile devices, the natural proposal has been to use this for contact tracing as this provides a major gain over a manual implementation. In this work, we study the characteristics of automated contact tracing and its effectiveness for mapping the spread of a pandemic due to the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We highlight the infrastructure and social structures required for automated contact tracing to work for the current pandemic. We display the vulnerabilities of the strategy to inadequately sample the population, which results in the inability to sufficiently determine significant contact with infected individuals. Of crucial importance will be the participation of a significant fraction of the population for which we derive a minimum threshold. We conclude that a strong reliance on contact tracing to contain the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can lead to the potential danger of allowing the pandemic to spread unchecked. A carefully thought out strategy for controlling the spread of the pandemic along with automated contact tracing can lead to an optimal solution.","Kim, Hyunju; Paul, Ayan",,488,24

Annually it can prevent nearly 2 to 3 million deaths. Understanding the determinants of effective immunization coverage is a critical undertaking. Accordingly, we set out to check the best available evidence of outstanding predictors of immunization coverage among children aged 12-23 months in Ethiopia. METHOD: Electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, HINARI, and SCOPUS, Web of Science, African Journals Online, Ethiopian Medical Journals were searched. The search process, study selection, critical appraisal, and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers using Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-analysis for Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI). The difference between reviewers was resolved with a third person. The risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle Ottawa Tool for observational studies. Data were extracted using the Microsoft Excel checklist and exported to STATA 13. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2, Funnel plot and Egger's test was used to check for publication bias. RESULTS: We identified 26 studies with 15,042 children with mothers/caretakers to assess factors associated with immunization coverage and significant factors were: maternal formal education, (OR = 2.45; 95% CI: 1.62-3.72), paternal formal education, (OR = 1.01; 95% CI: 0.27-3.77), residence, (OR = 2.11; 95% CI: 1.00-4.45), birth at health facility (OR = 1.86; 95% CI: 0.99-3.49), family size less than four, (OR = 1.81; 95% CI: 1.16-2.84), knowledge on age of immunization to be completed (OR = 6.18;95% CI: 3.07-12.43), knowledge on immunization schedule (OR = 2.49; 95% CI: 1.35-4.59), time to travel to health faculties, (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 0.62-4.89), antennal care, (OR = 3.11; 95% CI: 1.64-5.88), and tetanus toxoid vaccination, (OR = 4.82; 95% CI: 2.99-7.75). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed that literacy, residence, awareness, family size, maternal health services use, and proximity of the health facilities were factors associated with full immunization. This implies that there is a need for primary health service expansion and health education to ""hard to reach areas"" to improve immunization coverage for children aged 12-23 months.","Nour, Tahir Yousuf; Farah, Alinoor Mohamed; Ali, Omer Moelin; Osman, Mohamed Omar; Aden, Mowlid Akil; Abate, Kalkidan Hassen",BMC Public Health,488,1

Although most cases are mild, older patients and those with co-morbidities are at increased risk of developing a cytokine storm, characterized by a systemic inflammatory response leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure. The present paper focuses on the small molecule MP1032, describes its mode of action, and gives rationale why it is a promising option for the prevention/treatment of the SARS-CoV-2-induced cytokine storm. MP1032 is a phase-pure anhydrous polymorph of 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione sodium salt that exhibits good stability and bioavailability. The physiological action of MP1032 is based on a multi-target mechanism including localized, self-limiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities that were demonstrated in a model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced joint inflammation. Furthermore, its immune-regulatory and PARP-1-modulating properties, coupled with antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2, have been demonstrated in various cell models. Preclinical efficacy was elucidated in LPS-induced endotoxemia, a model with heightened innate immune responses that shares many similarities to COVID-19. So far, during oral clinical development with three-month daily administrations, no serious adverse drug reactions occurred, highlighting the outstanding safety profile of MP1032.","Schumann, Sara; Kaiser, Astrid; Nicoletti, Ferdinando; Mangano, Katia; Fagone, Paolo; van Wijk, Eduard; Yan, Yu; Schulz, Petra; Ludescher, Beate; Niedermaier, Michael; von Wegerer, Joerg; Rauch, Pia; Setz, Christian; Schubert, Ulrich; Brysch, Wolfgang",Int. j. mol. sci.

Some of this variability may be explained by medical comorbidities such as obesity and depression, both of which are strongly correlated with dietary practices such as levels of sugar and seafood consumption. Methods: COVID-19 mortality indices for 156 countries were obtained from the Johns Hopkins University’s data aggregator. Correlations between these variables and (a) per capita consumption of sugar and seafood, and (b) country-wise prevalence of depression and obesity were examined. Results: Sugar consumption (r = 0.51, p &lt;0.001) and prevalence of obesity (r = 0.66, p &lt;0.001) and depression (r = 0.56, p &lt;0.001) were positively correlated with crude mortality rates, while seafood consumption was negatively correlated with the infection fatality rate (r = −0.28, p = 0.015). These effects were significant even after correcting for potential confounders. The associations with depression and obesity remained significant upon multivariate regression. Conclusions: Both obesity and depression, which are associated with inflammatory dysregulation, may be related to cross-national variations in COVID-19 mortality, while seafood consumption may be protective. These findings have implications in terms of protecting vulnerable individuals during the current pandemic.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip",Diseases,488,3

However, the pandemic and the prevention strategies had a huge impact on the medical care procedures for patients with breast cancer, leading to the delay or interruption of anticancer therapies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To better serve patients with breast cancer under the premise of epidemic control, many strategies have been proposed and optimized in our center. One of the most important parts of these strategies is the promotion of telemedicine, including online consultation, online prescription, and drug mailing services. RESULTS: In keeping with the city and hospital policies, we have also introduced stricter ward management policies and more precise care. CONCLUSION: Here, we collected the diagnosis and treatment process of patients with breast cancer in our center during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, which was found to be correlated to a reduction in chemotherapy-related myelosuppression and hepatic dysfunction, hoping to provide a reference for other cancer centers that may suffer from the similar situation.","Zhou, Jun; Liu, Yuyin; Xu, Ming; Mei, Li; Ruan, Shengnan; Zhang, Ning; Yi, Pengfei; Chen, Qianzhi; Tan, Jie",Clin. breast cancer,488,25

Our knowledge concerning every aspect of COVID-19 is evolving rapidly, given the increasing data from all over the world. In this narrative review, the Turkish Thoracic Society Early Career Taskforce members aimed to provide a summary on recent literature regarding epidemiology, clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of COVID-19. Studies revealed that the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus showed significant identity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is an important target of the SARS-CoV-2 while entering an organism. Smokers were more likely to develop the disease and have a higher risk for ICU admission. The mean incubation period was 6.4 days, whereas asymptomatic transmission was reported up to 25 days after infection. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and cardiovascular diseases and hypertension were reported to be the most common comorbidities among patients. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several patients showed typical symptoms and radiological changes with negative RT-PCR but positive IgG and IgM antibodies. Although radiological findings may vary, bilateral, peripherally distributed, ground-glass opacities were typical of COVID-19. Poor prognosis was associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and high D-dimer level. Chloroquine was found to be effective in reducing viral replication in vitro. Likewise, protease inhibitors, including lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, and nucleoside analogue remdesivir were proposed to be the potential drug candidates in COVID-19 management.

Five one-step RT-qPCR assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope E and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation.SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic and undiagnosed cases. For this latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0-6.5% was figured. On the other hand, a proportion of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population was determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs.At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of the virus among the population, including not only symptomatic patients, but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population.

In this review, we summarize those studies to provide guidance for both the public to select the best materials for face masks and for future researchers to rigorously evaluate and report on mask material testing. Of the tested fabric materials and material combinations with adequate breathability, most single and multilayer combinations had a filtration efficiency of <30%. Most studies evaluating commonly available mask materials did not follow standard methods that would facilitate comparison across studies, and materials were often described with too few details to allow consumers to purchase equivalent materials to make their own masks. To improve the usability of future study results, researchers should use standard methods and report material characteristics in detail.","Kwong, Laura H; Wilson, Rob; Kumar, Shailabh; Crider, Yoshika Susan; Reyes Sanchez, Yasmin; Rempel, David; Pillarisetti, Ajay",ACS Nano,488,16

The molecular mechanisms driving failure of the alveolar barrier upon severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remain incompletely understood. The Na,K-ATPase is an adhesion molecule and a plasma membrane transporter that is critically required for proper alveolar epithelial function by both promoting barrier integrity and resolution of excess alveolar fluid, thus enabling appropriate gas exchange. However, numerous SARS-CoV-2-mediated and COVID-19-related signals directly or indirectly impair the function of the Na,K-ATPase, thereby potentially contributing to disease progression. In this Perspective, we highlight some of the putative mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-driven dysfunction of the Na,K-ATPase, focusing on expression, maturation, and trafficking of the transporter. A therapeutic mean to selectively inhibit the maladaptive signals that impair the Na,K-ATPase upon SARS-CoV-2 infection might be effective in reestablishing the alveolar epithelial barrier and promoting alveolar fluid clearance and thus advantageous in patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS.","Kryvenko, Vitalii; Vadász, István",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,488,11

However, studies on the psychological status of older adults during this public health emergency remained scant. This study aims to investigate the mental health status among the elderly Chinese population during COVID-19 pandemic and determine the influencing factors of psychological symptoms. Methods: From February 19 to March 19, 2020, an online survey was administered to Chinese older adults using a convenience sampling method. Information on demographic data, health status and other epidemic related factors were collected. Specifically, the study defined the psychological status as five primary disorder-depression, neurasthenia, fear, anxiety, and hypochondria-which were assessed by the Psychological Questionnaire for Emergent Event of Public Health (PQEEPH). Standard descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the data. Results: Of 1,501 participants recruited from 31 provinces in China, 1,278 were valid for further analysis. Participants' scores on each sub-scale were described in median and interquartile [M(Q)]: depression [0.00 (0.33)], neurasthenia [0.00 (0.40)], fear [1.00 (0.83)], anxiety [0.00 (0.17)], hypochondria [0.00 (0.50)].

The present study aimed to evaluate reported lifestyle changes in a cohort of adults in Italy, including physical exercise, food choices, and psychological wellbeing, after two months of lockdown. METHODS: A web survey on social media (Facebook and LinkedIn) of 32 multiple-choice questions aiming to evaluate the impact of the national COVID-19 lockdown in a sample of Italian adults. RESULTS: We received 1378 complete responses (women 68.3%, mean age 39.5 ± 12.5 years). The percentage of participants reporting regular exercise decreased during lockdown (52 vs. 56.5%). The vast majority of people continued to consume the three traditional meals per day, but the consumption of meat, fish, and eggs significantly decreased. Women reported more frequent anxiety, sadness, fear, and feelings of insecurity than men. The factors predicting the worst outcome during the lockdown were being a woman, low education and income, gastrointestinal diseases. CONCLUSION: The lockdown has had a limited impact on food choices and physical exercise in Italian adults of our series, since most of them made an effort to improve their lifestyle. However, women with gastrointestinal diseases reported more frequent negative feelings and poor adaptation to the lockdown.","Ruotolo, Monica; Gagliardi, Mario; Ciacci, Carolina; Zingone, Fabiana; de Santis Ciacci, Corina; Santonicola, Antonella; D039,; Arcangelo, Giovanna; Siniscalchi, Monica",Nutrients,488,5

Evidence that this nonlinear model demonstrates critical dynamics is scrutinized within the frame of the physics of critical phenomena. Additionally, the concept of criticality over the infected population fraction in epidemics (or a pandemic) is introduced and its importance is discussed, highlighting the emergence of the critical slowdown phenomenon. A simple method is proposed for estimating how far away a population is from this ""singular"" state, by utilizing the theory of critical phenomena. Finally, a dynamic approach applying the self-organized diffusion model is proposed, resulting in more accurate simulations, which can verify the effectiveness of restrictive measures. All the above are supported by real epidemic data case studies.","Contoyiannis, Y; Stavrinides, S G; Hanias, M P; Kampitakis, M; Papadopoulos, P; Picos, R; Potirakis, S M; Kosmidis, E K",Chaos,488,20

The rats were subjected to 30 minutes of hepatic pedicule occlusion followed by 2h of reperfusion to induce I/R damage. Nesfatin1 (10 µg/ kg) was administered, 30 min prior to ischemia and immediately before the reperfusion period. RESULTS: The findings showed that while the blood levels of AST, ALT and LDH were markedly elevated in the I/R group, they returned to normal levels upon treatment in the Nesfatin group. While IL-1 &#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IFN- Î³ levels in blood and tissue were lower after therapy in the Nesfatin group compared to the I/R group, statistically significant decreases were only noted in IL-1ß, IL-6, TNF-&#945; and IFN- Î³ levels. TAS levels increased in the treatment group, while upon nesfatin treatment statistically significant decreases were noted in TOS and OSI levels.

The study aims at determining the effect of the current coronavirus epidemic in the form of stress perceived among the medical workers in Pakistan and to discover the moderating role played by a healthy climate in offsetting it. The data was collected from 255 medical workers through a self-administered online questionnaire. Multiple Hierarchical Regression was used as a tool to test the hypotheses of the study. The results obtained indicate a correlation between the pandemic and the stress caused by it among the health workers, whereas, the role of a wholesome climate in the reduction of stress among them was found lacking. Sub-hypotheses indicate that the healthy environment provided by supervisors is effective in reducing the impact of workers' handling of the Covid-19 epidemic and perceived stress, while the healthy environment provided by hospitals in general or by workgroups fails to cause such positive change. This revelation necessitates the adoption of compulsory precautionary measures on the part of relevant authorities, because increase in stress caused by the pandemic can prove more lethal than the pandemic itself. The threat of the coronavirus pandemic has emerged as a massive socio-economic challenge for the global community, especially for the developing countries like Pakistan which faces serious socio-economic challenges in the current scenario.

Objectives: To determine the clinical and microbiological profile of patients admitted with CAP in Ilorin, Nigeria. Methods: One hundred and two consenting consecutively selected patients with clinical and radiologic confirmation of CAP were recruited in 12 months. The socio-demographic, physical examination and laboratory/radiologic parameters were documented in a questionnaire. Microbiological evaluation of their sputum was done and blood samples were taken for complete blood count, culture, serum urea and serological evaluation for atypical bacteria and some viral pathogens. Results: CAP constituted 5.9% of the total medical admissions during the one-year study period. The mean age of the patients was 49 ± 22 years with the largest frequency in those aged 65 years and above. The commonest symptoms were shortness of breath (96.1%) and cough (94.1%), with a median duration of 3 days from symptom onset to admission. Systemic hypertension was the commonest comorbid illness (25/102; 24.5%). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant pathogen isolated (20/102; 28.1%). The susceptible antibiotics were Imipenem, Ceftazidime and Ceftriaxone. Intra-hospital mortality was 17.6%.

Systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been previously demonstrated to improve PaO2/FiO2 (mmHg) when given to critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is unclear to what extent tPA may impact population-based survival during the current US COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A decision analytic Markov state transition model was created to simulate the life critically ill COVID-19 patients as they transitioned to either recovery or death. Two patient groups were simulated (50,000 patients in each group); (1) Patients received tPA immediately upon diagnosis of ARDS and (2) patients received standard therapy for ARDS. Base case critically ill COVID-19 patients were defined as having a refractory PaO2/FiO2 of < 60 mmHg (salvage use criteria). Transition from severe to moderate to mild ARDS, recovery, and death were estimated. Markov model parameters were extracted from existing ARDS/COVID-19 literature. RESULTS: The use of tPA was associated with reduced mortality (47.6% [tTPA] vs. 71.0% [no tPA]) for base case patients. When extrapolated to the projected COVID-19 eligible for salvage use tPA in the USA, peak mortality (deaths/100,000 patients) was reduced for both optimal social distancing (70.5 [tPA] vs. 75.0 [no tPA]) and no social distancing (158.7 [tPA] vs. 168.8 [no tPA]) scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage use of tPA may improve recovery of ARDS patients, thereby reducing COVID-19-related mortality and ensuring sufficient resources to manage this pandemic.","Choudhury, Rashikh; Barrett, Christopher D; Moore, Hunter B; Moore, Ernest E; McIntyre, Robert C; Moore, Peter K; Talmor, Daniel S; Nydam, Trevor L; Yaffe, Michael B",World J Emerg Surg,488,0

This might not be true for bariatric surgery because of reimbursement requirements and changes in coding systems. We assessed the availability and validity of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes among bariatric surgery patients. METHODS: We identified three nested retrospective cohorts of adult bariatric surgery patients who underwent adjusted gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, or sleeve gastrectomy between January 1, 2011 and June 30, 2018 using different components of OptumLabs® Data Warehouse, which contains linked de-identified claims and electronic health records (EHRs). We measured the availability of claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes in the 6-month preoperative and 1-year postoperative periods in the main cohort identified in the claims data. We created two claims-based algorithms to classify the presence of severe obesity (a commonly used cohort selection criterion) and categorize BMI (a commonly used baseline confounder or postoperative outcome). We evaluated their performance by estimating sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and weighted kappa in two sub-cohorts using EHR-based BMI measurements as the reference. RESULTS: Among the 29,357 eligible patients identified using claims only, 28,828 (98.2%) had preoperative weight-related diagnosis codes, either granular indicating BMI ranges or nonspecific denoting obesity status. Among the 27,407 patients with granular preoperative codes, 12,346 (45.0%) had granular codes and 9355 (34.1%) had nonspecific codes in the 1-year postoperative period. Among the 3045 patients with both preoperative claims-based diagnosis codes and EHR-based BMI measurements, the severe obesity classification algorithm had a sensitivity 100%, specificity 71%, positive predictive value 100%, and negative predictive value 78%. The BMI categorization algorithm had good validity categorizing the last available preoperative or postoperative BMI measurements (weighted kappa [95% confidence interval]: preoperative 0.78, [0.76, 0.79]; postoperative 0.84, [0.80, 0.87]). CONCLUSIONS: Claims-based weight-related diagnosis codes had excellent validity before and after bariatric surgical operation but suboptimal availability after operation. Claims databases can be used for bariatric surgery studies of non-weight-related effectiveness and safety outcomes that are well-captured.","Li, Xiaojuan; Lewis, Kristina H; Callaway, Katherine; Wharam, J Frank; Toh, Sengwee",BMC Med Res Methodol,488,22

Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.","Stockton, John; Kyle-Sidell, Cameron",Am. j. emerg. med,488,4

As we have seen a universal rise in manuscript submissions to all journals during the pandemic, we have also seen a decrease in peer reviewers submitting timely reviews. But, now more than ever, we need to have excellent peer reviewers reading the science and raising questions that we truly need to discuss, research, and try to answer. Another worry is the mental exhaustion so many nurse scientists have felt as they have been caring for patients, families, and themselves while continuing to conduct research might lead us to missed opportunities to conduct new and meaningful post-pandemic research.

METHODS: we conducted a descriptive, cross-sectional, unicentric, and analytical study carried out through a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: the study consisted of 57 patients, aged between 48 and 84 years old, 66.7% being male. The average income ranged between one and three (61.4%) minimum wages and below one minimum wage (31.6%). Type II Diabetes Mellitus was predominant (86.0%). Concerning comorbidities, arterial hypertension displayed the highest proportion (62.3%), followed by dyslipidemia (52.8%). Smokers comprised 35.1% of the sample. Infectious diabetic foot (50.9%) and mixed diabetic foot (49.1%) were the most common. Of the 20 patients with previous amputation, 90% had undergone minor amputation, and 10%, major ones. Callosity (92.6%) was the most prevalent deformity. Fifty-four (94.7%) patients underwent surgery, those being debridement (24.1%), minor amputation (37.0%) and major amputation (38.9%). During hospitalization, 78.9% of individuals did not require ICU stay. Hospitalization time varied between three and 59 days, and 78.9% of hospitalized patients did not progress to death, but 43.1% of patients submitted to major amputations died. CONCLUSION: patients with diabetic foot followed-up have a low socioeconomic profile; most of them underwent surgical procedures, whether major or minor, due to the higher prevalence of infectious diabetic foot and/or non-adherence to non-operative treatment.","Reis, JosÉ Maciel Caldas Dos; Wanzeller, Robson Roberto Melo; Meireles, Wilame Melo; Andrade, Mariseth Carvalho DE; Gomes, Victor Hugo Guerreiro AmÉrico; Arrais, JosÉ Aroldo Alves; Ishak, Geraldo",Rev Col Bras Cir,488,25

We aimed to assess the outcomes of NIV application in COVID-19 patients with AHRF. MATERIALS & METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, patients with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and AHRF receiving NIV in general wards were recruited from two university-affiliated hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were recorded at admission. The failure of NIV was defined as intubation or death during the hospital stay. RESULTS: Between April 8 and June 10, 2020, 61 patients were enrolled into the final cohort. NIV was successful in 44 out of 61 patients (72.1%), 17 patients who failed NIV therapy were intubated, and among them 15 died. Overall mortality rate was 24.6%. Patients who failed NIV were older, and had higher respiratory rate, PaCO2, D-dimer levels before NIV and higher minute ventilation and ventilatory ratio on the 1-st day of NIV. No healthcare workers were infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the study period. CONCLUSIONS: NIV is feasible in patients with COVID-19 and AHRF outside the intensive care unit, and it can be considered as a valuable option for the management of AHRF in these patients.","Avdeev, Sergey N; Yaroshetskiy, Andrey I; Tsareva, Natalia A; Merzhoeva, Zamira M; Trushenko, Natalia V; Nekludova, Galina V; Chikina, Svetlana Yu",Am. j. emerg. med,488,16

In this work, we propose a machine learning approach to model the nonlinear hourly wind dynamics in Saudi Arabia with a domain-specific choice of knots to reduce the spatial dimensionality. Our results show that for locations highlighted as wind abundant by a previous work, our approach results in a 11% improvement in the two-hours-ahead forecasted power against operational standards in the wind energy sector, yielding a saving of nearly one million US dollars over a year under current market prices in Saudi Arabia.","Huang, Huang; Castruccio, Stefano; Genton, Marc G.",,488,26

The process can either be automatic, semi-automatic, or manual, the first often not being sufficiently precise or easily reproducible, and the last being excessively time consuming when involving large districts with high-resolution acquisitions. A high-resolution CT of the chest is composed of hundreds of images, and this makes the manual approach excessively time consuming. Furthermore, the parenchymal alterations require an expert evaluation to be discerned from the normal appearance; thus, a semi-automatic approach to the segmentation process is, to the best of our knowledge, the most suitable when segmenting pneumonias, especially when their features are still unknown. For the studies conducted in our institute on the imaging of COVID-19, we adopted 3D Slicer, a freeware software produced by the Harvard University, and combined the threshold with the paint brush instruments to achieve fast and precise segmentation of aerated lung, ground glass opacities, and consolidations.

An active risk management approach can prevent the occurrence of the disease and promote positive organizational changes, subsequently decreasing mortality and hospitalization costs. Using scientific and clinical practice knowledge, a risk evaluation model was developed to identify patients more at risk of developing the disease. For this purpose, a Decision Expert qualitative multi-criteria decision method was used, in which alternatives are evaluated according to predetermined hierarchically arranged criteria. Characteristics of each evaluated alternative are described by the members of an interdisciplinary expert team and are represented by the values of the basic criteria. Values of hierarchically higher aggregated criteria are computed in an upwards fashion according to utility functions, which are defined as simple logical rules. This method is integrated into a software solution, DEXi. The approach is applicable to vastly diverse decision problems and has been successfully used before for health-related decision support. The designed model was tested using actual clinical data. Evaluations of alternatives that most distinctly demonstrated the functionality of the evaluation model were selected and are presented in the results. The evaluation model is intended to assist a holistic evaluation of the risk of developing ventilator-associated pneumonia, by considering patient-related risk factors and the use of preventive measures. The model incorporates nursing-specific data that have hitherto been poorly utilized in preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia and promotes the active engagement of nurses in confronting this interdisciplinary healthcare problem, which has gained more prominence with the onset of COVID-19 disease.","Drnovsek, Rok; Milavec Kapun, Marija; Rajkovic, Uros",Cent Eur J Oper Res,488,16

It is called COVID-19 because it was caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) in 2019. A total of 1.9 M deaths and 87.9 M cases have been reported all over the world where 49M cases have recovered so far. Scientists are working hard to find chemotherapeutics and vaccines for COVID-19. Mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have been observed in a combination of several hazardous stresses, making them more resistant and beneficial. So to break down the viral system, the disease targets are examined. OBJECTIVE: In today's review, a comprehensive study of spike protein explains the main purpose of the novel coronavirus and how to prevent the spread of the disease virus, cross-transmission from infected to a healthy person. METHOD: Covid-19 has already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to global death and wide illness. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. However, the intermediate host of the novel coronavirus is not clear. To explore the mechanisms of disease, one of the viral targets, such as the spike protein that binds to human cells and causes the disease and its genetic structure, is considered with potential inhibitors. RESULTS: It has been shown that the receptor-binding domain (RBD) protein of SARS- CoV-2 spike and the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) host receptor interact and further replication of coronavirus spike protein causes its invasion in the host cell. The human Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, Locus E (LY6E) inhibits the entry of CoV into host cells by interfering with the human gene, spike protein-mediated membrane fusion. Some natural formulations have also been shown to prevent spike protein from binding to the host cell. CONCLUSION: With the development of the LY6E gene activator that can inhibit spike protein-ACE2-mediated membrane fusion, new opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 treatment may emerge. Existing antiviral fusion inhibitors and natural compounds targeting spike resistance can serve as a template for further SARS-CoV-2 drug formulation.","Nandi, Sisir; Roy, Harekrishna; Gummadi, Asha; Saxena, Anil",Current drug targets (Print),488,24

Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) is one recommended method of thermal control. A wearable device, TempWatch, has been developed to monitor for and detect hypothermia and to promote KMC for preterm and LBW infants. PURPOSE: This randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate TempWatch's impact on weight gain, amount of KMC received, and length of hospital stay for LBW infants as compared to standard care. METHODS: Otherwise healthy LBW infants (with birthweights 1500-2300 g) admitted to a KMC ward of a government hospital in New Delhi, India were randomly allocated to a TempWatch group or a control group and wore the device until their time of discharge. 50 infants were enrolled in each group. All participants received standard-of-care temperature monitoring, and those in the control group were monitored using the hand-touch method. Each group also received sixth-hourly temperature monitoring. Infants' daily weight and the number of hypothermia episodes they experienced per day were recorded, and mothers of infants in both groups completed daily KMC diaries. RESULTS: The TempWatch group experienced statistically significant weight gain as compared to the control group (0.06 vs. 0.02 kg, p = .024). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the number of hypothermia events detected, the amount of KMC received. CONCLUSION: TempWatch promotes statistically significant weight gain for LBW infants as compared to standard care.","Azad, Mohammad; Bisht, Surender Singh; Tyagi, Amita; Jaipal, M L",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,488,21

Still, little is known about the psychological experiences of patients who received inpatient isolation treatment in order to improve the well-being of these patients. We randomly recruited 10 COVID-19 patients who received inpatient isolation treatment at a designated hospital in Wuhan from February to March 2020 and were discharged after recovery. The data were collected via a semi-structured interview over WeChat video and analyzed them using Calaizzi's descriptive phenomenological method. COVID-19 patients experienced significant psychological stress during hospitalization that continued after recovery and discharge. This can be categorized into three themes: (1) negative emotions experienced; (2) uncertainty of treatment provided; and (3) worries about readjusting to daily life. The insight into a patient's psychological experiences can support the timely implementation of personalized nursing interventions within hospitals and the community to improve the patient's mental well-being and recovery trajectory.","Pei, Haoyu; Wu, Qiuping; Xie, Yu; Deng, Jing; Jiang, Limei; Gan, Xiaoqin",Clin Nurs Res,488,10

This study aimed to examine factors related to preventive behaviors of emerging adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive online survey design was used. Data were collected using a self-administrated, 28-item questionnaire completed by 239 undergraduate students from a university in Seoul, South Korea. The questionnaire was developed based on previous studies and the guidelines of the World Health Organization about COVID-19 preventive behaviors. The mean age of participants was 21.97 years, and the average score for COVID-19 preventive behaviors was 4.13 (SD: ±0.42) on a 5-point scale. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that subjective norms related to parents (ß = 0.425, p < 0.001), issue involvement related to COVID-19 (ß = 0.160, p = 0.024), and sex (ß = 0.137, p = 0.029) were significant factors related to preventive behaviors of emerging adults after controlling for demographic characteristics. The variables explained 20.1% of the variance in preventive behaviors. The results of this study suggest that better strategies for subjective norms related to parents and issue involvement related to COVID-19 must be considered to improve emerging adults' preventive behaviors.","Park, Sunhee; Kim, Beomsoo; Kim, Kyoung A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),488,5

FGD5 antisense RNA 1 (FGD5-AS1) facilitates the progression of various tumors. However, the expression and function of FGD5-AS1 in ovarian cancer (OC) and its mechanism of action are not yet clear. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to explore the expression levels of FGD5-AS1 and miR-142-5p in OC. The relationship between the expression of FGD5-AS1 and clinicopathological indicators of OC patients was analyzed by &#967;2 test. CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, and Transwell assay were carried out to detect cell proliferation, migration, as well as invasion, respectively. Subcutaneous tumorigenesis experiment and lung metastasis model were used to examine the biological effects of FGD5-AS1 in OC in vivo. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay or RIP experiment was employed to explore the targeting relationship between FGD5-AS1 and miR-142-5p, as well as miR-142-5p and PD-L1 3'UTR. First, we found that FGD5-AS1 was markedly up-regulated in OC. Moreover, its high expression level was associated with positive local lymph node metastasis and higher T stage in OC patients. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that FGD5-AS1 facilitated the proliferation, migration, as well as invasion of OC cells. Mechanistically, it was revealed that FGD5-AS1 targeted miR-142-5p to repress its expression and function. Furthermore, miR-142-5p has a binding site for 3' UTR of PD-L1, and FGD5-AS1 could positively regulate PD-L1 expression via repressing miR-142-5p.

We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-&#945;) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. Hypertension (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.","Azevedo, Rafael Bellotti; Botelho, Bruna Gopp; Hollanda, João Victor Gonçalves de; Ferreira, Leonardo Villa Leão; Junqueira de Andrade, Letícia Zarur; Oei, Stephanie Si Min Lilienwald; Mello, Tomás de Souza; Muxfeldt, Elizabeth Silaid",J. hum. hypertens,488,24

RESULTS: This case highlights the ambiguity in distinguishing between these two entities in a subset of pediatric patients with COVID-19-related disease and the rapid decompensation these patients may experience. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate clinical suspicion is necessary for both acute disease and MIS-C. SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests obtained early in the diagnostic process may help to narrow down the differential but does not distinguish between acute COVID-19 and MIS-C. Better understanding of the hyperinflammatory changes associated with MIS-C and acute COVID-19 in children will help delineate the roles for therapies, particularly if there is a hybrid phenotype occurring in adolescents.","Beaudry, Jeanette T; Dietrick, Barbara; Lammert, Dawn B; Constas, Alexander; McCaw, Julia; Hammond, John; Buendia, Matthew; Stein, Julie E; Pekosz, Andrew; Schuette, Jennifer; Mostafa, Heba H; Hooper, Jody E; Bernier, Meghan; Agwu, Allison; Feldman, Leonard S",Pediatr. infect. dis. j,488,26

Few studies focusing on epidemiology and management of fractures in COVID-19 patients have been published. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the fracture types, presentation, treatment, complications, and early outcomes of fractures occurring amidst COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic review of the all published papers was conducted with a comprehensive search of PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Library database using keywords ‘COVID-19’, ‘Coronavirus’, ‘trauma∗’and ‘fracture’ from January–April 2020. Results: The searches yielded a total of ten studies with 112 Patients who were positive for COVID-19 associated with fractures was performed for six studies, reporting data separately for 44 patients with COVID 19 and an associated fracture. A diagnosis of COVID 19 was made on the basis of positive Computed Tomography scan in 39 patients and 30 patients had a positive Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction test. Overall, there were 29 proximal femoral fractures, 8 spine fractures, 7 fractures of the other bones. The fractures were treated surgically in 30 cases (68.18%) and the remaining 14 cases (31.82%) were managed conservatively. There were 16 patients (36.36%) who died, mostly due to respiratory failure with a median age of 82 years. Conclusion: COVID-19 has led to a significant reduction in a load of fracture patients globally, though the incidence of fragility fractures continues to be unaffected. There is a significantly higher risk of mortality in elderly patients with fractures and hence they should only be operated in a facility with a robust intensive care. Conservative treatment should be adopted as far as possible in non-obligatory fractures and in lesser equipped centers. Surgery in patients with proximal femur fragility fractures when judiciously selected did result in improvement in respiratory status. Reorganizing medical services is vital to deliver effective fracture care and also mitigate disease transmission.","Kumar Jain, Vijay; Lal, Hitesh; Kumar Patralekh, Mohit; Vaishya, Raju",J. Clin.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospective observational study involving epidemiological information from 403 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 between 1 March and 31 May 2020. Data were collected from 70 centres that participate in the Spanish Registry of COVID-19. METHODS: Patients' information was collected from their medical chart. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The rate of perinatal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and development of the infection in neonates within 14 days postpartum. RESULTS: The early cord clamping (ECC) group consisted of 231 infants (57.3%) and the DCC group consisted of 172 infants (42.7%). Five positive newborns (1.7% of total tests performed) were identified with the nasopharyngeal PCR tests performed in the first 12 hours postpartum, two from the ECC group (1.7%) and three from the DCC group (3.6%).

Others with a rather devastating history and high fatality rates such as plague, cholera, or typhus seem less threatening today but have not been eradicated, and with a declining efficacy of current antibiotics they ought to be watched carefully. Another emerging issue in this context is health-care associated infection. About 100,000 hospitalized patients in the USA ( www.cdc.gov ) and 33,000 in Europe ( https://www.ecdc.europa.eu ) die each year as a direct consequence of an infection caused by bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Among viral infections, influenza is responsible for about 3-5 million cases of severe illness, and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths annually ( www.who.int ). About 37 million people are currently living with HIV infection and about one million die from it each year. Coronaviruses such as MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, but in particular the recent outbreak of Covid-19 (caused by SARS-CoV2) have resulted in large numbers of infections worldwide with an estimated several hundred thousand deaths (anticipated fatality rate: <5%). With a comparatively low mortality rate dengue virus causes between 50 and 100 million infections every year, leading to 50,000 deaths. In contrast, Ebola virus is the causative agent for one of the deadliest viral diseases. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 is considered the largest outbreak in history with more than 11,000 deaths. Many of the deadliest pathogens such as Ebola virus, influenza virus, mycobacterium tuberculosis, dengue virus, and cholera exploit the endo-lysosomal trafficking system of host cells for penetration into the cytosol and replication. Defects in endo-lysosomal maturation, trafficking, fusion, or pH homeostasis can efficiently reduce the cytotoxicity caused by these pathogens. Most of these functions critically depend on endo-lysosomal membrane proteins such as transporters and ion channels.

Many reports from several countries have underlined a remarkable increase in the cases of IPV during the COVID-19 emergency. In this opinion article, we discussed the hypothesis that such an increase may be related to the restrictive measures enacted to contain the pandemic, including women's forced cohabitation with the abusive partner, as well as the exacerbation of partners' pre-existing psychological disorders during the lockdown. In addition, we retrospectively analyzed some data derived from our practice in a public Italian referral center for sexual and domestic violence (Service for Sexual and Domestic Violence [SVSeD]). These data interestingly revealed an opposite trend, that is, a decrease in the number of women who sought assistance since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Such a reduction should be interpreted as a negative consequence of the pandemic-related restrictive measures. Although necessary, these measures reduced women's possibilities of seeking help from antiviolence centers and/or emergency services. Owing to the COVID-19 outbreak, there is an urgent need for developing and implementing alternative treatment options for IPV victims (such as online and phone counseling and telemedicine), as well as training programs for health care professionals, especially those employed in emergency departments, to facilitate early detection of IPV.","Barbara, Giussy; Facchin, Federica; Micci, Laila; Rendiniello, Mitia; Giulini, Paolo; Cattaneo, Cristina; Vercellini, Paolo; Kustermann, Alessandra",J Womens Health (Larchmt),488,8

The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. OBJECTIVE: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. METHODS: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of &#8805;0.75 (&#945;=.05; power [1-ß]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. CONCLUSIONS: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19.

We aimed to assess its impact on mental health during the early phase by comparing pandemic with prepandemic data and to identify potential risk and protective factors. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analyses, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020, and screened reference lists of included studies. In addition, we searched PubMed and PsycINFO for prepandemic comparative data. Survey studies assessing mental burden by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the general population, healthcare workers, or any patients (eg, COVID-19 patients), with a broad range of eligible mental health outcomes, and matching studies evaluating prepandemic comparative data in the same population (if available) were included. We used multilevel meta-analyses for main, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, focusing on (perceived) stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep-related symptoms as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2429 records retrieved, 104 were included in the review (n = 208,261 participants), 43 in the meta-analysis (n = 71,613 participants). While symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.40; 95% CI 0.15-0.65) and depression (SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.07-1.27) were increased in the general population during the early phase of the pandemic compared with prepandemic conditions, mental burden was not increased in patients as well as healthcare workers, irrespective of COVID-19 patient contact. Specific outcome measures (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire) and older comparative data (published &#8805;5 years ago) were associated with increased mental burden. Across the three population groups, existing mental disorders, female sex, and concerns about getting infected were repeatedly reported as risk factors, while older age, a good economic situation, and education were protective. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis paints a more differentiated picture of the mental health consequences in pandemic situations than previous reviews. High-quality, representative surveys, high granular longitudinal studies, and more research on protective factors are required to better understand the psychological impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to help design effective preventive measures and interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific population groups.","Kunzler, Angela M; Röthke, Nikolaus; Günthner, Lukas; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Tüscher, Oliver; Coenen, Michaela; Rehfuess, Eva; Schwarzer, Guido; Binder, Harald; Schmucker, Christine; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Lieb, Klaus",Global Health,488,25

Distant metastases are seen in 50% of cases regardless of treatment, which contributes to high mortality rates. Polo-like kinase-1 (PLK-1) is a protein regulator of mitotic entry and cytokinesis. Increased PLK-1 expression has been shown in different tumours, which makes its inhibition a potential treatment target. To date, no study has been published to discuss the prognostic role of PLK-1 expression in patients with uveal melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We assessed by immunohistochemistry PLK-1 expression in uveal melanoma cells collected in 158 patients treated by primary enucleation. We determined the correlation between PLK-1 levels evaluated by the immunoreactivity scale (IRS) method and detailed clinical as well as histological parameters. Additionally, we determined the association between PLK-1 expression levels and long-term prognosis. RESULTS: Elevated PLK-1 expression in tumour cells, defined as IRS > 2, was observed in 70% (111/158) of cases, whereas low expression or no expression was seen in the remaining 30% (47/158) of patients. There was a significant correlation between low PLK-1 expression and a higher clinical tumour stage (pT, p = 0.04) as well as a higher AJCC prognostic stage group (p = 0.037). We observed an inverse correlation between PLK-1 expression and tumour cell pigment content (p = 0.0019). There was no correlation between PLK-1 expression and other histological parameters such as mitotic rate or histological subtype. The Kaplan-Meier's analysis demonstrated that low PLK-1 expression was associated with significantly reduced overall survival (p = 0.0058). A similar trend, albeit not significant, was observed for disease-free survival (p = 0.088). CONCLUSIONS: Downregulated PLK-1 expression is a negative prognostic factor in uveal melanoma. It warrants further, multicentre research on prognostic role of PLK-1 expression and possibility of PLK-1 inhibition in uveal melanoma.","Berus, Tomasz; Markiewicz, Anna; Kobylinska, Katarzyna; Biecek, Przemyslaw; Orlowska-Heitzman, Jolanta; Romanowska-Dixon, Bozena; Donizy, Piotr",Folia Histochem Cytobiol,488,1

Based on our discovery that the glycosaminoglycan dermatan sulfate (DS) displays peculiar affinity to apoptotic cells and autoantigens (autoAgs) and that DS-autoAg complexes cooperatively stimulate autoreactive B1 cell responses, we compiled a database of 751 candidate autoAgs from six human cell types. At least 657 of these have been found to be affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection based on currently available multi-omic COVID data, and at least 400 are confirmed targets of autoantibodies in a wide array of autoimmune diseases and cancer. The autoantigen-ome is significantly associated with various processes in viral infections, such as translation, protein processing, and vesicle transport. Interestingly, the coding genes of autoAgs predominantly contain multiple exons with many possible alternative splicing variants, short transcripts, and short UTR lengths. These observations and the finding that numerous autoAgs involved in RNA-splicing showed altered expression in viral infections suggest that viruses exploit alternative splicing to reprogram host cell machinery to ensure viral replication and survival. While each cell type gives rise to a unique pool of autoAgs, 39 common autoAgs associated with cell stress and apoptosis were identified from all six cell types, with several being known markers of systemic autoimmune diseases. In particular, the common autoAg UBA1 that catalyzes the first step in ubiquitination is encoded by an X-chromosome escape gene. Given its essential function in apoptotic cell clearance and that X-inactivation escape tends to increase with aging, UBA1 dysfunction can therefore predispose aging women to autoimmune disorders. In summary, we propose a model of how viral infections lead to extensive molecular alterations and host cell death, autoimmune responses facilitated by autoAg-DS complexes, and ultimately autoimmune diseases. Overall, this master autoantigen-ome provides a molecular guide for investigating the myriad of autoimmune sequalae to COVID-19 and clues to the rare but reported adverse effects of the currently available COVID vaccines.","Wang, Julia Y.; Roehrl, Michael W.; Roehrl, Victor B.; Roehrl, Michael H.",,488,5

Clinical and immunological features of patients with COVID-19 have highlighted a potential role for changes in immune activity in regulating disease severity. However, little is known about the responses in human lung tissue, the primary site of infection. Here we show that pathways related to neutrophil activation and pulmonary fibrosis are among the major up-regulated transcriptional signatures in lung tissue obtained from patients who died of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. Strikingly, the viral burden was low in all samples, which suggests that the patient deaths may be related to the host response rather than an active fulminant infection. Examination of the colonic transcriptome of these patients suggested that SARS-CoV-2 impacted host responses even at a site with no obvious pathogenesis. Further proteomics analysis validated our transcriptome findings and identified several key proteins, such as the SARS-CoV-2 entry-associated protease cathepsins B and L and the inflammatory response modulator S100A8/A9, that are highly expressed in fatal cases, revealing potential drug targets for COVID-19.","Wu, Meng; Chen, Yaobing; Xia, Han; Wang, Changli; Tan, Chin Yee; Cai, Xunhui; Liu, Yufeng; Ji, Fenghu; Xiong, Peng; Liu, Ran; Guan, Yuanlin; Duan, Yaqi; Kuang, Dong; Xu, Sanpeng; Cai, Hanghang; Xia, Qin; Yang, Dehua; Wang, Ming-Wei; Chiu, Isaac M; Cheng, Chao; Ahern, Philip P; Liu, Liang; Wang, Guoping; Surana, Neeraj K; Xia, Tian; Kasper, Dennis L",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,488,5

In this paper, we systematically studied the temporal and spatial characteristics of COVID-19, infectivity, and the impact of Hubei province’s quarantine on the national railway system on the basis of epidemic and national train data. This study found the following: (1) The overall growth of the epidemic was exponential, and the outbreak of Hubei had a strong spread in the eastern and southern directions. The epidemic was generally more serious in the capital or developed cities in each province, and the epidemic outside Hubei was under control after the imported growth ended. (2) On the basis of analyzing the disturbance of the spread of the epidemic by traffic control, the average incubation period of COVID-19 was approximately 4 days. The ratio of the number of cured people to the number of deaths gradually increased, indicating that, given sufficient medical service, the cure rate can be greatly improved. (3) The quarantine of Hubei had greater impact on cities with higher centrality, especially in the Yangtze River Delta region, and smaller impact on the overall connectivity of the national railway network. For local people, quarantine had great impact on the outflow of local people to neighboring provinces.","Wang, Fang Niu Fangqu",Sustainability,488,1

Clinical trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of early prone positioning for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), including decreased mortality. However, pregnant women were excluded from these trials. To address the need for low-cost, low-harm interventions in the face of a widespread viral syndrome wherein hypoxemia predominates, we developed an algorithm for prone positioning of both intubated and nonintubated pregnant women. This algorithm may be appropriate for a wide spectrum of hypoxemia severity among pregnant women. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is responsible for the clinical manifestations of COVID-19. This syndrome can manifest as severe pneumonia complicated by hypoxemia and ARDS. Given the current global COVID-19 pandemic, with a large number of ARDS cases, there is renewed interest in the use of prone positioning to improve oxygenation in moderate or severe hypoxemia. Among the populations who can benefit from prone positioning are pregnant women experiencing severe respiratory distress, as long as the physiologic changes and risks of pregnancy are taken into account.","Tolcher, Mary Catherine; McKinney, Jennifer R; Eppes, Catherine S; Muigai, David; Shamshirsaz, Amir; Guntupalli, Kalpalatha K; Nates, Joseph L",Obstet Gynecol,488,15

Inactivated vaccines are safe to use during biological treatment, without interruption. Conversely, live vaccines are used with caution and likely interruption of treatment. Given the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), nation-wide administration of vaccinations is underway. OBJECTIVE: This survey gathered information on the level of education psoriatic patients have concerning vaccinations. METHODS: An electronic survey was sent to 661 patients suffering from psoriasis. Patients originated from a single solo-practitioner community-based dermatology practice. RESULTS: The average percentage of patients who understand the difference between live and inactivated vaccines between the control and study group was 36.6%. The average response to not knowing the difference between the vaccines was 36.6% and 26.6% were ""unsure."" When asked if it was possible to receive inactivated vaccines while on a biologic, the mass response amidst the control and study group was ""unsure"" (66.9%). CONCLUSION: This questionnaire demonstrates that there is a need for supplementary education about vaccines for psoriatic patients on a biologic.

There remains a need to improve wastewater RNA extraction methods' sensitivity, speed, and reduce reliance on often expensive commercial reagents to make wastewater-based epidemiology more accessible. We present a kit-free wastewater RNA extraction method, titled ""Sewage, Salt, Silica and SARS-CoV-2"" (4S), that employs the abundant and affordable reagents sodium chloride (NaCl), ethanol, and silica RNA capture matrices to recover sixfold more SARS-CoV-2 RNA from wastewater than an existing ultrafiltration-based method. The 4S method concurrently recovered pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV) and human 18S ribosomal subunit rRNA, which have been proposed as fecal concentration controls. The SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations measured in three sewersheds corresponded to the relative prevalence of COVID-19 infection determined via clinical testing. Lastly, controlled experiments indicate that the 4S method prevented RNA degradation during storage of wastewater samples, was compatible with heat pasteurization, and in our experience, 20 samples can be processed by one lab technician in approximately 2 h. Overall, the 4S method is promising for effective, economical, and accessible wastewater-based epidemiology for SARS-CoV-2, providing another tool to fight the global pandemic.","Whitney, Oscar N; Kennedy, Lauren C; Fan, Vinson B; Hinkle, Adrian; Kantor, Rose; Greenwald, Hannah; Crits-Christoph, Alexander; Al-Shayeb, Basem; Chaplin, Mira; Maurer, Anna C; Tjian, Robert; Nelson, Kara L",Environ Sci Technol,488,21

It is an infectious disease (R0: 2.2 to 3.3) with confirmed human-to-human transmission. The high morbidity and mortality attributed to viral infection has overwhelmed the health systems of most countries across the globe. As of now, there is no confirmed treatment or vaccine against COVID-19. The current pharmacological management relies only on supportive care. Therefore, only non-pharmacological approaches are left to protect people from infection. Established preventive methods against infection include dodging the exposure from the virus, which will break the chain of transmission and prevent further human-to-human spread.

To shed light on this critical matter, the present study provides the first comprehensive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 stability on experimentally contaminated personal protective equipment (PPE) widely used by healthcare workers and the general public. Persistence of viable virus was monitored over 21 days on eight different materials, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, Tyvek, plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Unlike previous reports, viable SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of a soil load persisted for up to 21 days on experimentally inoculated PPE, including materials from filtering facepiece respirators (N-95 and N-100 masks) and a plastic visor. Conversely, when applied to 100% cotton fabric, the virus underwent rapid degradation and became undetectable by TCID50 assay within 24 h.

The majority of studies assess preventive behaviour through relevant unidimensional questions, but this approach is not necessarily the best way to conceptualize prevention, as health maintenance guidelines cover several different areas of possible individual precautionary and preventive practices. The aim of the study is the development and validation of a multidimensional COVID-19 prevention behaviour scale for the Hungarian speaking population (Covid-19-PBS). The items address major aspects related to preventive behaviour towards COVID-19 inspired by preliminary pandemic studies and the WHO prevention recommendations. 612 eligible female individuals were included in the study;the sample was recruited from the Hungarian general population, and participants were between the ages of 18 and 65 years old. According to preliminary studies women are more likely to engage proactively in prevention behaviour;they perceive the risk of a disease more profoundly, and even disease information seeking was more prevalent among women. An exploratory factor analysis was performed for this new scale, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis. According to our results, the model fit indices are adequate (CFI= .928, RMSEA= .064). Cronbach's alpha was used to examine the reliability of the factors;the internal validity of the scale is good (a = .78). The final instrument contains 11 items with responses scored on a 4-point Likert scale and 3 domains: general hygiene, social distancing, and COVID-19 information-seeking behaviour. Our results have revealed that the new scale has good psychometric properties and may be a useful instrument for assessing COVID-19 preventive behaviour across women. This tool can be useful for professionals in order to develop more effective and targeted prevention programs especially in the female population, as the instrument was validated only in women up to this stage. This scale can serve the purpose of improving individual and collective adjustment to prevention regulations during the epidemic.","Kalcza-Janosi, Kinga Jancso-Farcas Susana Szabo Kinga Kotta Ibolya Marschalko Eszter Eniko",Journal of International Women&#039;s Studies,488,16

METHODS: The authors conducted the study at 3 US dental schools and 1 US medical school using an online survey that assessed previous immunization behavior, attitudes about and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines, and personal experience with COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 248 DS and 167 MS completed the survey. Forty-five percent of DS and 23% of MS were hesitant about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Results of bivariate analyses found that MS were 2.7 times more likely than DS to receive the vaccine (odds ratio, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.76 to 4.31; P = .0001). Although DS were more likely than MS (P < .05) to have had COVID-19 and to personally know someone who had COVID-19, MS were more likely to agree with mandates and trust information about the vaccines. In multivariable analyses, after controlling for demographic variables, experience with COVID-19, and personal vaccination behaviors, being a MS or DS was no longer predictive of willingness to get the vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the need for profession-specific curricula designed to enhance student knowledge about the vaccines and vaccine counseling skills. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The American Dental Association supports dentists administering vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccines. Dentists and DS should be willing to receive the vaccines themselves. Education about the vaccines is needed to improve uptake.","Kelekar, Arati K; Lucia, Victoria C; Afonso, Nelia M; Mascarenhas, Ana Karina",,488,1

A cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 358 undergraduates from 14 universities in Turkey, including 200 female students (56%). The measurements used in the study were the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Perception of COVID Impact on Student Well-Being (CI), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Physical Activity Scale (PA), and a sociodemographic survey. Students reported high perceived stress, mild generalized anxiety, and low satisfaction with life. More than half of the students met the diagnostic criteria of GAD (52%) and depression (63%). Female and physically inactive students had higher PSS-10 levels. A hierarchical linear regression model showed that after controlling for gender and negative CI, anxiety and physical inactivity significantly predicted high perceived stress.

Past experience provides one source of knowledge about likely task demands in the present, with learning enabling future predictions about anticipated demands. We examine whether spatial contexts serve to cue retrieval of associated task demands (e.g., context A and B probabilistically cue retrieval of task demands X and Y, respectively), and the role of the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in mediating such retrieval. Using 3D virtual environments, we induce context-task demand probabilistic associations and find that learned associations affect goal-directed behavior. Concurrent fMRI data reveal that, upon entering a context, differences between hippocampal representations of contexts (i.e., neural pattern separability) predict proactive retrieval of the probabilistically dominant associated task demand, which is reinstated in dlPFC. These findings reveal how hippocampal-prefrontal interactions support memory-guided cognitive control and adaptive behavior.","Jiang, Jiefeng; Wang, Shao-Fang; Guo, Wanjia; Fernandez, Corey; Wagner, Anthony D",Nat Commun,488,1

DESIGN: Two-arm, multi-centre pilot and feasibility randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Five National Health Service hospitals in England. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (n = 73) with non-traumatic rotator cuff tears scheduled for repair were recruited and randomly allocated remotely prior to surgery. INTERVENTIONS: Early patient-directed rehabilitation (n = 37); advised to remove their sling as soon as able and move as symptoms allow. Standard rehabilitation (n = 36); sling immobilisation for four weeks. MEASURES: (1) Randomisation of 20% or more eligible patients. (2) Difference in time out of sling of 40% or more between groups. (3) Follow-up greater than 70%. RESULTS: 73/185 (39%) potentially eligible patients were randomised. Twenty participants were withdrawn, 11 due to not receiving rotator cuff repair. The between-group difference in proportions of participants who exceeded the cut-off of 222.6 hours out of the sling was 50% (80% CI = 29%, 72%), with the early patient-directed rehabilitation group reporting greater time out of sling. 52/73 (71%) and 52/53 (98%) participants were followed-up at 12 weeks when withdrawals were included and excluded respectively. Eighteen full-thickness re-tears were reported (early patient-directed rehabilitation = 7, standard rehabilitation = 11). Five serious adverse events were reported.

One of these concerns revolves around the pressing question: should providers continue to work in the absence of adequate PPE? Although the first peak of the COVID-19 crisis seems to have subsided and supply of PPE has increased, concerns about insufficient PPE availability remain. Inconsistent supply, limited efficacy, and continued high demand for PPE, combined with the continued threat of a second COVID-19 wave, mean that the issues surrounding PPE availability remain unresolved, including a duty to work. This paper offers an ethical investigation of whether neurosurgeons should perform their professional responsibilities with limited availability of PPE. We evaluate ethical considerations and conflicting duties and thereby hope to facilitate providers in making a well-considered personal and moral decision about this challenging issue.","Eijkholt, Marleen; Hulsbergen, Alexander; Muskens, Ivo; Mathiesen, Tiit Illimar; Bolger, Ciaran; Feldman, Zeev; Kitchen, Neil; Samprón, Nicolás; Sandvik, Ulrika; Tisell, Magnus; Broekman, Marike",Acta neurochir,488,1

Survey questions included demographic information and questions regarding working remotely, personal protective equipment, redeployment, personal wellness, wellness resources and financial concerns. A psychometrician reviewed the questions to ensure minimal risk of misinterpretation. RESULTS: Median age of respondents was 48 years (range 33-70 years) with median number of years in practice of 14 (range 1-45 years). Fifty-three percent of respondents were women and 46% were men. Because of an increase in remote work, 69% of respondents endorsed feeling more isolated from a lack of regular interaction with colleagues.

More recently, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and now Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) have arisen, and given the current absence of highly effective approved vaccines or drugs, brute-force approaches involving physical barriers are being used to counter virus spread. A major basis for physical protection from respiratory infections is eye, nose, and mouth protection. However, eye protection with goggles is problematic due to ""fogging"", while nose/mouth protection is complicated by the breathing difficulties associated with non-valved respirators. Here, we give a brief review of the origins and development of face masks and eye protection to counter respiratory infections on the basis of experiments conducted 100 years ago, work that was presaged by the first use of personal protective equipment, ""PPE"", by the plague doctors of the 17th Century. The results of the review lead to two conclusions: first, that eye protection using filtered eye masks be used to prevent ocular transmission; second, that new, pre-filtered, valved respirators be used to even more effectively block viral transmission.","Oldfield, Eric; Malwal, Satish R",ACS Infect Dis,488,16

The first Italian cases occurred in February 2020: since then, there has been an exponential increase in new cases, hospitalizations and intensive care assistance demand. This new and sudden scenario led to a forced National Health System reorganization and review of welfare priorities. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of this pandemic on ordinary activities in two plastic surgery divisions in Rome, hosted in a COVID-19 and a non-COVID-19 hospital. Methods: The data of this comparative retrospective study was collected between 9 March and 9 April 2019 and the same period of 2020 from two plastic surgery units, one in a COVID-19 hospital and second in a non-COVID-19 hospital in Rome, Italy. The 2019-2020 data of the two hospitals was compared regarding the number of surgeries, post-operative dressings and first consultations performed. Results: Both units sustained a decrease in workload due to lockdown effects. Statistically significant differences for day surgery procedures (p value = 0.0047) and first consultations (p value < 0.0001) were found between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 institutes, with a drastic trend limiting non-urgent access to COVID-19 hospitals.

By exploring children's reactions more broadly, we are better placed to understanding the breadth of implications of home school and social isolation under COVID-19. The present study explored how COVID-19 related variables, namely, home school experience, child perceived family stress and instability, screen time use, missing friends and worry about virus infection are associated with children's emotional, somatic/cognitive and worry reactions, respectively. A total of 442 children (M = 11.43 years, SD = 2.59) from the longitudinal FamilieForSK-study participated and a series of hierarchical linear regression models were applied controlling for background variables including children's psychological vulnerability. Results showed significant associations between all COVID-19 related predictors, except screen time use, and the three outcomes. Family stress and instability had the strongest effects with standardised betas ranging from .356 to .555 and collectively, predictors explained between 20.7 and 44.1% of variance in outcomes. Furthermore, several associations were moderated by age and older children were more negatively impacted (i.e., higher level of reported reactions).

By exploring children's reactions more broadly, we are better placed to understanding the breadth of implications of home school and social isolation under COVID-19. The present study explored how COVID-19 related variables, namely, home school experience, child perceived family stress and instability, screen time use, missing friends and worry about virus infection are associated with children's emotional, somatic/cognitive and worry reactions, respectively. A total of 442 children (M = 11.43 years, SD = 2.59) from the longitudinal FamilieForSK-study participated and a series of hierarchical linear regression models were applied controlling for background variables including children's psychological vulnerability. Results showed significant associations between all COVID-19 related predictors, except screen time use, and the three outcomes. Family stress and instability had the strongest effects with standardised betas ranging from .356 to .555 and collectively, predictors explained between 20.7 and 44.1% of variance in outcomes. Furthermore, several associations were moderated by age and older children were more negatively impacted (i.e., higher level of reported reactions).

Using CAD re-drawings, a systematic comparison of residential schemes identifies the evolutionary mechanism that connects manifold changes in the city and domestic spaces. This analysis defines a genealogical framework to observe how specific residential archetypes have shaped Brussels’ sociocultural identity and distinguishes contemporary housing initiatives dealing with current and future challenges. While during the 19th century, interwar, and postwar periods, spatial features evolved from individual, single-family houses to residential schemes bearing collective, egalitarian dwellings, contemporary initiatives are relevant for their experimental solutions, translating into housing design new collective ways of living. This trajectory demonstrates that collective housing provides new insights for designing future types of urban housing. Brussels contemporary housing can shed light on the fact that current crises generated by urban issues, such as demographic growth, migratory and gentrification dynamics, affordability and the COVID-19 pandemic, are accelerating the transition towards the 21st-century city.

The main objective of this report is to communicate our experience in the therapeutic management of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 3 liver transplant patients. Secondly, we stress the management and investigation of the contagious spreading into a liver transplant ward. CASE SUMMARY: The patients were two women (aged 61 years and 62 years) and one man (aged 68 years), all of them having recently received a liver transplant. All three patients required intensive care unit admission and invasive mechanical ventilation. Two of them progressed severely until death. The other one, who received tocilizumab, had a good recovery. In the outbreak, the wife of one of the patients and four healthcare professionals involved in their care were also infected.

Additionally, we considered the possible correlation between the Dark Triad and the intensity of symptoms of depression and anxiety. A total of 604 Polish participants, whose average age was 28.95 ± 11.27 years, completed an online survey which measured Dark Triad traits using the Polish version of the Dirty Dozen test. Anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The results revealed a possible relationship between personality traits and compliance with pandemic restrictions. Individuals with higher levels of psychopathy tended to disobey newly introduced rules. On the other hand, a higher level of subclinical narcissism might have contributed to a better civil compliance. The results showed a significant positive correlation between the intensity of the Dark Triad and the occurrence of depressive symptoms. Furthermore, narcissism was linked to anxiety symptoms. These results can contribute to a better understanding of behavioural patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic within the group of individuals who exhibit the Dark Triad traits.

Evidence from human trials demonstrate substantial reductions in all-cause mortality, especially in the first week of life. Observational studies have identified an association between BCG vaccination and reduced risk of respiratory infectious disease and clinical malaria later in childhood. The mechanistic basis for these pathogen-agnostic benefits, also known as beneficial non-specific effects (NSE) of BCG have been attributed to trained immunity, or epigenetic reprogramming of hematopoietic cells that give rise to innate immune cells responding more efficiently to a broad range of pathogens. Furthermore, within trained immunity, the focus so far has been on enhanced monocyte function. However, polymorphonuclear cells, namely neutrophils, are not only major constituents of the hematopoietic compartment but functionally as well as numerically represent a prominent component of the immune system. The beneficial NSEs of the BCG vaccine on newborn sepsis was recently demonstrated to be driven by a BCG-mediated numeric increase of neutrophils (emergency granulopoiesis (EG)). And experimental evidence in animal models suggest that BCG can modulate neutrophil function as well. Together, these findings suggest that neutrophils are crucial to at least the immediate beneficial NSE of the BCG vaccine. Efforts to uncover the full gamut of mechanisms underpinning the broad beneficial effects of BCG should therefore include neutrophils at the forefront.","Brook, Byron; Schaltz-Buchholzer, Frederick; Ben-Othman, Rym; Kollmann, Tobias; Amenyogbe, Nelly",Vaccine,488,29

This review aims to describe advances in cystic fibrosis-related SRH and highlight optimal practices. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent publications suggest that people with cystic fibrosis follow a similar trajectory of sexual development and activity as their noncystic fibrosis peers, although contraception use is lower. Although fertility is reduced in patients with cystic fibrosis, improved survival and assisted reproductive technologies have led to an increasing pursuit and incidence of pregnancy. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator modulators that correct the underlying cystic fibrosis defect might improve fertility and thus far appear safe in pregnancy, though data are limited.Despite medical knowledge of SRH in cystic fibrosis, patients continue to report they lack sufficient education about these aspects of their healthcare, and cystic fibrosis multidisciplinary teams are ill prepared to counsel their patients. SUMMARY: Understanding of the effects of cystic fibrosis on SRH continues to improve, although many questions remain regarding optimal care from the choice of contraception to the safety of cystic fibrosis-specific medications in pregnancy. Further development of cystic fibrosis-informed interdisciplinary specialist networks and a wider framework of practice would both enhance health outcomes and better support patients.","Frayman, Katherine B; Chin, Melanie; Sawyer, Susan M; Bell, Scott C",Curr Opin Pulm Med,488,26

In settings of large numbers of patients, a risk assessment tool may guide resource allocation not only for patient care but also for maximum health care and public health benefit. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether a COVID-19 telemedicine risk assessment tool accurately predicts hospitalizations. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of a COVID-19 telemedicine home monitoring program serving health care workers and the community in Atlanta, Georgia, with enrollment from March 24 to May 26, 2020; the final call range was from March 27 to June 19, 2020. All patients were assessed by medical providers using an institutional COVID-19 risk assessment tool designating patients as Tier 1 (low risk for hospitalization), Tier 2 (intermediate risk for hospitalization), or Tier 3 (high risk for hospitalization). Patients were followed with regular telephone calls to an endpoint of improvement or hospitalization. Using survival analysis by Cox regression with days to hospitalization as the metric, we analyzed the performance of the risk tiers and explored individual patient factors associated with risk of hospitalization. RESULTS: Providers using the risk assessment rubric assigned 496 outpatients to tiers: Tier 1, 237 out of 496 (47.8%); Tier 2, 185 out of 496 (37.3%); and Tier 3, 74 out of 496 (14.9%). Subsequent hospitalizations numbered 3 out of 237 (1.3%) for Tier 1, 15 out of 185 (8.1%) for Tier 2, and 17 out of 74 (23%) for Tier 3. From a Cox regression model with age of 60 years or older, gender, and reported obesity as covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios for hospitalization using Tier 1 as reference were 3.74 (95% CI 1.06-13.27; P=.04) for Tier 2 and 10.87 (95% CI 3.09-38.27; P<.001) for Tier 3.

Suicide rates for health care providers are thought to be higher than for people in other occupations because of job strain and burnout. Despite the National Academy of Medicine's Action Collaborative on Clinician Well-Being and Resilience, which focuses on reducing stress and preventing suicide, a shortage of data limits our understanding of nurse suicide. Neither employers nor professional nursing associations track suicide data. PURPOSE: To determine the number of suicides and estimated rate of suicide among RNs, using data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS). METHODS: We extracted data from the NVDRS, which is based on death certificates, coroner reports, and law enforcement reports, for the year 2015. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health's Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System was used to code the data. Industry and occupation coding experts reviewed the coding for accuracy. RESULTS: Analysis of 2015 NVDRS data from 17 states showed that among civilian employed nurses ages 16 to 64 years, the estimated suicide rates for female and male nurses (11.4 and 29.3 per 100,000 nurses, respectively) were each higher than the rates for the comparable total population (8.2 and 26.1 per 100,000 people, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that RNs may die by suicide at higher rates than the total employed population in the 16-to-64-year age range.

The virus has since spread globally, resulting in the currently ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The first whole genome sequence was published on January 5 2020, and thousands of genomes have been sequenced since this date. This resource allows unprecedented insights into the past demography of SARS-CoV-2 but also monitoring of how the virus is adapting to its novel human host, providing information to direct drug and vaccine design. We curated a dataset of 7666 public genome assemblies and analysed the emergence of genomic diversity over time. Our results are in line with previous estimates and point to all sequences sharing a common ancestor towards the end of 2019, supporting this as the period when SARS-CoV-2 jumped into its human host. Due to extensive transmission, the genetic diversity of the virus in several countries recapitulates a large fraction of its worldwide genetic diversity. We identify regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have remained largely invariant to date, and others that have already accumulated diversity. By focusing on mutations which have emerged independently multiple times (homoplasies), we identify 198 filtered recurrent mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Nearly 80% of the recurrent mutations produced non-synonymous changes at the protein level, suggesting possible ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2. Three sites in Orf1ab in the regions encoding Nsp6, Nsp11, Nsp13, and one in the Spike protein are characterised by a particularly large number of recurrent mutations (>15 events) which may signpost convergent evolution and are of particular interest in the context of adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to the human host.

Currently, there are no approved treatments for CoronaVirus Disease 19 (COVID-19); however, therapeutic strategies based on the preclinical evidence include supportive measures, such as oxygen supplementation, antiviral, and anticoagulant agents. Despite these treatments, 10% of patients worsen and develop severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since the pathogenic mechanism of ARDS is an uncontrolled inflammatory state, we speculate that removing inflammation effectors from blood may contrast tissue injury and improve clinical outcome. In a scenario of dramatic medical emergency, we conducted an observational study on 9 consecutive patients hospitalized in COVID Intensive Care Unit, where 5 of 9 consecutive patients were treated with HP, due to the emergency overload made it impossible to deliver blood purification in the other 4 patients. COVID-19 was diagnosed through the identification of virus sequences by reverse transcription-PCR on respiratory specimens. All patients had severe pneumonia requiring continuous positive airway pressure. HP was started in all patients 6-7 days after hospital admission.

However, the effectiveness of E-learning in CME interventions remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate whether E-learning training program can improve TB health personnel's knowledge and behaviour in China. METHODS: This study used a convergent mixed method research design to evaluate the impact of E-learning programs for tuberculosis (TB) health workers in terms of knowledge improvement and behaviour change during the China-Gates TB Project (add the time span). Quantitative data was collected by staff surveys (baseline n = 555; final n = 757) and management information systems to measure the demographic characteristics, training participation, and TB knowledge. Difference-in-difference (DID) and multiple linear regression models were employed to capture the effectiveness of knowledge improvement. Qualitative data was collected by interviews (n = 30) and focus group discussions (n = 44) with managers, teachers, and learners to explore their learning experience. RESULTS: Synchronous E-learning improved the knowledge of TB clinicians (average treatment effect, ATE: 7.3 scores/100, P = 0.026). Asynchronous E-learning has a significant impact on knowledge among primary care workers (ATE: 10.9/100, P < 0.001), but not in clinicians or public health physicians. Traditional face-to-face training has no significant impact on all medical staff. Most of the learners (57.3%) agreed that they could apply what they learned to their practice. Qualitative data revealed that high quality content is the key facilitator of the behaviour change, while of learning content difficulty, relevancy, and hardware constraints are key barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of E-learning in CME varies across different types of training formats, organizational environment, and target audience.

The survey attempted to retrospectively assess all self-reported or diagnosed cases of influenza since August 1, 1918. It indicated that the cumulative incidence of symptomatic influenza over 6 months had been 29.4% (range = 15% in Louisville, KY, to 53.3% in San Antonio, TX). The overall case fatality rate (CFR) was 1.70%, and it ranged from 0.78% in San Antonio to 3.14% in New London, Connecticut. Localities with high cumulative incidence were not necessarily those with high CFR.

Vaccination coverage is suboptimal in inflammatory bowel disease population. It is of paramount importance to ensure an effective and rapid vaccination program with the adherence of the largest number of well-informed patients. AIMS: We assessed the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among inflammatory bowel disease patients. METHODS: We performed a survey as part of routine practice, between January 8th and February 22nd, 2021. All consecutive adult patients followed at Nancy University Hospital for inflammatory bowel disease were included. Patients completed a self-administered, structured, paper-based questionnaire. Demographic data, medical history, knowledge, and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination were collected. RESULTS: Among the 104 patients who responded to the survey, 57 patients (54.8%) had intent to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccine efficacy, social responsibility, herd immunity, and desire to return to normal life were associated with self-reported willingness to receive a vaccine (20.2%, 20.2%, 11.5%, and 15.4%, respectively). Unknown long-term safety, risk of adverse reaction to vaccine and concern that the vaccine is being developed too quickly were the most commonly reported reasons for non-uptake (27.9%, 15.4%, and 12.5%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Half of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease would like to be vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. This rate is similar to that reported in the French general population. Despite some concerns, patients with inflammatory bowel disease understood the necessity to be vaccinated against COVID-19.","Caron, Bénédicte; Neuville, Elise; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent",Dig. dis. sci,488,31

METHODS: Retrospective, observational cohort study of all adult patients (18 years and older) consecutively admitted with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 infection between March 13 and April 25, 2020 at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. All of the patients either survived to hospital discharge or died during hospitalization. Demographics, body mass index, comorbidities, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings were collected. Patient outcomes (need for invasive mechanical ventilation and in-hospital death) were analyzed. RESULTS: One hundred patients were included, 53% of whom were women. Median age was 59 years (interquartile range 44-70) and 66% were younger than 65. Seventy-five percent identified themselves as Black, despite representing 58% of hospitalized patients at our institution in 2019. Common comorbid conditions included hypertension (68%), obesity (65%), and diabetes mellitus (31%). Frequent clinical manifestations included shortness of breath (76%), cough (75%), and fever (64%). Symptoms were present for a median of 7 days (interquartile range 4-7) on presentation. Twenty-four percent of patients required mechanical ventilation and, overall, 19% died (67% of those requiring mechanical ventilation). Eighty-four percent of those who died were Black. On multivariate analysis, ever smoking (odds ratio [OR] 5.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-28.6) and history of diabetes mellitus (OR 5.9, 95% CI 1.5-24.3) were associated with mortality, and those admitted from home were less likely to die (vs outside facility, OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0-0.7). Neither age, sex, race, body mass index, insurance status, nor rural residence was independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Our study adds evidence that Black patients appear to be overrepresented in those hospitalized with and those who die from COVID-19, likely a manifestation of adverse social determinants of health.

Healthcare professionals also identify the great value of communication with families to reduce their anxiety and stress. Despite this, families may feel inadequately informed, causing added suffering. The purpose of this study is to provide an understanding of both families' and healthcare professionals' perspectives on information giving within intensive care units (ICU). METHOD: A narrative review was conducted using MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases and the Cochrane Library to identify studies published in either English or Spanish from 2002 to 2018. RESULTS: 47 studies were included, and five categories were identified: 1)""the need to know""; 2)family satisfaction with the information received; 3)impact of information on families' experiences in the ICU; 4)nurses and physicians' perceptions of information transmission, and 5)information process in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Providing honest and truthful information to the families of critical patients is essential to reduce family anxiety and increase family control, although this often appears to be inadequately accomplished by staff. Interdisciplinary involvement in information giving may be beneficial for both families and ICU professionals. This review brings new understanding about the process of information to families of ICU patients and it can be used to improve the quality and humanization of care in the ICUs.","Regaira-Martínez, E; Garcia-Vivar, C",Enferm. intensiva (Ed. impr.),488,24

Despite current theories about their effectiveness, the true benefits of dietary supplements on the prevention and treatment of viral RTIs remain elusive, due to contradictory reports. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary supplements on the prevention and treatment of viral RTIs.Areas covered: We systematically searched databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar through 4 March 2020, to identify randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of consuming selected dietary supplements on the prevention or treatment of viral RTIs.Expert opinion: Thirty-nine randomized controlled trials (n = 16,797 participants) were eligible and included. Namely, vitamin D supplementation appeared to improve viral RTIs across cohorts particulate in those with vitamin D deficiency. Among the evaluated dietary supplements, specific lactobacillus strains were used most commonly with selected prebiotics that showed potentially positive effects on the prevention and treatment of viral RTIs. Further, ginseng extract supplementation may effectively prevent viral RTIs as adjuvant therapy. However, longitudinal research is required to confirm these observations and address the optimal dose, duration, and safety of dietary supplements being publicly recommended.","Shokri-Mashhadi, Nafiseh; Kazemi, Maryam; Saadat, Saeed; Moradi, Sajjad",Expert Rev Respir Med,488,26

Most recently, studies on confirmed COVID-19 cases have suggested that mortality might be due to virally induced hyperinflammation. Uncontrolled pro-inflammatory states are often driven by continuous positive feedback loops between pro-inflammatory signaling and oxidative stress, which cannot be resolved in a targeted manner. Here, we report on the development of multidrug nanoparticles for the mitigation of uncontrolled inflammation. The nanoparticles are made by conjugating squalene, a natural lipid, to adenosine, an endogenous immunomodulator, and then encapsulating &#945;-tocopherol, as antioxidant. This resulted in high drug loading, biocompatible, multidrug nanoparticles. By exploiting the endothelial dysfunction at sites of acute inflammation, these multidrug nanoparticles delivered the therapeutic agents in a targeted manner, conferring survival advantage to treated animals in models of endotoxemia. Selectively delivering adenosine and antioxidants together could serve as a novel therapeutic approach for safe treatment of acute paradoxal inflammation.","Dormont, Flavio; Brusini, Romain; Cailleau, Catherine; Reynaud, Franceline; Peramo, Arnaud; Gendron, Amandine; Mougin, Julie; Gaudin, Françoise; Varna, Mariana; Couvreur, Patrick",Sci Adv,488,16

However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model.4S-DTencourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data.4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream class-decomposition mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has achieved an accuracy of 97.54% (95% CI: 96.22%, 98.91%) in the detection of COVID-19 cases on an extended test set enriched by augmented images, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.","Abbas, Asmaa; Abdelsamea, Mohammed M.; Gaber, Mohamed",,488,16

Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and phycocyanin (PC) concentrations were estimated for the Guarapiranga and Billings reservoirs, which supply daily water use for over 20 million people and receives treated wastewater. We employed field-calibrated Sentinel 2 MSI and Landsat 8 OLI images to map the spatial patterns of Chl-a and PC over the two periods: before the lockdown (April, August and October 2019) and after the lockdown in São Paulo (April 2020). We found a significant increase in algae pigments (Chl-a and PC) in both reservoirs in April 2020, compared to the same month of 2019. We show that the episodic algae blooming is strongly related to the increased inflows of the residential wastewater from the surrounding watersheds, because the household water use has increased ∼3.2% in April 2020, while the runoff into the reservoirs driven by the rainfall was much lower in 2020 compared to the previous year for the same month. In the case of Guarapiranga Reservoir, PC increased nearly 500% in April 2020 compared to April 2019. Given the importance of Billings and Guarapiranga reservoirs for the water supply of the Metropolitan Region of Sao Paulo (MRSP), the abrupt occurrence of cyanobacteria blooms related to the state’s lockdown should be considered a major concern for public and environmental health of the region. Although several environmental consequences have been reported due to the COVID-19 worldwide, this study is the first to report the impact of COVID-19 on the trophic state in the tropical reservoirs.","Alcantara, Enner Coimbra Keyla Ogashawara Igor Rodrigues Thanan Mantovani José Rotta Luiz Henrique Park Edward Fernandes Cunha Davi Gasparini",Remote Sensing Applications: Society and Environment,488,16

Efforts to synthesize the evidence reach seemingly discrepant conclusions. METHODS: Systematic evaluations of seroprevalence studies that had no restrictions based on country and which estimated either total number of people infected and/or aggregate IFRs were identified. Information was extracted and compared on eligibility criteria, searches, amount of evidence included, corrections/adjustments of seroprevalence and death counts, quantitative syntheses and handling of heterogeneity, main estimates and global representativeness. RESULTS: Six systematic evaluations were eligible. Each combined data from 10 to 338 studies (9-50 countries), because of different eligibility criteria. Two evaluations had some overt flaws in data, violations of stated eligibility criteria and biased eligibility criteria (eg excluding studies with few deaths) that consistently inflated IFR estimates. Perusal of quantitative synthesis methods also exhibited several challenges and biases. Global representativeness was low with 78%-100% of the evidence coming from Europe or the Americas; the two most problematic evaluations considered only one study from other continents. Allowing for these caveats, four evaluations largely agreed in their main final estimates for global spread of the pandemic and the other two evaluations would also agree after correcting overt flaws and biases. CONCLUSIONS: All systematic evaluations of seroprevalence data converge that SARS-CoV-2 infection is widely spread globally. Acknowledging residual uncertainties, the available evidence suggests average global IFR of ~0.15% and ~1.5-2.0 billion infections by February 2021 with substantial differences in IFR and in infection spread across continents, countries and locations.","Ioannidis, John P A",Eur J Clin Invest,488,26

Various techniques have been reported with some failure and complications. Here, we compare the feasibility and safety between electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic marking and computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous marking using indocyanine green (ICG) and iopamidol. METHODS: A total of 47 patients with small-sized pulmonary nodules, scheduled to undergo video-assisted thoracoscopic limited resection, were enrolled in this study. A mixture of diluted ICG and iopamidol was injected into the lung parenchyma as a marker, using CT-guided percutaneous or electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection techniques and the results were examined and compared. RESULTS: A total of 35 and 12 patients underwent preoperative marking by percutaneous injection and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection, respectively, in which a marker was detected in 33/35 (94.3%) and 12/12 (100%) patients. No combination of these procedures was performed in any patient. All markers were successfully detected in three patients who underwent injection marking at two different lesion sites. Pneumothorax occurred in five patients (14%) in the percutaneous marking group, which was relieved in all patients without the necessity for chest tube drainage. No other complication was observed in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection techniques using indocyanine green fluorescence plus iopamidol are safe and effective, and comparable with CT-guided localization. Furthermore, a bronchoscopic approach enables marking of multiple lesion areas without increasing patient risk, especially for puncture-related pneumothorax. KEY POINTS: SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS OF THE STUDY: Either computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous or electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopic injection techniques can be used for preoperative marking of pulmonary nodules with indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Indocyanine green (ICG) is a safe and easily detectable fluorescent marker for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Problems include reduced access to medical supplies (in particular, personal protective equipment and tests), budgetary shortfalls as a result of reduced tariffs and taxes, and a general decline in economic activity-leading, in many cases, to recessions, threats to social safety nets, and to increased precariousness of income, employment, and food security.

Emerging data from COVID-19 patients have suggested a clear role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2, the pathogenic agent of COVID-19. Several comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and aging, have been associated with an increase in baseline oxidative stress, likely explaining why such individuals at risk for poor outcomes with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, the concept of oxidative stress remains one of the best supported theories to explain the mechanism behind aging. Oxidative stress through both endogenous and exogenous sources has known deleterious effects in both aging and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Herein, we will review the role of oxidative stress as a key player in both aging and COVID-19 and highlight why some individuals may have better or poorer outcomes because of this. Additionally, we will discuss potential therapeutic pathways for effectively anti-aging as we take away from our learnings on COVID-19.","Zarbafian, Misha; Dayan, Steven; Fabi, Sabrina G",J. cosmet. dermatol,488,16

Due to lack of any definitive medicine or vaccine, treatment options are supportive of oxygenation, antiviral, antiretroviral drugs, antibiotics, fluid/ electrolyte, mechanical ventilation with ICU (Intensive Care Unit) support, and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine have been tried to fight this infection. However, mortality due to severe pneumonia, ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome), and multiorgan failure arising from the overactive immune response (storm) mediated by cytokines remains a treatment challenge in elderly and patients with severe medical comorbidities. Recently, anti-inflammatory, angiogenic, immune-modular, and healing properties of intravenous injections of culture derived stem cells have been proposed and shown to benefits in a small number of patients with severe COVID-19 infections. Based on previous experience with other viral infections, convalescent plasma, and serum transfusion are being used as a source of neutralizing antibody/factors to minimize the effects of inflammatory cytokines in this infection. Immunotherapy with purified monoclonal antibodies and conditioned serum with a mixture of unique cytokines are also being developed.

The aim of this rapid systematic review was to explore the association between recreational skiing and the spread of COVID-19. This review was conducted according to the WHO practical guidelines on rapid reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, MedRxiv and Promed-mail were screened to identify relevant scientific and grey literature published since the emergence of COVID-19. Among the 11 articles included, seven focused on cases recorded during the first epidemic wave, when COVID-19 containment measures were not yet mandatory. Most infection clusters could be directly linked to public gatherings which took place without the enforcement of restrictions.

Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear. METHODS: A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the ""fifth vital sign"" for any hospitalized patient.","Kesavadev, Jothydev; Misra, Anoop; Saboo, Banshi; Aravind, S R; Hussain, Akhtar; Czupryniak, Leszek; Raz, Itamar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,488,13

We specifically address the presence in RmYN02 and closely related RacCSxxx strains of a claimed natural PAA/PVA amino acid insertion at the S1/S2 junction of their spike protein at the same position where the PRRA insertion in SARS-CoV-2 has created a polybasic furin cleavage site. We show that RmYN02/RacCSxxx instead of the claimed insertion carry a 6-nucleotide deletion in the region and that the 12-nucleotide insertion in SARS-CoV-2 remains unique among Sarbecoviruses. Also, our analysis of RaTG13 and RmYN02's metagenomic datasets found unexpected reads which could indicate possible contamination.

High intensity aerobic exercise has been shown to enhance connectivity between basal ganglia nuclei and cortical areas, including the SMA. The aim of this project was to determine the effects of high intensity lower extremity exercise on motor control patterns underlying a manual dexterity task. METHODS: PD participants completed eight weeks of high intensity aerobic exercise under forced or voluntary exercise (FE or VE) modalities. Grasping forces for each limb were quantified during a functional bimanual dexterity task. Data were collected while OFF antiparkinsonian medication at baseline, end of treatment (EOT), and eight weeks after exercise cessation (EOT+8). RESULTS: Eight weeks of high intensity exercise improved MDS-UPDRS Motor III clinical ratings by more than 4 points (~15%) for the FE and VE groups. Time to complete the task decreased nearly 30% across both groups as well. The control and coordination of grasping forces, simultaneity of force initiation, and rate of grip and load force exhibited significant improvements following exercise. In general, improvements in biomechanical outcomes were sustained following exercise cessation. CONCLUSION: High intensity aerobic exercise, achieved via a forced or voluntary mode, improved PD symptoms and bimanual dexterity. Sustained improvement of upper extremity motor control following exercise cessation indicates high intensity exercise enhances CNS functioning and suggests exercise may be a candidate for altering PD progression.","Jansen, A Elizabeth; Koop, Mandy Miller; Rosenfeldt, Anson B; Alberts, Jay L",Parkinsonism Relat Disord,488,16

Moreover, cordycepin enhanced immunity, inhibited the proliferation of viral RNA, and suppressed cytokine storms, thereby suggesting its potential to treat COVID-19 and other viral infections. From the collected and reviewed information, this article provides the theoretical basis for the clinical applications of cordycepin and discusses the path for future studies focusing on expanding the medicinal use of cordycepin.

We sought to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy activity in France. METHODS: We performed a web-based survey, including 35 questions on the responders and their endoscopic practice, from 23 March to 27 March 2020, sent to the 3300 French gastroenterologists practicing endoscopy. RESULTS: 694 GI endoscopists (21â%) provided analyzable data; of these, 29.4â% (204/694) were involved in the management of COVID-19 patients outside the endoscopy department. During the study period, 98.7â% (685/694) of endoscopists had had to cancel procedures.

The filtration performance of five N95FFR models following long-term storage, removal of charge using isopropanol alcohol (IPA), autoclaving, or treatment with gamma-radiation was assessed using a TSI 8130 automated filter tester. Statistically significant differences were found in the penetration (P), pressure drop (Δp) and quality factor (qf) between non-expired and expired N95 models 3M-8210 and 3M-8511. A statistically significant linear correlation was also obtained between the N95 penetration ratio (PR) and the difference between year of manufacture and time of test (DYM). The PR of N95 was more strongly influenced by eliminating the charge (for extremely out-of-date respirators) on the electret filter than by the DYM. Sterilization by gamma irradiation increased the P into non-expired and expired N95FFR models (p &lt; 0.05), reducing their qf. The qfof all N95FFR models, except UVEX-3200, was strongly affected by gamma irradiation, the removal of charge using IPA, autoclaving, and storage in that order. All expired models maintained acceptable filtration performance and still could be used to collect aerosol effectively, even though models 3M-8511 and 3M-1860 had been manufactured up to 13 years previously. As the COVID-19 outbreaks in 2019 and is getting worse in 2020, these data are useful in developing a global stockpiling strategy to maximize the longevity of N95FFRs for public health and healthcare workers. However, the aging of the straps and seal materials (rubbers, plastics) of the N95FFRs may affect their fit factor and effectiveness.","Lin, Tzu-Hsien; Tseng, Chun-Chieh; Huang, Yu-Li; Lin, Hsiu-Chuan; Lai, Chane-Yu; Lee, Shu-An",Aerosol Air Qual.

They improve our understanding of the world we live in and help us navigate global challenges including emerging infectious diseases, climate change and the biodiversity crisis. For any scientist, whether they work primarily in fundamental knowledge generation or in the applied sciences, it is important to understand how science fits into a decision-making framework. Decision science is a field that aims to pinpoint evidence-based management strategies. It provides a framework for scientists to directly impact decisions or to understand how their work will fit into a decision process. Decision science is more than undertaking targeted and relevant scientific research or providing tools to assist policy makers; it is an approach to problem formulation, bringing together mathematical modelling, stakeholder values and logistical constraints to support decision making. In this paper we describe decision science, its use in different contexts, and highlight current gaps in methodology and application. The COVID-19 pandemic has thrust mathematical models into the public spotlight, but it is one of innumerable examples in which modelling informs decision making. Other examples include models of storm systems (eg. cyclones, hurricanes) and climate change. Although the decision timescale in these examples differs enormously (from hours to decades), the underlying decision science approach is common across all problems. Bridging communication gaps between different groups is one of the greatest challenges for scientists. However, by better understanding and engaging with the decision-making processes, scientists will have greater impact and make stronger contributions to important societal problems.","Baker, Christopher M.; Campbell, Patricia T.; Chades, Iadine; Dean, Angela J.; Hester, Susan M.; Holden, Matthew H.; McCaw, James M.; McVernon, Jodie; Moss, Robert; Shearer, Freya M.; Possingham, Hugh P.",,488,16

Extracellular Cyclophilin A is an emerging inflammatory mediator and metalloproteinase inducer, and the gene responsible for its expression has recently been linked to COVID-19 infection. OBJECTIVES: Here we explore the involvement of extracellular Cyclophilin A in the pathophysiology of ventilator-induced lung injury. METHODS: Mice were ventilated with low or high tidal volume for up to 3 hours, with or without blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling, and lung injury and inflammation were evaluated. Human primary alveolar epithelial cells were exposed to in vitro stretch to explore the cellular source of extracellular Cyclophilin A, and Cyclophilin A levels were measured in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, to evaluate clinical relevance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: High tidal volume ventilation in mice provoked a rapid increase in soluble Cyclophilin A levels in the alveolar space, but not plasma. In vivo ventilation and in vitro stretch experiments indicated alveolar epithelium as the likely major source. In vivo blockade of extracellular Cyclophilin A signalling substantially attenuated physiological dysfunction, macrophage activation and matrix metalloproteinases. Finally, we found that patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome showed markedly elevated levels of extracellular Cyclophilin A within bronchoalveolar lavage. CONCLUSIONS: Cyclophilin A is upregulated within the lungs of injuriously ventilated mice (and critically ill patients), where it plays a significant role in lung injury. Extracellular Cyclophilin A represents an exciting novel target for pharmacological intervention.","Koh, Marissa W; Baldi, Rhianna F; Soni, Sanooj; Handslip, Rhodri; Tan, Ying Ying; O039,; Dea, Kieran P; Malesevic, Miroslav; McAuley, Daniel F; Kane, Cecilia M; Patel, Brijesh V; Takata, Masao; Wilson, Michael R",Am. j. respir. crit. care med,488,25

METHOD: A cross-sectional mixed-method study design was used. Researchers (n=18) and patient-partners (n=9) were surveyed using the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET) in areas of: (1) communication/supports for participation; (2) sharing views/perspectives; (3) impacts/influence of engagement initiative; and (4) final thoughts/satisfaction. Descriptive statistics and an inductive thematic-based approach were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: For both study groups, high agreement, with responses largely ranging between 'agree' to 'strongly agree', was noted on all four sections of the PPEET. Qualitative reports reflected that patient engagement was important, meaningful, and had a significant impact on the quality of the project and on the professional development of researchers in their understanding and use of patient-oriented methodology. Patient-partners noted challenges related to having realistic deadlines in providing feedback and a lack of a broader range of representation among members. INTERPRETATION: The benefits and challenges of applying patient-oriented strategies to a multicentre trial were highlighted.

In contrast to initial reports, recent studies suggest that children are just as likely as adults to become infected with the virus but have fewer symptoms and less severe disease. In this review, we summarize the epidemiologic and clinical features of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 reported in pediatric case series to date. We also summarize the perinatal outcomes of neonates born to women infected with SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy. We found 11 case series including a total of 333 infants and children. Overall, 83% of the children had a positive contact history, mostly with family members. The incubation period varied between 2 and 25 days with a mean of 7 days. The virus could be isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions for up to 22 days and from stool for more than 30 days. Co-infections were reported in up to 79% of children (mainly mycoplasma and influenza). Up to 35% of children were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms were cough (48%; range 19%-100%), fever (42%; 11%-100%) and pharyngitis (30%; 11%-100%). Further symptoms were nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, tachypnoea, wheezing, diarrhea, vomiting, headache and fatigue. Laboratory test parameters were only minimally altered. Radiologic findings were unspecific and included unilateral or bilateral infiltrates with, in some cases, ground-glass opacities or consolidation with a surrounding halo sign. Children rarely needed admission to intensive care units (3%), and to date, only a small number of deaths have been reported in children globally. Nine case series and 2 case reports described outcomes of maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy in 65 women and 67 neonates. Two mothers (3%) were admitted to intensive care unit. Fetal distress was reported in 30% of pregnancies. Thirty-seven percent of women delivered preterm. Neonatal complications included respiratory distress or pneumonia (18%), disseminated intravascular coagulation (3%), asphyxia (2%) and 2 perinatal deaths. Four neonates (3 with pneumonia) have been reported to be SARS-CoV-2 positive despite strict infection control and prevention procedures during delivery and separation of mother and neonates, meaning vertical transmission could not be excluded.","Zimmermann, Petra; Curtis, Nigel",Pediatr Infect Dis J,488,23

However, a relatively high-energy (26 000-30 000 cm-1) M-to-M' charge transfer can be identified. One-electron oxidation is largely localized on the {M(C[triple bond, length as m-dash]CR)(PP)Cp'} fragment and gives rise to a new charge transfer band with bridging-ligand-to-{M(PP)Cp'}+ (M'(CO)xCp' = Fe(CO)2Cp) or M'-to-M(+) (M(CO)xCp' = W(CO)3Cp*) character. The localized electronic ground state of these complexes is better revealed through analysis of the IR spectra, taking advantage of the well-resolved &#957;(C[triple bond, length as m-dash]C) and &#957;(CO) bands and IR spectroelectrochemical methods, than through the more classical analysis based on the concepts of Marcus-Hush theory and analysis of the putative IVCT electronic transition.

At most, if at all, a slightly increased risk can be derived from the previous case reports. In general, the risk of acute facial palsy is described in association with many vaccinations. The risk, if any, does not appear to be a specific risk of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. On the other hand, cases of acute facial palsy as symptom of a COVID-19 disease have also been described, so that the theoretical question arises as to the extent to which the vaccination may prevent rather than promote the occurrence of facial palsy. Ultimately, if acted quickly, acute facial paralysis can be treated well and its severity and sequelae cannot be compared with the severity of a COVID-19 disease and its possible long-COVID sequelae.","Volk, Gerd Fabian; Kuttenreich, Anna-Maria; Geitner, Maren; Guntinas-Lichius, Orlando",Laryngorhinootologie,488,8

As a result, many cancer patients had their treatment deferred during the pandemic, increasing the time-to-treatment initiation, the number of untreated patients (which will alter the dynamics of healthcare delivery in the post-pandemic era) and increasing their risk of death. Hence, we analyzed the impact on global cancer mortality considering the decline in oncology care during the COVID-19 outbreak using head and neck cancer, a known time-dependent disease, as a model. METHODS: An online practical tool capable of predicting the risk of cancer patients dying due to the COVID-19 outbreak and also useful for mitigation strategies after the peak of the pandemic has been developed, based on a mathematical model. The scenarios were estimated by information of 15 oncological services worldwide, given a perspective from the five continents and also some simulations were conducted at world demographic data. RESULTS: The model demonstrates that the more that cancer care was maintained during the outbreak and also the more it is increased during the mitigation period, the shorter will be the recovery, lessening the additional risk of dying due to time-to-treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: This impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer patients is inevitable, but it is possible to minimize it with an effort measured by the proposed model.","Matos, Leandro L; Forster, Carlos Henrique Q; Marta, Gustavo N; Castro Junior, Gilberto; Ridge, John A; Hirata, Daisy; Miranda-Filho, Adalberto; Hosny, Ali; Sanabria, Alvaro; Gregoire, Vincent; Patel, Snehal G; Fagan, Johannes J; D039,; Cruz, Anil K; Licitra, Lisa; Mehanna, Hisham; Hao, Sheng-Po; Psyrri, Amanda; Porceddu, Sandro; Galloway, Thomas J; Golusinski, Wojciech; Lee, Nancy Y; Shiguemori, Elcio H; Matieli, José Elias; Shiguemori, Ana Paula A C; Diamantino, Letícia R; Schiaveto, Luiz Felipe; Leão, Lysia; Castro, Ana F; Carvalho, André Lopes; Kowalski, Luiz Paulo",Cancer Causes Control,488,20

In this extraordinary research context of the SARS CoV-2 pandemic, publishers are announcing that their coronavirus-related articles will be made immediately accessible in appropriate open repositories, like PubMed Central, agreeing upon funders' and researchers' instigation. Methods: This work uses Unpaywall, OpenRefine and PubMed to analyse the level of openness of articles about COVID-19, published during the first quarter of 2020. It also analyses Open Access (OA) articles published about previous coronavirus (SARS CoV-1 and MERS CoV) as a means of comparison. Results: A total of 5,611 COVID-19-related articles were analysed from PubMed. This is a much higher amount for a period of 4 months compared to those found for SARS CoV-1 and MERS during the first year of their first outbreaks (335 and 116 articles, respectively). Regarding the levels of openness, 88.8% of the SARS CoV-2 papers are freely available; similar rates were found for the other coronaviruses. Deeper analysis showed that (i) 67.4% of articles belong to an undefined Bronze category; (ii) 76.4% of all OA papers don't carry any license, followed by 10.4% which display restricted licensing. These patterns were found to be repeated in the three most frequent publishers: Elsevier, Springer and Wiley. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, although scientific production is much higher than during previous epidemics and is open, there is a caveat to this opening, characterized by the absence of fundamental elements and values ââon which Open Science is based, such as licensing.","Arrizabalaga, Olatz; Otaegui, David; Vergara, Itziar; Arrizabalaga, Julio; Méndez, Eva",F1000Res,488,16

The disease often manifests with flu-like symptoms and is dominated by pulmonary complications, but widely diverse clinical manifestations involving multiple organ systems can result. We posit that viral tropism and the aberrant host immune response mediate the protean findings and severity in this disease. In general, extrapulmonary manifestations are a harbinger of or contemporaneously associate with disease progression, but in the case of some extrapulmonary findings (GI and dermatologic), may track with milder disease. The precise underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain incompletely elucidated, and additional immune phenotyping studies are warranted to reveal early correlates of disease outcomes and novel therapeutic targets.

By focusing directly on masculinity as a social process, this analysis contributes to the broader literature on gender and leadership, unpacking the gendered double bind that leaders who identify as men must navigate in acknowledging and responding to risks. I examine the responses of Justin Trudeau and Donald Trump suggesting that their respective struggles to acknowledge and respond to the public health threat were not simply the result of a lack of available information to inform rational policy decisions. Acknowledging risk and taking measures to prevent rather than 'fight' are not culturally neutral, they are coded as feminine and 'weak'. Clearly, the delay in the response and subsequent spread of the virus in North America was not inevitable, other jurisdictions were able to respond more quickly. The masculinity double bind may have been one of the factors that undermined a prompt response in the increasingly macho context of North America.","Thomson, Kelly",Health Sociol Rev,488,11

AIM: Two disinfectants - BIAKOS antimicrobial skin and wound cleanser (AWC) and AWC2 (Sanara MedTech, Fort Worth, TX, USA) - were tested to determine whether they can inactivate SARS-CoV-2 upon contact or as a coating applied before contact with the virus. METHODS: The ability of AWC and AWC2 to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 was tested in liquid and dried form on plastic surfaces and porcine skin. FINDINGS: AWC and AWC2 were effective in reducing the infectious titre of SARS-CoV-2 in liquid form during application and in dried form 4 h after application. Virus on skin was reduced up to 2 log10-fold and 3.5 log10-fold after treatment with AWC and AWC2, respectively. CONCLUSION: Application of AWC and AWC2 to skin reduces the level of SARS-CoV-2 and the risk of infection.","Campos, R K; Mirchandani, D; Rafael, G; Saada, N; McMahon, R; Weaver, S C",J Hosp Infect,488,1

The kinetic description leads to study the evolution over time of Boltzmann-type equations describing the number densities of social contacts of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals, whose proportions are driven by a classical SIR-type compartmental model in epidemiology. Explicit calculations show that the spread of the disease is closely related to moments of the contact distribution. Furthermore, the kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to achieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a very large number of daily contacts. We conduct numerical simulations which confirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristic of the rapid spread of an epidemic. Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a last part is dedicated to fit numerical solutions of the proposed model with infection data coming from different European countries.","Dimarco, G; Perthame, B; Toscani, G; Zanella, M",J Math Biol,488,20

Grade of urgency of electroencephalography (EEG) may vary according to the clinical indication, setting, and status of infection of SARS-CoV-2 virus. ""Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology"" (SINC), ""Italian League Against Epilepsy"" (LICE), and the ""Italian Association of Neurophysiology Technologists"" (AITN) aimed to provide clinical and technical recommendation for EEG indications and recording standards in this pandemic era. METHODS: Presidents of SINC, LICE, and AITN endorsed three members per each society to formulate recommendations: classification of the degree of urgency of EEG clinical indications, management and behavior of physicians and neurophysiology technologists, hygiene and personal protection standards, and use of technical equipment. RESULTS: Scientific societies endorsed a paper conveying the recommendation for EEG execution in accordance with clinical urgency, setting (inpatients/outpatients), status of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection (positive, negative and uncertain), and phase of governmental restrictions (phase 1 and 2). Briefly, in phase 1, EEG was recommended only for those acute/subacute neurological symptoms where EEG is necessary for diagnosis, prognosis, or therapy. Outpatient examinations should be avoided in phase 1, while they should be recommended in urgent cases in phase 2 when they could prevent an emergency room access. Reduction of staff contacts must be encouraged through rescheduling job shifts. The use of disposable electrodes and dedicated EEG devices for COVID-19-positive patients are recommended. CONCLUSIONS: During the different phases of COVID-19 pandemic, the EEG should be reserved for patients really benefiting from its execution in terms of diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and avoidance of emergency room access.","Grippo, Antonello; Assenza, Giovanni; Scarpino, Maenia; Broglia, Lidia; Cilea, Rosalia; Galimberti, Carlo Andrea; Lanzo, Giovanni; Michelucci, Roberto; Tassi, Laura; Vergari, Maurizio; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Mecarelli, Oriano",Neurol Sci,488,16

The primary objective of the present study is to examine the role of doctor-patient communication and vaccination. We test the impact of doctor-patient communication on trust in doctors' vaccine recommendations as a mediator, to understand the mechanisms leading to positive vaccination attitudes, and ultimately leading to actual H1N1 vaccination behavior. We use data from a nationally representative U.S. sample from one of the Multimedia Audience Research Systems (MARS) data sets collected by Kantar Media. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of doctor-patient communication in building patients' trust in doctors, which in turn positively impact vaccination attitudes and H1N1 vaccination behavior. Unlike other preventive health measures, getting vaccines after a pandemic is a critical decision because these vaccines are previously unknown. Our finding implies that verified communication from the physician's office may be one of the effective strategies during or after a pandemic. Our findings have implications for public health organizations to incorporate effective vaccination communication and could have critical implications for the COVID-19 vaccination.","Borah, Porismita; Hwang, Juwon",Health Commun,488,15

Since both Influenza Like Illness (ILI) and COVID-19 case definitions overlap, we re-investigated the ILI cases using PCR for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in 739 nasopharyngeal swabs collected from November 2019 to March 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in 37 samples (5%) collected mostly during February 2020. It was followed by confirmation of evolutionary and spatial relationships using next generation sequencing (NGS). We observed that the overall incidence of ILI cases during 2019-2020 influenza season was considerably higher than previous years and was gradually replaced with SARS-CoV-2, which indicated a silent transmission among ambulatory patients. Sequencing of representative isolates confirmed independent introductions and silent transmission earlier than previously thought. Evolutionary and spatial analyses revealed clustering in the GH clade, characterized by three amino acid substitutions in spike gene (D614G), RdRp (P323L) and NS3 (Q57H). P323L causes conformational change near nsp8 binding site that might affect virus replication and transcription. In conclusion, assessment of the community transmission among patients with mild COVID-19 illness, particularly those without epidemiological link for acquiring the virus, is of utmost importance to guide policy makers to optimize public health interventions. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in ILI cases shows the importance of ILI surveillance systems and warrants its further strengthening to mitigate the ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The effect of NS3 substitutions on oligomerization or membrane channel function (intra- and extracellular) needs functional validation.","Alosaimi, Bandar; Naeem, Asif; Alghoribi, Majed F; Okdah, Lilian; Hamed, Maaweya E; AlYami, Ahmad S; Alotaibi, Athari; Enani, Mushira",Viruses,488,6

We hypothesize that changes in habits and medical care during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown might have worsened the clinical course of migraine. DESIGN: Retrospective survey study collecting online responses from migraine patients followed-up by neurologists at three tertiary hospitals between June and July 2020. METHODS: We used a web-based survey that included demographic data, clinical variables related with any headache (frequency) and migraine (subjective worsening, frequency, and intensity), lockdown, and symptoms of post-traumatic stress. RESULTS: The response rate of the survey was 239/324 (73.8%). The final analysis included 222 subjects. Among them, 201/222 (90.5%) were women, aged 42.5 ± 12.0 (mean±SD). Subjective improvement of migraine during lockdown was reported in 31/222 participants (14.0%), while worsening in 105/222 (47.3%) and was associated with changes in migraine triggers such as stress related to going outdoors and intake of specific foods or drinks. Intensity of attacks increased in 67/222 patients (30.2%), and it was associated with the subjective worsening, female sex, recent insomnia, and use of acute medication during a headache. An increase in monthly days with any headache was observed in 105/222 patients (47.3%) and was related to symptoms of post-traumatic stress, older age and living with five or more people. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately half the migraine patients reported worsening of their usual pain during the lockdown. Worse clinical course in migraine patients was related to changes in triggers and the emotional impact of the lockdown.","Gonzalez-Martinez, Alicia; Planchuelo-Gómez, Álvaro; Guerrero, Ángel L; García-Azorín, David; Santos-Lasaosa, Sonia; Navarro-Pérez, María Pilar; Odriozola-González, Paula; Irurtia, María Jesús; Quintas, Sonia; de Luis-García, Rodrigo; Gago-Veiga, Ana Beatriz",Pain med,488,16

In the last decade, these pts were treated with a new dose-dense, short-term therapy termed “CARMEN”, at several Italian Centers. Excellent efficacy and safety profile have been reported in HIV/AIDS pts with high-risk Burkitt lymphoma (BL) [Ferreri et al. BJH 2021], but its efficacy in pts with high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC rearrangement (HGBCL) remains to be defined. Herein, we report a retrospective series of consecutive pts with BL or HGBCL treated with CARMEN regimen. Methods: Either HIV-negative and HIV-positive pts aged 18-80 years with BL or HGBCL and MYC rearrangement positive by FISH were treated with CARMEN regimen, which includes a single 36-day induction course of sequential doses of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, rituximab, methotrexate, VP16, and doxorubicin plus intrathecal chemotherapy, followed by consolidation with HD-cytarabine ± cisplatin. Pts who did not achieve complete remission (CR) after induction received BEAM/ASCT after consolidation. Results: 63 pts (22 HGBCL;41 BL) received the CARMEN regimen (Table). Treatment was well tolerated: 56 (89%) pts completed the induction, and 55 (87%) completed the consolidation. G4 hematological toxicity during induction was neutropenia in 48 (76%) pts, thrombocytopenia in 24 (38%) and anemia in 7 (11%), which were recorded after consolidation in 34 (62%), 38 (69%) and 1 (2%) pt, respectively. G4 non hematological toxicity was uncommon: mucositis in 4 (6%) pts and tumor lysis syndrome in 1 (2%) during induction, and heart failure and bleeding in 1 (2%) pt each after consolidation. G4 infections were recorded in 4 (6%) pts during induction and in 2 (3%) after consolidation. Induction and consolidation doses were reduced in 6 (9%) and 4 (7%) pts, respectively. Seven HGBCL and 9 BL pts received ASCT, with expected tolerability. 4 HGBCL and 2 BL pts died of toxicity (sepsis in 4;respiratory failure;COVID-19), with a TRM of 9%. After induction, 18 (82%) HGBCL and 37 (90%) BL pts achieved a response, which was CR in 10 (45%) and 26 (63%) pts, respectively. After the whole treatment, 15 (68%) HGBCL pts and 32 (78%) BL pts achieved a CR, and, at a median follow-up of 54 (2-131) months, 15 (100%) HGBCL and 29 (91%) BL pts remain relapse-free, with a 5-yr PFS of 67% and 70%, respectively. 15 HGBCL and 32 BL pts are alive, with a 5-yr OS of 66% and 77%, respectively. HIV seropositivity did not modify outcome. Age and LDH level were independently associated with OS. Conclusions: With the limitations of a retrospective series, this study shows that CARMEN is a safe and active treatment both in HIVnegative and-positive pts with HGBCL and MYC rearrangement and BL. Survival figures in HGBCL pts compare favorably with results reported with R-CHOP or analogous, and are similar to those achieved in BL pts.","Ferreri, A. J.

hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction This manuscript presents the analysis of Google Trends meta-data and shows a marked spike in search volume for chest pain that is strongly correlated with COVID-19 case numbers in the United States This raises a concern that fear of contracting COVID-19 may be leading patients to self-triage using internet searches Research Letter During the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians worldwide have noted reductions in hospital admissions for emergencies including acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (1)(,)(2) Several explanations have been proposed including reduced air pollution, changes in diet and lifestyle, or, most worryingly, avoidance of hospitals to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection (3) There is significant concern that instead of presenting to hospital, fear of COVID-19 has led patients to self-triage using internet searches Google Trends™ is a free publicly available tool that monitors how often search items are queried over time and provides insights into public health behavior Recommendations for the documentation of Google Trends™ analyses have previously been published(4) and were consulted to facilitate reproducibility of the present study We quantified searches in the United States (US) for the symptom of interest, chest pain, and the control terms toothache, abdominal pain, knee pain, heart attack and stroke (time period 1st Jan 2017 to 24th May 2020, accessed 28th May 2020, no quotation marks, no combination symbols, all query categories) Data on the number of COVID-19 cases per day in the US was retrieved from USAFacts org, which collates data from government agencies and is used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Time-lag correlation analysis was performed using R To assess the relationship between chest pain searches and COVID-19 caseload, data on search volume was also collected for the states with the highest and lowest numbers of COVID-19 cases No extramural funding was used to support this work The number of cases of COVID-19 in the US rose rapidly throughout March 2020 and during the same month the relative search frequency of the symptom chest pain, but not the control terms, nearly doubled compared to the previous three years (Figure 1A) There was a strong correlation between the number of new COVID-19 cases and Google search queries for chest pain (Pearson correlation coefficient 0 79 with 18-day time-lag) (Figure 1B) The search volume for chest pain also spiked in the states with the three highest (New York, New Jersey, Illinois), but not the three lowest (Hawaii, Montana, Alaska), COVID-19 caseloads (Figure 2) In this analysis we describe a strong correlation between the increase in COVID-19 cases and the utilization of Google for medical information Chest pain is a common presenting symptom of life-threatening medical conditions including coronary artery disease, aortic dissection and pulmonary embolus, but is not a common symptom of COVID-19 (5) The analysis presented here suggests that the rise in COVID-19 cases has led patients to seek medical information about their symptoms from the internet at substantially higher rates compared to the previous three years This does not appear to be due to generally increased search volumes nor seasonal variation (Figure 1) Within the US this was observed in states with a high prevalence of COVID-19 but not states with a low prevalence (Figure 2) This was despite all analyzed states instituting stay-at-home orders, which suggests this phenomenon is not related to lockdown restrictions This raises a significant concern that in regions where caseloads are high, fear of contracting COVID-19 may be leading patients to self-triage, potentially in lieu of presenting to hospital The rise in search volume for 'chest pain' but not 'heart attack' or 'stroke' may be explained by several hypotheses, including patients being more likely to search for symptoms rather than diagnoses, or it may reflect the reduced hospitalisations for these conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic and hence fewer patients receiving the diagnostic labels 'heart attack' and 'stroke' Indeed it was recently reported that the rate of catheter laboratory activation for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction has decreased by 38% in the US compared to the pre-COVID-19 period,(1) and there have been similar reductions in hospital presentations for other life-threatening conditions such as acute aortic dissection (6) This has been accompanied by a concurrent increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests(7) and, amongst patients that did present to hospital with acute myocardial infarction, increased rates of delayed presentation and complications (8) While COVID-19 has a mortality of approximately 1%,(9) acute myocardial infarction in the absence of contemporary treatment has a one-month mortality of up to 50% (10) As lockdown regulations begin to relax worldwide there is a significant risk of a second-wave of COVID-19, and so it is critical to re-emphasize to patients that internet searches are not an alternative to professional medical attention","Ciofani, J.

Conventionally, fixed air filters are not used as a key pandemic prevention method for public indoor spaces because they are unable to trap the airborne pathogens in time in the entire room. However, by combining the mobility of a robot with air filtration, the efficacy of cleaning up the air around multiple people is largely increased. A disinfection co-robot prototype is thus developed to provide continuous and occupant-friendly protection to people gathering indoors, specifically for students in a classroom scenario. In a static classroom with students sitting in a grid pattern, the mobile robot is able to serve up to 14 students per cycle while reducing the worst-case pathogen dosage by 20%, and with higher robustness compared to a static filter. The extent of robot protection is optimized by tuning the passing distance and speed, such that a robot is able to serve more people given a threshold of worst-case dosage a person can receive.","Yang, Haoguang; Balakuntala, Mythra V.; Moser, Abigayle E.; Quinones, Jhon J.; Doosttalab, Ali; Esquivel-Puentes, Antonio; Purwar, Tanya; Castillo, Luciano; Mahmoudian, Nina; Voyles, Richard M.",,488,13

There is an urge to manufacture a greater number of masks to prevent any aerosol with microbes. Hence, we aim to develop an efficient viral inactivation system by exploiting active compounds from naturally occurring medicinal plants and infusing them into nanofiber-based respiratory masks. Our strategy is to develop fibrous filtration with three-layered masks using the compounds from medicinal plants for viral deactivation. These masks will be beneficial not just to healthcare workers but common citizens as well. In the absence of vaccination, productive masks can be worn to prevent transmission of airborne pathogenic aerosols and control diseases.","Balachandar, V; Mahalaxmi, I; Kaavya, J; Vivekanandhan, G; Ajithkumar, S; Arul, N; Singaravelu, G; Senthil Kumar, N; Mohana Dev, S",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,488,16

The objective is to determine whether in the care of vulnerable patients, to succeed against COVID-19, multiple public health tools and interventions will be needed to minimize morbidity and mortality. The study is a prospective cohort investigation of patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19, who required to any of the Health Centers response from April 8, 2020, to August 18, 2020. In Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA), April 8, 2020 the virus was identified in patients hospitalized in the ""Southeast Network"" (SN), AMBA. SN covering an area of 661 square kilometers, with 1.8 million inhabitants residing in urban, and rural areas. A total of 14 health centers with different levels of care complexity provide care to patients in the region. The information of each patient with COVID-19 evaluated by SN, was incorporated in an Epidemiological Dashboard. The investigation was designed and reported with consideration of observational studies in epidemiology. We describe the hospitals presentation and care of persons who required SN response and were ultimately diagnosed with COVID-19. From April 8, 2020, to August 18, 2020, were included 1495 patients with lab-confirmed COVID-19 in SN. A total of 58% patients were men, and the mean age (SD) was 48.9 (15.59) years. Eighty one percent patients with pre-existing diseases, most frequent hypertension and diabetes, but hypertension, chronic lung disease, and cardiovascular disease presented higher risk. A total of 13% were hospitalized in Intensive Therapy Unit. The mortality of the cohort was 9.77%. Mortality was higher for patients aged 65 or more (OR 5.09), and for those had some pre-existing disease (OR 2.61). Our observations are consistent with reports demonstrating older persons, and those with comorbidities have the highest risk of mortality related to COVID-19. However, unlike other reports from developed or some developing countries, the mortality in our study is lower. This finding may be related to age of our cohort is younger than other published. Also, the health system was able to respond to the demand.","Yacobitti, A; Otero, L; Doldan Arrubarrena, V; Arano, J; Lage, S; Silberman, M; Zubieta, M; Erbetta, I; Danei, P; Baeck, G; Vallejos, V; Cavalli, F; Calderón, N; Di Gregorio, M; Hernandez, V; Bruno, D; Rodera, B; Macherett, I; Parisi, M; Gallastegui, M; Paz, A; Bernardi, R; Azcárate, S; Hraste, A; Caridi, I; Boechi, L; Salgado, P; Kochen, S",Sci Rep,488,16

Looking back in history, airborne transimission diseases have caused huge casualties several times. COVID-19 as a typical airborne disease caught our attention and reminded us of the importance of preventing such diseases. Therefore, this study focuses on finding a new way to guard against the spread of these diseases such as COVID-19. This paper studies the dynamic electromechanical response of metal-core piezoelectric fiber/epoxy matrix composites, designed as mass load sensors for virus detection, by numerical modelling. The dynamic electromechanical response is simulated by applying an alternating electric current field to make the composite vibrate. Furthermore, both concentrated and distributed loads are considered to assess the sensitivity of the biosensor during modelling of the combination of both biomarker and viruses. The design parameters of this sensor, such as the resonant frequency, the position and size of the biomarker, will be studied and optimized as the key values to determine the sensitivity of detection. The novelty of this work is to propose functional composites that can detect the viruses from changes of the output voltage instead of the resonance frequency change using piezoelectric sensor and piezoelectric actuator. The contribution of this detection method is that it does not require fast Fourier transform (FFT) or discrete Fourier transform (DFT) analysis and will shorten the detection time. The outcome of this research offers a reliable numerical model to optimize the design of the proposed biosensor for virus detection, which will contribute to the production of high-performance piezoelectric biosensors in the future.","Wang, Yinli; Shi, Yu; Narita, Fumio",Sens Actuators A Phys,488,24

However, researchers around the globe are working hard to find a solution e.g. synthetic vaccine. Here, we have performed genome-wide analysis of 566 Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes to extract the potential conserved regions for identifying peptide based synthetic vaccines, viz. epitopes with high immunogenicity and antigenicity. In this regard, different multiple sequence alignment techniques are used to align the SARS-CoV-2 genomes separately. Subsequently, consensus conserved regions are identified after finding the conserved regions from each aligned result of alignment techniques. Further, the consensus conserved regions are refined considering that their lengths are greater than or equal to 60nt and their corresponding proteins are devoid of any stop codons. Subsequently, their specificity as query coverage are verified using Nucleotide BLAST. Finally, with these consensus conserved regions, T-cell and B-cell epitopes are identified based on their immunogenic and antigenic scores which are then used to rank the conserved regions. As a result, we have ranked 23 consensus conserved regions that are associated with different proteins. This ranking also resulted in 34 MHC-I and 37 MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes with 16 and 19 unique HLA alleles and 29 B-cell epitopes. After ranking, the consensus conserved region from NSP3 gene is obtained that is highly immunogenic and antigenic. In order to judge the relevance of the identified epitopes, the physico-chemical properties and binding conformation of the MHC-I and MHC-II restricted T-cell epitopes are shown with respect to HLA alleles.","Ghosh, Nimisha; Sharma, Nikhil; Saha, Indrajit; Saha, Sudipto",Int Immunopharmacol,488,1

Therefore, many methods are offered to fight against Covid-19. In this paper, a novel fuzzy tree classification approach was introduced for Covid-19 detection. Since Covid-19 disease is similar to pneumonia, three classes of data sets such as Covid-19, pneumonia, and normal chest x-ray images were employed in this study. A novel machine learning model, which is called the exemplar model, is presented by using this dataset. Firstly, fuzzy tree transformation is applied to each used chest image, and 15 images (3-level F-tree is constructed in this work) are obtained from a chest image. Then exemplar division is applied to these images. A multi-kernel local binary pattern (MKLBP) is applied to each exemplar and image to generate features. Most valuable features are selected using the iterative neighborhood component (INCA) feature selector. INCA selects the most distinctive 616 features, and these features are forwarded to 16 conventional classifiers in five groups. These groups are decision tree (DT), linear discriminant (LD), support vector machine (SVM), ensemble, and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN). The best-resulted classifier is Cubic SVM, and it achieved 97.01% classification accuracy for this dataset.","Tuncer, Turker; Ozyurt, Fatih; Dogan, Sengul; Subasi, Abdulhamit",Chemometr Intell Lab Syst,488,23

The shortage of personal protective equipment, including N95 respirators, in hospital facilities has put frontline healthcare professionals at high risk for contracting this virus. AIM: To develop a reproducible and safe N95 respirator reprocessing method that satisfies all presented regulatory standards and that can be directly implemented by hospitals using existing available equipment. METHODS: A non-toxic gravity steam reprocessing method has been developed for the reuse of N95 respirators consisting of 30 min of steam treatment at 121°C followed by 30 min of heat drying. Samples of model number 1860, 1860s, 1870+, and 9105 N95 respirators were either collected from hospitals (for microbiology testing) or purchased new (for functionality testing), with all functionality tests (i.e. filter efficiency, fit evaluation, and strap integrity) performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention using standard procedures established by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. FINDINGS: All tested models passed the minimum filter efficiency of 95% after three cycles of gravity steam reprocessing. The 1870+ N95 respirator model is the most promising model for reprocessing based on its efficient bacterial inactivation coupled with the maintenance of all other key functional respirator properties after multiple reprocessing steps. CONCLUSIONS: The gravity steam method can effectively reprocess N95 respirators over at least three reprocessing cycles without negatively impacting the functionality requirements set out by regulators. Enabling the reuse of N95 respirators is a crucial tool for managing both the current pandemic and future healthcare crises.","Aljabo, A; Mueller, E; Abdul-Azeez, D; Hoare, T; Jain, A",J Hosp Infect,488,6

Elevations in serum IL-6 concentrations in patients with severe COVID-19 have led to renewed interest in the cytokine as a therapeutic target. However, although the pro-inflammatory properties of IL-6 are widely known, the cytokine also has a series of important physiological and anti-inflammatory functions. An adequate understanding of the complex processes by which IL-6 signalling occurs is crucial for the correct interpretation of IL-6 concentrations in the blood or lung, the use of IL-6 as a critical care biomarker, or the design of effective anti-IL-6 strategies. Here, we outline the role of IL-6 in health and disease, explain the different types of IL-6 signalling and their contribution to the net biological effect of the cytokine, describe the approaches to IL-6 inhibition that are currently available, and discuss implications for the future use of treatments such as tocilizumab in the critical care setting.","McElvaney, Oliver J; Curley, Gerard F; Rose-John, Stefan; McElvaney, Noel G",Lancet Respir.

Decision making is particularly hazardous when we have poor evidence to guide us and face unpredictable outcomes. Mainstream leadership theories are of little help, since an environment of radical uncertainty means that leaders have less information, expertise and resources to guide them than is often assumed. Undaunted, populist leaders exploit uncertainty to suggest that simple solutions will work. I suggest that the responses of such leaders have been characterised by incompetent leadership, denialist leadership, panic leadership, othering leadership and authoritarian leadership. I also consider the implications of the crisis for business leadership, suggesting that already strained relationships within organisations are likely to deteriorate still further. Critical leadership studies has an important contribution to make in challenging self-serving theories of business that have come to guide much leadership decision-making. We have an opportunity to do research that really matters, and participate in vital conversations about how the theory and practice of leadership can contribute to better outcomes from the coronavirus crisis, and others still to come.","Tourish, Dennis",Leadership,488,24

There was an increase in opiate assessments and a reduction in alcohol assessments. There was no overall increase in mortality. There was minor deviation from national guidance when it was initially published. Conclusions: The services were well equipped to respond to the rapid changes demanded during early lockdown. Reduced restrictions in OST may not be associated with negative service or patient outcomes.

The ICM is density-stratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the cluster and decreasing radially outwards. As a result of this, Kolmogorov (homogeneous, isotropic) turbulence theory does not apply to the ICM. The gas motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number ($\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$). These turbulent motions are associated with density and pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray surface brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ) fluctuations, respectively. In order to advance our understanding of the relations between these fluctuations and the turbulent gas velocities, we have conducted 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of stratified turbulence ($256^2\times 384$---$1024^2\times1536$ resolution elements), in which we scan the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), $\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$, and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights ($R_{PS}=H_P/H_S$), relevant to the ICM. We develop a new scaling relation between the standard deviation of logarithmic density fluctuations ($\sigma_s$, where $s=\ln(\rho/\left<\rho\right>)$), $\mathcal{M}$, and $\mathrm{Fr}_{\perp}$, valid till $\mathrm{Fr}_\perp\ll1$:~$\sigma_s^2=\ln\left(1+b^2\mathcal{M}^4+0.10/(\mathrm{Fr}_\perp+0.25/\sqrt{\mathrm{Fr}_\perp})^2\mathcal{M}^2R_{PS}\right)$, where $b\sim1/3$ for solenoidal turbulence driving studied here.

Previously, the prevalence of burnout among Dutch intensivists was found to be low. Engagement and resilience among intensivists have not previously been studied quantitatively, however, both are related to burnout and provide a possible way to mitigate burnout. Our objective was to study burnout and its association with work engagement and resilience among Dutch intensivists in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: An online questionnaire was sent to all Dutch intensivists. The questionnaire consisted of questions on personal and work-related characteristics and validated questionnaires: the Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Resilience Evaluation Scale. RESULTS: The response rate was 27.2% with 162 evaluable responses. Thirteen respondents (8.0%) were classified as having burnout, 63 (38.9%) respondents were reporting high work engagement. Burnout was found to be negatively associated with both work engagement and resilience. CONCLUSION: In the aftermath of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis, we found a raised prevalence of burnout among intensivists, however this is still low in international comparisons.

We compared the baseline characteristics and in-hospital mortality between hypertensive patients taking RAS inhibitors (N=355) versus non-RAS inhibitors (N=827). Of the 1,182 hypertensive patients (median age 68 years, 49.1% male), 12/355 (3.4%) patients died in the RAS inhibitors group vs. 95/827 (11.5%) patients in the non-RAS inhibitors group (p<0.0001). Adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 0.28 (95% CI 0.15-0.52, p<0.0001) at 45 days in the RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. Similar findings were observed when patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (N=289) or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (N=66) were separately compared with non-RAS inhibitors group. The RAS inhibitors group compared with non-RAS inhibitors group had lower levels of C-reactive protein (median 13.5 vs. 24.4 pg/mL; p=0.007) and interleukin-6 (median 6.0 vs. 8.5 pg/mL; p=0.026) on admission. The protective effect of RAS inhibitors on mortality was confirmed in a meta-analysis of published data when our data were added to previous studies (odd ratio 0.44, 95% CI 0.29-0.65, p<0.0001). Conclusions In a large single center retrospective analysis we observed a protective effect of pre-hospitalization use of RAS inhibitors on mortality in hypertensive COVID-19 patients; which might be associated with reduced inflammatory response.","Chen, Chen; Wang, Feng; Chen, Peng; Jiang, Jiangang; Cui, Guanglin; Zhou, Ning; Moroni, Francesco; Moslehi, Javid J; Ammirati, Enrico; Wang, Dao Wen",J Am Heart Assoc,488,20

Though behavioral health disorders can be successfully mitigated with early implementation of evidence-based parent management strategies, education for pediatric residents on behavioral health anticipatory guidance has been limited to date, with training challenges compounded by the physical distancing requirements of the COVID-19 pandemic. Virtual reality (VR) simulations provide an opportunity to train residents on this complex competency by allowing deliberate practice of necessary skills while adhering to current social distancing guidelines. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the usability of a VR-based behavioral health anticipatory guidance curriculum for pediatric residents. METHODS: This mixed methods study included 14 postgraduate third-year pediatric residents who completed the behavioral health anticipatory guidance VR curriculum. Residents completed the MEC Spatial Presence Questionnaire to assess immersion in the virtual environment. Semistructured interviews were used to elucidate residents' perspectives on the curriculum's content and format. The interviews were analyzed using conventional content analysis. RESULTS: Quantitatively, residents reported a high degree of immersion, spatial presence, and cognitive involvement. Most residents (11/14, 79%) agreed or strongly agreed that it seemed as though they took part in the action of the simulation. Qualitatively, two themes emerged from the data: (1) the curriculum expands behavioral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing knowledge and skills and (2) VR technology is uniquely positioned to develop competence. These themes revealed that the curriculum expanded their current level of knowledge and skill, addressed training gaps, and was applicable to all residents. Additionally, residents experienced VR as immersive, feasible, realistic to the clinic setting, and a safe space to practice and learn new skills. CONCLUSIONS: Pilot data indicates that VR may be an effective tool to teach pediatric residents behavioral health anticipatory guidance, meeting a current gap in medical education training. This VR curriculum is particularly relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic given the increased behavioral health concerns of families.","Herbst, Rachel; Rybak, Tiffany; Meisman, Andrea; Whitehead, Monica; Rosen, Brittany; Crosby, Lori E; Klein, Melissa D; Real, Francis J",JMIR Pediatr Parent,488,24

This global emergency requires specific efforts by any discipline that regards specific problems which need to be solved urgently. The characteristic airborne diffusion patterns of COVID-19 shows that the airborne presence of viruses depends on multiple factors which include the dimension of microdroplets emitted by a contagious person, the atmospheric temperature and humidity, the presence of atmospheric particulate and pollution, which may act as a transport vehicle for the virus. The pandemic diffusion shows a particular correlation with the air quality and levels of atmospheric pollution. Specific problems need to solved to understand better the virus, its reliability, diffusion, replication, how it attacks the persons and the conditions, which drives to both positive and deadly evolution of the illness. Most of these problems may benefit from the contribution from both heat and mass transfer and the unsteady thermodynamics of living systems which evolves according to constructal law.

From a cohort including 3060 patients with confirmed COVID-19, 109 (3.4%) cancer patients were included in this study. Among them, 23 (21.1%) patients died in the hospital. Cancer patients, especially those with hematological malignancies (41.6%), urinary carcinoma (35.7%), malignancies of the digestive system (33.3%), gynecological malignancies (20%), and lung cancer (14.3%), had a much higher mortality than patients without cancer.

So, far, millions of people are infected with the virus across the length and breadth of the world with thousand losing their lives each passing day. The WHO in February 2020 classified the virus as a coronavirus and the name Coronavirus-19 (CoV-19) was offered to the virus. The disease caused by the virus was termed coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is associated with elevation of several immune plays as well as inflammatory factors which contributes to cytokine storms. Currently, the detection of CoV-19 RNA is through reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of suppressing several kinds of cytokines via the paracrine secretion system. Therefore, MSCs therapy could be game charges in the treatment of the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, intravenous IG may be capable of suppressing the high expression of IL-6 by the CoV-19 resulting in lessen disease burden. Anti-inflammatory medications like, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, glycyrrhetinic acid, as well as etoposide may be very advantageous in decreasing the COVID-19 burden because, their mode of action targets the cytokine storms initiated by the CoV-19. It is important to indicate that, these medication does not target the virus itself. Therefore, potent CoV-19 anti-viral medications are needed to completely cure patients with COVID-19. Also, a vaccine is urgently needed to stop the spread of the virus. This review therefore elucidates the immune players in the management of COVID-19; focusing principally on MSCs and inflammatory mediators.","Richard, Seidu A; Kampo, Sylvanus; Sackey, Marian; Hechavarria, Maite Esquijarosa; Buunaaim, Alexis D B; Kuugbee, Eugene Dogkotenge; Anabah, Thomas Winsum",Current stem cell research &amp; therapy (Online),488,26

DESIGN: Multicenter, prospective, observational study. SETTING: 78 centers participating in the Spanish COVID19 Registry. PATIENT(S): 1,347 pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 positive results registered consecutively between February 26 and November 5, 2020. INTERVENTION(S): The patients' information was collected from their medical records, and multivariable regression analyses were performed, controlling for maternal age and the clinical presentation of the infection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Obstetrics and neonatal outcomes, pregnancy comorbidities, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation need, and medical conditions. RESULT(S): The IVF group included 74 (5.5%) women whereas the spontaneous pregnancy group included 1,275 (94.5%) women. The operative delivery rate was high in all patients, especially in the IVF group, where cesarean section became the most frequent method of delivery (55.4%, compared with 26.1% of the spontaneous pregnancy group). The reason for cesarean section was induction failure in 56.1% of the IVF patients.

To this end, we develop a novel feedback control method for data-driven decision-making to identify optimal levels of NPIs across geographical regions in order to guarantee that hospitalizations will not exceed a given risk tolerance. Results are shown for the state of Colorado, and they suggest that: coordination in decision-making across regions is essential to maintain the daily number of hospitalizations below the desired limits; increasing risk tolerance can decrease the number of days required to discontinue NPIs, at the cost of an increased number of deaths; and if vaccination uptake is less than 70\%, at most levels of risk tolerance, return to pre-pandemic contact behaviors before the early months of 2022 may newly jeopardize the healthcare system.","Bianchin, Gianluca; Dall'Anese, Emiliano; Poveda, Jorge I.; Jacobson, David; Carlton, Elizabeth J.; Buchwald, Andrea G.",,488,12

We aimed to compare projected COVID-19 mortality under four different strategies for the prioritisation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. METHODS: We developed a coupled social-epidemiological model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in which social and epidemiological dynamics interact with one another. We modelled how population adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions responds to case incidence. In the model, schools and workplaces are also closed and reopened on the basis of reported cases. The model was parameterised with data on COVID-19 cases and mortality, SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence, population mobility, and demography from Ontario, Canada (population 14·5 million). Disease progression parameters came from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological literature. We assumed a vaccine with 75% efficacy against disease and transmissibility. We compared vaccinating those aged 60 years and older first (oldest-first strategy), vaccinating those younger than 20 years first (youngest-first strategy), vaccinating uniformly by age (uniform strategy), and a novel contact-based strategy. The latter three strategies interrupt transmission, whereas the first targets a vulnerable group to reduce disease. Vaccination rates ranged from 0·5% to 5% of the population per week, beginning on either Jan 1 or Sept 1, 2021. FINDINGS: Case notifications, non-pharmaceutical intervention adherence, and lockdown undergo successive waves that interact with the timing of the vaccine programme to determine the relative effectiveness of the four strategies. Transmission-interrupting strategies become relatively more effective with time as herd immunity builds. The model predicts that, in the absence of vaccination, 72 000 deaths (95% credible interval 40 000-122 000) would occur in Ontario from Jan 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, and at a vaccination rate of 1·5% of the population per week, the oldest-first strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 90·8% on average (followed by 89·5% in the uniform, 88·9% in the contact-based, and 88·2% in the youngest-first strategies). 60 000 deaths (31 000-108 000) would occur from Sept 1, 2021, to March 14, 2025, in the absence of vaccination, and the contact-based strategy would reduce COVID-19 mortality by 92·6% on average (followed by 92·1% in the uniform, 91·0% in the oldest-first, and 88·3% in the youngest-first strategies) at a vaccination rate of 1·5% of the population per week. INTERPRETATION: The most effective vaccination strategy for reducing mortality due to COVID-19 depends on the time course of the pandemic in the population. For later vaccination start dates, use of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to interrupt transmission might prevent more deaths than prioritising vulnerable age groups.

It is vital to know the characteristics of its users in order to be able to meet their needs and understand the coverage of this service in a context where there is reduced accessibility to the health system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to analyze the profile of the citizens who use the eConsulta tool and the reasons for their use, as well as to gain an understanding of the elements that characterize their decision to use it while distinguishing between those who used it before and those who have used it since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A descriptive, observational study based on administrative data was performed. This study differentiates between the COVID-19 pandemic era and the period preceding it, considering the day the state of emergency was declared in Spain (ie, March 12, 2020) as the cut-off point. It also differentiates between eConsulta users who send messages and those who only receive them. RESULTS: During the pandemic, the number of unique users of this teleconsultation service had almost tripled, with up to 33.10 visits per 1000 inhabitants per month reported in the first three months. For the two user profiles analyzed, most users since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak were predominantly female, systematically younger, more actively employed, and with less complex pathologies. Furthermore, eConsulta users received more messages proactively from the health professionals. There was also a relative decrease in the number of conversations initiated by higher-income urban users and an increase in conversations initiated by users in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has helped to generalize the use of telemedicine as a tool to compensate, to some extent, for the decline in face-to-face visits, especially among younger citizens in Catalonia. Telemedicine has made it possible to maintain contact between citizens and the health care system in the context of maximum complexity.","Solans, Oscar; Vidal-Alaball, Josep; Roig Cabo, Pasqual; Mora, Núria; Coma, Ermengol; Bonet Simó, Josep Maria; Hermosilla Pérez, Eduardo; Saigí-Rubió, Francesc; Olmos Domínguez, Carmen; Piera-Jiménez, Jordi; Abizanda González, Mercè; López Seguí, Francesc",J Med Internet Res,488,11

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of vedolizumab (VDZ), a gut-selective anti-integrin, on COVID-19 outcomes in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for IBD (SECURE-IBD), an international registry of IBD patients with confirmed COVID-19, we studied the impact of VDZ on COVID-19 hospitalization and severe COVID-19 (intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation and/or death). RESULTS: Of 3,647 adult patients on any IBD medication in the registry, 457 (12.5%) patients were on VDZ. On multivariable analyses using backward selection of covariates, VDZ use was not associated with hospitalization or severe COVID-19 when comparing to patients on all other medications [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.87; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71, 1.1 and aOR 0.95; 95% CI 0.53; 1.73, respectively]. On comparing VDZ monotherapy to anti-TNF monotherapy, the odds for hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, were higher (aOR CI 1.39; 95% CI 1.001, 1.90 and aOR 2.92; 95% CI 0.98, 8.71, respectively). In an exploratory analysis, VDZ monotherapy, compared to anti-TNF monotherapy, was associated with new-onset GI symptoms at the time of COVID-19, especially among patients whose IBD was in remission. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 outcomes among IBD patients on VDZ are comparable to those on all other therapies. Hospitalization, but not severe COVID-19, is more likely with VDZ monotherapy than with anti-TNF monotherapy. Overall, VDZ appears to be safe in IBD patients with COVID-19.","Agrawal, Manasi; Zhang, Xian; Brenner, Erica J; Ungaro, Ryan C; Kappelman, Michael D; Colombel, Jean-Frederic",J. crohns. colitis,488,16

We evaluated the health and economic impact of different age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies across this demographically and socio-economically diverse region. MethodsWe fitted country-specific age-stratified compartmental transmission models to reported COVID-19 mortality in the WHO European Region to inform the immunity level before vaccine roll-out. Building upon broad recommendations from the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE), we examined four strategies that prioritise: all adults (V+), younger (20-59 year-olds) followed by older adults (60+) (V20), older followed by younger adults (V60), and the oldest adults (75+) (V75) followed by incremental expansion to successively younger five-year age groups. We explored four roll-out scenarios based on projections or recent observations (R1-4) - the slowest scenario (R1) covers 30% of the total population by December 2022 and the fastest (R4) 80% by December 2021. Five decision-making metrics were summarised over 2021-22: mortality, morbidity, and losses in comorbidity-adjusted life expectancy (cLE), comorbidity- and quality-adjusted life years (cQALY), and the value of human capital (HC). Six sets of infection-blocking and disease-reducing vaccine efficacies were considered. FindingsThe optimal age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies were sensitive to country characteristics, decision-making metrics and roll-out speeds. Overall, V60 consistently performed better than or comparably to V75. There were greater benefits in prioritising older adults when roll-out is slow and when VE is low. Under faster roll-out, V+ was the most desirable option. InterpretationA prioritisation strategy involving more age-based stages (V75) does not necessarily lead to better health and economic outcomes than targeting broad age groups (V60). Countries expecting a slow vaccine roll-out may particularly benefit from prioritising older adults. FundingWorld Health Organization, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom), the National Institute of Health Research (United Kingdom), the European Commission, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (United Kingdom), Wellcome Trust Research in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed and medRxiv for articles published in English from inception to 9 Jun 2021, with the search terms: (""COVID-19"" OR ""SARS-CoV-2"") AND (""priorit*) AND (""model*"") AND (""vaccin*"") and identified 66 studies on vaccine prioritization strategies. Of the 25 studies that compared two or more age-based prioritisation strategies, 12 found that targeting younger adults minimised infections while targeting older adults minimised mortality; an additional handful of studies found similar outcomes between different age-based prioritisation strategies where large outbreaks had already occurred. However, only two studies have explored age-based vaccine prioritisation using models calibrated to observed outbreaks in more than one country, and no study has explored the effectiveness of vaccine prioritisation strategies across settings with different population structures, contact patterns, and outbreak history. Added-value of this studyWe evaluated various age-based vaccine prioritisation strategies for 38 countries in the WHO European Region using various health and economic outcomes for decision-making, by parameterising models using observed outbreak history, known epidemiologic and vaccine characteristics, and a range of realistic vaccine roll-out scenarios. We showed that while targeting older adults was generally advantageous, broadly targeting everyone above 60 years might perform better than or comparably to a more detailed strategy that targeted the oldest age group above 75 years followed by those in the next younger five-year age band. Rapid vaccine roll-out has only been observed in a small number of countries. If vaccine coverage can reach 80% by the end of 2021, prioritising older adults may not be optimal in terms of health and economic impact. Lower vaccine efficacy was associated with greater relative benefits only under relatively slow roll-out scenarios considered. Implication of all the available evidenceCOVID-19 vaccine prioritization strategies that require more precise targeting of individuals of a specific and narrow age range may not necessarily lead to better outcomes compared to strategies that prioritise populations across broader age ranges. In the WHO European Region, prioritising all adults equally or younger adults first will only optimise health and economic impact when roll-out is rapid, which may raise between-country equity issues given the global demand for COVID-19 vaccines.","Liu, Yang; Sandmann, Frank G; Barnard, Rosanna C; Pearson, Carl A.B.; Group, - LSHTM CMMID COVID-19 Working; Pastore, Roberta; Pebody, Richard; Flasche, Stefan; Jit, Mark",,488,1

Increasingly, procedures are performed in more distant, isolated and less familiar locations, challenging anaesthesiologists and requiring well developed situational awareness. This review looks at implications for the practitioner and patient safety, outlining considerations and steps involved in translation of systems and processes well established in the operating room to more unfamiliar environments. RECENT FINDINGS: Despite limited nonoperating room anaesthesia outcome data, analysis of malpractice claims, anaesthesia-related medical disputes and clinical outcome registries have suggested higher morbidity and mortality. Complications were often associated with suboptimal monitoring, nonadherence to recommended guidelines and sedationist or nonanaesthesiologist caregivers. More recently, clear monitoring guidelines, global patient safety initiatives and widespread implementation of cognitive aids may have contributed to nonoperating room anaesthesia (NORA) outcomes approaching that of traditional operating rooms. SUMMARY: As NORA caseloads increase, understanding structural and anaesthetic requirements is essential to patient safety. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 pandemic has provided an opportunity for anaesthesiologists to implement lessons learned from previous analyses, share expertise as patient safety leaders and provide valuable input into protecting patients and caregivers.","Borshoff, David C; Sadleir, Paul",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,488,2

The most fearful aspect is the unavailability of any concrete guidelines and treatment or protective strategies for reducing mortality or morbidity caused by this virus. Repurposing of drugs, antivirals, convalescent plasma and neutralizing antibodies are being considered for treatment but are still questionable in lieu of the conflicting data, study design and induction of secondary infections. Stem cell therapy has seen substantial advancements over the past decade for the treatment of various diseases including pulmonary disorders with severe complications similar to COVID-19. Recently, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have received particular attention as a potential therapeutic modality for SARS-CoV2 infection due to their ability to inhibit cytokine storm, a hallmark of severe COVID-19. MSCs secretion of trophic factors and extracellular vesicles mediated intercellular signaling are considered as principal contributing factors for tissue recovery. Although, recent preliminary studies have established the safety and efficacy of these cells without any severe secondary complications in the treatment of SARS-CoV2 infection, the rational use of MSCs on a large scale would still require additional relevant clinical investigations and validation of postulated mechanisms of these cells.

METHODS: Imaging data of the first chest CT examination and clinical data (age, sex, clinical history, epidemiological history, and laboratory tests) of 163 patients with COVID-19 from 2 hospitals were collected for retrospective analysis. Imaging features of the first chest CT examination and the correspondence between CT manifestations and the nucleic acid test results of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were analyzed. RESULTS: The first chest CT images of 163 COVID-19 patients showed that 92.02% of lesions were ground-glass opacity (GGO), 76.69% were consolidation, and 73.62% were GGO together with consolidation. Multiple lesions were found in 71.17% patients and multiple lobules in 86.50% patients. Lesions in 53.37% patients were found with bronchial inflation signs and those in 36.20% patients presented with ""crazy paving"" pattern, while only 7.36% were found with hilar node enlargement and pleural effusion. First CT findings of 18 patients were found to be inconsistent with the results of pathogen examination. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients showed specific features in the first chest CT examination.

Objective: To examine the association of identified SARS-CoV-2 variants, virus clades, and clade groups with disease severity and patient outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study, viral genome analysis of clinical specimens obtained from patients at the Cleveland Clinic infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the initial wave of infection (March 11 to April 22, 2020) was performed. Identified variants were matched with clinical outcomes. Data analysis was performed from April to July 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mortality, and laboratory outcomes were matched with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Results: Specimens sent for viral genome sequencing originated from 302 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection (median [interquartile range] age, 52.6 [22.8 to 82.5] years), of whom 126 (41.7%) were male, 195 (64.6%) were White, 91 (30.1%) required hospitalization, 35 (11.6%) needed ICU admission, and 17 (5.6%) died. From these specimens, 2531 variants (484 of which were unique) were identified. Six different SARS-CoV-2 clades initially circulated followed by a rapid reduction in clade diversity. Several variants were associated with lower hospitalization rate, and those containing 23403A>G (D614G Spike) were associated with increased survival when the patient was hospitalized (64 of 74 patients [86.5%] vs 10 of 17 patients [58.8%]; &#967;21 = 6.907; P = .009). Hospitalization and ICU admission were similar regardless of clade. Infection with Clade V variants demonstrated higher creatinine levels (median [interquartile range], 2.6 [-0.4 to 5.5] mg/dL vs 1.0 [0.2 to 2.2] mg/dL; mean creatinine difference, 2.9 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.8 to 5.0 mg/dL]; Kruskal-Wallis P = .005) and higher overall mortality rates (3 of 14 patients [21.4%] vs 17 of 302 patients [5.6%]; &#967;21 = 5.640; P = .02) compared with other variants. Infection by strains lacking the 23403A>G variant showed higher mortality in multivariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 22.4; 95% CI, 0.6 to 5.6; P = .01). Increased variants of open reading frame (ORF) 3a were associated with decreased hospitalization frequency (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2 to 0.96; P = .04), whereas increased variants of Spike (OR, 0.01; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.3; P = .01) and ORF8 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to 0.6; P = .03) were associated with increased survival. Conclusions and Relevance: Within weeks of SARS-CoV-2 circulation, a profound shift toward 23403A>G (D614G) specific genotypes occurred. Replaced clades were associated with worse clinical outcomes, including mortality. These findings help explain persistent hospitalization yet decreasing mortality as the pandemic progresses. SARS-CoV-2 clade assignment is an important factor that may aid in estimating patient outcomes.","Esper, Frank P; Cheng, Yu-Wei; Adhikari, Thamali M; Tu, Zheng Jin; Li, Derek; Li, Erik A; Farkas, Daniel H; Procop, Gary W; Ko, Jennifer S; Chan, Timothy A; Jehi, Lara; Rubin, Brian P; Li, Jing",JAMA Netw Open,488,24

Design/methodology/approach Natural England's people and nature survey (PANS) data (n = 4,206) from the UK was used to assess a number of well-being outcomes (loneliness, life satisfaction, worthwhile life and happiness) and pro-nature behaviours as a function of longer-term physical time in nature and psychological connectedness to nature and shorter-term visits and noticing of nature. Findings Longer-term factors of nature connectedness and time in nature were both consistent significant predictors of well-being measures (apart from loneliness) and pro-nature conservation behaviours. Considered alone short-term visits and noticing were again consistent and significant predictors of three well-being measures, but recent visits to nature were not associated with pro-nature conservation behaviours. A combined regression highlighted the importance of a longer-term relationship with nature in all outcomes apart from loneliness but also revealed that even when considered in concert with longer-term factors, currently noticing nature had a role in feeling one's life was worthwhile, pro-nature behaviours and loneliness. Originality/value The closeness of the human-nature relationship and noticing nature have rarely been examined in concert with nature visits. Further, the reciprocal benefits of pro-nature behaviours are often overlooked.","Richardson, M.; Hamlin, I.",Journal of Public Mental Health,488,16

However, the methods required to remove large amounts of excess labeling reagents from the reaction mixture are time-consuming. Furthermore, these methods, including solvent extraction and solid phase extraction (SPE), often impair quantitative analysis. Here, we developed an online sample cleanup procedure for HPLC analysis of 2-aminopyridine (AP)-labeled glycans using a six-port/two-way valve and two small columns: one packed with a strong cation exchange resin (SCX) and the other comprising ODS silica gel. AP-labeled glycans delivered from an injection port were separated from excess AP by passing through an SCX column (4.6 mm i.d., 1 cm long) regulated to 40°C. The AP-labeled glycans were trapped on an ODS column (4.6 mm i.d., 1 cm long) to further separate them from inorganic contaminants. By changing the valve position after 2 min to connect the ODS column to an analysis column, AP-labeled glycans trapped in the ODS column were eluted with an acetonitrile-containing eluent followed by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation on an amide column or reversed-phase mode separation on a C30 column. This method was successfully used to analyze N-linked glycans released from several glycoprotein samples.","Kishimoto, Yuka; Okada, Fuka; Maesako, Tomohiro; Yamamoto, Sachio; Kinoshita, Mitsuhiro; Hayakawa, Takao; Suzuki, Shigeo",J Chromatogr A,488,10

So far, COVID-19 is not fully contained, and new cases are arising on daily bases in various countries. Due to zoonotic nature and human-to-human spread, COVID-19 is considered pandemic with more causalities in developing countries. Full genome analysis revealed its resemblance with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus with minor variation in non-structural proteins. Both viruses use the common angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor to attach to the epithelial cells of the target organs. Currently, COVID-19 patients are treated with drugs that are used for lungs infections. However, ACE2 has high expression in other human organs such as kidney and testes. Thus, it is assumed that, like SARS, it may have adverse effects on other vital organs, which have dominant expression of ACE2. In testis, SARS affected patients displayed peritubular fibrosis, extensive germ cell disruption, damage of blood-testis barrier integrity and more frequent occurrence of apoptosis. Here, we critically discuss the possible adverse effects of COVID-19 on the testes of patients along with future precautions to overcome the complications of reproductive organs.","Ranjha, Khan Tayyaba Naseem Hussain M.

OUTCOME MEASURE: A semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: From 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively.

METHODS: Sets of panoramic (PAN) - cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) of 218 patients were assessed for ILTM classification, contact with mandibular canal, contact and resorption of the lower second molar (LSM), intraoperative planning and postoperative expectations. RESULTS: Percentage agreement and McNemar test compared PAN vs CBCT assessments. Logistic regression analyzed the dependency of change in surgical planning considering the changes in diagnostic features; descriptive statistics was used to observe the expectation of postoperative complications and paresthesia. Differences were found between PAN vs CBCT for classification of impaction and positioning, LSM relationship, choice for crown and root sectioning and expectation of postoperative complications (all with p < 0.001). Logistic regression indicated that the change in diagnosis caused by CBCT examination did not change the clinical decision to extract ILTM but altered the planning of intraoperative steps such as osteotomy, crown sectioning and relaxing incision. The expectation of postoperative complications decreased when professionals planned the ILTM removal using 3D images. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that changes in the diagnosis after CBCT examination can lead to alterations in the treatment plan of impacted lower third molar.","Mendonça, Lucas Moreira; Gaêta-Araujo, Hugo; Cruvinel, Pedro Bastos; Tosin, Ingrid Wenzel; Azenha, Marcelo Rodrigues; Ferraz, Emanuela Prado; Oliveira-Santos, Christiano; Tirapelli, Camila",Dentomaxillofac Radiol,488,18

A retrospective cohort study with analysis of visits to the PES from March 30 to June 30, 2020, and comparison with homologous periods in the previous 3 years (2017-2019).A total of 53,883 episodes were analysed, with a median age of 5.8 years, and 53% were boys. In 2020, there was a 60% reduction in the number of admissions (p < 0.001). There was a significant increase in referral by the public medical advice phone line of the National Health Service (NHS) (18.5% vs 5.4%) and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (5.1% vs 4.2%). Urgent patients decreased (31.2% vs 38.3%), and non-urgent patients increased (7.5% vs 1.7%). There was a significant reduction in school (0.4% vs 7.1%) and sports accidents (0.1% vs 1.2%) and an increase in other accidents (falls, wounds, burns, and dog bites) (12.2% vs 6.3%). Hospitalisation rate was higher (5.7% vs 3.1%, p < 0.001). The infection rate for SARS-CoV-2 was 1.1%, all with mild illness or asymptomatic.Conclusion: The pandemic brought a marked reduction in emergency admissions and a decrease in urgent situations but an increase in accidents, such as falls, wounds, burns, and dog bites. Despite the low infection rate for SARS-CoV-2, there were increased referrals by the phone line of NHS and EMS and a higher admission in the ward. What is Known: â¢ The number of admissions to emergency services significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in the paediatric population, whom has a milder disease than adults. â¢ Diseases that justify urgent/emergent hospital admission continue to exist and the eventual delay in seeking health care might lead to a worse prognosis. What is New: â¢ Despite the low rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children, there was an increase in referrals by the phone line of the National Health Service and Emergency Medical Services. â¢ The global admission rate to the ward increased but there were no admissions to intensive care or deaths.","Paiva, Rafaela; Martins, Cátia; Rodrigues, Fernanda; Domingues, Mariana",Eur J Pediatr,488,26

Previously, low-dose techniques were rarely used for infectious diseases, despite the recognised danger of ionising radiation. Method: To evaluate the role of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and lung ultrasound (LUS) in managing COVID-19 pneumonia, we performed a review of the literature including our cases. Results: Chest LDCT is now performed routinely when diagnosing and assessing the severity of COVID-19, allowing patients to be rapidly triaged. The extent of lung involvement assessed by LDCT is accurate in terms of predicting poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19-infected patients. Infectious disease specialists are less familiar with LUS, but this technique is also of great interest for a rapid diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 and is effective at assessing patient prognosis. Conclusions: COVID-19 is currently accelerating the transition to low-dose and “no-dose” imaging techniques to explore infectious pneumonia and their long-term consequences.","Finance, Julie Zieleskewicz Laurent Habert Paul Jacquier Alexis Parola Philippe Boussuges Alain Bregeon Fabienne Eldin Carole",Journal of Clinical Medicine,488,20

Besides respiratory symptoms, a growing body of evidence indicates a variety of gastrointestinal manifestations including liver involvement. In this regard, several data supported an association between COVID-19 infection and liver injury in adults, while in children there is compelling but currently limited evidence. In particular, patients with COVID-19 have shown a higher risk of liver injury (mainly expressed as increased transaminase levels or hepatic steatosis). Conversely, a greater risk of more severe forms of COVID-19 infection has been observed in subjects with pre-existing chronic liver diseases. The dramatic interplay between COVID-19 and liver damage has been related to the inflammatory pathways chronically active in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and acutely in those affected by COVID-19, but other different pathogenic mechanisms have also been supposed. Of note, patients with previous metabolic comorbidities also had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. This emphasizes the pathogenic interrelation of the inflammatory pathways with a dysregulated metabolic milieu in COVID-19 patients. Taking into account the prognostic role of fatty liver in COVID-19 patients and its intrinsic relationship with metabolic abnormalities even in childhood, a strict monitoring of this condition is recommended. We aimed to summarize the most recent evidence regarding the potential interplay between pediatric fatty liver and COVID-19.","Di Sessa, Anna; Lanzaro, Francesca; Zarrilli, Sarah; Picone, Vittorio; Guarino, Stefano; Miraglia Del Giudice, Emanuele; Marzuillo, Pierluigi",World J Gastroenterol,488,3

However, as far as we know, there is no effective marker to predict the virus discharge in stool and initial gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19 patients. Aims: We aimed to investigate the likely biomarker predicting virus discharge in stool and initial gastrointestinal involvement of COVID-19, which may assist the clinicians in better preventing COVID-19 spread. Methods: The patients complained of gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, with or without respiratory symptoms, attending the Sixth People's Hospital of Wenzhou, and the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, were screened by qRT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2. The confirmed COVID-19 patients, without any history of intaking contaminated food or water, were all enrolled to investigate the association between circulating lymphocyte count and virus discharge, initial gastrointestinal involvement. Results: Seventy-six COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis (mean age of 44.5 years, male 44.7%), with 24 (31.5%) complained of initial gastrointestinal symptoms. Significantly lower circulating lymphocyte count was found in the patients with positive results of qRT-PCR on stool (p = 0.012). Patients were divided into tertile groups by circulating lymphocyte count: lymphocyte &#8804;0.88*10^9/l ( n = 25 ), 0.88*10^9/l -1.2*10^9/l ( n = 28 ), and >1.2*10^9/l ( n = 23 ), respectively. When circulating lymphocyte count increased from 1st tertile to the 2nd and 3rd tertiles, the risk of initial gastrointestinal symptoms decreased by nearly 75% (OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.07, 0.98, p = 0.047), 83% (OR = 0.17, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.63, p = 0.008), after adjusting for likely confounders.

METHODS: This case-control study comprised a subsample of 124 women (35 cases; 89 controls). Endometriosis was confirmed (cases) or ruled out (controls) by laparoscopy, with visual inspection of the pelvis and biopsy of suspected lesions (histological diagnosis). Urinary concentrations of benzophenone-1 (BP-1), benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 4-hydroxibenzophenone (4-OH-BP), methyl- (MeP), ethyl- (EtP), propyl- (PrP), and butyl-paraben (BuP), and biomarkers of oxidative stress [lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and total antioxidant power (TAP)] were quantified. Information was gathered on the frequency of use of cosmetics and PCPs. Associations between the frequency of cosmetics/PCP use, urinary concentrations of benzophenones and parabens, oxidative stress, and endometriosis risk were explored in logistic and linear multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: The frequency of utilization of certain cosmetics and PCPs was significantly associated with urinary concentrations of benzophenones and parabens. After adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of endometriosis was increased in women in the second versus first terciles of MeP (OR=5.63; p-value<0.001), BP-1 (OR=5.12; p-value=0.011), BP-3 (OR=4.98; p-value=0.008), and Æ©BPs (OR=3.34; p-value=0.032). A close-to-significant relationship was observed between TBARS concentrations and increased endometriosis risk (OR=1.60, p-value 0.070) and an inverse association between TAP concentrations and this risk (OR=0.15; p-value=0.048). Oxidative stress results did not modify associations observed between benzophenone/paraben exposure and endometriosis risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the frequency of cosmetics and PCP utilization is a strong predictor of exposure to certain benzophenone and paraben congeners. These compounds may increase the risk of endometriosis in an oxidative stress-independent manner. Further studies are warranted to corroborate these findings.","Fm, Peinado; Ocón-Hernández, O; Iribarne-Durán, L M; Vela-Soria, F; A, Ubiña; C, Padilla; Jc, Mora; J, Cardona; J, León; Fernández, M F; N, Olea; Artacho-Cordón, F",Environ Res,488,24

Dual oxidase maturation factor 1 (Duoxa1) has been associated with the maturation of ROS-generating enzymes including dual oxidases (Duox1 and Duox2). In the progression of osteoclast differentiation, we identified that only Duoxa1 showed an effective change upon RANKL stimulation, but not Duox1, Duox2, and Duoxa2. Therefore, we hypothesized that Duoxa1 could independently act as a second messenger for RANKL stimulation and regulate ROS production during osteoclastogenesis. Duoxa1 gradually increased during RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Using siRNA or retrovirus transduction, we found that Duoxa1 regulated RANKL-stimulated osteoclast formation and bone resorption positively. Furthermore, knockdown of Duoxa1 decreased the RANKL-induced ROS production. During Duoxa1-related control of osteoclastogenesis, activation of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-mediated early signaling molecules including MAPKs, Akt, I&#954;B, Btk, Src and PLCÎ³2 was affected, which sequentially modified the mRNA or protein expression levels of key transcription factors in osteoclast differentiation, such as c-Fos and NFATc1, as well as mRNA expression of osteoclast-specific markers. Overall, our data indicate that Duoxa1 plays a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis via regulating RANKL-induced intracellular ROS production and activating TRAF6-mediated signaling.","Cheon, Yoon-Hee; Lee, Chang Hoon; Jeong, Da Hye; Kwak, Sung Chul; Kim, Soojin; Lee, Myeung Su; Kim, Ju-Young",,488,29

Several studies have reported the COVID-19 diagnosis model from chest X-ray images. But the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients from chest X-ray images is a tedious process as the bilateral modifications are considered an ill-posed problem. This paper presents a new metaheuristic-based fusion model for COVID-19 diagnosis using chest X-ray images. The proposed model comprises different preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification processes. Initially, the Weiner filtering (WF) technique is used for the preprocessing of images. Then, the fusion-based feature extraction process takes place by the incorporation of gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), gray level run length matrix (GLRM), and local binary patterns (LBP). Afterward, the salp swarm algorithm (SSA) selected the optimal feature subset. Finally, an artificial neural network (ANN) is applied as a classification process to classify infected and healthy patients. The proposed model's performance has been assessed using the Chest X-ray image dataset, and the results are examined under diverse aspects. The obtained results confirmed the presented model's superior performance over the state of art methods.","Shankar, K; Perumal, Eswaran; Tiwari, Prayag; Shorfuzzaman, Mohammad; Gupta, Deepak",Multimed Syst,488,24

Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a new peak in infections. In this study, we wanted to quantify the relative contribution of mobility restrictions, and that of behavioral changes that occurred already before the lockdowns, on the reduction of transmission during lockdowns in Western countries in early 2020. METHODS: Incidence data of cases and deaths from the first wave of infections for 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada) were analyzed using epidemiological compartment models in a Bayesian framework. Mobility data was used to estimate the timing of changes associated with a lockdown, and was correlated with estimated reductions of Rt. RESULTS: Across all countries, the initial median estimate for Rt was 3.6 (95% IQR 2.4-5.2), and it was reduced to 0.78 (95% IQR 0.58-1.01) during lockdown. 48% (18-65%) of the reduction occurred already in the week before lockdown, with lockdown itself causing the remaining drop in transmission. A lower Rt during lockdown was independently associated with an increased time spent at home (0.21 per 10% more time, p < 0.007), and decreased mobility related to retail and recreation (0.07 per 10% less mobility, p < 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: In a Western population unaware of the risk, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly contagious with a reproduction number R0 > 5. Our results are consistent with evidence that recreational activities (including restaurant and bar visits) enable super-spreading events. Exiting from lockdown therefore requires continued physical distancing and tight control on this kind of activities.","Deforche, Koen; Vercauteren, Jurgen; Müller, Viktor; Vandamme, Anne-Mieke",BMC Public Health,488,16

In this study, we examined the relationship between fasting blood glucose (FBG) and 28-day mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients not previously diagnosed as having diabetes. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study involving all consecutive COVID-19 patients with a definitive 28-day outcome and FBG measurement at admission from 24 January 2020 to 10 February 2020 in two hospitals based in Wuhan, China. Demographic and clinical data, 28-day outcomes, in-hospital complications and CRB-65 scores of COVID-19 patients in the two hospitals were analysed. CRB-65 is an effective measure for assessing the severity of pneumonia and is based on four indicators, i.e. confusion, respiratory rate (>30/min), systolic blood pressure (&#8804;90 mmHg) or diastolic blood pressure (&#8804;60 mmHg), and age (&#8805;65 years). RESULTS: Six hundred and five COVID-19 patients were enrolled, including 114 who died in hospital. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age (HR 1.02 [95% CI 1.00, 1.04]), male sex (HR 1.75 [95% CI 1.17, 2.60]), CRB-65 score 1-2 (HR 2.68 [95% CI 1.56, 4.59]), CRB-65 score 3-4 (HR 5.25 [95% CI 2.05, 13.43]) and FBG &#8805;7.0 mmol/l (HR 2.30 [95% CI 1.49, 3.55]) were independent predictors for 28-day mortality.

The health system has no resources for this huge quantity of patients after the hospital discharge to finish the complete recovery and avoid the chronicity of the symptoms. We propose an application named RespiraConNosotros. The application has been created and designed to guide users in performing respiratory rehabilitation exercises, especially for COVID-19 patients, and it also facilitates patient-physiotherapist contact via chat or video calling to help patients. It is accessible for all users and on all devices. All exercises would be guided and supervised by a specialized physiotherapist who suggests, adapts, and guides the exercise according to the function level of each patient. Data obtained was satisfactory; all patients pointed out the easy access, the intuitive format, and the advantage of communicating with an expert. Concerning functional assessment, all participants improved their score on the Borg scale after performing the intervention with the application.This platform would help respiratory patients to make rehabilitation treatments to recover their pulmonary function and to decrease or eliminate the possible complications they have. It never substitutes any prescribed treatment. In conclusion, RespiraConNosotros is a simple, viable, and safe alternative for the improvement and maintenance of respiratory capacity and patient's functionality affected by COVID-19.

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of the level of some laboratory factors (C-reactive protein (CRP), creatinine, leukocyte count, hemoglobin, and platelet count) on the severity and outcome of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We collected the articles published before May 26, 2020. We gathered the laboratory factors in groups of patients with COVID-19, and studied the relation between level of these factors with severity and outcome of the disease. RESULTS: Mean CRP level, creatinine, hemoglobin, and the leukocytes count in the critically ill patients were significantly higher than those of the other groups (non-critical patients); mean CRP = 54.81 mg/l, mean creatinine = 86.82 µmol/l, mean hemoglobin = 144.05 g/l, and mean leukocyte count = 7.41 × 109. The lymphocyte count was higher in patients with mild/moderate disease (mean: 1.32 × 109) and in the invasive ventilation group (mean value of 0.72 × 109), but it was considerably lower than those of the other two groups. The results showed that the platelet count was higher in critically ill patients (mean value of 205.96 × 109). However, the amount was lower in the invasive ventilation group compared with the other groups (mean level = 185.67 × 109). CONCLUSION: With increasing disease severity, the leukocyte count and the level of CRP increase significantly and the lymphocyte count decreases. There seems to be a significant relation between platelet level, hemoglobin, and creatinine level with severity of the disease. However, more studies are required to confirm this.","Kazemi, Erfan; Soldoozi Nejat, Reihane; Ashkan, Fatemeh; Sheibani, Hossein",Ann Clin Microbiol Antimicrob,488,21

The results revealed that the untreated wastewater samples showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome, which was correlated with the increased number of COVID-19 positive patients from the concerned areas, as reported in the publically available health data. This is the first study that investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in wastewater, at higher ambient temperature (45 °C), further validating WBE as potential tool in predicting and mitigating outbreaks.","Arora, Sudipti; Nag, Aditi; Sethi, Jasmine; Rajvanshi, Jayana; Saxena, Sonika; Shrivastava, Sandeep K; Gupta, A B",Water Sci Technol,488,23

The objectives of this work were to characterise the kinetics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) concentration in the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the antibody response in patients with (D+) and without (D-) dexamethasone treatment. METHODS: Data and biosamples from hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19, enrolled between March 4th and December 11th, 2020, in a prospective observational study, were analysed. SARS-CoV-2 virus concentration in serial URT samples was measured using RT-PCR. SARS-CoV-2-specific Immunoglobulin A and G (IgA and IgG) were measured in serum samples using S1-ELISA. RESULTS: We compared 101 immunocompetent patients who received dexamethasone according to the inclusion criteria and dosage determined in the RECOVERY trial to 93 immunocompetent patients with comparable disease severity from the first months of the pandemic, who had not been treated with dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids. We found no inter-group differences in virus concentration kinetics, duration of presence of viral loads >106 viral copies/mL (D+: median 17 days (IQR 13-24), D-: 19 days (IQR 13-29)), or time from symptom onset until seroconversion (IgA: D+: median 11.5 days (IQR 11-12), D-: 14 days (IQR 11.5-15.75); IgG: D+: 13 days (IQR 12-14.5), D-: 12 days (IQR 11-15)).

Demonstrating the success of these initiatives is essential to justify their systemic or individual cost. Objective: To examine the association of a shelter-in-place order with lower rates of seasonal respiratory viral activity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study with interrupted time series analysis obtained monthly counts of respiratory virus testing results at UC Davis Health from August 1, 2014, to July 31, 2020. Patients of all ages underwent testing conducted by the laboratory at UC Davis Health, a referral center for a 65â¯000-square-mile area that includes 33 counties and more than 6 million Northern California residents. Exposures: A statewide shelter-in-place order was instituted on March 19, 2020, restricting residents to their homes except for traveling for essential activities. Large social gatherings were prohibited, schools were closed, and nonessential personnel worked remotely. Those who had to leave their homes were mandated to wear face masks, engage in frequent handwashing, and maintain physical distancing. Main Outcomes and Measures: Positivity rates of common respiratory viruses within the community served by UC Davis Health. Results: A total of 46â¯128 tests for viral respiratory pathogens over a 6-year period were included in the analysis. For the postexposure period (March 25-July 31), approximately 168 positive test results occurred for the studied organisms in the 2020 virus year, a positivity rate of 9.88 positive results per 100 tests that was much lower than the positivity rate of 29.90 positive results per 100 tests observed for this date range in the previous 5 virus years. In contrast, the positivity rates were similar for the preexposure time frame (August 1-March 24) in the 2020 virus year and for the same time periods in the 5 previous years (30.40 vs 33.68 positive results per 100 tests). In the regression analyses, statistically significant decreases in viral activity were observed in the postexposure period for influenza (93% decrease; incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.07; 95% CI, 0.02-0.33) and for rhinovirus or enterovirus (81% decrease; IRR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.09-0.39) infections. Lower rates of postexposure viral activity were seen for respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenzavirus, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses; however, these associations were not statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: Using interrupted time series analysis of testing for viral respiratory pathogens, this study found that statistically significant lower rates of common community respiratory viruses appeared to be associated with a shelter-in-place order during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Partridge, Elizabeth; McCleery, Ellen; Cheema, Ritu; Nakra, Natasha; Lakshminrusimha, Satyan; Tancredi, Daniel J; Blumberg, Dean A",JAMA Netw Open,488,1

In this Personal View, we review data supporting the importance of the viral inoculum (the dose of viral particles from an infected source over time) in increasing the probability of infection in respiratory, gastrointestinal, and sexually transmitted viral infections in humans. We also review the available evidence linking the relationship of the viral inoculum to disease severity. Non-pharmaceutical interventions might reduce the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing the viral inoculum when there is exposure to an infectious source. Data from physical sciences research suggest that masks protect the wearer by filtering virus from external sources, and others by reducing expulsion of virus by the wearer. Social distancing, handwashing, and improved ventilation also reduce the exposure amount of viral particles from an infectious source. Maintaining and increasing non-pharmaceutical interventions can help to quell SARS-CoV-2 as we enter the second year of the pandemic. Finally, we argue that even as safe and effective vaccines are being rolled out, non-pharmaceutical interventions will continue to play an essential role in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 transmission until equitable and widespread vaccine administration has been completed.","Spinelli, Matthew A; Glidden, David V; Gennatas, Efstathios D; Bielecki, Michel; Beyrer, Chris; Rutherford, George; Chambers, Henry; Goosby, Eric; Gandhi, Monica","Lancet, Infect. dis.

A survey was published online during the last week of the 2-month full lockdown and 1,627 individuals completed the online survey. The survey was self-administered and included standardised questionnaires. Sleep schedules were delayed during lockdown in more than half of the participants. New severe delayed sleep phase affected 10% of participants with sleep schedules delayed by ≥3 hr during the lockdown compared to before. A significant decrease in exposure to morning (p < 0.001) and evening natural light (p < 0.001), a significant increase in screen exposure time (with a significant screen exposure >3 hr during the evening for 45% of the participants during lockdown versus 18% before lockdown, p < 0.001), an increase in substance use for one-quarter of participants, a poorer sleep quality in 56% of participants, and less regular sleep schedules in 48% of participants were observed. We also found a poorer sleep quality in women than men during lockdown (p = 0.004). The French full lockdown had a severe impact on sleep quality, sleep?wake rhythms, and sleep behaviours.

Additionally, we detected an average of 1100 human proteins from each sample. The most abundant proteins exclusively detected in positive swabs were “Guanylate-binding protein 1”, “Tapasin” and “HLA class II histocompatibility antigen DR beta chain”. The biological processes overrepresented in infected host cells were “SRP-dependent cotranslational protein targeting to membrane”, “nuclear-transcribed mRNA catabolic process, nonsense-mediated decay”, “viral transcription” and “translational initiation”. Data is available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD020394. We expect that this data can contribute to the future development of mass spectrometry based approaches for COVID-19 diagnosis. Also, we share this preliminary proteomic characterization concerning the host response to infection for its reuse in basic investigation.","Rivera, Bernardina; Leyva, Alejandro; Portela, María Magdalena; Moratorio, Gonzalo; Moreno, Pilar; Durán, Rosario; Lima, Analía",Data Brief,488,2

METHODS: In a prospective fashion, N95 respirators (n = 15) were randomized to a decontamination process (time, dry heat, or ultraviolet C light [UVC]) in outpatient clinics. Each respirator was re-used up to 5 separate clinic sessions. Swabs on each respirator for SARS-CoV-2, bacteria, and fungi were obtained before clinic, after clinic and post-treatment. Mask integrity was checked after each treatment (n = 68). Statistical analyses were performed to determine factors for positive samples. RESULTS: All three decontamination processes reduced bacteria counts similarly. On multivariate mixed model analysis, there were an additional 8.1 colonies of bacteria (95% CI 5.7 to 10.5; p < 0.01) on the inside compared to the outside surface of the respirators. Treatment resulted in a decrease of bacterial load by 8.6 colonies (95% CI -11.6 to -5.5; p < 0.01). Although no decontamination treatment affected the respirator filtration efficiency, heat treatments were associated with the breakdown of thermoplastic elastomer straps. Contamination with fungal and SARS-CoV-2 viral particles were minimal to non-existent. CONCLUSIONS: Time, heat and UVC all reduced bacterial load on reused N95 respirators. Fungal contamination was minimal. Heat could permanently damage some elastic straps making the respirators nonfunctional. Given its effectiveness against microbes, lack of damage to re-treated respirators and logistical ease, UVC represents an optimal decontamination method for individual N95 respirators when reuse is necessary.","Jiang, Zi Yang; Huang, Zhen; Schmale, Isaac; Brown, Eric L; Lorenz, Michael C; Patlovich, Scott J; Goswami, Karan; Wilson, Hannah B; Ahmad, Jumah; Alexander, Ronda; Bryan, William; Burke, Luke; Citardi, Martin J; Elias, Jose; Ho, Tang; Jacob, Jack; Low, Garren; Miramón, Pedro; Patki, Aniruddha U; Yao, William C; Luong, Amber U",Am J Otolaryngol,488,19

However, in order to maintain hand hygiene, it is ideal to have access to safe water, sanitation and hygienic (WASH) facilities, as this will significantly reduce the risk of the transmission of infection between humans. Thus, all steps should be taken to ensure that improved WASH facilities and waste management provisions are available at home, education institutions, workplaces, community and health care establishment.

We conducted detailed investigations in six London care homes reporting suspected COVID-19 outbreaks during April 2020. METHODS: Residents and staff had nasal swabs for SARS CoV-2 testing using RT-PCR and were followed-up for 14 days. They were categorized as symptomatic, post-symptomatic or pre-symptomatic if they had symptoms at the time of testing, in the two weeks before or two weeks after testing, respectively, or asymptomatic throughout. Virus isolation and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was also performed. FINDINGS: Across the six care homes, 105/264 (39.8%) residents were SARS CoV-2 positive, including 28 (26.7%) symptomatic, 10 (9.5%) post-symptomatic, 21 (20.0%) pre-symptomatic and 46 (43.8%) who remained asymptomatic. Case-fatality at 14-day follow-up was highest among symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive residents (10/28, 35.7%) compared to asymptomatic (2/4, 4.2%), post-symptomatic (2/10, 20.0%) or pre-symptomatic (3/21,14.3%) residents. Among staff, 53/254 (20.9%) were SARS-CoV-2 positive and 26/53 (49.1%) remained asymptomatic. RT-PCR cycle-thresholds and live-virus recovery were similar between symptomatic/asymptomatic residents/staff. Higher RT-PCR cycle threshold values (lower virus load) samples were associated with exponentially decreasing ability to recover infectious virus (P<0.001). WGS identified multiple (up to 9) separate introductions of different SARS-CoV-2 strains into individual care homes. INTERPRETATION: A high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 positivity was found in care homes residents and staff, half of whom were asymptomatic and potential reservoirs for on-going transmission. A third of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 residents died within 14 days. Symptom-based screening alone is not sufficient for outbreak control.

Representing Ombudsmen Institution of Bosnia and Herzegovina, authors shared their experience in monitoring implementation of the decisions of all levels of government and presented challenges in striking the right balance between interests of public health and protection of rights of vulnerable groups. Public authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina have passed emergency measures aimed at containing the spread of virus, but some of them failed to maintain human rights standards. Following the decisions of crisis centers to limit the freedom of movement, it was necessary to secure rights of children to education, protection from domestic violence and neglect in the family context. In introducing online education, authorities were asked to adapt recognition and grading system to the children in different conditions and circumstances, especially to the children with difficulties in development, children living in poverty and on margins of society such as Roma children or those living in institutions. Ombudsmen Institution registered increase in the number of domestic violence cases because measures limiting freedom of movement had impact on victims' ability to seek help from trusted sources, usually members of immediate family or representatives of law enforcement agencies. Having in mind that large number of citizens could not afford access to the official gazettes in any form, Ombudsmen requested that all enacted legislation be accessible online recommended that the decision banning reporters from conferences be reconsidered, guided by the right of citizens to be informed of their government actions. Examining the practice of placing COVID stickers on mail by the Post Office, Ombudsmen issued recommendation to stop such practice as it was deemed disproportional to the right to privacy and protection of personal data, while the pro-tection of postal workers could have been ensured by other protective measures. It also became evident that national budgetary capacities had to be increased in order to prevent deterioration in provision of basic public services such as health and social protection, since economic consequences of the pandemic were disproportionally felt by the groups exposed to poverty, such as Roma, refugees or migrants. Drawing conclusion from concrete cases, authors offer review of particular emergency measures, analyze their adequacy, justifiability and timeliness, while presenting authorities' response to Ombudsmen's findings in formulating more adequate and efficient but, at the same time, least intrusive measures taken in response to the disaster. In search of common response to such widespread phenomenon, governments should recognize the intention of Ombudsmen Institutions to be in,permanent session"" over protection of vulnerable groups and should more actively involve it in discussions on emergency measures and their effect on human rights and freedoms. It proved to be better suited to act quickly, to apply more effective remedies and to correct government actions thanks to its knowledge of the local context than traditional institutions for protection of human rights, such as constitutional courts, international courts or treaty bodies.","Mitrovic, L.; Raosavljevic, P.",Eu 2021 - the Future of the Eu in and after the Pandemic,488,22

Regular testing, producing rapid and reliable results is important in this population because infections spread quickly, and presentations are often atypical or asymptomatic. This study evaluated current testing pathways in care homes to explore the role of point-of-care tests (POCTs). METHODS: Ten staff from eight care homes, purposively sampled to reflect care organisational attributes that influence outbreak severity, underwent a semi-structured remote videoconference interview. Transcripts were analysed using process mapping tools and framework analysis focussing on perceptions about, gaps within, and needs arising from, current pathways. RESULTS: Four main steps were identified in testing: infection prevention, preparatory steps, swabbing procedure, and management of residents. Infection prevention was particularly challenging for mobile residents with cognitive impairment. Swabbing and preparatory steps were resource-intensive, requiring additional staff resource. Swabbing required flexibility and staff who were familiar to the resident. Frequent approaches to residents were needed to ensure they would participate at a suitable time. After-test management varied between sites. Several homes reported deviating from government guidance to take more cautious approaches, which they perceived to be more robust. CONCLUSION: Swab-based testing is organisationally complex and resource-intensive in care homes. It needs to be flexible to meet the needs of residents and provide care homes with rapid information to support care decisions. POCT could help address gaps but the complexity of the setting means that each technology must be evaluated in context before widespread adoption in care homes.","Micocci, Massimo; Gordon, Adam L; Allen, A Joy; Hicks, Timothy; Kierkegaard, Patrick; McLister, Anna; Walne, Simon; Buckle, Peter",Age ageing,488,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who visited the paediatric department clinic during the observed period were included in this study. The patient's demographic data, purpose of visit, and treatment type were evaluated retrospectively from patient examination records. The Pearson chi-square and t-tests were used for comprehensive statistical analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1454 patient files (1184/270 cases from non-pandemic/pandemic period) were assessed. A significant reduction was found in aggregated emergency/non-emergency visits during the pandemic period (p < 0.01). During the pandemic, average daily visits for emergency dental care were observed to have a decrease to half of the non-pandemic period. Non-emergency routine dental visits have also exhibited a drastic decline. Severe dental pain due to pulpal inflammation and abscess/swelling were the most frequently reported urgent dental complaints that patients applied to the paediatric dental clinic during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 pandemic has a significant influence on patients' attendance to paediatric dental clinic. Therefore, concerning a potential post-pandemic increase in treatment demand, meticulous future planning and proper regulation of dental care should be provided for better oral health and children's quality of life. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study's importance is the observation of dramatically reduced number of patient visits during the pandemic period which may yield increased number of oral health-related complications in the long run.","Üstün, Nilüfer; Akgöl, Beyza Balli; Bayram, Merve",Clin. oral investig,488,20

Methods: This study was a retrospective study. A total of 7 patients with heart failure and 12 patients with COVID-19 in the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University between December 1, 2019 and February 15, 2020 were enrolled. The baseline clinical and imaging features of the two groups were statistically analyzed. Results: There was no significant difference in age and sex between the two groups(both P>0.05), but the incidence of epidemiological contact history, fever or respiratory symptoms in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the heart failure group (12/12 vs. 0, P<0.001; 12/12 vs. 4/7, P=0.013). While the proportion of cardiovascular diseases and impaired cardiac function was significantly less than that of the heart failure group(2/12 vs.7/7, P<0.001ï¼0 vs.7/7, P<0.001). For imaging features, both groups had ground-glass opacity and thickening of interlobular septum, but the ratio of central and gradient distribution was higher in patients with heart failure than that in patients with COVID-19 (4/7 vs. 1/12, P=0.04). In heart failure group, the ratio of the expansion of pulmonary veins was also higher (3/7 vs. 0ï¼P=0.013), and the lung lesions can be significantly improved after effective anti-heart failure treatment.

The RESPICOVID study has been designed to evaluate patients' pulmonary damage previously hospitalised for interstitial pneumonia due to COVID-19. We focused on the arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis variables due to the initial observation that some patients had hypocapnia (arterial partial carbon dioxide pressure-PaCO2 &#8804; 35 mmHg). Therefore, we aimed to characterise patients with hypocapnia compared to patients with normocapnia (PaCO2 > 35 mmHg). Data concerning demographic and anthropometric variables, clinical symptoms, hospitalisation, lung function and gas-analysis were collected. Our study comprised 81 patients, of whom 19 (24%) had hypocapnia as compared to the remaining (n = 62, 76%), and defined by lower levels of PaCO2, serum bicarbonate (HCO3-), carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO), and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO) with an increased level of pH and arterial partial oxygen pressure (PaO2). KCO was directly correlated with PaCO2 and inversely with pH. In our preliminary report, hypocapnia is associated with a residual lung function impairment in diffusing capacity.

The onset of COVID-19 has brought to light access inequalities that preceded the pandemic and that the COVID-19 lockdown has exacerbated and made visible. The concept of home-based accessibility (HBA) is introduced, and novel research questions are addressed: (i) What type of households had zero home deliveries before COVID-19 lockdown? (ii) How the COVID-19 lockdown affected the type of households that receive home deliveries? and (iii) What are the implications of no access to home delivery services in terms of equity and environmental justice? To answer the first two questions, exploratory and confirmatory models with latent variables are estimated utilizing data collected from an online survey representative of the population in the Portland metropolitan region. Policy and environmental equity implications are discussed using the concept of home-based accessibility (HBA). The results indicate that traditionally underserved populations are less likely to benefit from home-based delivery services and that COVID-19 has worsened home delivery inequalities for underserved populations.","Figliozzi, Miguel; Unnikrishnan, Avinash",Transp Res D Transp Environ,488,16

It is caused by a new positive-sense RNA virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures involved in the control of a variety of biological processes including viral replication. Using several G4 prediction tools, we identified highly putative G4 sequences (PQSs) within the positive-sense (+gRNA) and negative-sense (-gRNA) RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 conserved in related betacoronaviruses. By using multiple biophysical techniques, we confirmed the formation of two G4s in the +gRNA and provide the first evidence of G4 formation by two PQSs in the -gRNA of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, biophysical and molecular approaches were used to demonstrate for the first time that CNBP, the main human cellular protein bound to SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, binds and promotes the unfolding of G4s formed by both strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Our results suggest that G4s found in SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and its negative-sense replicative intermediates, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with them, are relevant factors for viral genes expression and replication cycle, and may constitute interesting targets for antiviral drugs development.","Bezzi, Georgina; Piga, Ernesto J; Binolfi, Andrés; Armas, Pablo",Int. j. mol. sci.

The aim of the present study was to evaluated colonic wound healing in an inflamed bowel. Forty Wistar rats were divided in 2 groups: the control and experimental groups. In the experimental group, colitis was induced by the infusion of 10% acetic acid per rectum to understand how inflammation interferes with the healing process of intestinal. On the7th post-operative day an end to end colonic anastomosis was performed with interrupted suture. On the 3rd and 7th post-operative days, the anastomosis were evaluated. We observed that mortality and the number of complications were greater in the group of animals with inflammatory bowel disease. Dehiscence with peritonitis was the most common complication(p=0.0222). The bursting strength in the colons without leakage was lesser than those in the control group, however this difference was not statistically significant (p=0,0836). It was verified that the anastomosis performed in colons with inflammatory bowel disease showed greater total collagen concentration, with a predominance of immature collagen (type III) (p=0.0000). The mature collagen (type I) was the predominant collagen in the wounds of normal colon. (p=0.0102). On the 3th post-operative day It was also observed that the organization of collagen was poorer on the third day in the colonic wounds with inflammatory bowel disease. Nevertheless, the analysis of the inflammatory reaction at the level of the anastomosis was similar in both groups. These results suggest that inflammatory bowel disease increases the risks of anastomosis dehiscence, probably because of the delay in the maturation and the organisation of collagen.","Hintz Greca, Fernando; de Lourdes Pessole Biondo-Simões, Maria; Ioshi, Sergio; A.

Activation maps were generated using group independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary learning (sDL). Activation maps were compared to pig reference functional connectivity atlases and evaluated using Pearson spatial correlation coefficients and mean ratios. Nonparametric permutation analyses were used to determine significantly different activation areas between the TBI and healthy control groups. Significantly lower Pearson values and mean ratios were observed in the visual, executive control, and sensorimotor networks for TBI piglets compared to controls. Significant differences were also observed within several specific individual anatomical structures within each network. In conclusion, both rs- and tb-fMRI demonstrate the ability to detect functional connectivity disruptions in a translational TBI piglet model, and these disruptions can be traced to specific affected anatomical structures.","Simchick, Gregory; Scheulin, Kelly M; Sun, Wenwu; Sneed, Sydney E; Fagan, Madison M; Cheek, Savannah R; West, Franklin D; Zhao, Qun",Sci Rep,488,16

This so-called cytokine storm often leads to refractory edema, respiratory arrest, and death. At present, anti-IL-6, antiviral therapy, convalescent plasma, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin among others are being investigated as potential treatments for COVID-19. As the disease etiology and precise therapeutic interventions are still not definitively defined, we wanted to review the roles that complement and the contact system may have in either the treatment or pathogenesis of the disease. METHODS: We searched the recent literature (PubMed) on complement and coronavirus; contact system and coronavirus; bradykinin and coronavirus; and angiotensin receptor and coronavirus. The manuscript complies with ethics guidelines and was deemed exempt from institutional review board approval according to Human Subjects Protection Office guidelines. RESULTS: Mouse models are available for the study of coronavirus and complement. Although complement is effective in protecting against many viruses, it does not seem to be protective against coronavirus. C3 knockout mice infected with SARS-CoV had less lung disease than wild-type mice, suggesting that complement may play a role in coronavirus pathogenesis. Some evidence suggests that the observed pulmonary edema may be bradykinin-induced and could be the reason that corticosteroids, antihistamines, and other traditional interventions for edema are not effective. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and studies thus far have not concluded a benefit or risk associated with the use of either ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor antagonists. Activation of complement and the contact system, through generation of bradykinin, may play a role in the SARS-CoV-2-induced pulmonary edema, and our search suggests that further work is necessary to confirm our suspicions.","Maglakelidze, Natella; Manto, Kristen M; Craig, Timothy J",,488,9

A question was asked: ""What if nursing had something similar?"" PURPOSE: Describe the development and function of the Nursing COVID and Historical Epidemic Literature and describe high-level summaries of abstracts within the repository. METHOD: Nurse-specific literature was abstracted from two data sets: CORD-19 and LitCOVID. LitCOVID is a data set containing the most up-to-date literature around COVID-19. Multiple text mining algorithms were utilized to provide summaries of the articles. DISCUSSION: As of July 2020, the repository contains 760 articles. Summaries indicate the importance of psychological support for nurses and of high-impact rapid education. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this repository is the only repository specific for nursing that utilizes text mining to provide summaries.","Loresto, Figaro L; Nunez, Lisa; Tarasenko, Lindsey; Pierre, Marie St; Oja, Kenneth; Mueller, Mallory; Switzer, Bailey; Marroquin, Katherine; Kleiner, Catherine",Nurs. outlook,488,16

However, bleeding complications have also been observed in some patients. Understanding the balance between coagulation and fibrinolysis will help inform optimal approaches to thrombosis prophylaxis and potential utility of fibrinolytic-targeted therapies. 118 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 30 healthy controls were included in the study. We measured plasma antigen levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and performed spontaneous clot-lysis assays. We found markedly elevated tPA and PAI-1 levels in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Both factors demonstrated strong correlations with neutrophil counts and markers of neutrophil activation. High levels of tPA and PAI-1 were associated with worse respiratory status. High levels of tPA, in particular, were strongly correlated with mortality and a significant enhancement in spontaneous ex vivo clot-lysis. While both tPA and PAI-1 are elevated among COVID-19 patients, extremely high levels of tPA enhance spontaneous fibrinolysis and are significantly associated with mortality in some patients. These data indicate that fibrinolytic homeostasis in COVID-19 is complex with a subset of patients expressing a balance of factors that may favor fibrinolysis. Further study of tPA as a biomarker is warranted.","Zuo, Yu; Warnock, Mark; Harbaugh, Alyssa; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Knight, Jason S; Kanthi, Yogendra; Lawrence, Daniel A",Sci Rep,488,1

Here, we briefly discuss the history of this area and, more extensively, the recent breakthroughs, including the identification of protein serine residues as a major substrate of PARP1 and PARP2 in human cells and of cysteine and tyrosine as potential targets of specific PARPs. On the molecular level, the modification of serine residues requires a composite active site formed by PARP1 or PARP2 together with a specificity-determining factor, HPF1; this represents a new paradigm not only for PARPs but generally for post-translational modification (PTM) catalysis. Additionally, we discuss the identification of DNA as a substrate of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3, and some bacterial ARTs and the discovery of noncanonical RNA capping by several PARP family members. Together, these recent findings shed new light on PARP-mediated catalysis and caution to 'expect the unexpected' when it comes to further potential substrates.","Suskiewicz, Marcin J; Palazzo, Luca; Hughes, Rebecca; Ahel, Ivan",FEBS j,488,33

First, the sequence of 2019-nCoV RBD, including its receptor-binding motif (RBM) that directly contacts ACE2, is similar to that of SARS-CoV, strongly suggesting that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 as its receptor. Second, several critical residues in 2019-nCoV RBM (particularly Gln493) provide favorable interactions with human ACE2, consistent with 2019-nCoV's capacity for human cell infection.

Objective: To describe and intercorrelate epidemiology and geographic data from Brazil about the number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: The epidemiology and geographic data were correlated with the distribution of ICU beds (public and private health systems) and the number of beneficiaries of private health insurance using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient. The same data were correlated using partial correlation controlled by gross domestic product (GDP) and number of beneficiaries of private health insurance. Findings: Brazil has a large geographical area and diverse demographic and economic aspects. This diversity is also present in the states and the Federal District regarding the number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and case fatality rate. The effective management of severe COVID-19 patients requires ICU services, and the scenario was also dissimilar as for ICU beds and ICU beds/10,000 inhabitants for the public (SUS) and private health systems mainly at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic. The distribution of ICUs was uneven between public and private services, and most patients rely on SUS, which had the lowest number of ICU beds. In only a few states, the number of ICU beds at SUS was above 1 to 3 by 10,000 inhabitants, which is the number recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).

DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of nursing-home COVID-19 reports and other databases. Multivariable negative binomial models were used to estimate disparities in COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates across nursing-home groups with varying proportions of racial and ethnic minority residents, defined as low-, medium-, medium-high-, and high-proportion groups. Trends in such disparities were estimated from week 1 (April 13) to week 10 (ending on June 19, 2020). SETTING: The study was conducted across 211 nursing homes. RESULTS: The average number of cases ranged from 6.1 cases per facility for the low-proportion group to 11.7 cases per facility for the high-proportion group in week 1, and from 26.7 to 58.5 cases per facility in week 10. Compared to the low-proportion group, the adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for the high-proportion group were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-1.80; P > .10) in week 1 and 1.54 (95% CI, 1.05-2.25; P < .05) in week 10, showing a 30% (95% CI, 5%-62%) relative increase (P < .05). The average weekly number of COVID-19-related deaths ranged from 0 to 0.3 deaths per facility for different groups in week 1, and from 7.6 to 13.3 deaths per facility in week 10. Adjusted disparities in fatalities similarly increased over time. CONCLUSIONS: Connecticut nursing homes caring for predominately racial and ethnic minority residents tended to have higher COVID-19 incidence and fatality rates. These across-facility disparities increased during the early periods of the pandemic.","Li, Yue; Cai, Xueya; Mao, Yunjiao; Cheng, Zijing; Temkin-Greener, Helena",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,488,24

So far, clinical applications have focused on diagnosis and on prediction of outcomes. It is less clear in what way AI can or should support complex clinical decisions that crucially depend on patient preferences. In this paper, we focus on the ethical questions arising from the design, development and deployment of AI systems to support decision-making around cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the determination of a patient's Do Not Attempt to Resuscitate status (also known as code status). The COVID-19 pandemic has made us keenly aware of the difficulties physicians encounter when they have to act quickly in stressful situations without knowing what their patient would have wanted. We discuss the results of an interview study conducted with healthcare professionals in a university hospital aimed at understanding the status quo of resuscitation decision processes while exploring a potential role for AI systems in decision-making around code status. Our data suggest that (1) current practices are fraught with challenges such as insufficient knowledge regarding patient preferences, time pressure and personal bias guiding care considerations and (2) there is considerable openness among clinicians to consider the use of AI-based decision support. We suggest a model for how AI can contribute to improve decision-making around resuscitation and propose a set of ethically relevant preconditions-conceptual, methodological and procedural-that need to be considered in further development and implementation efforts.","Biller-Andorno, Nikola; Ferrario, Andrea; Joebges, Susanne; Krones, Tanja; Massini, Federico; Barth, Phyllis; Arampatzis, Georgios; Krauthammer, Michael",J. med. ethics,488,1

METHODS: Data collection forms were sent online to nursing students of three different state or foundation universities in Turkey. In all, 456 individuals who answered the data collection forms were included in the study. FINDINGS: Study results revealed that the total average score for the ""Attitude Scale for Nursing Profession"" was 162 ± 15.6. The Professional characteristics subdimension score average was 80.64 ± 7.02. Furthermore, the state of choosing nursing profession subdimension score average was 50.05 ± 9.23, whereas the Attitude for the general status of nursing profession subdimension score average was 34.38 ± 2.97. Due to the pandemic, anxiety levels for the nursing profession were 4.86 ± 2.76 (between 0 and 10). It was determined that nursing students who studied in cities where the virus was very common had a more positive attitude toward the profession. Anxiety levels of nursing students studying in cities where the virus impact was moderate and in cities where the virus presence was quite common were higher (p > 0.05). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It was found that nursing students had a positive and high-level attitude toward the nursing profession. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that attitudes toward the nursing profession decreased significantly as anxiety increased.","Bahçecioglu Turan, Gülcan; Özer, Zülfünaz; Çiftçi, Bahar",Perspect. psychiatr. care,488,17

The virus is highly infectious and spreads by human to human local transmission mode. Till date, there is no vaccination or drugs been approved for the treatment by the World Health Organisation. Henceforth, the discovery of the potential drugs is an urgent and utmost requirement for the medical fraternity. Since, the side effects of plant-derived compounds will be lower compared to synthetic/chemical drugs. The Main protease (3CLpro or NSP5) and endoribonuclease (NSP15) proteins are necessity for viral replication and its survival in the host cell. In the present study, in-silico approach of drug development was used to search for potential antiviral plant-derived compounds as inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 replication proteins. Eight plant-derived compounds of which the antiviral activity was known and available, and two reported drugs against SARS-CoV-2 selected for the molecular docking analysis. The docking results suggested that bisdemethoxycurcumin, demethoxycurcumin, scutellarin, quercetin and myricetin showed least binding energy, i.e., greater than -6.5 Kcal/mol against 3CLpro and endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2. Further studies of ADME-Tox and bioavailability of drugs were also performed that exhibited efficient parameters of drug likeness. Molecular dynamics simulation calculations were performed for the most negative binding affinity of the compound to evaluate the dynamic behavior,and stability of protein-ligand complex. Our findings suggest that these compounds could be potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease and endoribonuclease. However, further in-vitro and pre-clinical experiments would validate the potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 proteins.","Sharma, Aniket; Goyal, Shubham; Yadav, Arvind Kumar; Kumar, Pawan; Gupta, Lovely",J Biomol Struct Dyn,488,24

Diabetes has been recognized as a possible risk factor for COVID-19 complications. OBJECTIVE: International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) investigated perceptions, challenges and experience of health care professionals (HCP) taking care of children and young people with diabetes worldwide during COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: From 21st April to 17th May 2020, during COVID-19 pandemic, a web-based survey was sent to ISPAD members and former participants of ISPAD conferences by email. RESULTS: Responders from 215 diabetes centers from 75 countries completed the survey. Majority were from UK (35; 16.3%), USA (20; 9.3%), and India (15; 7%). HCP were mostly pediatric endocrinologists (64%). During COVID-19 pandemic, 16.5% of responders continued face-to-face consultation while most changed to telephone (32%) or video (18%) consultations. 19% reported a shortage of medical supplies. 22% reported a delay in diagnosis of patients with new-onset diabetes, while 15% reported a higher incidence of DKA. 12% reported having one or more patients with COVID-19. Most of the 86 children and adolescents with diabetes and COVID-19 had only mild/moderate symptoms, while 5 required admission to an intensive care unit. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This large global survey during COVID-19 pandemic showed that many HCP adapted to the pandemic by resorting to telemedicine. One fourth of HCP reported delays in diagnosis and an increased rate of DKA. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic had an important impact on family's behavior that might have led to increase in diabetic ketoacidosis presentation.","Elbarbary, Nancy Samir; Dos Santos, Tiago Jeronimo; de Beaufort, Carine; Agwu, Juliana Chizo; Calliari, Luis Eduardo; Scaramuzza, Andrea Enzo",Pediatr. diabetes,488,20

There are competing risks of mortality from cancer versus serious complications and higher risk of death from COVID-19 in immunocompromised hosts. Furthermore, compounding these concerns is the inadequate supply of personal protective equipment, decreased hospital capacity, and paucity of effective treatments or vaccines to date for COVID-19. Guidance measures and recommendations have been published by national organizations aiming to facilitate the delivery of care in a safe and effective manner, many of which, are permanently adoptable interventions. Given the critical importance to continue chemotherapy, there remains additional interventions to further enhance patient safety while conserving healthcare resources such as adjustments in medication administration, reduction in laboratory or drug monitoring, and home delivery of specialty infusions. In this manuscript, we outline how to implement these actionable interventions of chemotherapy and supportive care delivery to further enhance the current precautionary measures while maintaining safe and effective patient care.

METHODS: This cross-sectional internet-based survey included 1239 workers (mean age [standard deviation], 44.7 [13.7] years; 59.2% men) living in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Time spent sitting (SB), standing (light-intensity PA; LPA), walking, and engaging in heavy labor (moderate-to-vigorous PA; MVPA) during work time was measured using the Work-related Physical Activity Questionnaire. Workers reported weekly WFH percentages (eg, 0% implies no WFH and 100% implies full WFH), and WFH percentages were categorized into no WFH (0% WFH) and WFH (1%-100% WFH) groups. The WFH group was further subcategorized into 1%-25%, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and 76%-100% subgroups. RESULTS: Overall, 494 workers (39.9%) worked from home. During working hours, SB time was longer in the WFH group than in the no WFH group (mean minutes [% working-time SB]: 335.7 vs 224.7 min [74% vs 50%]).

To date, no drugs have demonstrated safety and efficacy in randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19. Although the association between Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin efficacy lack of solid evidence-base, several governments have adopted it for all virology confirmed Covid-19 cases even for those who are asymptomatic. In the following, we aim to discuss some of the ethical issues associated with the use of this treatment association. We mainly tried to discuss the following controversial questions: Is it ethical not to treat a patient while a treatment exists and is used for other indications than Covid-19 for which it's not proven yet? If yes, is a randomized controlled trial to prove the hydroxychloroquine for the Covid-19 treatment, necessary, in the context of covid-19 pandemic? If no, is it the government's right to decide the hydroxychloroquine treatment for all covid-19 patients? And what should be the physicians’ attitudes? Finally, what are the government, physicians, and patient's rights and responsibilities? The paper conclude that, since health authorities in some countries recommended this off-label use treatment, physicians are challenged by the requirement of veracity while providing care to their patients and the implications of such a requirement; they are facing the challenge of balancing this guideline and their own conviction. Furthermore, the fundamental principles of beneficence and non-maleficence, and respect for persons should underlie any reflection process to address this dilemma. In addition, in a pandemic context, the limits between the government's, practitioner's and patient's rights and obligations are not clear which could significantly endanger the universal ethical principles in clinical practice. It could also undermine any attempt to develop serious clinical trials to prove the considered off-label drug.La pandémie de coronavirus 2019-2020 (COVID-19) conduit au syndrome respiratoire aigu sévère coronavirus 2 (SRAS-CoV-2). À ce jour, aucun médicament n'a démontré son innocuité et son efficacité dans des essais contrôlés randomisés pour les patients atteints de COVID-19. Bien que l'association entre l'hydroxychloroquine et l'azithromycine manque de preuves solides, plusieurs gouvernements l'ont adoptée pour tous les cas de Covid-19 confirmés, même pour ceux qui sont asymptomatiques. Dans ce qui suit, nous discutons certains des problèmes éthiques associés à l'utilisation de cette association thérapeutique. Nous avons principalement essayé de discuter les questions controversées suivantes: est-il éthique de ne pas traiter un patient alors qu'un traitement existe et est utilisé pour d'autres indications que le Covid-19 pour lequel il n'est pas encore prouvé ? Si oui, un essai contrôlé randomisé pour prouver l'hydroxychloroquine pour le traitement Covid-19 est-il nécessaire dans le contexte de la pandémie Covid-19 ? Si non, le gouvernement a-t-il le droit de décider du traitement à l'hydroxychloroquine pour tous les patients de Covid-19 ? Et quelles devraient être les attitudes des médecins ? Enfin, quels sont les droits et responsabilités du gouvernement, des médecins et des patients ? Le document conclut que, puisque les autorités sanitaires de certains pays ont recommandé ce traitement hors AMM, les médecins sont confrontés aux challenges de l'exigence de véracité de l'efficacité du traitement tout en prodiguant des soins à leurs patients et aux implications d'une telle exigence; ils sont confrontés au défi d’équilibrer ces exigence et leur propre conviction. En outre, les principes fondamentaux de bienfaisance et de non-malfaisance, et le respect des personnes devraient sous-tendre tout processus de réflexion pour résoudre ce dilemme. Enfin, dans un contexte de pandémie, les limites entre les droits et obligations du gouvernement, du praticien et du patient ne sont pas toujours claires, ce qui pourrait mettre en danger de manière significative les principes éthiques universels dans la pratique clinique. Cela pourrait également saper toute tentative de développer des essais cliniques sérieux pour prouver le médicament hors AMM considéré.","El Rhazi, K.; Adarmouch, L.",Ethics Med. Public Health,488,16

Globally, it has been observed that according to the statistics, India has the second largest number of people with diabetes. Literature review has been implemented within the databases using suitable keywords. For persons suffering from diabetic disorder, the COVID-19 infection becomes a dual challenge. Diabetes is a severe metabolic situation which causes the sugar levels in the blood to increase than the normal level. Normally, communicable disease like COVID-19 is more prevailing in patients with diabetes. Diabetic patient has poor immune response to infections. The different bacterial, viral, parasitic, and mycotic infections showed increased probability in diabetic patients as compared to non-diabetic patient. All these conclusions clear out the intention that the diabetic patients are more susceptible to enhanced inflammatory response that may lead to rapid spreading of COVID-19 infection with high rate of mortality. In the present situation of pandemic, managing diabetes seems to be quite challenging and diabetic patient having COVID-19 infection should follow normal course of antihypertensive and antidiabetic drugs prescribed with the exception of sodium glucose co-transpoters-2 inhibitors which would increase the risk of dehydration and ketoacidosis.

RESULTS: At the end of the 12-week period, the incidence of grade (2, 3) peripheral neuropathy was significantly lower in the high dose group (28.6%) compared to the low dose group (61.9%) and the control group (100%), p value < 0.001. A significant improvement in the mTNS and QOL scores was observed after 6 and 12 weeks in the high dose group and the low dose group compared to the control, p value < 0.001. Significantly higher levels of serum NGF in the high dose group and lower level of serum MDA in the high dose and the low dose group were observed. CONCLUSION: Oral NAC (1200 mg once and twice daily) might reduce the incidence and severity of PIPN and improve the patients' QOL.

We evaluated a screening strategy combining chest computed tomography (CT) and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for patients treated with radiation therapy at our cancer center located in a COVID-19 French hotspot during the first wave of the pandemic. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Chest CT images were proposed during radiation therapy CT simulation. Images were reviewed by an expert radiologist according to the COVID-19 Reporting and Data System classification. Nasal swabs with RT-PCR assay were initially proposed in cases of suspicious imaging or clinical context and were eventually integrated into the systematic screening. A dedicated radiation therapy workflow was proposed for COVID-19 patients to limit the risk of contamination. RESULTS: From March 18, 2020 to May 1, 2020, 480 patients were screened by chest CT, and 313 patients had both chest CT and RT-PCR (65%). The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 5.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-7.8; 26 of 480 patients). Diagnosis of COVID-19 was made before radiation therapy for 22 patients (84.6%) and during RT for 4 patients (15.3%). Chest CT directly aided the diagnosis of 7 cases in which the initial RT-PCR was negative or not feasible, out of a total of 480 patients (1.5%) and 517 chest CT acquisitions. Four patients with COVID-19 at the time of the chest CT screening had a false negative CT. Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT screening in patients with both RT-PCR and chest CT testing were estimated at 0.82 (95% CI, 0.60-0.95) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), respectively. Adaptation of the radiation therapy treatment was made for all patients, with 7 postponed treatments (median: 5 days; interquartile range, 1.5-14.8). CONCLUSIONS: The benefit of systematic use of chest CT screening during CT simulation for patients undergoing radiation therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic seemed limited.","Sun, Roger; Achkar, Samir; Ammari, Samy; Bockel, Sophie; Gallois, Emmanuelle; Bayle, Arnaud; Battistella, Enzo; Salviat, Flore; Merad, Mansouria; Laville, Adrien; Ka, Kanta; Griscelli, Franck; Albiges, Laurence; Barlesi, Fabrice; Bossi, Alberto; Rivera, Sofia; Chargari, Cyrus; Deutsch, Eric",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,488,16

Medical students, as frontline healthcare workers, are more susceptible to be infected by the virus. The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19 related knowledge, self-reported preventive behaviors and risk perception among Iranian medical students within the first week after the onset of the outbreak in Iran. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from 26th to 28th of February, 2020. Participants were Iranian medical students (5th-7th year) whose knowledge, preventive behaviors and risk perceptions of COVID-19 were assessed using an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of 26 questions including 15 items about COVID-19 related knowledge, 9 items regarding preventive measures and 2 items about COVID-19 risk perception. The validity and reliability of the questionnaire were shown to be satisfactory. RESULTS: A total of 240 medical students completed the questionnaire. The mean age of participants was 23.67 years. The average of correct answers of knowledge was 86.96%; and 79.60% had high level of related knowledge. The average rate of practicing preventive behaviors was 94.47%; and 94.2% had high level of performance in preventive behaviors. The cumulative score of risk perception was 4.08 out of 8 which was in moderate range. Risk perception was significantly different between stagers and interns and between those being trained in emergency room (ER) and non-ER wards. There was a significant negative correlation between preventive behaviors and risk perception. CONCLUSION: We found a high level of COVID-19 related knowledge and self-reported preventive behaviors and moderate risk perception among Iranian medical students.","Taghrir, Mohammad Hossein; Borazjani, Roham; Shiraly, Ramin",Arch Iran Med,488,26

This study aims to investigate the psychological distress impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among the Saudi population. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study, using data collected from 3036 participants via an online self-reported questionnaire. The psychological distress was constructed using the COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index to classify individuals in the sample as having normal, mild or severe distress levels. The study used descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regressions to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with psychological distress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: The evidence showed that 40% of the Saudi population are distressed due to COVID-19, of whom approximately 33% are mildly distressed, while 7% are severely distressed. The distress levels are particularly high amongst the young, females, private sector employees and health workers, especially those working on the frontline. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased distress amongst people living in Saudi Arabia. In support of evidence found in other countries, the study has established that the distress levels vary across different sociodemographic characteristics. Therefore, limiting people’s psychological damage demands both medium-and long-term policy strategies, which include mapping the rates of stress and anxiety for effective psychological treatment allocation and establishing innovative online methods of heightening people’s mental wellbeing.","Khaled Al-Hanawi, Mohammed; Mwale, Martin Limbikani; Alshareef, Noor; Qattan, Ameerah M.

However, acceptance rates of such food swaps tend to be low. This study aimed to see whether framing lower-energy food swaps in terms of cost savings or social norms could improve likelihood of acceptance relative to framing swaps in terms of health benefits. Participants (n = 900) were asked to shop from a 12-item shopping list in a simulation online supermarket. When a target high-energy food was identified in the shopping basket at check-out, one or two lower-energy foods would be suggested as an alternative (a ""swap""). Participants were randomised to only see messages emphasising health benefits (fewer calories), cost benefits (lower price) or social norms (others preferred this product). Data were analysed for 713 participants after exclusions. Participants were offered a mean of 3.17 swaps (SD = 1.50), and 12.91% of swaps were accepted (health = 14.31%, cost = 11.49%, social norms = 13.18%). Swap acceptance was not influenced by the specific swap frame used (all p > .170). Age was significantly and positively associated with swap acceptance (b = 0.02, SE = 0.00, p < .001), but was also associated with smaller decreases in energy change (b = 0.46, SE = .19, p = .014). Overall, offering swaps reduced both energy (kcal) per product (b = -9.69, SE = 4.07, p = .017) and energy (kcal) per shopping basket (t712 = 11.09, p < .001) from pre- to post-intervention. Offering lower-energy food swaps could be a successful strategy for reducing energy purchased by customers of online supermarkets. Future research should explore alternative solutions for increasing acceptance rates of such swaps.","Bunten, Amanda; Porter, Lucy; Sanders, Jet G; Sallis, Anna; Payne Riches, Sarah; Van Schaik, Paul; González-Iraizoz, Marta; Chadborn, Tim; Forwood, Suzanna",PLoS One,488,21

Cyclic nucleotides and steroid hormones may contribute to the process of carcinogenesis or provide protection via apoptotic mechanisms. Although several pharmacologic classes of compounds influence cyclic nucleotide levels markedly, less is known about the class effects of promoters and blockers of tumourigenesis and apoptosis. This molecular modeling study uses cyclic nucleotide templates to investigate relative molecular similarity within compounds modulating tumourigenesis and apoptosis. Findings, in respect of superimposition and molecular fit of the investigated compounds, are related to their individual effects on cyclic nucleotide pharmacology. Modulators of tumourigenesis and estrogen receptor sub-type ligands relate to cyclic nucleotide structure. Estradiol and GPER ligands provide a similar pattern of fit to adenine nucleotide. Chemically diverse modulators of apoptosis, including K+ channel ligands, fit to different components of cyclic nucleotide structure. Compounds modulating Ca2+ entry and IP3 receptors relate structurally to the nucleotide dioxaphosphinin moiety. Relative molecular similarity within the structures of apoptosis and tumourigenesis modulators identifies a unifying property within chemically disparate compounds. The ubiquitous generation of oxidative stress and ROS in cells by apoptosis modulating compounds may relate to the disruption of cyclic nucleotide regulated homeostasis mechanisms.","Williams, Wynford R",Gen Physiol Biophys,488,16

The total number of cases for the COVID-19 epidemic over time in 28 countries was analysed and fit to several simple rate models. The resulting model parameters were used to extrapolate projections for more recent data. While the Gompertz growth model (mean R2 = 0.998) best fit the current data, uncertainties in the eventual case limit introduced significant model errors. However, the quadratic rate model (mean R2 = 0.992) fit the current data best for 25 (89%) countries as determined by R2 values of the remaining models. Projection to the future using the simple quadratic model accurately forecast the number of future total number of cases 50% of the time up to 10 days in advance. Extrapolation to the future with the simple exponential model significantly overpredicted the total number of future cases. These results demonstrate that accurate future predictions of the case load in a given country can be made using this very simple model.","Blanco, N; Stafford, K A; Lavoie, M C; Brandenburg, A; Górna, M W; Merski, M",Epidemiol Infect,488,7
455536,455536,455536,Postmortem Examination of Patients With COVID-19,17.90402,7.586103,2020,"Background: Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are one of the most common causes of the “common cold”. Some HCoV strains, however, can cause fatal respiratory disease. Some examples of these diseases are severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19). This article will review the etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs. Methods: A systematic literature review was performed using the terms “human coronaviruses”, “MERS-CoV”, “SARS-CoV”, “SARS-CoV2”, “COVID-19”, and “common cold” in OVID MEDLINE, PubMed, and Cochrane Library. Findings: Most HCoVs cause mild upper respiratory infections which resolve with supportive care and no sequelae. In recent decades, however, there have been outbreaks of novel HCoVs that cause more severe disease. This is largely due to HCoVs having large genomes which undergo frequent recombination events, leading to the emergence of novel and more virulent strains of the virus. These severe respiratory illnesses can lead to acute respiratory distress requiring invasive intervention, such as mechanical ventilation. These severe infections can lead to long-lasting sequelae in patients. Scientists continue to investigate potential treatments for these viruses, though supportive care remains the gold standard. Scientists have succeeded in developing numerous vaccines for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and ongoing data collection and analysis will shed even more light on the next steps in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: Due to the frequency of recombination events and the subsequent emergence of novel strains, HCoVs are becoming more prevalent, making them a global health concern as they can lead to epidemics and pandemics. Understanding the epidemiology, etiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of HCoVs is important, especially during this worldwide pandemic. © 2021 Coerdt KM et al.","Coerdt, K.

Reported cognitive assessment is often limited to orientation alone. Further assessment may seem an inappropriate burden in acute COVID-19 cases characterized by fatigue and confusion as well as examiner safety. OBJECTIVE: Objective: To assess cognition in COVID-19 cases as comprehensively as possible in a brief format, all while observing safety; and to establish clear-face value of its external validity. METHODS: Method: We adapted a brief cognitive assessment, previously applied to liver transplant candidates and medical/surgical inpatients, for remote use in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment. Collecting quality assurance data from telephone-administered assessments, this report presents a series of six COVID-19 case vignettes to illustrate the 5-Minute Assessment use in diagnosis and treatment of brain effects. Primary medical teams referred the cases for neuropsychiatric consultation. RESULTS: Results: Varying over four decades in age, none were able to engage meaningfully with their surroundings on admission. On follow-up exam 6 to 10 days later, four of the six had recovered Working Memory, and only one had recovered calculation ability. Two were capable of complex Judgment responses while none of the cases completed frontal executive function testing in the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusions: Cognitive assessment in COVID-19 cases, using this remote examination, reveals patterns of cognitive recovery that vary among cases and are far more complex than loss of orientation. In this series, testing specific temporal, parietal, and three frontal lobe functions suggests that calculation ability, judgment, and especially frontal executive functions, may characterize COVID-19 brain effects. Used widely, and serially, this exam method can potentially inform our understanding of COVID-19 brain effects with healing from the virus.

The ""JArDinS"" quasi-experimental study aimed to assess the impact of community garden participation on the adoption of more sustainable lifestyles among French adults. METHODS: Individuals entering a community garden in Montpellier (France) in 2018 (n = 66) were compared with pairwise matched individuals with no experience in community gardening (n = 66). Nutritional quality, environmental impact and cost of monthly household food supplies, level of physical activity measured by accelerometers, as well as mental and social well-being, sensitivity to food waste, and connection with nature were evaluated at baseline (t0) and 12 months later (t1) to explore sustainability of lifestyles in social/health, environmental and economic dimensions. Linear mixed models were used to determine the independent effect of community gardening on investigated lifestyles components. In-depth interviews were conducted at t1 with 15 gardeners to better understand changes that may have occurred in gardeners' lives during the first year of gardening. RESULTS: At t0, gardeners had lower education level, lower BMI and their household reported lower percentage of meals consumed outside of the home compared to non-gardeners (p < 0.05). Participating in the community garden had no significant impact, in spite of sufficient statistical power, on fruit and vegetables supplies (main outcome), nor on physical activity parameters, nor on others of the social/health, environmental and economic lifestyles components investigated. Qualitative interviews suggested the existence of pre-established health and environmental consciousness in some gardeners and revealed several barriers to the participation such as lack of time, lack of gardening knowledge, physical difficulty of gardening, health problems and conflicts with other gardeners. CONCLUSIONS: The health benefits of community gardening previously reported by cross-sectional studies might be confounded by selection bias. The JArDinS study highlights the need to identify solutions to overcome barriers related to community garden participation when designing relevant public health interventions for the promotion of sustainable lifestyles.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of vitamin D deficiency in complex PCOS pathophysiological pathways. Methods: Two hundred sixty-seven patients with PCOS were divided into two groups Group 1 with 25(OH)D3 deficiency, and Group 2 with normal 25(OH)D3. Biochemical and hormonal parameters (androgen hormones, gonadotropins, and thyroid function tests) were compared between the two groups. Results: Eighty-six percent of the patients (n=231) were in Group 1 and 14% (n=36) in Group 2. Statistically significantly higher concentrations of serum testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate and LH were determined in Group 1 (p<0.05). 25(OH)D3 concentrations were negatively correlated with body mass index (r=-0.459), serum testosterone (r =-0.374) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels (r=-0.418); (all; p< 0.05). Conclusion: The study findings show that low 25(OH)D3 levels are associated with high androgen levels in women with PCOS. Vitamin D deficiency should be considered as an additional risk factor in the development of PCOS. We think that providing vitamin D supplementation for women from identified deficiency areas can reduce the risk of PCOS development.","Gokosmanoglu, Feyzi; Onmez, Attila; Ergenç, Hasan",Afr Health Sci,488,33

METHOD: data were collected from the COVID-19 reports of the Department of Epidemiology, Ministry of Health, Chile. Curve adjustment studies were developed with the data in four different models: quadratic, exponential, simple exponential smoothing, and double exponential smoothing. The significance level used was &#945;&#8804;0.05. RESULTS: the curve that best fits the evolution of the accumulated confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Chile is the doubly-smoothed exponential curve. CONCLUSION: the number of infected patients will continue to increase. Chile needs to remain vigilant and adjust the strategies around the prevention and control measures. The behavior of the population plays a fundamental role. We suggest not relaxing restrictions and further improving epidemiological surveillance. Emergency preparations are needed and more resource elements need to be added to the current health support. This prediction is provisional and depends on keeping all intervening variables constant. Any alteration will modify the prediction.","Díaz-Narváez, Víctor; San-Martín-Roldán, David; Calzadilla-Núñez, Aracelis; San-Martín-Roldán, Pablo; Parody-Muñoz, Alexander; Robledo-Veloso, Gonzalo",Rev Lat Am Enfermagem,488,16

One of the innovations that make sudden acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) more infectious than its ancestor viruses is the addition of a furin cleavage site. Conditions associated with elevated furin levels, including diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, overlap greatly with vulnerability to the severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We suggest that diet and lifestyle modifications that reduce the associated comorbidities may prevent the development of severe COVID-19 by, in part, lowering circulating furin levels. Likewise, natural and pharmaceutical inhibitors of furin may be candidate prophylactic interventions or, if used early in the COVID-19, may prevent the development of critical symptoms.","Fitzgerald, Kara",Perm. j.

This situation has enforced scientific researchers to gather their efforts to contain the virus. In this pandemic situation, health monitoring and human movements are getting significant consideration in the field of healthcare and as a result, it has emerged as a key area of interest in recent times. This requires a contactless sensing platform for detection of COVID-19 symptoms along with containment of virus spread by limiting and monitoring human movements. In this paper, a platform is proposed for the detection of COVID-19 symptoms like irregular breathing and coughing in addition to monitoring human movements using Software Defined Radio (SDR) technology. This platform uses Channel Frequency Response (CFR) to record the minute changes in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers due to any human motion over the wireless channel. In this initial research, the capabilities of the platform are analyzed by detecting hand movement, coughing, and breathing. This platform faithfully captures normal, slow, and fast breathing at a rate of 20, 10, and 28 breaths per minute respectively using different methods such as zero-cross detection, peak detection, and Fourier transformation. The results show that all three methods successfully record breathing rate. The proposed platform is portable, flexible, and has multifunctional capabilities. This platform can be exploited for other human body movements and health abnormalities by further classification using artificial intelligence. IEEE","Rehman, M.; Shah, R. A.; Khan, M. B.; Ali, N. A.

We investigate if CCP transfusion in patients with severe respiratory failure increases plasma titres of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and improves clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients with COVID-19 (n=34) were consented for CCP transfusion and serial blood draws pretransfusion and post-transfusion. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 antireceptor binding domain (RBD) IgG and IgM titres were measured by ELISA serially, and compared with serial plasma titre levels from control patients (n=68). The primary outcome was survival at 30 days, and secondary outcomes were length of ventilator and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and in the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcomes were compared with matched control patients (n=34). Kinetics of antibodies and clinical outcomes were compared using LOess regression and ORs, respectively. RESULTS: Prior to CCP transfusion, 74% of patients were anti-RBD seropositive for IgG (median 1:3200), and 81% were anti-RBD IgM seropositive (median 1:320), while 16% were seronegative. The kinetics of antibody titres in CCP recipients were similar to controls. CCP recipients presented with similar survival, duration on ventilatory and/or ECMO support, as well as ICU and hospital LOS compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: CCP transfusion did not increase the kinetics of SARS-CoV2 antibodies and did not result in improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 with severe respiratory failure, suggesting that CCP may not be indicated in this category of patients.","Klein, Matthew N; Wang, Elizabeth Wenqian; Zimand, Paul; Beauchamp, Heather; Donis, Caitlin; Ward, Matthew D; Martinez-Hernandez, Aidaelis; Tabatabai, Ali; Baddley, John W; Bloch, Evan M; Mullins, Kristin E; Fontaine, Magali J",J. clin. pathol,488,16

Knowledge of laboratory tests associated with the prolonged need for mechanical ventilation may guide resource allocation. We hypothesized that an elevated plasma procalcitonin level (>0.1 ng/ml) would be associated with the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19, who were admitted to any of our health system's hospitals between March 9th-April 20th, 2020 and required invasive mechanical ventilation, were eligible for this observational cohort study. Demographics, comorbidities, components of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score, and procalcitonin levels on admission were obtained from the electronic health record. The primary outcome was the duration of mechanical ventilation; secondary outcomes included 28-day mortality and time to intubation. Outcomes were assessed within the first 28 days of admission. Baseline demographics and comorbidities were summarized by descriptive statistics. Univariate comparisons were made using Pearson's chi-square test for binary outcomes and Mann-Whitney U test for continuous outcomes. A multiple linear regression was fitted to assess the association between procalcitonin levels and the duration of mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: Patients with an initial procalcitonin level >0.1 ng/ml required a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation than patients with a level of &#8804;0.1 ng/ml (p = 0.021) in the univariate analysis. There was no significant difference in 28-day mortality or time to intubation between the two groups. After adjusted analysis using multivariable linear regression, the duration of mechanical ventilation was, on average, 5.6 (p = 0.016) days longer in patients with an initial procalcitonin level >0.1 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of 93 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients, we found an association between an initial plasma procalcitonin level >0.1 ng/ml and the duration of mechanical ventilation. These findings may help to identify patients at risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation upon admission.","Krause, Martin; Douin, David J; Tran, Timothy T; Fernandez-Bustamante, Ana; Aftab, Muhammad; Bartels, Karsten",PLoS One,488,24

This has been dubbed as the MH 'second wave'. In Australia, these impacts have been partly mitigated by institutional responses such as increased access to psychotherapy. Consultation Liaison (CL) psychiatry services provide MH care to acutely unwell patients in general hospitals. It was hypothesised that the number of referrals to the studied service had increased since the start of the pandemic. METHODS: From the Electronic medical records (eMRs), the authors collected daily referral numbers, over 3 consecutive years, to a large CL service in metropolitan Sydney. RESULTS: Referrals were significantly increased by 25%, 95% CI [1.14, 1.36], p < .001 since the start of the pandemic. This increase was delayed, and remained elevated despite a reduction in COVID-19 infections. CONCLUSION: This study adds evidence to the existence of the MH 'second wave', highlights a key impact on healthcare workers' well-being and will assist in guiding resource allocation decisions in the near future.","Lele, Kiran; Cartoon, Jodi; Griffiths, Alison",Australas Psychiatry,488,16

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common feature of severe forms of COVID-19 and can lead to respiratory failure, especially in older individuals. The increasing recognition of the neurotropic potential of SARS-CoV-2 has sparked interest in the role of the nervous system in respiratory failure in people with COVID-19. However, the neuroimmune interactions in the lung in the context of ARDS are poorly understood. In this Perspectives article, we propose the concept of the neuroimmune unit as a critical determinant of lung function in the context of COVID-19, inflammatory conditions and ageing, focusing particularly on the involvement of the vagus nerve. We discuss approaches such as neurostimulation and pharmacological neuromodulation to reduce tissue inflammation with the aim of preventing respiratory failure.","De Virgiliis, Francesco; Di Giovanni, Simone",Nat Rev Neurol,488,16

As such, when an infectious disease outbreak, epidemic, or pandemic occurs-particularly when it is associated with a novel pathogen-the question will naturally arise as to whether the pathogen can be transmitted through breastfeeding. Until high-quality data are generated to answer this question, abandonment of breastfeeding due to uncertainty can result. The COVID-19 pandemic, which was in full swing at the time this document was written, is an excellent example of this scenario. During these times of uncertainty, it is critical for investigators conducting research to assess the possible transmission of pathogens through milk, whether by transfer through the mammary gland or contamination from respiratory droplets, skin, breast pumps, and milk containers, and/or close contact between mother and infant. To promote the most rigorous science, it is critical to outline optimal methods for milk collection, handling, storage, and analysis in these situations, and investigators should openly share their methods in published materials. Otherwise, the risks of inconsistent test results from preanalytical and analytical variation, false positives, and false negatives are unacceptably high and the ability to provide public health guidance poor.

While a fast and reliable IgG response has been reported for samples from hospitalized COVID-19 patients, less is known about ambulatory patients. We evaluated the SARS-CoV-2-IgG response by the Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA IgG (Euroimmun) in a defined cohort of SARS-CoV-2-PCR-confirmed outpatients and asymptomatic contact persons including 137 serum samples from PCR-confirmed outpatients (n = 111) and asymptomatic but PCR-positive contact persons (n = 26) sent to our laboratory as part of routine diagnostics for determination of SARS-CoV-2-IgG. Overall positivity rate for SARS-CoV-2-IgG was 81.1 % in outpatients (irrespective of sampling before or after day 21 after onset of symptoms) but significantly lower in asymptomatic contact persons (15.4 %, p < 0.0001). In contact persons without symptoms the ct values of the PCR assays were significantly higher (5-7 threshold cycles) than in outpatients, and ct values were significantly negative correlated to the SARS-CoV-2-IgG ratio, suggesting a lower viral load as a possible explanation for lower rate of seropositivity. In summary, our study shows that serological response to SARS-CoV-2 in outpatients including asymptomatic persons is less pronounced than in hospitalized patients. Further controlled studies are urgently needed to determine serological response in outpatients and asymptomatic persons since this is the main target population for seroepidemiological investigations.","Wellinghausen, Nele; Plonné, Dietmar; Voss, Meike; Ivanova, Ralitsa; Frodl, Reinhard; Deininger, Susanne",J Clin Virol,488,3

This study aimed to analyze the impact of influenza A virus (IAV) exposure on COVID-19. METHODS: Seventy COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital during January and February 2020 in Wuhan, China were included in this retrospective study. Serum tests including respiratory pathogen immunoglobulin M (IgM) and inflammation biomarkers were performed upon admission. Patients were divided into common, severe, and critical types according to disease severity. Symptoms, inflammation indices, disease severity, and fatality rate were compared between anti-IAV IgM-positive and anti-IAV IgM-negative groups. The effects of the empirical use of oseltamivir were also analyzed in both groups. For comparison between groups, t tests and the Mann-Whitney U test were used according to data distribution. The Chi-squared test was used to compare disease severity and fatality between groups. RESULTS: Thirty-two (45.71%) of the 70 patients had positive anti-IAV IgM. Compared with the IAV-negative group, the positive group showed significantly higher proportions of female patients (59.38% vs. 34.21%, &#967;â=â4.43, Pâ=â0.035) and patients with fatigue (59.38% vs. 34.21%, &#967;â=â4.43, Pâ=â0.035). The levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (median 791.00 vs. 1075.50 IU/mL, Zâ=â-2.70, Pâ=â0.007) and tumor necrosis factor &#945; (median 10.75 vs. 11.50 pg/mL, Zâ=â-2.18, Pâ=â0.029) were significantly lower in the IAV-positive group. Furthermore, this group tended to have a higher proportion of critical patients (31.25% vs. 15.79%, Pâ=â0.066) and a higher fatality rate (21.88% vs. 7.89%, Pâ=â0.169). Notably, in the IAV-positive group, patients who received oseltamivir had a significantly lower fatality rate (0 vs. 36.84%, Pâ=â0.025) compared with those not receiving oseltamivir. CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that during the flu season, close attention should be paid to the probability of IAV exposure in COVID-19 patients. Prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to clarify whether IAV increases the fatality rate of COVID-19 and to elucidate any benefits of empirical usage of oseltamivir.","Hu, Zhan-Wei; Wang, Xi; Zhao, Jian-Ping; Ma, Jing; Li, Hai-Chao; Wang, Guang-Fa; Cheng, Yuan; Zhang, Hong",Chin Med J (Engl),488,26

A survey of the World Health Organization adapted to the local context was applied. Open-ended questions were included to study people's feelings about COVID-19, and content analysis was subsequently conducted. In terms of results, it is revealed that the population surveyed feels uncertainty, fear and anguish, albeit a feeling of responsibility and care in the face of COVID-19 also emerges. Moreover, positive feelings regarding society stand out as an achievement of social interdependence. The results obtained show that the impact on mental health differs in accordance with gender, educational level, and perceived comfort in the home. The study concludes that the emotional and bonding dimensions of people are central to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. It is recommended that these dimensions, as well as their subjective and differential social impact among the different population groups, should be considered in the planning of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johnson, María Cecilia; Saletti-Cuesta, Lorena; Tumas, Natalia",Cien Saude Colet,488,16

While most epigenetic studies have been performed in severely ill COVID-19 patients, studies on individuals who have recovered from mild-to-moderate disease remain scarce. The aim of this study was to assess epigenome-wide DNA methylation patterns in COVID-19 convalescents compared to uninfected controls from before and after the pandemic outbreak began. MethodsDNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells originating from uninfected controls before (Pre20, n=5) and after (Con, n=18) 2020, COVID-19 convalescents (CC19, n=14) and symptom-free individuals with a SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response (SFT, n=6), as well as from Pre20 (n=4) samples stimulated in vitro with SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, epigenome-wide DNA methylation analyses were performed using the Illumina MethylationEPIC 850K array, and statistical and bioinformatic analyses comprised differential DNA methylation, pathway over-representation and module identification network analyses. ResultsDNA methylation patterns of COVID-19 convalescents were altered as compared to uninfected controls, with similar results observed in in vitro stimulations of PBMC with SARS-CoV-2. Differentially methylated genes from the in vivo comparison constituted the foundation for the identification of a possibly SARS-CoV-2-induced module, containing 66 genes of which six could also be identified in corresponding analyses of the in vitro data (TP53, INS, HSPA4, SP1, ESR1 and FAS). Pathway over-representation analyses revealed involvement of Wnt, cadherin and apoptosis signalling pathways amongst others. Furthermore, numerous interactions were found between the obtained differentially methylated genes from both settings and the network analyses when overlaying the data unto the SARS-CoV-2 interactome. ConclusionsEpigenome-wide DNA methylation patxterns of individuals that have recovered from mild-to-moderate COVID-19 are different from those of non-infected controls. The observed alterations during both in vivo and in vitro exposure to SARS-CoV-2 showed involvement in interactions and pathways that are highly relevant to COVID-19. The present study provides indications that DNA methylation is one of several epigenetic mechanisms that is altered upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further studies on the mechanistic underpinnings should determine whether the observed effects are reflecting host-protective antiviral defence or targeted viral hijacking to evade host defence.","Huoman, Johanna; Sayyab, Shumaila; Apostolou, Eirini; Karlsson, Lovisa; Porcile, Lucas; Rizwan, Muhammad; Sharma, Sumit; Das, Jyotirmoy; Rosen, Anders; Lerm, Maria",,488,16

We apply three consecutive waves of the Dutch Housing Demand Survey (WoON) in a repeated cross-section setting, with data collected at the time of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and its aftermath. We find that households desire to move down the urban hierarchy during the volatile and uncertain periods following the GFC. This is a surprising result, given that urban areas are generally considered more opportunity rich. In order to uncover the mechanisms driving this result, we considered the impact of the economic circumstances on the general willingness to move and on the underlying motives. We find that willingness to move increased when the adverse economic consequences of the GFC hit Dutch households. Further, it appears that this willingness to move is only partially related to work. Besides work, desires to move for health, education, vicinity to family and friends, and reasons related to the dwelling, also become more prevalent during the aftermath of the GFC as well. This heterogeneity in impacts and consequences for household desired mobility serves to explain some of the mixed results in the literature, and generates lessons for current and future crises such as the Covid-19 pandemic.","van Leeuwen, Eveline S; Venhorst, Viktor A",J Geogr Syst,488,24

Eighty-four patients were used as training cohort and 40 patients as validation cohort. Logistic regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to develop and evaluate the prognostic prediction model.In the training cohort, the mean age was 63.4â±â1.5âyears, and male patients (48, 57%) were predominant. Forty-three (52%) recovered, and 41 (49%) progressed to critical. Decreased lymphocyte count (LC, odds ratio [OR]â=â4.40, Pâ=â.026), elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (LDH, ORâ=â4.24, Pâ=â.030), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP, ORâ=â1.01, Pâ=â.025) at admission were independently associated with higher odds of deteriorated outcome.

A protective vaccine and more effective therapeutics are urgently needed. We evaluated a new poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, stenoparib, that recently advanced to phase II clinical trials for treatment of ovarian cancer, for activity against human respiratory coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, in vitro Stenoparib exhibits dose-dependent suppression of SARS-CoV-2 multiplication and spread in Vero E6 monkey kidney and Calu-3 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Stenoparib was also strongly inhibitory to the human seasonal respiratory coronavirus HCoV-NL63. Compared to remdesivir, which inhibits viral replication downstream of cell entry, stenoparib impedes entry and postentry processes, as determined by time-of-addition (TOA) experiments. Moreover, a 10 µM dosage of stenoparib-below the approximated 25.5 µM half-maximally effective concentration (EC50)-combined with 0.5 µM remdesivir suppressed coronavirus growth by more than 90%, indicating a potentially synergistic effect for this drug combination. Stenoparib as a stand-alone or as part of combinatorial therapy with remdesivir should be a valuable addition to the arsenal against COVID-19.IMPORTANCE New therapeutics are urgently needed in the fight against COVID-19. Repurposing drugs that are either already approved for human use or are in advanced stages of the approval process can facilitate more rapid advances toward this goal. The PARP inhibitor stenoparib may be such a drug, as it is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer and its safety and dosage in humans have already been established. Our results indicate that stenoparib possesses strong antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses in vitro. This activity appears to be based on multiple modes of action, where both pre-entry and postentry viral replication processes are impeded. This may provide a therapeutic advantage over many current options that have a narrower target range. Moreover, our results suggest that stenoparib and remdesivir in combination may be especially potent against coronavirus infection.","Stone, Nathan E; Jaramillo, Sierra A; Jones, Ashley N; Vazquez, Adam J; Martz, Madison; Versluis, Lora M; Raniere, Marlee O; Nunnally, Haley E; Zarn, Katherine E; Nottingham, Roxanne; Ng, Ken R; Sahl, Jason W; Wagner, David M; Knudsen, Steen; Settles, Erik W; Keim, Paul; French, Christopher T",mBio (Online),488,16

However, there are still few data on COVID-19 occurring in hematologic patients. METHODS: One hundred two patients with COVID-19 symptoms and a nasopharyngeal swab positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 seen at 2 hematologic departments located in Lombardy, Italy, during March 2020 were studied. Risk factors for acquiring COVID-19 were analyzed by comparisons of patients with COVID-19 and the standard hematologic population managed at the same institutions in 2019. Thirty-day survival was compared with the survival of matched uninfected control patients with similar hematologic disorders and nonhematologic patients affected by COVID-19. RESULTS: Male sex was significantly more prevalent in patients with COVID-19. The infection occurred across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring a COVID-19 infection was lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive-related treatments. The 30-day mortality rate was 39.2%, which was higher than the rates for nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) and uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001). The severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and active hematologic treatment were independently associated with a worse prognosis. Neither diagnosis nor disease status affected the prognosis. The worst prognosis was demonstrated among patients on active hematologic treatment and those with more severe respiratory syndrome at COVID-19 presentation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients should be advised to seek medical attention at the earliest signs of dyspnea and/or respiratory infection. Physicians should perform a risk-benefit analysis to determine the impact of temporarily deferring nonlifesaving treatments versus the risk of adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19. LAY SUMMARY: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection occurs across all different types of hematologic disease; however, the risk of acquiring it is lower for patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including chronic myeloid leukemia, and higher for patients with immune-mediated anemia on immunosuppressive treatment. The 30-day mortality rate is 39.2%, which is far higher than the rates for both uninfected hematologic controls (3%; P < .001) and nonhematologic patients with COVID-19 (23.5%; P = .02) despite matching for age, sex, comorbidities, and severity of disease. Variables independently associated with a worse prognosis are the severity of the respiratory syndrome at presentation and any type of active hematologic treatment.

To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an increased prevalence of accidental hand sanitizer/alcoholic beverage exposure in children and adolescents, we compared pediatric hospitalization rates during COVID-19 and the previous year. For poisoning admissions during COVID-19, we also evaluated the cause by age and clinical outcomes. Methods This retrospective data linkage study evaluated data from the Legal Medicine Organization (reporting mortalities) and hospitalization data from nine toxicology referral centers for alcohol-poisoned patients (age 0 to 18 years) for the study period (February 23 to June 22, 2020) and the pre-COVID-19 reference period (same dates in 2019). Results Hospitalization rates due to ethanol and methanol exposure were significantly higher in 2020 (n = 375) than 2019 (n = 202;OR [95% CI] 1.9 [1.6, 2.2], p < 0.001). During COVID-19, in patients ≤15 years, the odds of intoxication from hand sanitizers were significantly higher than from alcoholic beverages, while in 15- to 18-year-olds, alcoholic beverage exposure was 6.7 times more common (95% CI 2.8, 16.1, p < 0.001). Of 375 children/adolescents hospitalized for alcoholic beverage and hand sanitizer exposure in 2020, six did not survive. The odds of fatal outcome were seven times higher in 15- to 18-year-olds (OR (95% CI) 7.0 (2.4, 20.1);p < 0.001). Conclusion The Iranian methanol poisoning outbreak during the first wave of COVID-19 was associated with significantly increased hospitalization rates among children and adolescents?including at least six pediatric in-hospital deaths from poisoning.

The receiver consists of 5 beams. The four beams, located at the four corners of a square with the beam separation of 720$''$, are installed with a 100 GHz band SIS receiver having 2-polarization sideband-separation filter. The other beam, located at the optical axis, is installed with a 200 GHz band SIS receiver having 2-polarization sideband-separation filter. The cooled component is modularized for each beam, and cooled mirrors are used. The IF bandwidths are 8 and 4 GHz for 100 and 200 GHz bands, respectively. Using XFFTS spectrometers with a bandwidth of 2 GHz, the lines of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O of $J$=1$-$0 or $J$=2$-$1 can be observed simultaneously for each beam.

In this study, we describe a protein nanoparticle vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine is based on the display of coronavirus spike glycoprotein receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a synthetic virus-like particle (VLP) platform, SpyCatcher003-mi3, using SpyTag/SpyCatcher technology. Low doses of RBD-SpyVLP in a prime-boost regimen induce a strong neutralising antibody response in mice and pigs that is superior to convalescent human sera. We evaluate antibody quality using ACE2 blocking and neutralisation of cell infection by pseudovirus or wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Using competition assays with a monoclonal antibody panel, we show that RBD-SpyVLP induces a polyclonal antibody response that recognises key epitopes on the RBD, reducing the likelihood of selecting neutralisation-escape mutants. Moreover, RBD-SpyVLP is thermostable and can be lyophilised without losing immunogenicity, to facilitate global distribution and reduce cold-chain dependence. The data suggests that RBD-SpyVLP provides strong potential to address clinical and logistic challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Tiong Kit; Rijal, Pramila; Rahikainen, Rolle; Keeble, Anthony H; Schimanski, Lisa; Hussain, Saira; Harvey, Ruth; Hayes, Jack W P; Edwards, Jane C; McLean, Rebecca K; Martini, Veronica; Pedrera, Miriam; Thakur, Nazia; Conceicao, Carina; Dietrich, Isabelle; Shelton, Holly; Ludi, Anna; Wilsden, Ginette; Browning, Clare; Zagrajek, Adrian K; Bialy, Dagmara; Bhat, Sushant; Stevenson-Leggett, Phoebe; Hollinghurst, Philippa; Tully, Matthew; Moffat, Katy; Chiu, Chris; Waters, Ryan; Gray, Ashley; Azhar, Mehreen; Mioulet, Valerie; Newman, Joseph; Asfor, Amin S; Burman, Alison; Crossley, Sylvia; Hammond, John A; Tchilian, Elma; Charleston, Bryan; Bailey, Dalan; Tuthill, Tobias J; Graham, Simon P; Duyvesteyn, Helen M E; Malinauskas, Tomas; Huo, Jiandong; Tree, Julia A; Buttigieg, Karen R; Owens, Raymond J; Carroll, Miles W; Daniels, Rodney S; McCauley, John W",Nat Commun,488,33

Next, we exhibit linear fits which lack evidence of curvature, challenging the notion that athlete scores are leveling off or have reached their natural peak. Third, we examine the relationship in performance trends among men and women's categories of the same event, revealing striking similarity, together with some anomalous events. Finally, we analyze the geographic composition of the world's top athletes, attempting to understand how the diversity by country and continent varies over time across events. Again we challenge a widely held conception of athletics, that certain events are more geographically dominated than others. Our methods and findings could be applied more generally to identify evolutionary dynamics in group performance and highlight spatio-temporal trends in group composition.","James, Nick; Menzies, Max; Bondell, Howard",,488,30

Drawing from Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory, the study was guided by four null hypotheses. The quantitative research method based on the virtual cross-sectional survey design was adopted. A total of 8,591 academics in African universities were the targeted demographic of this study. However, data were collected from a virtual snowball sample of 1,977 respondents (males, N = 1347;females, N = 630) from 24 African countries. A validated electronic survey, with three major aspects, was employed for data collection. The e-survey was released on the Association of African Universities' Telegram forum, which includes 1,622 participants from diverse African nations and regions. Members of the forum, who are all academics, were invited to complete the survey and publish it on their universities' internet-based forums. Coded data were analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics such as the Kruskal Wallis Non-parametric test. The non-parametric test was used because the data failed to meet the normality assumptions required to perform a parametric test. Results indicated, amongst others, that there are considerable variances in staff preparedness to use internet-based channels for research communication based on their educational credentials, educational qualification, rank and areas of research interest. According to the survey, academics with a doctoral degree;grade II lecturers;staff with 3 to 6 years of service;and staff in the medical sciences demonstrated a higher propensity of readiness to use internet-based channels for research communication.

This is a systematic literature review that seeks to explore the transition, in the context of the pandemic, from traditional education that involves face-to-face interaction in physical classrooms to online distance education. It examines the ways in which this transition has impacted academia and students and looks at the potential long-term consequences it may have caused.

While early studies have uncovered some evidence of racial and ethnic differences in mask-wearing behavior, critical gaps remain. We begin to address these gaps by (1) more comprehensively investigating the role of race and ethnicity on mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) examining whether gender intersects with race and ethnicity to differently influence mask-wearing patterns. METHODS: Data were drawn from the COVID-19 Impact Survey, a cross-sectional, nationally representative survey of adults living in the U.S. Data were pooled from three time points that ranged from late April 2020 to early June 2020. The final analytic sample consisted of 4688 non-institutionalized adults living in the U.S. A series of logistic regression models with robust standard errors were used to estimate differences in mask-wearing patterns. RESULTS: Compared with White respondents, results revealed Black, Latina/o, and Asian respondents were more likely to report wearing a mask in response to the coronavirus. Moreover, results show White men were least likely to wear a mask from late April 2020 to early June 2020. CONCLUSION: Overall, findings demonstrate mask-wearing patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic are differently shaped by racial and ethnic background and gender. Findings from this study can inform targeted strategies designed to increase mask-wearing adherence among U.S. adults.","Hearne, Brittany N; Niño, Michael D",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),488,2

Viral-host interactions can guide discovery of disease regulators, and protein structure function analysis points to several immune pathways, including complement and coagulation, as targets of coronaviruses. To determine whether conditions associated with dysregulated complement or coagulation systems impact disease, we performed a retrospective observational study and found that history of macular degeneration (a proxy for complement-activation disorders) and history of coagulation disorders (thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and hemorrhage) are risk factors for SARS-CoV-2-associated morbidity and mortality-effects that are independent of age, sex or history of smoking. Transcriptional profiling of nasopharyngeal swabs demonstrated that in addition to type-I interferon and interleukin-6-dependent inflammatory responses, infection results in robust engagement of the complement and coagulation pathways. Finally, in a candidate-driven genetic association study of severe SARS-CoV-2 disease, we identified putative complement and coagulation-associated loci including missense, eQTL and sQTL variants of critical complement and coagulation regulators. In addition to providing evidence that complement function modulates SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome, the data point to putative transcriptional genetic markers of susceptibility.

DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Websites of known respiratory professional bodies were searched for COVID-19 guidance related to asthma. Subject matter experts were also consulted for useful resources. Resources that were targeted at healthcare professionals were included, while those targeting patients and the general public were excluded. RESULTS: There is currently little data to suggest that asthma protects from or increases the risk of COVID-19, nor is there any data to support strong recommendations for or against specific asthma treatments. Physicians should continue to manage asthma according to existing accepted asthma guidelines and recommendations. All prescribed medications, especially inhaled corticosteroids, should be continued, and, where indicated, oral corticosteroids and biologic therapies should still be used. Nebulizers and spirometry should be avoided where possible to reduce the risk of viral transmission. A detailed history should be taken to differentiate asthma exacerbations from COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Understanding similarities and differences among the recommendations of the various professional bodies will aid in medical decision-making in managing asthma in the COVID-19 pandemic.

OBJECTIVE: To review the association between maternal thyroid dysfunction and the risk of adverse outcomes in offspring. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library. STUDY SELECTIONS: Eligible studies reported the association between maternal thyroid hormone function and the risk of adverse outcomes in their children. DATA EXTRACTION: Reviewers extracted data on study characteristics and results independently. DATA SYNTHESIS: Estimates were pooled and reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). I2 tests were applied to assess the heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: We identified 29 eligible articles and found an association between maternal hyperthyroidism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (OR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.04 - 1.34, I2 = 0%) and epilepsy (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.08 - 1.31, I2 = 0%) in offspring; as well as an association of maternal hypothyroidism with increased risk of ADHD (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03 - 1.26, I2 = 25%), autism spectrum disorder (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.90, I2 = 63%) and epilepsy (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.39, I2 = 0%) in offspring.

This surge in death necessitates identification of resource needs and relies on modelling resource and understanding anticipated surges in demand. Our aim was to develop a generic computer model that could estimate resources required for end-of-life (EoL) care delivery during the pandemic. SETTING: A discrete event simulation model was developed and used to estimate resourcing needs for a geographical area in the South West of England. While our analysis focused on the UK setting, the model is flexible to changes in demand and setting. PARTICIPANTS: We used the model to estimate resourcing needs for a population of around 1 million people. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The model predicts the per-day 'staff' and 'stuff' resourcing required to meet a given level of incoming EoL care activity. RESULTS: A mean of 11.97 hours of additional community nurse time, up to 33 hours of care assistant time and up to 30 hours additional care from care assistant night sits will be required per day as a result of out of hospital COVID-19 deaths based on the model prediction. Specialist palliative care demand is predicted to increase up to 19 hours per day. An additional 286 anticipatory medicine bundles per month will be necessary to alleviate physical symptoms at the EoL care for patients with COVID-19: an average additional 10.21 bundles of anticipatory medication per day. An average additional 9.35 syringe pumps could be needed to be in use per day. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis for a large region in the South West of England shows the significant additional physical and human resource required to relieve suffering at the EoL as part of a pandemic response.","Chalk, Daniel; Robbins, Sara; Kandasamy, Rohan; Rush, Kate; Aggarwal, Ajay; Sullivan, Richard; Chamberlain, Charlotte",BMJ Open,488,1

Understanding the dynamics of the disease spread and the effectiveness of the interventions is essential in predicting its future evolution. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to simulate the effect of different social distancing interventions and investigate whether their timing and stringency can lead to multiple waves (subepidemics), which can provide a better fit to the wavy behavior observed in the infected population curve in the majority of countries. METHODS: We have designed and run agent-based simulations and a multiple wave model to fit the infected population data for many countries. We have also developed a novel Pandemic Response Index to provide a quantitative and objective way of ranking countries according to their COVID-19 response performance. RESULTS: We have analyzed data from 18 countries based on the multiple wave (subepidemics) hypothesis and present the relevant parameters. Multiple waves have been identified and were found to describe the data better. The effectiveness of intervention measures can be inferred by the peak intensities of the waves. Countries imposing fast and stringent interventions exhibit multiple waves with declining peak intensities. This result strongly corroborated with agent-based simulations outcomes. We also provided an estimate of how much lower the number of infections could have been if early and strict intervention measures had been taken to stop the spread at the first wave, as actually happened for a handful of countries. A novel index, the Pandemic Response Index, was constructed, and based on the model's results, an index value was assigned to each country, quantifying in an objective manner the country's response to the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the COVID-19 pandemic can be successfully modeled as a series of epidemic waves (subepidemics) and that it is possible to infer to what extent the imposition of early intervention measures can slow the spread of the disease.","Kaxiras, Efthimios; Neofotistos, Georgios",J Med Internet Res,488,32

To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the people at high risk of infection. Hence, we aimed (i) to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, (ii) to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk, and (iii) to compare it with unspecific scores. METHODS: Retrospective case-control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each person with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS) was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. Discriminant power was used to compare SIS performance with that of other comorbidity scores. RESULTS: Subjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinson's disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS = 4) 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS = 1).

It has been shown that SARS-CoV2 binds to ACE2. Covid-19 may infect NK cells to suppress their functions, as NK cells express angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines in Covid-19 infection may have played a crucial role in lymphodepletion. Although not published in Covid-19, other RNA viruses that cause acute pulmonary infections promote NK cell apoptosis. In NK/T-cell lymphoma plasma EBV-DNA is a sensitive surrogate biomarker of lymphoma load. In this case, we also notice a dramatic transient reduction in plasmatic EBV-DNA viral copies during Covid-19 pneumonia other than NK clonal cells reduction, and after the infection resolution we described a lymphoma relapse as well as EBV-DNA increase and the rising in NK clonal cells count. Although the mechanism leading to spontaneous remission remain uncharacterized, we hypothezised that a favorable adaptive immunity against concurrent viral infection could render an enhanced anti-tumor effect. We suppose COVID-19 infection have induced a transient remission in this patient affected with NK neoplasm.","Pasin, Federico; Mascalchi Calveri, Matteo; Calabrese, Alberto; Pizzarelli, Ginevra; Bongiovanni, Isabel; Andreoli, Michele; Cattaneo, Chiara; Rignanese, Giovanni",Acta Biomed,488,16

Fragile patients are at high risk of developing complications such as pneumonia and may die from it. Limited information is available on the extent of the circulation of respiratory viruses in the hospital setting. Most knowledge relates to influenza viruses (FLU) but several other viruses produce flu-like illness. The study was conducted at the University Hospital Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy. Clinical and laboratory data from hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections during the period October 2016-March 2019 were analysed. The retrospective analysis included 17 viral agents detected by FilmArray test and clinical data from medical records and hospital discharge sheets. Models were adjusted for relevant confounders such as clinical severity and risk of death, socio-demographic characteristics and surgical procedures. From a total of 539 specimens analysed, 180 (33.39%) were positive for one or more respiratory viruses. Among them, 83 (46.1 %) were positive for influenza viruses (FLU), 36 (20%) rhino/enteroviruses (RHV/EV), 17 (9.44%) human coronaviruses (HCOV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63, and -OC43), 17 (9.44%) respiratory syncytial virus, 15 (8.33%) human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 8 (4.44%) parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and 4 (2.22%) adenoviruses (ADV). The distribution of viral agents varied across age groups and month of detection. The positive specimens were from 168 patients [102 M, 66 F; median age (range): 64 years (19-93)]. Overall, 40% of them had a high-grade clinical severity and a 27% risk of death; 27 patients died and 22 of them (81.5%) had received a clinical diagnosis of pneumonia. Respiratory viral infections may have a severe course and a poor prognosis in hospitalized patients, due to underlying comorbidities. Monitoring the circulation of respiratory viruses in hospital settings is important to improve diagnosis, prevention and treatment.","Ciotti, Marco; Maurici, Massimo; Santoro, Viviana; Coppola, Luigi; Sarmati, Loredana; De Carolis, Gerardo; De Filippis, Patrizia; Pica, Francesca",,488,32

This study aimed to investigate changes in preventive behaviors during the first three months of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. METHOD: This cross-sectional survey was conducted on 1477 adults aged 18years and older in 31 provinces of Iran. Data was collected by an anonymous online questionnaire. RESULT: Overall, engagement in preventive behaviors was relatively acceptable and more than 45% of subjects always carried out all preventive behaviors. Engaging in the all preventive behaviors had a peak in the second month and obviously declined during third month. Engagement in some preventive behaviors such as ""wearing a face mask"" and ""keeping a safe distance from others"" observed less than other behaviors. There was statistically significant difference in the engagement in preventive behaviors by gender and occupation (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Although engagement in preventive behaviors was relatively acceptable at first two months of the outbreak, it has declined gradually. This is a warning for public health decision makers. COVID-19 is still a crucial issue in Iran and it is necessary that government decision be based on the fact that Iranian people must live with a coronavirus for months, with full caution and compliance toward all preventive care protocols.","Shamsalinia, Abbas; Mohammadi, Sepideh; Ghaffari, Fatemeh; Arazi, Tajmohammad",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,488,5

METHODS: Overall, 231 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 as proven by PCR were included in this study. Based on the duration of hospitalization, patients were divided into three groups as follows: Group 1, patients receiving outpatient treatment or requiring hospitalization <7 days; Group 2, requiring hospitalization &#8805;7 days; Group 3, patients requiring at least 1 day of intensive care at any time. Chest CT findings at first admission were evaluated for the following features: typical/atypical involvement of the disease, infiltration patterns (ground-glass opacities, crazy-paving pattern, consolidation), distribution and the largest diameters of the lesions, total lesion numbers, number of affected lung lobes, and affected total lung parenchyma percentages. The variability of all these findings according to the groups was analyzed statistically. RESULTS: In this study, 172 patients were in Group 1, 39 patients in Group 2, and 20 patients in Group 3. The findings obtained in this study indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in ground-glass opacity rates among the groups (p = 0.344). The rates of crazy-paving and consolidation patterns were significantly higher in Groups 2 and 3 than in Group 1 (p = 0.001, p = 0.002, respectively). The rate of right upper, left upper lobe, and right middle lobe involvements as consolidation pattern was significantly higher in Group 3 than in Group 1 (p = 0.148, p = 0.935, p = 0.143, respectively). A statistically significant difference was also found between the affected lobe numbers, total lesion numbers, the diameter of the largest lesion, and the affected lung parenchyma percentages between the groups (p = 0.001). The average number of impacted lobes in Group 1 was 2; 4 in Group 2 and Group 3. The mean percentage of affected lung parenchyma percentage was 25% in Group 1 and Group 2, and 50% in Group 3. CONCLUSION: In case of infiltration dominated by right middle or upper lobe involvement with a consolidation pattern, there is a higher risk of future intensive care need. Also, the need for intensive care increases as the number of affected lobes and percentage of affected parenchymal involvement increase.","Tekcan Sanli, Deniz Esin; Yildirim, Duzgun; Sanli, Ahmet Necati; Erozan, Neval; Husmen, Guray; Altundag, Aytug; Tuzuner, Filiz; Dikensoy, Oner; Erel Kirisoglu, Ceyda",Diagn. interv. radiol,488,5

Therefore, the purpose of this review was to identify relevant peer-reviewed literature in this area to thematically produce evidence-based recommendations that would inform community planning and response amongst homeless populations. Although this review is inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic, our intention was to produce relevant recommendations to for all current and future outbreaks and pandemics more generally. Our search criteria focused on pandemics and rapid-spread illnesses such as contagious respiratory diseases with contact spread and with an emphasis on individuals experiencing homelessness. Content analysis methods were followed to extract and thematically synthesise key information amongst the 223 articles that matched our search criteria between the years of 1984 and 2020. Two reviewers were assigned to the screening process and used Covidence and undertook two rounds of discussion to identify and finalise themes for extraction. This review illustrates that the current breadth of academic literature on homeless populations has thus far focused on tuberculosis (TB) rather than diseases that are more recent and closely related to COVID-19-such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or H1N1. Our thematic content analysis revealed six themes that offer tangible and scalable recommendations which include (1) education and outreach, (2) adapting structure of services, (3) screening and contract tracing, (4) transmission and prevention strategies, (5) shelter protocols and (6) treatment, adherence and vaccination. The breadth and depth of reviews such as these are dependent on the quantity and quality of the available literature. Therefore, the limited existing literature outside of tuberculosis specific to homelessness in this review illustrates a need for more academic research into the intersections of pandemics and homelessness-particularly for evaluations of response and planning. Nonetheless, this review offers timely considerations for pandemic response and planning amongst homeless populations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and can facilitate future research in this area.","Babando, Jordan; Quesnel, Danika A; Woodmass, Kyler; Lomness, Arielle; Graham, John R",Heal. soc. care community,488,21

Given the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness and uptake of a vaccine, it is important that the search for treatments continue. An exaggerated inflammatory state is likely responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in COVID-19. Elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, have been shown to be associated with increased COVID-19 mortality. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, TNF blockade reduces not only biologically active TNF but other pro-inflammatory cytokines important in COVID-19 hyperinflammation.

This may result in insufficient blood components to meet every patient's needs resulting in difficult decisions about which patients with major bleeding do and do not receive active transfusion support. This document, which was prepared on behalf of the National Blood Transfusion Committee in England, provides a framework and triage tool to guide the allocation of blood for patients with massive haemorrhage during severe blood shortage. Its goal is to provide blood transfusions in an ethical, fair, and transparent way to ensure that the greatest number of life years are saved. It is based on an evidence- and ethics-based Canadian framework, and would become operational where demand for blood greatly exceeds supply, and where all measures to manage supply and demand have been exhausted. The guidance complements existing national shortage plans for red cells and platelets.","Doughty, Heidi; Green, Laura; Callum, Jeannie; Murphy, Michael F",Br J Haematol,488,25

To characterize statewide seroprevalence and point prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Rhode Island.Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of randomly selected households across Rhode Island in May 2020. Antibody-based and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for SARS-CoV-2 were offered. Hispanics/Latinos and African Americans/Blacks were oversampled to ensure adequate representation. Seroprevalence estimations accounted for test sensitivity and specificity and were compared according to age, race/ethnicity, gender, housing environment, and transportation mode.Results. Overall, 1043 individuals from 554 households were tested (1032 antibody tests, 988 PCR tests). The estimated seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 2.1% (95% credible interval [CI] = 0.6, 4.1). Seroprevalence was 7.5% (95% CI = 1.3, 17.5) among Hispanics/Latinos, 3.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 15.0) among African Americans/Blacks, and 0.8% (95% CI = 0.0, 2.4) among non-Hispanic Whites. Overall PCR-based prevalence was 1.5% (95% CI = 0.5, 3.1).Conclusions. Rhode Island had low seroprevalence relative to other settings, but seroprevalence was substantially higher among African Americans/Blacks and Hispanics/Latinos. Rhode Island sits along the highly populated northeast corridor, making our findings broadly relevant to this region of the country. Continued monitoring via population-based sampling is needed to quantify these impacts going forward.","Chan, Philip A; King, Ewa; Xu, Yizhen; Goedel, William; Lasher, Leanne; Vargas, Matt; Brindamour, Ken; Huard, Richard; Clyne, Ailis; McDonald, James; Bandy, Utpala; Yokum, David; Rogers, Michelle L; Chambers, Laura; Napoleon, Siena C; Alexander-Scott, Nicole; Hogan, Joseph W",Am J Public Health,488,25

We designed an adhesive, gas-tight, and self-healing supramolecular polysiloxane-dimethylglyoxime-based polyurethane (PDPU) porous elastomer based on segmented oxime-carbamate-urea. It is an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with trapped air within closed voids, exhibiting ultrahigh static surface potential and excellent compressibility. This porous PDPU generates electricity from interactions between the trapped air and the elastomeric matrix under periodical compression. The positively charged trapped air (or other gas) dominates the tribo-electrification with PDPU, inducing electron transfer from gas to the solid polymer for electricity generation. The self-healable elastomer renders gas-solid interacted triboelectric nanogenerator, GS-TENG, with high stretchability (~1200%). The inherently adhesive surface enables adherance to other substrates, allowing mechanical energy harvesting from deformations such as bending, twisting, and stretching.

In adult mice, KRM maintain their population through self-renewal with little or no input from the peripheral blood. Despite recent data suggesting that a transcriptionally similar population of KRM-like cells is present across species, the idea that they are self-renewing and independent of peripheral blood input in other species has yet to be proven due to the lack of an appropriate model and cross-species expression markers. In this study, we use our recently identified cross-species KRM cell surface markers and parabiosis surgery in inbred Lewis rats to determine if rat KRM are maintained independent of peripheral blood input, similar to their mouse counterparts. Flow cytometry analysis indicates that parabiosis surgery in the rat results in establishment of chimerism of T/B cells, neutrophils, and monocyte-derived infiltrating macrophages in the blood, spleen, and kidney three weeks post parabiosis surgery. Analysis of KRM using the cell surface markers CD81 or C1q indicates that these cells have minimal chimerism and, therefore, receive little input from the peripheral blood. Thus, a putative KRM population in the rat identified using two novel cross-species markers is maintained with minimal input from the peripheral blood confirming that KRM properties are conserved in at least two different species.","Zimmerman, Kurt; Yang, Zhengqin; Lever, Jeremie M; Li, Zhang; Croyle, Mandy J; Agarwal, Anupam; Yoder, Bradley K; George, James","Am. j. physiol., Renal fluid electrolyte physiol",488,10

Objective: To examine caregiver-reported changes in the psychological well-being of their children 3 to 4 months after the start of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, and to examine the association of caregiver-reported COVID-19 exposure and family stressors with caregiver perceptions of child psychological well-being. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used an anonymous survey distributed via email from June 24 to July 15, 2020, to 350â¯000 families of students attending public schools in Chicago, Illinois. The a priori hypotheses were that caregivers would report worsening in child psychological well-being during the closure period compared with preclosure and that exposure to COVID-19-related stressors would be associated with a higher probability of worsening child psychological well-being. Data were analyzed from September 10, 2020, to March 15, 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were 7 mental health concerns and 5 positive adjustment characteristics reported by caregivers using a retrospective pre-post design. COVID-19 exposure and family stressors were also reported by caregivers. Results: Among 350â¯000 families invited to participate, 32â¯217 caregivers (10â¯827 [39.3%] White, 8320 [30.2%] Latinx, 6168 [22.4%] Black; 2223 [8.1%] with multiple or other races/ethnicities) completed the survey on behalf of 49â¯397 children in prekindergarten through 12th grade. Child-specific outcomes were reported for 40â¯723 to 40â¯852 children depending on the specific question. The frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth mental health concerns ranged from 0.1 percentage point (suicidal ideation or self-harm, reported by 191 caregivers [0.5%] preclosure vs 246 caregivers [0.6%] during closure; P < .001) to 28.3 percentage points (loneliness, reported by 1452 caregivers [3.6%] preclosure vs 13â¯019 caregivers [31.9%] during closure; P < .001) higher after the end of in-person instruction compared with preclosure. Frequency of caregiver endorsement of youth positive adjustment characteristics ranged from -13.4 percentage points (plans for the future, reported by 18â¯114 caregivers [44.3%] preclosure vs 12â¯601 caregivers [30.9%] during closure; P < .001) to -30.9 percentage points (positive peer relationships, reported by 24â¯666 caregivers [60.4%] preclosure vs 19â¯130 caregivers [46.8%] during closure; P < .001) lower after the end of in-person instruction. Significant differences in COVID-19 exposure were observed across racial/ethnic (F3,27â¯534 = 614.8; P < .001) and household income strata (F5,27â¯506 = 842.0; P < .001). After accounting for covariates, all mental health concerns increased in probability (eg, angry: odds ratio, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.48-1.62]; P < .001) and all the positive adjustment characteristics decreased in probability (eg, hopeful or positive: odds ratio, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.92]; P < .001) as COVID-19 exposure and family stressors increased. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study of caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 and resulting exposure to stress were associated with worse youth psychological well-being, demonstrating the need for a comprehensive public health approach that prioritizes children's well-being and draws broad public attention to the mental health needs of youth.","Raviv, Tali; Warren, Christopher M; Washburn, Jason J; Kanaley, Madeleine K; Eihentale, Liga; Goldenthal, Hayley Jane; Russo, Jaclyn; Martin, Caroline P; Lombard, Lisa S; Tully, Jamie; Fox, Kenneth; Gupta, Ruchi",JAMA Netw Open,488,16

The COVID-19 pandemic caused rapid shifts in the delivery of medical education to clerkship-level students. This article describes the successful pilot of a direct patient care, virtual health curriculum at the clerkship level and discusses lessons learned. APPROACH: All 18 preceptors and 5 students at Stanford University School of Medicine, California, enrolled in the required 4-week family medicine clerkship in April 2020 were connected as virtual partners via a commercial video platform. The combined use of both this video program and Epic electronic health record (EHR) software as modes for teaching and patient care led to technical challenges and logistical hurdles. As part of an iterative process, clerkship leadership identified problems via preceptor and student interviews and integrated that feedback in order to create a model for delivering high-quality, clerkship-level clinical instruction during the COVID-19 shelter in place order. OUTCOMES: Of those who completed an evaluation, the majority of preceptors (n = 16; 89%) and students (n = 4; 100%, 1 student did not respond) expressed satisfaction with the virtual, remote teaching model conducted over 37 clinic visits. A detailed 14-step process list resulted from identifying and addressing both audio and video technical challenges and is provided for use by other institutions that wish to implement this workflow. NEXT STEPS: Future directions include assessing patient perspectives on the involvement of students in virtual visits, soliciting patient input for a more robust patient-physician-student virtual experience, and integrating a multi-party platform, when available, via the EHR to afford greater student autonomy.","Rydel, Tracy A; Bajra, Rika; Schillinger, Erika",Acad. med,488,24

The isolate I0305/19 was clustered together with viruses in sublineage D of GI-19 lineage on the basis of the complete S1 sequence analysis. Isolate I0305/19 and other GI-19 viruses isolated in China have the amino acid sequence MIA at positions 110-112 in the S protein. Further analysis based on the complete genomic sequence showed that the isolate emerged through at least four recombination events between GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848- and GI-13 4/91-like strains, in which the S gene was found to be similar to that of the GI-19 ck/CH/LJS/120848-like strain. Pathological assessment showed the isolate was a nephropathogenic IBV strain that caused high morbidity of 100 % and mortality of 80 % in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. The isolate I0305/19 exhibited broader tropisms in different tissues, including tracheas, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, liver, kidneys, proventriculus, small intestines, large intestines, cecum, and cecal tonsils. Furthermore, subpopulations of the virus were found in tissues of infected chickens; this finding is important in understanding how the virulent IBV strains can potentially replicate and evolve to cause disease. This information is also valuable for understanding the mechanisms of replication and evolution of other coronaviruses such as the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2.","Hou, Yutong; Zhang, Lili; Ren, Mengting; Han, Zongxi; Sun, Junfeng; Zhao, Yan; Liu, Shengwang",Virus Res,488,16
501399,501399,501399,Global Solidarity is Necessary to End the COVID-19 Pandemic,17.643852,2.6723387,2020,"Background: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is responsible for over 83 million cases of infection and over 1.8 million deaths since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because COVID-19 infection is associated with a devastating mortality rate and myriad complications, it is critical that clinicians better understand its pathophysiology to develop effective treatment. Cumulative evidence is suggestive of cerebral aneurysms being intertwined with the hyperinflammatory state and hypercytokinemia observed in severe COVID-19 infections. Case Description: In case example 1, the patient presents with chills, a mild cough, and sore throat. The patient develops high-grade fever of 39.8° C, decreased oxygen saturation of 93% on room air, and an extensive spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the basal cisterns from a ruptured left posterior communicating artery aneurysm. In case example 2, the patient presents with a positive PCR test for COVID-19 2 weeks prior with spontaneous SAH and found to have a large multilobulated bulbous ruptured aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery. Both patients' symptoms and high-grade fever are consistent with hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state, with elevated granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, inducible protein-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, M1P1A, and tumor necrosis factor-a inflammatory mediators found to be elevated in COVID-19 intensive care unit admissions. Conclusion: COVID-19 effect on cerebral aneurysms requires future studies to clearly delineate correlation, however, hypercytokinemia and a hyperinflammatory state are strongly implicated to cause degenerative vascular changes that may predispose patients to cerebral aneurysm formation, change in size or morphology, and resultant aneurysm rupture.

METHODS We included 51,770 participants from a nationally representative, household-based health survey (PNS) conducted in Brazil. We estimated the proportion and number of adults (&#8805; 18 years) at risk of severe Covid-19 by sex, educational level, race/ethnicity, and state based on the presence of one or more of the following risk factors: age &#8805; 65 years or medical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, chronic kidney disease and moderate to severe asthma, smoking status, and obesity. RESULTS Adults at risk of severe Covid-19 in Brazil varied from 34.0% (53 million) to 54.5% (86 million) nationwide. Less-educated adults present a 2-fold higher prevalence of risk factors compared to university graduated. We found no differences by sex and race/ethnicity. São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, and Rio Grande do Sul were the most vulnerable states in absolute and relative terms of adults at risk. CONCLUSIONS Proportion and total number of adults at risk of severe Covid-19 are high in Brazil, with wide variation across states and adult subgroups. These findings should be considered while designing and implementing prevention measures in Brazil. We argue that these results support broad social isolation measures, particularly when testing capacity for SARS-CoV-2 is limited.","Rezende, Leandro F M; Thome, Beatriz; Schveitzer, Mariana Cabral; Souza-Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Szwarcwald, Célia Landmann",Rev Saude Publica,488,24

Currently, there is no worldwide-approved effective treatment for COVID-19, urging the scientific community to intense efforts to accelerate the discovery and development of prophylactic and therapeutic solutions against SARS-CoV-2 infection. In particular, effective antiviral drugs are urgently needed. With few exceptions, therapeutic approaches to combat viral infections have traditionally focused on targeting unique viral components or enzymes; however, it has now become evident that this strategy often fails due to the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. Targeting host factors that are essential for the virus life cycle, but are dispensable for the host, has recently received increasing attention. The spike glycoprotein, a component of the viral envelope that decorates the virion surface as a distinctive crown (""corona"") and is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, represents a key target for developing therapeutics capable of blocking virus invasion.

Meanwhile, the ecological impacts must be considered by researchers to minimize the hazardous effects of research laboratories. Favipiravir (FAV) is an antiviral agent recently approved for treatment of COVID-19 infections during 2020 pandemic crisis, so the size of its production by international pharmaceutical corporations evolved dramatically within the past few months. Two novel simple, sensitive, and green methods were developed and validated for FAV determination based on solvent-free micellar LC and spectrofluorimetry techniques. To improve FAV native fluorescence, several factors were studied including solvent type, buffering, pH and added surfactants. The best sensitivity for FAV fluorescence was obtained in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4) at 436 nm after excitation at 323 nm within concentration range of 20-350 ng mL-1. Another HPLC method was validated using C18-RP (5µm, 250 x 4.6 mm) stationary phase and solvent-free mobile phase consisting of (0.02M Brij-35, 0.15M SDS, and 0.02M disodium hydrogen phosphate, pH 5.0) isocratically eluted at a flow rate of 1 mL min-1 and detection wavelength of 323nm. LC method was validated across concentration range of 10-100 µg mL-1 and FAV eluted in 3.8 min. The methods were validated according to the FDA guidelines and were applied successfully for determination of FAV in its marketed tablet dosage forms and in spiked human plasma samples. The proposed methods are eco-friendly since they are typically based on biodegradable reagents in aqueous solvent-free phases, which was proven by their assessment on two recent greenness metrics (GAPI and AGREE) to prove their eco-friendly properties.","Mikhail, Ibraam E; Elmansi, Heba; Belal, Fathalla; Ehab Ibrahim, Adel",Microchem J,488,16

In our analysis, we consider climate risk, readiness to climate change and individualism as main indicators reflecting the climate and culture status of individual countries. Using data from 110 countries, we find that the greater the climate risk; the lower the readiness to climate change and the more individualistic the society, the higher the pandemic mortality rate. We also present a series of sensitivity checks and show that our findings are robust to different specifications, alternative definitions of the mortality rate; and different estimation methods. One policy implication arising from our results is that countries that were better prepared for the climate emergency were also better placed to fight the pandemic. Overall, countries in which individuals look after each other and the environment, creating sustainable societies, are better able to cope with climate and public health emergencies.","Ozkan, Aydin; Ozkan, Gulcin; Yalaman, Abdullah; Yildiz, Yilmaz",World Dev,488,16

At the same time, one should aim to ensure adequate care for urological emergencies and urgent urological treatments as far as possible, even during the pandemic. For this, patients must be prioritized individually, alternative therapy concepts must be considered and regional and supraregional cooperation must be used. Outpatient departments are of great importance in the care, examination and coordination of urological emergencies and urgent treatment. Urological clinics must prepare themselves to perform urgent operations and interventions on SARS-CoV­2-positive patients. Here, the creation of a separate, appropriately equipped emergency operating room to perform operations and interventions on SARS-CoV­2 patients should be considered. Furthermore strictly defined hygiene measures to protect employees in various clinical scenarios should be set up.","Kriegmair, M C; Kowalewski, K F; Lange, B; Heininger, A; Speck, T; Haas, H; Michel, M S",Urologe A,488,20

We aimed to investigate the potential use of saliva samples as a non-invasive tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19. METHODS: From 27 March to 4 April 2020, we prospectively collected saliva samples and a standard nasopharyngeal and throat swab in persons seeking care at an acute respiratory infection clinic in a university hospital during the outbreak of COVID-19. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed, and the results of the two specimens were compared. RESULTS: Two-hundred pairs of samples were collected. Sixty-nine (34.5%) individuals were male, and the median (interquartile) age was 36 (28-48) years. Using nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR as the reference standard, the prevalence of COVID-19 diagnosed by nasopharyngeal and throat swab RT-PCR was 9.5%. The sensitivity and specificity of the saliva sample RT-PCR were 84.2% (95% CI 60.4%-96.6%), and 98.9% (95% CI 96.1%-99.9%), respectively. An analysis of the agreement between the two specimens demonstrated 97.5% observed agreement (&#954; coefficient 0.851, 95% CI 0.723-0.979; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Saliva might be an alternative specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19. The collection is non-invasive, and non-aerosol generating. This method could facilitate the diagnosis of the disease, given the simplicity of specimen collection and good diagnostic performance.","Pasomsub, E; Watcharananan, S P; Boonyawat, K; Janchompoo, P; Wongtabtim, G; Suksuwan, W; Sungkanuparph, S; Phuphuakrat, A",Clin. microbiol. infect,488,22

It is notable that in countries where latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is common and participating in the national Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination program, the case-fatality rates are relatively low throughout the world. In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the effects of the BCG vaccine and LTBI status on the course of the disease in patients diagnosed with coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection and to compare the LTBI rate with people with and without COVID-19 infection. The patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized during a period of seven months between May 1st to December 1st, 2020 were investigated by the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) test in the blood samples for the presence of LTBI. For the comparison of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and people without COVID-19 infections in terms of LTBI rate retrospectively; all consecutive patients who were sent blood samples to the mycobacteriology laboratory for the QFT-Plus test between January 2016 and December 2019 were included in the study. Demographic, clinical, radiological, laboratory, and follow-up data of the patients were obtained from the electronic patient file. A total of 170 patients (n= 9 8 male [57.6%], n= 72 female [42.3%], mean age= 53.5 ± 15.8 years) were enrolled. Twenty-five patients' (25/170 [14.7%]) QFT-plus tests were positive. When the cases with positive QFT-Plus test (n= 25) and the cases with negative QFT-Plus test (n = 145) were compared in terms of disease severity respectively; it was determined that mild/moderate patients were 18/25 (72%) and 108/145 (74.5%), severe patients were 7/25 (28%) and 37/145 (25.5%) (p= 0.988). When these two groups were compared in terms of the clinical course respectively; the need for intensive care was 6/25 (24%) and 34/145 (23.4%) (p= 1.00), oxygen therapy requirement was 13/25 (52%) and 49/145 (33.8%) (p= 0.128), and death was 5/25 (20%) and 18/145 (12.4%) (p= 0.341). QFT-Plus positivity was 25/170 (14.7%) in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, while in control group it was 198/496 (39.9%) (OR= 0.259, 95% CI [0.164-0.411], p<0.001). When the values were evaluated quantitatively, in the COVID-19 patient group, QFT-Plus T1/T2 (IU/ml) interferon (IFN)-É£ was 0.87 ± 1.52/0.62 ± 1.53, while in the control group it was 1.52 ± 3.69/1.50 ± 3.33 (p= 0.032, p= 0.04). There was no significant difference in the parameters investigated between 82 (48.2%) patients with BCG vaccine and those 88 (51.8%) without BCG vaccine. Although it was not statistically significant in our study, increased oxygen therapy requirement and higher mortality rates in the QFT-Plus positive group were remarkable. The detection of statistically significantly lower LTBI rates and T1-T2/IFN-É£ values in the COVID-19 group supported that SARS-CoV-2 infection may suppress lymphocyte functions in patients and IFN-É£ response. We believe that the results of our study are remarkably valuable, but more clinical studies are needed to elucidate the relationship between BCG vaccine, LTBI, and COVID-19 infection.","Erdem, Hüseyin Aytaç; Sanlidag, Gamze; Çinar, Ece; Yasar, Melike; Pullukçu, Hüsnü; Tasbakan, Mehmet Sezai; Çavusoglu, Cengiz; Gökengin, Deniz; Isikgöz Tasbakan, Meltem",Mikrobiyol Bul,488,16

Here we identify a hitherto unknown role of CX3CR1 in Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway mediated repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) in replicating cells. FA pathway activation triggers CX3CR1 nuclear localization which facilitates assembly of the key FA protein FANCD2 into foci. Interfering with CX3CR1 function upon ICL-induction results in inability of replicating cells to progress from S phase, replication fork stalling and impaired chromatin recruitment of key FA pathway factors. Consistent with defective FA repair, CX3CR1i results in increased levels of residual cisplatin-DNA adducts and decreased cell survival. Importantly, CX3CR1i synergizes with platinum agents in a nonreversible manner in proliferation assays including platinum resistant models. Taken together, our results reveal an unanticipated interplay between CX3CR1 and the FA pathway and show for the first time that a clinical-phase small molecule inhibitor targeting CX3CR1 might show benefit in improving responses to DNA crosslinking chemotherapeutics.","Lehto, Jemina; Huguet Ninou, Anna; Chioureas, Dimitrios; Jonkers, Jos; Gustafsson, Nina M S",,488,21

DESIGN: We present the results of a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial of colchicine for the treatment of moderate to severe COVID-19, with 75 patients allocated 1:1 from 11 April to 30 August 2020. Colchicine regimen was 0.5 mg thrice daily for 5 days, then 0.5 mg twice daily for 5 days. The primary endpoints were the need for supplemental oxygen, time of hospitalisation, need for admission and length of stay in intensive care unit and death rate. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients (36 for placebo and 36 for colchicine) completed the study. Median (and IQR) time of need for supplemental oxygen was 4.0 (2.0-6.0) days for the colchicine group and 6.5 (4.0-9.0) days for the placebo group (p<0.001). Median (IQR) time of hospitalisation was 7.0 (5.0-9.0) days for the colchicine group and 9.0 (7.0-12.0) days for the placebo group (p=0.003). At day 2, 67% versus 86% of patients maintained the need for supplemental oxygen, while at day 7, the values were 9% versus 42%, in the colchicine and the placebo groups, respectively (log rank; p=0.001). Two patients died, both in placebo group. Diarrhoea was more frequent in the colchicine group (p=0.26). CONCLUSION: Colchicine reduced the length of both, supplemental oxygen therapy and hospitalisation. The drug was safe and well tolerated. Once death was an uncommon event, it is not possible to ensure that colchicine reduced mortality of COVID-19.

The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is highly influenced by methodologies used for its isolation, concentration and RNA extraction. Although various viral concentration methods are currently employed, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, adsorption-extraction, ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration, to our knowledge, none of these methods have been standardized for use with a variety of wastewater matrices and/or different kits for RNA extraction and quantification. To address this, wastewater with different physical characteristics was seeded with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 and used to test the efficiency of PEG precipitation and adsorption-extraction to concentrate the virus from three physiochemically different wastewater samples, sourced from three distinct wastewater plants. Efficiency of viral concentration and RNA extraction was assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the recovery yields calculated. As co-purification of inhibitors can be problematic for subsequent detection, two commonly used commercial master mixes were assessed for their sensitivity and efficiency to detect two SARS-CoV-2 target nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences. Recovery rates varied greatly between wastewater matrices and concentration methods, with the highest and most reproducible recovery rates (46.6-56.7%) observed when SARS-CoV-2 was precipitated with PEG and detected by the Luna® Universal master mix. The adsorption-extraction method was less effective (0-21.7%). This study demonstrates that PEG precipitation is the more robust method, which translates well to varying wastewater matrices, producing consistent and reproducible recovery rates. Furthermore, it is compatible with different kits for RNA extraction and quantitation.","Sapula, Sylvia A; Whittall, Jonathan J; Pandopulos, Aaron J; Gerber, Cobus; Venter, Henrietta",Sci Total Environ,488,20

OBJECTIVE: To determine the bleeding risk with various intensities of anticoagulation in critically ill patients with COVID-19 compared with other respiratory viral illnesses (ORVI). PATIENTS/METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared the incidence of major bleeding in patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) within a single health system with COVID-19 versus ORVI. In the COVID-19 cohort, we assessed the effect of anticoagulation intensity received on ICU admission on bleeding risk. We performed a secondary analysis with anticoagulation intensity as a time-varying covariate to reflect dose changes after ICU admission. RESULTS: Four hundred and forty-three and 387 patients were included in the COVID-19 and ORVI cohorts, respectively. The hazard ratio of major bleeding for the COVID-19 cohort relative to the ORVI cohort was 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.86-1.86). In COVID-19 patients, an inverse-probability treatment weighted model found therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation on ICU admission had an adjusted hazard ratio of bleeding of 1.55 (95% CI: 0.88-2.73) compared with standard prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. However, when anticoagulation was assessed as a time-varying covariate and adjusted for other risk factors for bleeding, the adjusted hazard ratio for bleeding on therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation compared with standard thromboprophylaxis was 2.59 (95% CI: 1.20-5.57). CONCLUSIONS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 had a similar bleeding risk as ORVI patients. When accounting for changes in anticoagulation that occurred in COVID-19 patients, therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation was associated with a greater risk of major bleeding compared with standard thromboprophylaxis.","Halaby, Rim; Cuker, Adam; Yui, Jennifer; Matthews, Andrew; Ishaaya, Ella; Traxler, Elizabeth; Domenico, Christopher; Cooper, Tara; Tierney, Ann; Niami, Pardis; van der Rijst, Nathalie; Adusumalli, Srinath; Gutsche, Jacob; Giri, Jay; Pugliese, Steven; Hecht, Todd E H; Pishko, Allyson M",J Thromb Haemost,488,20

physicians per 1000 people in South Korea compared to Italian physicians per 1000 people in Italy However, both countries have a national healthcare system with universal healthcare coverage Despite this underlying similarity, the two countries addressed COVID-19 in nearly opposite manners South Korea employed technology and the holistic education of its physician community, despite having a smaller proportion of physicians in society, to its advantage by implementing efficacious drive-through centers that test suspected individuals rapidly and with little to no contact with healthcare staff, decreasing the possibility of transmission of COVID-19 Conversely, Italy is presently considered the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe and has recorded the highest death toll of any country

Evidence from China,17.640018,2.9182022,2021,"Selecting causal inference models for estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) from observational data presents a unique challenge since the counterfactual outcomes are never observed. The problem is challenged further in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access to labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that achieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples are available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods under the UDA setting. In particular, we propose selecting models whose predictions of interventions' effects satisfy known causal structures in the target domain. Experimentally, our method selects ITE models that are more robust to covariate shifts on several healthcare datasets, including estimating the effect of ventilation in COVID-19 patients from different geographic locations.","Kyono, Trent; Bica, Ioana; Qian, Zhaozhi; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,488,16

The system is made up of a variety of proteins which function to deliver intracellular cargo to lysosomes for formation of autophagosomes in which the contents are degraded. The maintenance of cellular homeostasis is key in the survival and function of a variety of human cell populations. The interconnection between metabolism and autophagy is extensive, therefore it has a role in a variety of different cell functions. The disruption or dysfunction of autophagy in these cell types have been implicated in the development of a variety of inflammatory diseases including asthma. The role of autophagy in non-immune and immune cells both lead to the pathogenesis of lung inflammation. Autophagy in pulmonary non-immune cells leads to tissue remodeling which can develop into chronic asthma cases with long term effects. The role autophagy in the lymphoid and myeloid lineages in the pathology of asthma differ in their functions. Impaired autophagy in lymphoid populations have been shown, in general, to decrease inflammation in both asthma and inflammatory disease models. Many lymphoid cells rely on autophagy for effector function and maintained inflammation. In stark contrast, autophagy deficient antigen presenting cells have been shown to have an activated inflammasome. This is largely characterized by a TH17 response that is accompanied with a much worse prognosis including granulocyte mediated inflammation and steroid resistance. The cell specificity associated with changes in autophagic flux complicates its targeting for amelioration of asthmatic symptoms. Differing asthmatic phenotypes between TH2 and TH17 mediated disease may require different autophagic modulations. Therefore, treatments call for a more cell specific and personalized approach when looking at chronic asthma cases. Viral-induced lung inflammation, such as that caused by SARS-CoV-2, also may involve autophagic modulation leading to inflammation mediated by lung resident cells. In this review, we will be discussing the role of autophagy in non-immune cells, myeloid cells, and lymphoid cells for their implications into lung inflammation and asthma. Finally, we will discuss autophagy's role viral pathogenesis, immunometabolism, and asthma with insights into autophagic modulators for amelioration of lung inflammation.","Painter, Jacob D; Galle-Treger, Lauriane; Akbari, Omid",Front Immunol,488,1

COVID-19 also reports an increased prevalence of comorbidities, similar to patients with Sleep disorder breathing (SDB). OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between undiagnosed SDB and the risk of ARDS and pulmonary abnormalities in a cohort of patients' survivors of COVID-19 between 3 and 6 months after diagnosis. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of patients who developed ARDS during hospitalization due to COVID-19 compared with a control group of patients who had COVID-19 with mild to moderate symptoms. All patients were evaluated between the 12th and 24th week after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The evaluation includes persistent symptoms, lung diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), chest CT scan and home sleep apnea test. SDB was diagnosed by the respiratory disturbance index &#8805;5 ev/h. The association between SDB and ARDS, the hazards of lung impairment and the hazard ratios (HR) were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients were included (ARDS: 34 patients, Control: 26 patients). The mean follow-up was 16 weeks (range 12-24). ARDS reported a high prevalence of SDB (79% vs. 38% in control group). A total of 35% reported DLCO impairment, and 67.6% abnormal chest CT. SDB was independently associated to ARDS, OR 6.72 (CI, 1.56-28.93), p < 0.01, and abnormal Chest CT, HR 17.2 (CI, 1.68-177.4, p = 0.01). Besides, ARDS, days in mechanical ventilation, male gender were also associated with an increased risk of abnormal chest CT. CONCLUSION: Undiagnosed SDB is prevalent and independently associated with ARDS. In addition, undiagnosed SDB increased the hazard of abnormal Chest CT in the midterm.

Despite the numerousin-silico approaches, the virus-host relationship remains a serious concern. MicroRNAs are the small non-coding RNAs that help in regulating gene profiling. The current study utilized miRNA prediction tools along with the PANTHER classification system to demonstrate association and sequence similarities shared between miRNAs of SARS-CoV2 and human host. METHOD: An in-silico approach was carried out using Vmir analyzer to predict miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes. Predicted miRNAs from SARS-CoV2 viral genomes were used for effective hybridization sequence identification along the nucleotide similarities with human miRNAs from miRbase database. Further, it was proceeded to analyze the gene ontology using miRDB with PANTHER classification. RESULT: Based on the prediction and analysis, we have identified 22 potential miRNAs from five genomes of SARS-CoV2 linked with 12 human miRNAs. Analysis of human miRNAs hsa-mir-1267, hsa-mir-1-3p, hsa-mir-5683 were found shared between all the five viral SARS-CoV2 miRNAs. Further, PANTHER classification analyzed the gene-ontology being carried by these associations showed that 44 genes were involved in biological functions that includes genes specific for signaling pathway, immune complex generation, enzyme binding with effective role in the virus-host relationship. CONCLUSION: Our analysis concludes that the genes identified in this study can be effective in analyzing the virus-host interaction. It also provides a new direction to understand viral pathogenesis with a probable new way to link, that can be used to understand and relate the miRNAs of the virus to the host conditions.","Sarma, Abhijit; Phukan, Homen; Halder, Neha; Madanan, Madathiparambil Gopalakrishnan",Comput Biol Chem,488,16

In particular the early events causing ammonia-induced toxicity to astrocytes are not well understood. Using established cellular HE models, we show that mitochondria rapidly undergo fragmentation in a reversible manner upon hyperammonemia. Further, within a timescale of minutes mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis were hampered which occurred in a pH-independent manner. Using metabolomics an accumulation of numerous amino acids, including branched chain amino acids and glucose was observed. Metabolomic tracking of 15N-labeled ammonia showed rapid incorporation of 15N into glutamate and glutamate-derived amino acids. Downregulating human GLUD2, encoding mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (GDH2), inhibiting GDH2 activity by SIRT4 overexpression, and supplementing cells with glutamate or glutamine alleviated ammonia-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration. Metabolomic tracking of 13C-glutamine showed that hyperammonemia can inhibit anaplerosis of TCA-cycle intermediates. Contrary to its classical anaplerotic role, we show that under hyperammonemia GDH2 rather catalyzes the removal of ammonia by reductive amination of &#945;-ketoglutarate which efficiently and rapidly inhibits the TCA-cycle. Overall, we propose a critical GDH2-dependent mechanism in HE models that on the one hand helps to remove ammonia but on the other hand impairs energy metabolism in mitochondria rapidly.","Drews, Leonie; Zimmermann, Marcel; Westhoff, Philipp; Brilhaus, Dominik; Poss, Rebecca E; Bergmann, Laura; Wiek, Constanze; Brenneisen, Peter; Piekorz, Roland P; Mettler-Altmann, Tabea; Weber, Andreas P M; Reichert, Andreas S",Dis. model. mech.

METHODS: We review the current experience of conventional cardiovascular drugs [angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, anticoagulants, acetosalicylic acid, antiarrhythmic drugs, statins] as well as some other drug classes (antidiabetic drugs, vitamin D and NSAIDs) frequently used by older patients with cardiovascular diseases. Data were sought from clinical databases for COVID-19 and appropriate key words. Conclusions and recommendations are based on a consensus among all authors. RESULTS: Several cardiovascular drugs have a potential to protect patients with COVID-19, although evidence is largely based on retrospective, observational studies. Despite propensity score adjustments used in many analyses observational studies are not equivalent to randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Ongoing RCTs include treatment with antithrombotics, pulmonary vasodilators, RAAS-related drugs, and colchicine. RCTs in the acute phase of COVID-19 may not, however, recognise the benefits of long term anti-atherogenic therapies, such as statins. CONCLUSIONS: Most current cardiovascular drugs can be safely continued during COVID-19. Some drug classes may even be protective.

Therefore, knowing the frequency and characteristics of these manifestations of COVID-19 is important for both clinicians and health policy makers. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the available data on the gastrointestinal and liver manifestations of patients with COVID-19 was performed.

There are scanty data from India on the prevalence of liver injury in corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHODS: We did this retrospective study in a tertiary care hospital, Chennai, India. Patients aged >18 years admitted with COVID-19 from May 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, were included. We noted the demographic details, symptoms at presentation, history of pre-existing illnesses, and laboratory tests. We also recorded the patient's clinical course and outcome. RESULTS: We took 445 patients for final analysis. Aspartate transaminase (AST) was borderline elevated in 47.5%, mildly elevated in 11.2%, moderately elevated in 2% and severely in 0.7%. Alanine transaminase (ALT) was borderline elevated in 28.7%, mildly elevated in 11.4%, and moderately elevated in 1.3%. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase were abnormal in only 19 (4.2%) and 15 (3.3%) patients, respectively. Patients with abnormal LFT were more likely to be symptomatic (90.3% vs. 80.6%, p 0.002). Respiratory symptoms (43.5% vs. 29.7%) and loose stools (11.4% vs. 3.4%) were also more common among them. Patients with abnormal LFT were more likely to have severe disease (25.2% vs. 13.6%, p value 0.003) and mortality (8.8% vs. 0.7%). CONCLUSION: Liver test abnormalities were widespread in patients with COVID-19. Most of the patients had borderline or mild transaminase elevation. Despite only mild changes, patients with abnormal LFT were more likely to be symptomatic and had more severe disease and mortality.","Saithanyamurthi, Hemamala V; Munirathinam, Manoj; Ananthavadivelu, Murali",Indian J Gastroenterol,488,24

In the past decades, the incidence of IFIs has continuously increased. More recently, SARS-CoV-2-associated lethal IFIs have been reported worldwide in critically ill patients. Combating IFIs requires a more profound understanding of fungal pathogenicity to facilitate the development of novel antifungal strategies. Animal models are indispensable for studying fungal infections and to develop new antifungals. However, using mammalian animal models faces various hurdles including ethical issues and high costs, which makes large-scale infection experiments extremely challenging. To overcome these limitations, we optimized an invertebrate model and introduced a simple calcofluor white (CW) staining protocol to macroscopically and microscopically monitor disease progression in silkworms (Bombyx mori) infected with the human pathogenic filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Lichtheimia corymbifera. This advanced silkworm A. fumigatus infection model could validate knockout mutants with either attenuated, strongly attenuated or unchanged virulence. Finally, CW staining allowed us to efficiently visualize antifungal treatment outcomes in infected silkworms. Conclusively, we here present a powerful animal model combined with a straightforward staining protocol to expedite large-scale in vivo research of fungal pathogenicity and to investigate novel antifungal candidates.","Yu, Yidong; Wolf, Ann-Katrin; Thusek, Sina; Heinekamp, Thorsten; Bromley, Michael; Krappmann, Sven; Terpitz, Ulrich; Voigt, Kerstin; Brakhage, Axel A; Beilhack, Andreas",,488,24

Despite their utility, comprehensive autopsy studies are somewhat lacking relative to the global burden of disease, and very few comprehensive studies contextualize the findings to other fatal viral infections. We developed a novel autopsy protocol in order to perform postmortem examinations on victims of COVID-19 and herein describe detailed clinical information, gross findings, and histologic features observed in the first 16 complete COVID-19 autopsies. We also critically evaluated the role of ancillary studies used to establish a diagnosis of COVID-19 at autopsy, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and electron microscopy (EM). IHC and ISH targeting SARS-CoV-2 were comparable in terms of the location and number of infected cells in lung tissue; however, nonspecific staining of bacteria was seen occasionally with IHC. EM was unrevealing in blindly sampled tissues. We then compared the clinical and histologic features present in this series to six archival cases of fatal seasonal influenza and six archival cases of pandemic influenza from the fourth wave of the 'Spanish Flu' in the winter of 1920. In addition to routine histology, the inflammatory infiltrates in the lungs of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza victims were compared using quantitative IHC. Our results demonstrate that the clinical and histologic features of COVID-19 are similar to those seen in fatal cases of influenza, and the two diseases tend to overlap histologically. There was no significant difference in the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in COVID-19 and influenza at sites of acute lung injury at the time of autopsy. Our study underscores the relatively nonspecific clinical features and pathologic changes shared between severe cases of COVID-19 and influenza, while also providing important caveats to ancillary methods of viral detection.","McMullen, Phillip; Pytel, Peter; Snyder, Alexis; Smith, Heather; Vickery, Jasmine; Brainer, James; Guzy, Robert; Wu, David; Schoettler, Nathan; Adegunsoye, Ayodeji; Sperling, Anne; Hart, John; Alpert, Lindsay; Chang, Anthony; Gurbuxani, Sandeep; Krausz, Thomas; Husain, Aliya N; Mueller, Jeffrey","J. pathol., Clin. res",488,24

However, biases in tractography data, particularly near the boundary between white matter and cortical grey matter can limit the accuracy of such studies. When seeding from the white matter, streamlines tend to travel parallel to the convoluted cortical surface, largely avoiding sulcal fundi and terminating preferentially on gyral crowns. When seeding from the cortical grey matter, streamlines generally run near the cortical surface until reaching deep white matter. These so-called ""gyral biases"" limit the accuracy and effective resolution of cortical structural connectivity profiles estimated by tractography algorithms, and they do not reflect the expected distributions of axonal densities seen in invasive tracer studies or stains of myelinated fibres. We propose an algorithm that concurrently models fibre density and orientation using a divergence-free vector field within gyral blades to encourage an anatomically-justified streamline density distribution along the cortical white/grey-matter boundary while maintaining alignment with the diffusion MRI estimated fibre orientations. Using in vivo data from the Human Connectome Project, we show that this algorithm reduces tractography biases. We compare the structural connectomes to functional connectomes from resting-state fMRI, showing that our model improves cross-modal agreement. Finally, we find that after parcellation the changes in the structural connectome are very minor with slightly improved interhemispheric connections (i.e, more homotopic connectivity) and slightly worse intrahemispheric connections when compared to tracers.","Cottaar, Michiel; Bastiani, Matteo; Boddu, Nikhil; Glasser, Matthew F; Haber, Suzanne; van Essen, David C; Sotiropoulos, Stamatios N; Jbabdi, Saad",Neuroimage,488,20

A reliable laboratory assay is essential both to confirm suspected patients and to exclude patients infected with other respiratory viruses, thereby facilitating the control of global outbreak scenarios. CONTENT: In this review, we focus on the genomic, transmission, and clinical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, and comprehensively summarize the principles and related details of assays for SARS-CoV-2. We also explore the quality assurance measures for these assays. SUMMARY: SARS-CoV-2 has some unique gene sequences and specific transmission and clinical features that can inform the conduct of molecular and serological assays in many aspects, including the design of primers, the selection of specimens, and testing strategies at different disease stages. Appropriate quality assurance measures for molecular and serological assays are needed to maintain testing proficiency. Because serological assays have the potential to identify later stages of the infection and to confirm highly suspected cases with negative molecular assay results, a combination of these two assays is needed to achieve a reliable capacity to detect SARS-CoV-2.","Shi, Jiping; Han, Dongsheng; Zhang, Runling; Li, Jinming; Zhang, Rui",Clin Chem,488,24

One possible way to decrease the LoD is to optimize nanoparticle properties that are used as labels. We compare two types of Au nanoparticles: usual quasispherical gold nanoparticles (C-GNPs), obtained by the Turkevich-Frens method, and superspherical gold nanoparticles (S-GNPs), obtained by a progressive overgrowth technique. Average diameters were 18.6-47.5 nm for C-GNPs and 20.2-90.4 nm for S-GNPs. Cardiomarker troponin I was considered as the target analyte. Adsorption and covalent conjugation with antibodies were tested for both GNP types. For C-GNPs, the minimal LoD was obtained with 33.7 nm nanoparticles, reaching 12.7 ng/mL for covalent immobilization and 9.9 ng/mL for adsorption. The average diameter of S-GNPs varied from 20.2 to 64.5 nm, which resulted in a decrease in LoD for an LFIA of troponin I from 3.4 to 1.2 ng/mL for covalent immobilization and from 2.9 to 2.0 ng/mL for adsorption. Thus, we obtained an 8-fold decrease in LoD (9.9 to 1.2 ng/mL) by using S-GNPs. This effect can be related to more effective antibody immobilization and improved S-GNP optical properties. The obtained results can improve LFIAs for various practically significant analytes.","Byzova, Nadezhda A; Zherdev, Anatoly V; Khlebtsov, Boris N; Burov, Andrey M; Khlebtsov, Nikolai G; Dzantiev, Boris B",,488,24

This ""exercise is medicine"" (E=M) concept can be used to prevent, manage, and cure various lifestyle-related chronic diseases. Due to several challenges, E=M is not yet routinely implemented in clinical care. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the rationale and design of the Physicians Implement Exercise = Medicine (PIE=M) study, which aims to facilitate the implementation of E=M in hospital care. METHODS: PIE=M consists of 3 interrelated work packages. First, levels and determinants of PA in different patient and healthy populations will be investigated using existing cohort data. The current implementation status, facilitators, and barriers of E=M will also be investigated using a mixed-methods approach among clinicians of participating departments from 2 diverse university medical centers (both located in a city, but one serving an urban population and one serving a more rural population). Implementation strategies will be connected to these barriers and facilitators using a systematic implementation mapping approach. Second, a generic E=M tool will be developed that will provide tailored PA prescription and referral. Requirements for this tool will be investigated among clinicians and department managers. The tool will be developed using an iterative design process in which all stakeholders reflect on the design of the E=M tool. Third, we will pilot-implement the set of implementation strategies, including the E=M tool, to test its feasibility in routine care of clinicians in these 2 university medical centers. An extensive learning process evaluation will be performed among clinicians, department managers, lifestyle coaches, and patients using a mixed-methods design based on the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: This project was approved and funded by the Dutch grant provider ZonMW in April 2018. The project started in September 2018 and continues until December 2020 (depending on the course of the COVID-19 crisis). All data from the first work package have been collected and analyzed and are expected to be published in 2021. Results of the second work package are described. The manuscript is expected to be published in 2021. The third work package is currently being conducted in clinical practice in 4 departments of 2 university medical hospitals among clinicians, lifestyle coaches, hospital managers, and patients. Results are expected to be published in 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The PIE=M project addresses the potential of providing patients with PA advice to prevent and manage chronic disease, improve recovery, and enable healthy ageing by developing E=M implementation strategies, including an E=M tool, in routine clinical care. The PIE=M project will result in a blueprint of implementation strategies, including an E=M screening and referral tool, which aims to improve E=M referral by clinicians to improve patients' health, while minimizing the burden on clinicians.","Krops, Leonie A; Bouma, Adrie J; Van Nassau, Femke; Nauta, Joske; van den Akker-Scheek, Inge; Bossers, Willem Jr; Brügemann, Johan; Buffart, Laurien M; Diercks, Ronald L; De Groot, Vincent; De Jong, Johan; Kampshoff, Caroline S; Van der Leeden, Marike; Leutscher, Hans; Navis, Gerjan J; Scholtens, Salome; Stevens, Martin; Swertz, Morris A; Van Twillert, Sacha; Van der Velde, Joeri; Zwerver, Johannes; Van der Woude, Lucas Hv; Van Mechelen, Willem; Verhagen, Evert Alm; Van Keeken, Helco G; Van der Ploeg, Hidde P; Dekker, Rienk",JMIR Res Protoc,488,26

The choice of a satisfactory experimental model to be used in research on neuroprotective agents has been the basis of these studies. In the present investigation, the cat was chosen as an experimental model of ischemia and the condition was evaluated on the basis of two parameters, i.e., mitochondrial respiration and swelling. The animals used in the experiment (N = 32) were divided into four groups; three groups of 10 animals each were submitted to progressively increasing periods of ischemia (15, 30 and 60 minutes), and the last group (N = 2) was not submitted to ischemia. Clear changes in the curves of energized mitochondrial swelling were observed in the animals submitted to 60 minutes of ischemia when the ischemic side was compared to the control, and this occurrence was even clearer when the antibiotic alameticin was added during the laboratory assays of swelling. It is possible to find these conclusions: swelling is an indicator of mitochondrial differentiation between tissues; brain mitochondrion when exposed to effects of alameticin presents a different sensibility if is comparison to other tissues; brain mitochondria submitted to ischemia during 60 minutes became more sensibility to alameticin; and finally, brain mitochondria have an extremely fast installation of reversion swelling.","Câmara, RLB; Roselino, JES; Colli, BO",Acta cir. bras.,488,14

These findings are that teachers and others base their ideas about teaching on the long apprenticeship of observation as students; they derive their satisfaction from the psychic rewards of teaching – the emotional satisfaction and feedback that teachers got from students; and they work in conservative cultures of individualism. Design/methodology/approach: The article appraises Lortie's foundational text in relation to contemporary public domain surveys and op-ed articles about the impact of the pandemic on teaching and learning. Findings: COVID-19 created conditions that undermined traditional psychic rewards, weakened the tenuous student–teacher relationship as more students found schooling less engaging, began to give parents distorted observations of teaching online and made teacher collaboration more difficult. Research limitations/implications: Due to the current nature of the pandemic and the shortage of just-in-time original data, the research relies on rapid responses and op-ed perceptions rather than on an established body of literature and database. Practical implications: The postpandemic agenda holds out three ways to modernize Lortie's agenda in ways that advance the presence and impact of professional capital. These ways comprise new psychic rewards for students and not just teachers, a more open professionalism that is actively inclusive of parents and collaborative professionalism that has greater strength and depth. Social implications: Educational reform in the postpandemic age must be transformational and not seek to return to normal. Originality/value: The paper gives new meaning to Lortie's original ideas on COVID-19 circumstances.","Hargreaves, Andy; Fullan, Michael",J. Prof. Cap. Comm.,488,16

It employed a descriptive approach using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results can be summarized into 4 overarching themes: (1) process of implementation, (2) issues addressed, (3) experiences, and (4) success stories. This intervention targeted the whole population, with a specific focus on quarantined/isolated individuals and selected vulnerable groups. COVID pandemic has sowed several negative emotions, such as anxiety; and stigma and fearful thoughts, including suicidal ideations; trepidation regarding family members; and misinfodemics in general. Social and religious corollaries of the pandemic have intensified the psychological agony. The study provides an overview of the psychosocial intervention adopted by the state during the pandemic, which has helped both the beneficiaries and the providers. It has also helped to promote positive thinking and change the attitude toward the disease among the beneficiaries. It is highly commendable that timely intervention could obviate quite a few psychiatric emergencies, including suicides and aggressive behaviors.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a piloted survey was administered to CR programs globally via REDCap from April to June 2020. The 50 members of the International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation (ICCPR) and personal contacts facilitated program identification. RESULTS: Overall, 1062 (18.3% program response rate) responses were received from 70/111 (63.1% country response rate) countries in the world with existent CR programs. Of these, 367 (49.1%) programs reported they had stopped CR delivery, and 203 (27.1%) stopped temporarily (mean = 8.3 ± 2.8 weeks). Alternative models were delivered in 322 (39.7%) programs, primarily through low-tech modes (n = 226,19.3%). Furthermore, 353 (30.2%) respondents were re-deployed, and 276 (37.3%) felt the need to work due to fear of losing their job, despite the perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 (mean = 30.0% ± 27.4/100). Also, 266 (22.5%) reported anxiety, 241(20.4%) were concerned about exposing their family, 113 (9.7%) reported increased workload to transition to remote delivery, and 105 (9.0%) were juggling caregiving responsibilities during business hours. Patients were often contacting staff regarding grocery shopping for heart-healthy foods (n = 333, 28.4%), how to use technology to interact with the program (n = 329, 27.9%), having to stop their exercise because they have no place to exercise (n = 303, 25.7%), and their risk of death from COVID-19 due to pre-existing cardiovascular disease (n = 249, 21.2%). Respondents perceived staff (n = 488, 41.3%) and patient (n = 453, 38.6%) personal protective equipment, as well as COVID-19 screening (n = 414, 35.2%), and testing (n = 411, 35.0%) as paramount to in-person service resumption. CONCLUSION: Given the estimated number of CR programs globally, these results suggest approximately 4400 CR programs globally have ceased or temporarily stopped service delivery. Those that remain open are implementing new technologies to ensure their patients receive CR safely, despite the challenges. HIGHLIGHTS: – COVID-19 has impacted cardiac rehabilitation (CR) delivery around the globe. – In this cross-sectional study, a survey was completed by 1062 (18.3%) CR programs from 70 (63.1%) countries. – The pandemic has resulted in at least temporary cessation of ~75% of CR programs, with others ceasing initiation of new patients, reducing components delivered, and/or changing of mode delivery with little opportunity for planning and training. – There is also significant psychosocial and economic impact on CR providers. – Alternative CR model (e.g., home-based, virtual) reimbursement advocacy is needed, to ensure safe, accessible secondary prevention delivery.","Ghisi, Gabriela Lima de Melo; Xu, Zhiming; Liu, Xia; Mola, Ana; Gallagher, Robyn; Babu, Abraham Samuel; Yeung, Colin; Marzolini, Susan; Buckley, John; Oh, Paul; Contractor, Aashish; Grace, Sherry L.",Global heart,488,5

The policy response to such pandemics will always have to include accurate monitoring of the spread, as this provides one of the few alternatives to total lockdown. However, COVID-19 diagnosis is currently performed almost exclusively by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Although this is efficient, automatable, and acceptably cheap, reliance on one type of technology comes with serious caveats, as illustrated by recurring reagent and test shortages. We therefore developed an alternative diagnostic test that detects proteolytically digested SARS-CoV-2 proteins using mass spectrometry (MS). We established the Cov-MS consortium, consisting of 15 academic laboratories and several industrial partners to increase applicability, accessibility, sensitivity, and robustness of this kind of SARS-CoV-2 detection. This, in turn, gave rise to the Cov-MS Digital Incubator that allows other laboratories to join the effort, navigate, and share their optimizations and translate the assay into their clinic. As this test relies on viral proteins instead of RNA, it provides an orthogonal and complementary approach to RT-PCR using other reagents that are relatively inexpensive and widely available, as well as orthogonally skilled personnel and different instruments. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022550.","Van Puyvelde, Bart; Van Uytfanghe, Katleen; Tytgat, Olivier; Van Oudenhove, Laurence; Gabriels, Ralf; Bouwmeester, Robbin; Daled, Simon; Van Den Bossche, Tim; Ramasamy, Pathmanaban; Verhelst, Sigrid; De Clerck, Laura; Corveleyn, Laura; Willems, Sander; Debunne, Nathan; Wynendaele, Evelien; De Spiegeleer, Bart; Judak, Peter; Roels, Kris; De Wilde, Laurie; Van Eenoo, Peter; Reyns, Tim; Cherlet, Marc; Dumont, Emmie; Debyser, Griet; t’Kindt, Ruben; Sandra, Koen; Gupta, Surya; Drouin, Nicolas; Harms, Amy; Hankemeier, Thomas; Jones, Donald J.

In an attempt to limit the spread of infection and to preserve healthcare resources, one commonly used strategy has been to postpone elective surgery, whilst maintaining the provision of anaesthetic care for urgent and emergency surgery. General anaesthesia with airway intervention leads to aerosol generation, which increases the risk of COVID‐19 contamination in operating rooms and significantly exposes the healthcare teams to COVID‐19 infection during both tracheal intubation and extubation. Therefore, the provision of regional anaesthesia may be key during this pandemic, as it may reduce the need for general anaesthesia and the associated risk from aerosol‐generating procedures. However, guidelines on the safe performance of regional anaesthesia in light of the COVID‐19 pandemic are limited. The goal of this review is to provide up‐to‐date, evidence‐based recommendations or expert opinion when evidence is limited, for performing regional anaesthesia procedures in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID‐19 infection. These recommendations focus on seven specific domains including: planning of resources and staffing; modifying the clinical environment; preparing equipment, supplies and drugs; selecting appropriate personal protective equipment; providing adequate oxygen therapy; assessing for and safely performing regional anaesthesia procedures; and monitoring during the conduct of anaesthesia and post‐anaesthetic care. Implicit in these recommendations is preserving patient safety whilst protecting healthcare providers from possible exposure.","Uppal, V.; Sondekoppam, R.

We aimed to compare the pattern of abnormal liver tests in SARS-CoV-2 patients with those of patients infected with influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), two non-hepatotropic respiratory viruses, and their association with in-hospital mechanical ventilation or death. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 1271 hospitalized patients (872 influenza, 218 RSV, and 181 SARS-Cov-2) in a tertiary medical center. We defined abnormal liver tests as GPT, GOT or GGT[≥]40IU/ML at any time-point during hospitalization. Results: Abnormal liver tests were mild-moderate in the majority of patients regardless of infection type but the majority of patients with influenza or RSV had a transaminases peak earlier during hospitalization compared to patients with SARS-Cov-2. Abnormal liver tests correlated with markers of severe disease across all types of infections, and were associated with mechanical ventilation or death, occurring mainly in patients with severe liver tests abnormalities (>200IU/L) (27.2%, 39.4% and 55.6% of patients with influenza, RSV or SARS-Cov-2). In multivariate analysis, controlling for age, gender, lymphopenia and CRP, liver tests abnormalities remained significantly associated with mechanical ventilation or death for influenza (OR= 3.047, 95% CI 1.518-6.117) and RSV (OR= 3.402, 95% CI 1.032- 11.220) but not for SARS-Cov-2 (OR= 0.995, 95% CI 0.198-4.989). These results were confirmed upon propensity score matching. Conclusions: Abnormal liver tests during hospitalization with different viral respiratory infections are common, may differ in their time-course and reflect disease severity. They are associated with worse outcomes, mainly in patients with severe liver test abnormalities, regardless of infection type.","Shafran, N.; Issachar, A.; Shochat, T.; Shafran, I.

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of outbreak in mass religious gathering and further to assess the preparedness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in this context. METHODS: The risk of COVID-19 outbreak in mass religious gathering was evaluated by using secondary COVID-19 cases and reproductive numbers. The preparedness of a series of NPIs for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in mass religious gathering was then assessed by using a density-dependent model. This approach was first illustrated by the Mazu Pilgrimage in Taiwan and validated by using the COVID-19 outbreak in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus (SCJ) religious gathering in South Korea. RESULTS: Through the strict implementation of 80% NPIs in the Mazu Pilgrimage, the number of secondary cases can be substantially reduced from 1508 (95% CI: 900–2176) to 294 (95% CI: 169–420) with the reproductive number (R) significantly below one (0.54, 95% CI: 0.31–0.78), indicating an effective containment of outbreak. The expected number of secondary COVID-19 cases in the SCJ gathering was estimated as 232 (basic reproductive number (R(0)) = 6.02) and 579 (R(0) = 2.50) for the first and second outbreak, respectively, with a total expected cases (833) close to the observed data on high infection of COVID-19 cases (887, R(0) = 3.00). CONCLUSION: We provided the evidence on the preparedness of NPIs for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in the context of mass religious gathering by using a density-dependent model.","Hsu, Chen-Yang; Chen, Ya-Mei; Su, Chiu-Wen; Ku, Mei-Sheng; Kim, Yeol; Jensen, Tim; Luh, Dih-Ling",J Formos Med Assoc,488,21

Our findings revealed significantly decreased levels of total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the severe group when compared with the non-severe group in a random effect model. Similarly, random effect model results demonstrated significantly lower levels of HDL-C and LDL-C in the non-survivor group when compared with the survivor group. The level of TC was also found to be decreased in the non-survivor group when compared to the survivor group in a fixed-effect model. Conclusion In conclusion, lipid profile is associated with both the severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Hence, a lipid profile may be used for assessing the severity and prognosis of COVID-19.

These infections are steadily increasing at an alarming rate, mostly among immunocompromised patients. The newly synthesized compounds (3a–3k) were characterized by physicochemical parameters and investigated for antimicrobial activity using the microdilution broth method to estimate minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC). Additionally, their antibiofilm activity and mode of action together with the effect on the membrane permeability in C. albicans were investigated. Biofilm biomass and its metabolic activity were quantitatively measured using crystal violet (CV) staining and tetrazolium salt (XTT) reduction assay. The cytotoxic effect on normal human lung fibroblasts and haemolytic effect were also evaluated. The results showed differential activity of the compounds against yeasts (MIC = 0.24–500 µg/mL) and bacteria (MIC = 125–1000 µg/mL). Most compounds possessed strong antifungal activity (MIC = 0.24–7.81 µg/mL). The compounds 3b, 3c and 3e, showed no inhibitory (at 1/2 × MIC) and eradication (at 8 × MIC) effect on C. albicans biofilm. Only slight decrease in the biofilm metabolic activity was observed for compound 3b. Moreover, the studied compounds increased the permeability of the membrane/cell wall of C. albicans and their mode of action may be related to action within the fungal cell wall structure and/or within the cell membrane. It is worth noting that the compounds had no cytotoxicity effect on pulmonary fibroblasts and erythrocytes at concentrations showing anticandidal activity. The present studies in vitro confirm that these derivatives appear to be a very promising group of antifungals for further preclinical studies.","Biernasiuk, Anna; Banasiewicz, Anna; Masłyk, Maciej; Martyna, Aleksandra; Janeczko, Monika; Baranowska-Łączkowska, Angelika; Malm, Anna; Łączkowski, Krzysztof Z.",Materials (Basel),488,1

Here, we employ a bioinformatics method, Prediction of T Cell Epitopes for Cancer Therapy, to analyze sequencing data from neuroblastoma patients and identify a recurrent anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutation (ALK R1275Q) that leads to two high affinity neoepitopes when expressed in complex with common HLA alleles. Analysis of the X-ray structures of the two peptides bound to HLA-B*15:01 reveals drastically different conformations with measurable changes in the stability of the protein complexes, while the self-epitope is excluded from binding due to steric hindrance in the MHC groove. To evaluate the range of HLA alleles that could display the ALK neoepitopes, we used structure-based Rosetta comparative modeling calculations, which accurately predict several additional high affinity interactions and compare our results with commonly used prediction tools. Subsequent determination of the X-ray structure of an HLA-A*01:01 bound neoepitope validates atomic features seen in our Rosetta models with respect to key residues relevant for MHC stability and T cell receptor recognition. Finally, MHC tetramer staining of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from HLA-matched donors shows that the two neoepitopes are recognized by CD8+ T cells. This work provides a rational approach toward high-throughput identification and further optimization of putative neoantigen/HLA targets with desired recognition features for cancer immunotherapy.","Toor, Jugmohit S.; Rao, Arjun A.; McShan, Andrew C.; Yarmarkovich, Mark; Nerli, Santrupti; Yamaguchi, Karissa; Madejska, Ada A.; Nguyen, Son; Tripathi, Sarvind; Maris, John M.; Salama, Sofie R.; Haussler, David; Sgourakis, Nikolaos G.",Front Immunol,488,20

While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing—both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing—and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples’ behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come.","Newbold, Stephen C.; Finnoff, David; Thunström, Linda; Ashworth, Madison; Shogren, Jason F.",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),488,1

Next came the lesser known Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) originating in Saudi Arabia in 2012 (Assiri et al., 2013), after which the Ebola outbreak in West Africa took place from 2014 to 2016, with a more recent occurrence in the Democratic Republic of Congo from 2018 to 2019 (Malvy, McElroy, de Clerck, Günther, & van Griensven, 2019). To date, the coronavirus (COVID‐19) outbreak that started in Wuhan, in the Hubei province of China, in late December 2019 seems to be eclipsing all of these previous infectious diseases in terms of its global reach and impact (Wang, Horby, Hayden, & Gao, 2020). After being declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency on 30 January 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020c), it was elevated to a pandemic status on 11 March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020d).

It invades host cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). This newly discovered virus can result in excessive inflammation and immune pathological damage, as shown by a decreased number of peripheral lymphocytes, increased levels of cytokines, and damages of lung, heart, liver, kidney, and other organs. Effective therapeutic modalities such as new antiviral drugs and vaccines against this emerging virus need to be thoroughly studied and developed. However, so far the only recognized but mild progress in this area is the screening of old drugs for new uses. Therefore, rapid and accurate laboratory SARS-CoV-2 testing approaches are the important basis of identification and blockage of COVID-19 transmission. For COVID-19 patients with different clinical classifications (mild, common, severe, and critically severe), dynamic monitoring of functional indicators of susceptible and vital organs is an important strategy for evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis. In this review, we summarized SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostic schemes, pathophysiological indices of tissues and organs of COVID-19 patients, and laboratory diagnostic strategies for distinct disease stages. Further, we discussed the importance of hierarchical management and dynamic observation in SARS-CoV-2 laboratory diagnostics. We then summed up the advance in SARS-CoV-2 testing technology and described the prospect of intelligent medicine in the prevention of infectious disease outbreaks.

As regional and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, families, and children grapple with the immediate public health impact of COVID-19, the rights and well-being of children, especially those who are already marginalized, have been overlooked. Those working with children have likely encountered unprecedented challenges and responded in innovative ways in efforts to address the needs and rights of all children. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a protocol for a large-scale, multinational study using a new smartphone app to capture the real-time experiences and perspectives of practitioners and policymakers supporting children and families during the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe in relation to a children’s human rights 4P framework of protection, provision, prevention, and participation. METHODS: This protocol describes a mixed methods survey utilizing a custom-built iOS and Android smartphone app called the COVID 4P Log for Children’s Wellbeing, which was developed in close consultation with 17 international key partner organizations. Practitioners and policymakers working with and for children’s well-being across 29 countries and 5 continents were invited to download the app and respond to questions over the course of 8 weeks. The anticipated large amount of qualitative and quantitative response data will be analyzed using content analysis, descriptive statistics, and word frequencies. RESULTS: Formal data collection took place from October 2020 until March 2021. Data analysis was completed in July 2021. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will directly inform the understanding of the ways in which COVID-19 has impacted practitioners’, managers’, and policymakers’ efforts to support children’s well-being in their practices, services, and policies, respectively. Innovative and ambitious in its scope and use of smartphone technology, this project also aims to inform and inspire future multinational research using app-based methodologies—the demand for which is likely to continue to dramatically rise in the COVID-19 era. Mitigating the risks of longitudinal remote data collection will help maximize the acceptability of the app, respondents’ sustained engagement, and data quality.

This study was designed to study various barriers perceived and experienced with poor mask usage among hospital staff from an otorhinolaryngological perspective. An online survey was conducted to study the awareness of health care professionals and other hospital staff about advantages and disadvantages of mask use. Total 100 questionnaire based responses were obtained using this method. The participants included the ministerial staff, nursing and paramedical staff and faculty and residents of various medical and surgical specialties. The data thus collected was analyzed to identify the perceived benefits and limitations in mask usage. The participants wore surgical mask more commonly (50%) as compared to N95 respirator and cloth mask. 58% of the participants were using masks due to professional need. Majority (40%) used masks for a period ranging from 4 to 8 h in a day. Most of the participants realized that the masks offered protection from aerosols (90%) and more than 60% also mentioned that it helped in avoiding touching the face inadvertently. 62% participants complained of fogging of vision while wearing masks and approximately 50% reported pain due to tight elastic bands, difficulty breathing through mask and excessive sweating in the masked area In non-pharmaceutical measures to contain the aerosol-associated pandemics, face masks play an important precautionary role. It is cheap, easy to use and protects against respiratory infections, pollution and allergies.

It soon became apparent that the incidence of pediatric COVID-19 was much lower than the adult form. Morbidity in children is characterized by a variable clinical presentation and course. Symptoms are similar to those of other acute respiratory viral infections, the upper airways being more affected than the lower airways. Thus far, over 90% of children who tested positive for the virus presented mild or moderate symptoms and signs. Most children were asymptomatic, and only a few cases were severe, unlike in the adult population. Deaths have been rare and occurred mainly in children with underlying morbidity. Factors as reduced angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor expression, increased activation of the interferon-related innate immune response, and trained immunity have been implicated in the relative resistance to COVID-19 in children, however the underlying pathogenesis and mechanism of action remain to be established. While at the pandemic outbreak, mild respiratory manifestations were the most frequently described symptoms in children, subsequent reports suggested that the clinical course of COVID-19 is more complex than initially thought. Thanks to the experience acquired in adults, the diagnosis of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection has improved with time. Data on the treatment of children are sparse, however, several antiviral trials are ongoing.

During the interval between February 19 and 23, 2020, Iran reported its first 43 cases with eight deaths. Three exported cases originating in Iran were identified, suggesting a underlying burden of disease in that country than is indicated by reported cases. A large epidemic in Iran could further fuel global dissemination of COVID-19. We sought to estimate COVID-19 outbreak size in Iran based on known exported case counts and air travel links between Iran and other countries, and to anticipate where infections originating in Iran may spread to next. We assessed interconnectivity between Iran and other countries using using International Air Transport Association (IATA) data. We used the methods of Fraser et al. to estimate the size of the underlying epidemic that would result in cases being observed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lebanon, and Canada. Time at risk estimates were based on a presumed 6 week epidemic age, and length of stay data for visitors to Iran derived from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). We evaluated the relationship between the strength of travel links with Iran, and destination country rankings on the Infectious Disease Vulnerability Index (IDVI), a validated metric that estimates the capacity of a country to respond to an infectious disease outbreak . Scores range between 0-1, with higher scores reflecting greater capacity to manage infectious outbreaks. UAE, Lebanon, and Canada ranked 3rd, 21st, and 31st, respectively, for outbound air travel volume from Iran in February 2019. We estimated that 18,300 (95% confidence interval: 3770 to 53,470) COVID-19 cases would have had to occur in Iran, assuming an outbreak duration of 1.5 months in the country, in order to observe these three internationally exported cases reported at the time of writing. Results were robust under varying assumptions about undiagnosed case numbers in Syria, Azerbaijan and Iraq. Even if it were assumed that all cases were identified in all countries with certainty, the ""best case"" outbreak size was substantial (1820, 95% CI: 380-5320 cases), and far higher than reported case counts. Given the low volumes of air travel to countries with identified cases of COVID-19 with origin in Iran (such as Canada), it is likely that Iran is currently experiencing a COVID-19 epidemic of significant size for such exportations to be occurring. This is concerning, both for public health in Iran itself, and because of the high likelihood for outward dissemination of the epidemic to neighbouring countries with lower capacity to respond to infectious diseases epidemics.","Tuite, Ashleigh R.; Bogoch, Isaac; Sherbo, Ryan; Watts, Alexander; Fisman, David N.; Khan, Kamran",,488,28

Given their relatively rare occurrence, the primary objective of this systematic review was to synthesize their clinical features, response to treatments, and clinical outcomes to better understand the nature of this neurologic consequence of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Patients with a history of COVID-19 infection were included if their reports provided adequate detail to confirm a diagnosis of ADEM or AHLE by virtue of clinical features, radiographic abnormalities, and histopathologic findings. Cases purported to be secondary to vaccination against COVID-19 or occurring in the context of a preexisting relapsing CNS demyelinating disease were excluded. Case reports and series were identified via PubMed on May 17, 2021, and 4 additional cases from the authors' hospital files supplemented the systematic review of the literature. Summary statistics were used to describe variables using a complete case analysis approach. RESULTS: Forty-six patients (28 men, median age 49.5 years, 1/3 >50 years old) were analyzed, derived from 26 case reports or series originating from 8 countries alongside 4 patient cases from the authors' hospital files. COVID-19 infection was laboratory confirmed in 91% of cases, and infection severity necessitated intensive care in 67%. ADEM occurred in 31 cases, whereas AHLE occurred in 15, with a median presenting nadir modified Rankin Scale score of 5 (bedridden). Anti-MOG seropositivity was rare (1/15 patients tested). Noninflammatory CSF was present in 30%. Hemorrhage on brain MRI was identified in 42%. Seventy percent received immunomodulatory treatments, most commonly steroids, IV immunoglobulins, or plasmapheresis. The final mRS score was ≥4 in 64% of patients with adequate follow-up information, including 32% who died. DISCUSSION: In contrast to ADEM cases from the prepandemic era, reported post–COVID-19 ADEM and AHLE cases were often advanced in age at onset, experienced severe antecedent infection, displayed an unusually high rate of hemorrhage on neuroimaging, and routinely had poor neurologic outcomes, including a high mortality rate. Findings are limited by nonstandardized reporting of cases, truncated follow-up information, and presumed publication bias.","Manzano, Giovanna S.; McEntire, Caleb R.

However, it is not clear whether the effect of these genetic factors is independent of the risk due to more established non-genetic demographic and metabolic risk factors such as male sex, poor cardiometabolic health, and low socioeconomic status. We sought to identify interactions between genetic variants and non-genetic risk factors influencing COVID-19 severity via a genome-wide interaction study in the UK Biobank. Of 378,051 unrelated individuals of European ancestry, 2,402 were classified as having experienced severe COVID-19, defined as hospitalization or death due to COVID-19. Exposures included sex, cardiometabolic risk factors (obesity and type 2 diabetes [T2D], tested jointly), and multiple deprivation index. Multiplicative interaction was tested using a logistic regression model, conducting both an interaction test and a joint test of genetic main and interaction effects. Five independent variants reached genome-wide significance in the joint test, one of which also reached significance in the interaction test. One of these, rs2268616 in the PGF gene, showed stronger effects in males and in individuals with T2D. None of the five variants showed effects on a similarly-defined phenotype in a lookup in the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative. These results reveal potential additional genetic loci contributing to COVID-19 severity and demonstrate the value of including non-genetic risk factors in an interaction testing approach for genetic discovery.","Westerman, Kenneth E.; Lin, Joanna; Sevilla-Gonzalez, Magdalena; Tadess, Beza; Marchek, Casey; Manning, Alisa K.",medRxiv,488,16

The TGEV primers and probe were designed to be specific to a portion of the S gene sequence conserved in all TGEV isolates, but absent in the closely related porcine respiratory coronaviruses. The optimized TaqMan assay detected a minimum of 2.8 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA of the target S gene and RNA extracted from 1 TCID(50)/ml of TGEV. Using 113 clinical samples received at our diagnostic laboratory over a 4-year period, the performance of the assay was tested and compared with that of a previously described nested RT-PCR assay. All the fecal samples which tested positive for TGEV by the nested RT-PCR assay also tested positive by the TaqMan assay. However, approximately 9% of the samples that tested negative by the nested RT-PCR assay tested positive by the TaqMan assay. These results indicate that the developed TaqMan assay is a highly sensitive diagnostic test for rapid detection of TGEV in pig fecal samples.","Vemulapalli, Ramesh; Gulani, Jatinder; Santrich, Cecilia",J Virol Methods,488,1

This human pathogen is a member of betacoronavirus genus carrying 30 kilobase of single positive-sense RNA genome. Understanding the evolution, zoonotic transmission, and source of this novel virus would help accelerating containment and prevention efforts. The present study reported detailed analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genome evolution and potential candidate peptides for vaccine development. This new coronavirus genotype might have been evolved from a bat-coronavirus by accumulating non-synonymous mutations, indels, and recombination events. Structural proteins Spike (S), and Membrane (M) had extensive mutational changes, whereas Envelope (E) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins were very conserved suggesting differential selection pressures exerted on SARS-CoV-2 during evolution. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein contains a 39 nucleotide sequence insertion relative to SARS-like bat-SL-CoVZC45/2017. Furthermore, we identified eight high binding affinity (HBA) CD4 T-cell epitopes in the S, E, M and N proteins, which can be commonly recognized by HLA-DR alleles of Asia and Asia-Pacific Region population. These immunodominant epitopes can be incorporated in universal subunit SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Diverse HLA types and variations in the epitope binding affinity may contribute to the wide range of immunopathological outcomes of circulating virus in humans. Our findings emphasize the requirement for continuous surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 strains in live animal markets to better understand the viral adaptation to human host and to develop practical solutions to prevent the emergence of novel pathogenic SARS-CoV-2 strains.","Ramaiah, Arunachalam; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja",bioRxiv,488,16

However, the impact of this decrease on overall vaccination coverage in a specific birth cohort is not known. METHODS: We projected measles vaccinationcoverage for the cohort of children becoming one year old in 2020 in the United States, for different durations of stay-at-home orders, along with varying catch-up vaccination efforts. RESULTS: A 15% sustained catch-up rate outside stay-at-home orders (compared to what would be expected via natality information) is necessary to achieve projected vaccination coverage similar to previous years. Permanent decreases in vaccine administration could lead to projected vaccination coverage levels below 80%. CONCLUSION: Modeling measles vaccination coverage under a range of scenarios provides useful information about the potential magnitude and impact of under-immunization.

Reported residential postcode was used to locate cases, and clusters were identified using a scan statistic. Cases included in clusters were compared to those not included in such clusters with respect to human socioeconomic factors (postcode area relative socioeconomic disadvantage, economic resources, education and occupation) and dog factors (neuter status, breed, age, gender, vaccination status). During 2010, there were 1187 cases of canine parvovirus reported. Nineteen significant (P < 0.05) disease clusters were identified, most commonly located in New South Wales. Eleven (58%) clusters occurred between April and July, and the average cluster length was 5.7 days. All clusters occurred in postcodes with a significantly (P < 0.05) greater level of relative socioeconomic disadvantage and a lower rank in education and occupation, and it was noted that clustered cases were less likely to have been neutered (P = 0.004). No significant difference (P > 0.05) was found between cases reported from cluster postcodes and those not within clusters for dog age, gender, breed or vaccination status (although the latter needs to be interpreted with caution, since vaccination was absent in most of the cases).

Although exercise has benefits for motor function and quality of life (QOL) in patients with parkinsonism, these patients face many barriers to exercise participation, such as lack of motivation, fatigue, depression, and time constraints. Recently, the use of mobile apps has been highlighted as a remote exercise management strategy for patients with chronic diseases. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of home-based exercise management with a customized mobile app on the exercise amount, physical activity, and QOL of patients with parkinsonism. METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, single-arm pilot study. The therapist installed the app in the smartphones of the participants and educated them on how to use the app. The therapist developed an individualized multimodal exercise program that consisted of stretching, strengthening, aerobic, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercises. Participants were encouraged to engage in an 8-week home-based exercise program delivered through a customized app. The alarm notifications of the app provided reminders to exercise regularly at home. The primary outcome was the exercise amount. The secondary outcomes were assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). The usability of the customized app was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 21 participants with parkinsonism completed the intervention and assessment between September and December 2020 (mean age: 72 years; women: 17/21, 81%; men: 4/21, 19%). The participants reported a significant increase in the total amount of exercise (baseline: mean 343.33, SD 206.70 min/week; 8-week follow-up: mean 693.10, SD 373.45 min/week; P<.001) and in the amount of each exercise component, including stretching, strengthening, balance and coordination, and oral-motor and vocal exercise after 8 weeks. Analysis of the secondary outcomes revealed significant improvements in the IPAQ (P=.006), PDQ-39 (P=.02), and GDS (P=.04) scores. The usability of the program with the mobile app was verified based on the positive responses such as “intention to use” and “role expectation for rehabilitation.” CONCLUSIONS: Exercise management with a customized mobile app may be beneficial for improving exercise adherence, physical activity levels, depression management, and QOL in patients with parkinsonism. This remotely supervised technology-based, reinforcing, and multimodal exercise management strategy is recommended for use in patients with parkinsonism. In addition, this program proved useful as an alternative exercise management strategy during the COVID-19 pandemic when patients with Parkinson disease were less physically active than before and showed aggravation of symptoms. However, additional clinical trials are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this exercise program in a large population and to confirm its disease-modifying effects.","Kim, Aram; Yun, Seo Jung; Sung, Kwan-Sik; Kim, Yeonju; Jo, Ju Young; Cho, Hanseul; Park, Kyudong; Oh, Byung-Mo; Seo, Han Gil",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,488,16

This is a cause of concern as anxiety is associated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. Globally, India has the third largest population of PLHIV and third highest number of COVID-19 cases which are rapidly increasing. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the burden of anxiety and its sources among Asian Indian PLHIV during this pandemic. Methods: We used data from a telephonically delivered assessment among PLHIV engaged in care at a tertiary healthcare associated antiretroviral therapy (ART) center in Pune, India. Assessments were conducted between April 21 and May 28, 2020, one month into the government mandated lockdown. GAD-7 was used to assess for anxiety over two-preceding weeks. Significant sociodemographic and clinical differences between groups (GAD-7<10 and GAD-7≥10) were assessed using Fisher’s exact and Wilcoxson rank sum tests, for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze an open-ended question that asked about the most pressing cause(s) of concern. Results : Of 167 PLHIV contacted, median age was 44 years (IQR:40 – 50), 60% (n=100) were cisgender women and 81% (n=135) had a monthly family income<200 USD. Thirty-eight percent (n=64) had prior history of tuberculosis and 27% (n=45) were living with another comorbidity. A fourth (25%, n=41) had GAD-7 scores indicative of generalized anxiety. PLHIV who had fewer remaining doses of ART had significantly higher GAD-7 scores compared to those that had more doses (p=0.05). Thematic analysis indicated that concerns were both health related and unrelated, and stated temporally. Present concerns were often also projected as future concerns. Conclusions : In a group of socioeconomically disadvantaged PLHIV, a fourth were found to have anxiety, that appeared to be influenced by concerns about ART availability. Furthermore, the persistence of sources of anxiety and therefore an increase in anxiety for these PLHIV is anticipated as the pandemic worsens in India. We recommend the regular utilization of short screening tools for anxiety to monitor and triage PLHIV as an extension of current HIV-services.","Marbaniang, Ivan; Sangle, Shashikala; Nimkar, Smita; Zarekar, Kanta; Salvi, Sonali; Chavan, Amol; Gupta, Amita; Suryavanshi, Nishi; Mave, Vidya",Res Sq,488,1

METHODS: Leftover blood samples were selected between 8 February and 25 March 2021, by SYNLAB Estonia from all counties and age groups (0–9, 10–19, 20–59, 60–69, 70–79 and 80–100 years) proportionally to the whole Estonian population and tested for IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (anti-S-RBD IgG) using Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant assay. Antibody levels after positive PCR-test or vaccination were described by exponential increase-decrease models. RESULTS: According to total of 2517 samples, overall seroprevalence (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 20.1% (18.5–21.7%), similar in all age groups, but varied between counties. If individuals vaccinated with the first dose at least 14 d before antibody measurement were assumed to be seronegative, the overall seroprevalence was 15.8% (14.4–17.3%), 4.0-fold larger than the proportion of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Of seropositive individuals (n = 506) 194 (38.3%; 33.8–43.1%) had not had positive PCR-test or been vaccinated. According to exponential increase-decrease model, the peak of anti-S-RBD IgG in a 52-year-old (median age of PCR-positive and/or vaccinated individuals) was significantly higher after vaccination compared with positive PCR-test (22,082 (12,897–26,875) vs. 6732 (2321–8243) AU/mL), but half-life was similar (26.5 (6.9–46.1) vs. 38.3 (8.2–68.5) d). CONCLUSIONS: One year after the start of COVID-19 pandemic the actual prevalence of infection is still underestimated compared with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The aim of this retrospective study was to compare epidemiology and clinical presentation of C19-CP referring to the emergency department (ED) of our institution (San Luigi Gonzaga University Hospital, Orbassano, Turin, Italy), in a 3-week observation period of the first and second COVID-19 waves, starting from the introduction of the corresponding national lockdowns. METHODS: We retrieved ED admissions from March 9 to 29, 2020, for the first wave, and from October 24 to November 13, 2020, for the second wave. We collected clinical characteristics of consecutive patients with molecularly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also considered untested or SARS-CoV-2-negative cancer patients referring to the ED in the reference time frames. RESULTS: C19-CP in the second wave exceeded those in the first wave despite the nonsignificant difference (39 of 576 v 8 of 163; P = .5). Compared with nononcological patients, C19-CP were older (median age 70 years [interquartile range 61-77] v 60 years [interquartile range 45-73]; P = .02) and presented more often with &#8805; 2 comorbidities (40.4% v 24.3%; P = .02).

Five of 24 and 10 of 27 hospitalized cancer patients in the first and second waves developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: C19-CP were a vulnerable population, irrespective of the COVID-19 waves.

As Brazil and many parts of the world are marked by regional, cultural, and social inequalities, risk communication and assimilation of protection recommendations by the public may be erratic, hampering the proper measurement of their effectiveness. SCOPE AND APPROACH: Even though transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by foods is unlikely, this work aimed to evaluate the population's adherence to the recommended food hygiene and personal protection measures to prevent COVID-19. An online survey containing questions on food hygiene and personal protection was publicly disseminated via internet and social networks. Data from 3000 respondents were collected and discussed herein. Key findings and conclusions: Most respondents adopted the recommended hygienic and personal protection measures to avoid contamination with SARS-CoV-2. However, some important flaws were detected, such as lack of use of face masks when in public places (6%), improper hand washing and sanitizing (10–12%) and use of incorrect products for food or environment cleaning and sanitization (28%), indicating that adequate risk communication and preventive recommendations must continue in order to avoid contamination with the coronavirus.

Patients with COVID-19 present mainly with respiratory symptoms. Prone position has been traditionally used in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) to improve oxygenation and prevent barotrauma in ventilated patients. Awake proning is being used as an investigational therapy in COVID to defer invasive ventilation, improve oxygenation, and outcomes. Hence, we conducted a retrospective case study to look for benefits of awake proning with oxygen therapy in non-intubated COVID patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective case study of 15 COVID patients admitted from June 15 to July 1, 2020 to HDU in our hospital was conducted. Cooperative patients who were hemodynamically stable and SpO(2) < 90% on presentation were included. Oxygen was administered through facemask, non-rebreathing mask and noninvasive ventilation to patients as per requirement. Patients were encouraged to maintain prone position and target time was 10–12 hours/day. SpO(2) and P/f ratio in supine and prone position was observed till discharge. Primary target was SpO(2) > 95% and P/f > 200 mm Hg. Other COVID therapies were used according to institutional protocol. RESULTS: The mean SpO(2) on room air on admission was 80%. In day 1 to 3, the mean P/f ratio in supine position was 98.8 ± 29.7 mm Hg which improved to 136.6 ± 38.8 mm Hg after proning (p = 0.005). The difference was significant from day 1 to 10. Two patients were intubated. The mean duration of stay was 11 days. CONCLUSION: Awake prone positioning showed marked improvement in P/f ratio and SpO(2) in COVID-19 patients with improvement in clinical symptoms with reduced rate of intubation. HIGHLIGHTS: Prone position ventilation improves oxygenation by reducing V/Q mismatch. Awake prone positioning has been used along with high-flow oxygen therapy in recent pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 virus for management of mild to moderate cases.

EVD, an emerging infectious disease, can create fear and panic among patients, contacts and relatives, which could be a risk factor for psychological distress. Psychological distress among this subgroup could have public health implication for control of EVD, because of potential effects on patient management and contact tracing. We determined the Prevalence, pattern and factors associated with psychological distress among survivors and contacts of EVD and their relatives. METHODS: In a descriptive cross sectional study, we used General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress and Oslo Social Support Scale to assess social support among 117 participants who survived EVD, listed as EVD contacts or their relatives at Ebola Emergency Operation Center in Lagos, Nigeria. Factors associated with psychological distress were determined using chi square/odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. RESULTS: The mean age and standard deviation of participants was 34 +/ - 9.6 years. Of 117 participants, 78 (66.7 %) were females, 77 (65.8 %) had a tertiary education and 45 (38.5 %) were health workers. Most frequently occurring psychological distress were inability to concentrate (37.6 %) and loss of sleep over worry (33.3 %). Losing a relation to EVD outbreak (OR = 6.0, 95 % CI, 1.2–32.9) was significantly associated with feeling unhappy or depressed while being a health worker was protective (OR = 0.4, 95 % CI, 0.2–0.9). Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) showed losing a relation (AOR = 5.7, 95 % CI, 1.2–28.0) was a predictor of “feeling unhappy or depressed”, loss of a relation (AOR = 10.1, 95 % CI, 1.7–60.7) was a predictor of inability to concentrate. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors and contacts of EVD and their relations develop psychological distress. Development of psychological distress could be predicted by loss of family member. It is recommended that psychiatrists and other mental health specialists be part of case management teams. The clinical teams managing EVD patients should be trained on recognition of common psychological distress among patients. A mental health specialist should review contacts being monitored for EVD for psychological distress or disorders.","Mohammed, Abdulaziz; Sheikh, Taiwo Lateef; Gidado, Saheed; Poggensee, Gabriele; Nguku, Patrick; Olayinka, Adebola; Ohuabunwo, Chima; Waziri, Ndadilnasiya; Shuaib, Faisal; Adeyemi, Joseph; Uzoma, Ogbonna; Ahmed, Abubakar; Doherty, Funmi; Nyanti, Sarah Beysolow; Nzuki, Charles Kyalo; Nasidi, Abdulsalami; Oyemakinde, Akin; Oguntimehin, Olukayode; Abdus-salam, Ismail Adeshina; Obiako, Reginald O.",BMC Public Health,488,33

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: COVID-ICUs in 27 hospitals across Norway. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare professionals (n=484): nurses (81%), medical doctors (9%) and leaders (10%), who responded to a secured, web-based questionnaire from 6 May 2020 to 15 July 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY MEASURES: Healthcare professionals’: (1) professional and psychological preparedness to start working in COVID-ICUs, (2) factors associated with high degree of preparedness and (3) experience of working conditions. RESULTS: The age of the respondents was 44.8±10 year (mean±SD), 78% were females, 92% had previous ICU working experience. A majority of the respondents reported professional (81%) and psychological (74%) preparedness for working in COVID-ICU. Factors significantly associated with high professional preparedness for working in COVID-19-ICU in a multivariate logistic model were previous ICU work experience (p<0.001) and participation in COVID-ICU simulation team training (p<0.001). High psychological preparedness was associated with higher age (p=0.003), living with spouse or partner (p=0.013), previous ICU work experience (p=0.042) and participation in COVID-ICU simulation team training (p=0.001). Working with new colleagues and new professional challenges were perceived as positive in a majority of the respondents, whereas 84% felt communication with coworkers to be challenging, 46% were afraid of being infected and 82% felt discomfort in denying access for patient relatives to the unit. Symptoms of sweating, tiredness, dehydration, headache, hunger, insecurity, mask irritation and delayed toilet visits were each reported by more than 50%.

In this era of sensitive molecular diagnostics, the incidence and outcome of HSCT recipients who are hospitalized with RVI (H-RVI) are not well described. METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort of pediatric HSCT recipients (between January 2010 and June 2013) was assembled from 9 US pediatric transplant centers. Their medical charts were reviewed for H-RVI events within 1 year after their transplant. An H-RVI diagnosis required respiratory signs or symptoms plus viral detection (human rhinovirus/enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, coronaviruses, and/or respiratory syncytial virus). The incidence of H-RVI was calculated, and the association of baseline HSCT factors with subsequent pulmonary complications and death was assessed. RESULTS: Among 1560 HSCT recipients, 259 (16.6%) acquired at least 1 H-RVI within 1 year after their transplant. The median age of the patients with an H-RVI was lower than that of patients without an H-RVI (4.8 vs 7.1 years; P < .001). Among the patients with a first H-RVI, 48% required some respiratory support, and 14% suffered significant pulmonary sequelae. The all-cause and attributable case-fatality rates within 3 months of H-RVI onset were 11% and 5.4%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that H-RVI onset within 60 days of HSCT, steroid use in the 7 days before H-RVI onset, and the need for respiratory support at H-RVI onset were associated with subsequent morbidity or death. CONCLUSION: Results of this multicenter cohort study suggest that H-RVIs are relatively common in pediatric HSCT recipients and contribute to significant morbidity and death.

There is no robust in vitro model for assessing the infectivity of emerging viruses in humans. Based on a recently established method, we generated long-term expanding 3D human airway organoids which accommodate four types of airway epithelial cells: ciliated, goblet, club, and basal cells. We report differentiation conditions which increase ciliated cell numbers to a nearly physiological level with synchronously beating cilia readily discernible in every organoid. In addition, the differentiation conditions induce elevated levels of serine proteases, which are essential for productive infection of human influenza viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses. We also established improved 2D monolayer culture conditions for the differentiated airway organoids. To demonstrate the ability of differentiated airway organoids to identify human-infective virus, 3D and 2D differentiated airway organoids are applied to evaluate two pairs of viruses with known distinct infectivity in humans, H7N9/Ah versus H7N2 and H1N1pdm versus an H1N1 strain isolated from swine (H1N1sw). The human-infective H7N9/Ah virus replicated more robustly than the poorly human-infective H7N2 virus; the highly human-infective H1N1pdm virus replicated to a higher titer than the counterpart H1N1sw.

It is often caused by infectious agents of viral, bacterial, or parasitic origin. Cows vaccination and colostrum intake by calves during the first 6 h of life are critical strategies to prevent severe diarrhea but these are still insufficient. Here we report the field evaluation of a product based on IgY antibodies against group A rotavirus (RVA), coronavirus (CoV), enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Salmonella sp. This product, named IgY DNT, has been designed as a complementary passive immunization strategy to prevent neonatal calf diarrhea. The quality of the product depends on the titers of specific IgY antibodies to each antigen evaluated by ELISA. In the case of the viral antigens, ELISA antibody (Ab) titers are correlated with protection against infection in calves experimentally challenged with RVA and CoV (Bok M, et al., Passive immunity to control bovine coronavirus diarrhea in a dairy herd in Argentina, 2017), (Vega C, et al., Vet Immunol Immunopathol, 142:156–69, 2011), (Vega C, et al., Res Vet Sci, 103:1–10, 2015). To evaluate the efficiency in dairy farms, thirty newborn Holstein calves were randomly assigned to IgY DNT or control groups and treatment initiated after colostrum intake and gut closure. Calves in the IgY DNT group received 20 g of the oral passive treatment in 2 L of milk twice a day during the first 2 weeks of life. Animals were followed until 3 weeks of age and diarrhea due to natural exposure to infectious agents was recorded during all the experimental time. RESULTS: Results demonstrate that the oral administration of IgY DNT during the first 2 weeks of life to newborn calves caused a delay in diarrhea onset and significantly reduced its severity and duration compared with untreated calves. Animals treated with IgY DNT showed a trend towards a delay in RVA infection with significantly shorter duration and virus shedding compared to control calves. CONCLUSIONS: This indicates that IgY DNT is an effective product to complement current preventive strategies against neonatal calf diarrhea in dairy farms. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this is the only biological product available for the prevention of virus-associated neonatal calf diarrhea.","Vega, Celina Guadalupe; Bok, Marina; Ebinger, Maren; Rocha, Lucía Alejandra; Rivolta, Alejandra Antonella; González Thomas, Valeria; Muntadas, Pilar; D’Aloia, Ricardo; Pinto, Verónica; Parreño, Viviana; Wigdorovitz, Andrés",BMC Vet Res,488,16

However, as yet we have no complete understanding of this condition. We report here the first case of FBA in a human immunodeficiency virus-infected patient with coexisting cytomegalovirus (CMV) and COVID-19 infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-year-old Malay man with underlying acquired immunodeficiency syndrome receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy was referred to the Opthalmology Department with complaints of blurry vision for the past 2 months.

Clinical care settings can be particularly stressful for both patients and providers. Kindness and compassion are buffers for the negative effects of stress, likely through strengthening positive interpersonal connection. In previous laboratory-based studies, simply watching kindness media uplifts (elevates) viewers, increases altruism, and promotes connection to others. The objective of the present study is to examine whether kindness media can affect viewers in a real-world, pediatric healthcare setting. Methods: Parents and staff in a pediatric dental clinic were studied. Study days were randomized for viewers to watch either original kindness media or the standard televised children’s programming that the clinic shows. Participants scored self-rated pre-media emotions in a survey, watched either media type for 8 min, and then completed the survey. All participants were informed that they would receive a gift card for their participation. After completion of the survey, participants were asked if they wanted to keep the card or donate it to a family in need. Results: Fifty (50) participants completed the study; 28 were parents and 22 were staff. In comparison to viewers of children’s programming, participants who watched kindness media had significant increases in feeling happy, calmer, more grateful, and less irritated (p < 0.05), with trends observed in feeling more optimistic and less anxious. Kindness media caused marked increases in viewers’ reports of feeling inspired, moved, or touched (p < 0.001). No change was observed in self-reported compassion, although baseline levels were self-rated as very high. People who watched kindness media were also more generous, with 85% donating their honoraria compared to 54% of Standard viewers (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Kindness media can increase positive emotions and promote generosity in a healthcare setting.","Fryburg, David A.; Ureles, Steven D.; Myrick, Jessica G.; Carpentier, Francesca Dillman; Oliver, Mary Beth",Front Psychol,488,30

While there are compelling reasons why providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids may affect COVID-19-related outcomes, evidence is lacking. The objective of this scoping review is to explore and describe the literature examining the effect of providing additional micronutrients or conditional amino acids (glutamine, arginine) in adults with conditions or infections similar to COVID-19 infection on COVID-19 related health outcomes. A literature search of the MEDLINE database and hand-search of Cochrane Database of systematic reviews retrieved 1,423 unique studies, and eight studies were included in this scoping review. Four studies examined a target population with ventilator-related pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, while the other four studies included patients who were at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Interventions included intravenous vitamin C, intramuscular vitamin D, enteral and intramuscular vitamin E, enteral zinc sulfate, and oral and parenteral glutamine. In six of the eight included studies, baseline status of the nutrient of interest was not reported and, thus, it is uncertain how outcomes may vary in the context of nutrient deficiency or insufficiency compared to sufficiency.

The analysis showed that patients' age inversely correlates with threshold cycle (Ct) values for RdRP gene (LightMix® Modular Wuhan CoV RdRP-gene by Roche Diagnostics) and RdRP+S genes (MutaPLEX® Coronavirus RT-PCR kit by Immundiagnostic). At the same time, there was no correlation between age and Ct values for E, N, and ORF1ab genes. When patients were grouped by age, mean Ct values for RdRP gene in older patients were significantly lower compared with younger individuals.

Professional societies have recommended changes in cancer service provision to minimize COVID-19 risks to cancer patients and health care workers. However, we do not know the extent to which cancer patients, in whom multi-morbidity is common, may be at higher overall risk of mortality as a net result of multiple factors including COVID-19 infection, changes in health services, and socioeconomic factors. Methods: We report multi-center, weekly cancer diagnostic referrals and chemotherapy treatments until April 2020 in England and Northern Ireland. We analyzed population-based health records from 3,862,012 adults in England to estimate 1-year mortality in 24 cancer sites and 15 non-cancer comorbidity clusters (40 conditions) recognized by CDC as high-risk. We estimated overall (direct and indirect) effects of COVID-19 emergency on mortality under different Relative Impact of the Emergency (RIE) and different Proportions of the population Affected by the Emergency (PAE). We applied the same model to the US, using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program data. Results: Weekly data until April 2020 demonstrate significant falls in admissions for chemotherapy (45-66% reduction) and urgent referrals for early cancer diagnosis (70-89% reduction), compared to pre-emergency levels. Under conservative assumptions of the emergency affecting only people with newly diagnosed cancer (incident cases) at COVID-19 PAE of 40%, and an RIE of 1.5, the model estimated 6,270 excess deaths at 1 year in England and 33,890 excess deaths in the US. In England, the proportion of patients with incident cancer with [≥]1 comorbidity was 65.2%. The number of comorbidities was strongly associated with cancer mortality risk. Across a range of model assumptions, and across incident and prevalent cancer cases, 78% of excess deaths occur in cancer patients with [≥]1 comorbidity. Conclusion: We provide the first estimates of potential excess mortality among people with cancer and multimorbidity due to the COVID-19 emergency and demonstrate dramatic changes in cancer services. To better inform prioritization of cancer care and guide policy change, there is an urgent need for weekly data on cause-specific excess mortality, cancer diagnosis and treatment provision and better intelligence on the use of effective treatments for comorbidities.","Lai, A.

METHOD: A total of 11,227 people from 30 countries across all continents participated in the study and completed measures of psychological distress (depression, stress, and anxiety), loneliness, well-being, and physical health, together with measures of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, and a measure called the Meaning-centered Coping Scale (MCCS) that was developed in the present study. Validation analyses of the MCCS were performed in all countries, and data were assessed by multilevel modeling (MLM). RESULTS: The MCCS showed a robust one-factor structure in 30 countries with good test-retest, concurrent and divergent validity results. MLM analyses showed mixed results regarding emotion and problem-focused coping strategies. However, the MCCS was the strongest positive predictor of physical and mental health among all coping strategies, independently of demographic characteristics and country-level variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the MCCS is a valid measure to assess meaning-centered coping. The results also call for policies promoting effective coping to mitigate collective suffering during the pandemic.","Eisenbeck, Nikolett; Carreno, David F.; Wong, Paul T.P.; Hicks, Joshua A.; María, Ruíz-Ruano García; Puga, Jorge L.; Greville, James; Testoni, Ines; Biancalani, Gianmarco; López, Ana Carla Cepeda; Villareal, Sofía; Enea, Violeta; Schulz-Quach, Christian; Jansen, Jonas; Sanchez-Ruiz, Maria-Jose; Yıldırım, Murat; Arslan, Gökmen; Cruz, José Fernando A.; Sofia, Rui Manuel; Ferreira, Maria José; Ashraf, Farzana; Wąsowicz, Grażyna; Shalaby, Shahinaz M.; Amer, Reham A.; Yousfi, Hadda; Chukwuorji, JohnBosco Chika; Guerra, Valeschka M.; Singh, Sandeep; Heintzelman, Samantha; Hutapea, Bonar; Béjaoui, Bouchara; Dash, Arobindu; Schlosser, Karoly Kornel; Anniko, Malin K.; Rossa, Martin; Wongcharee, Hattaphan; Avsec, Andreja; Kocjan, Gaja Zager; Kavčič, Tina; Leontiev, Dmitry A.; Taranenko, Olga; Rasskazova, Elena; Maher, Elizabeth; García-Montes, José Manuel",Int J Clin Health Psychol,488,27

We aimed to study the association between B. pertussis and other respiratory pathogens in children hospitalised with severe LRTI, and to assess clinical relevance of co-detection. Nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and induced sputa (IS) were tested with a B. pertussis specific PCR; additionally, IS was tested for other pathogens using a multiplex PCR. We included 454 children, median age 8 months (IQR 4–18), 31 (7%) of whom tested positive for B. pertussis. Children with B. pertussis had more bacterial pathogens detected (3 versus 2; P < 0.001). While B. pertussis showed no association with most pathogens, it was independently associated with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and parainfluenza viruses with adjusted risk ratios of 4.01 (1.03–15.64), 4.17 (1.42–12.27) and 2.13 (1.03–4.55), respectively. There was a consistent increased risk of severe disease with B. pertussis.

STUDY DESIGN We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify reports of severe acute neurologic complications associated with acute respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in children aged <15 years (PROSPERO Registration CRD42019125722). Main outcomes included neurologic, clinical, and demographic features of cases, and the frequency of disease. We aggregated available case data from the published literature and from the Australian Acute Childhood Encephalitis (ACE) study. RESULTS We identified 87 unique studies from 26 countries describing a spectrum of RSV-associated severe acute neurologic syndromes including proven encephalitis, acute encephalopathy, complex seizures, hyponatremic seizures, and immune-mediated disorders. The frequency of RSV infection in acute childhood encephalitis/encephalopathy was 1.2 to 6.5%. We aggregated data from 155 individual cases with RSV-associated severe acute neurologic complications; median age was 11.0 months (IQR 2.0-21.5), most were previously healthy (71/104, 68%). Seizure was the most frequently reported neurologic feature (127/150, 85%). RSV was detected in the central nervous system of 12 cases. Most children recovered (81/122, 66%), however some reports described partial recovery (33/122, 27%) and death (8/122, 7%). CONCLUSIONS RSV-associated neurologic complications have been widely reported but there is substantial heterogeneity in the design and quality of existing studies. The findings from our study have implications for the investigation, management, and prevention of RSV-associated neurologic complications. Further, this systematic review can inform the design of future studies aiming to quantify the burden of childhood RSV-associated neurologic disease.","Saravanos, Gemma L; King, Catherine L; Deng, Lucy; Dinsmore, Nicole; Ramos, Isabelle; Takashima, Mari; Crawford, Nigel; Clark, Julia E; Dale, Russell C; Jones, Cheryl A; Wood, Nicholas J; Britton, Philip N",The Journal of pediatrics,488,28

Delays and interference with IFN responses are closely associated with the severity of disease caused by CoV infection. As the most abundant viral protein in infected cells just after the entry step, the CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein likely plays a key role in IFN interruption. We have conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis and report herein that the N proteins of representative human and animal CoVs from four different genera [swine acute diarrhea syndrome CoV (SADS-CoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), SARS-CoV-2, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV)] suppress IFN responses by multiple strategies. In particular, we found that the N protein of SADS-CoV interacted with RIG-I independent of its RNA binding activity, mediating K27-, K48- and K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I and its subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation, thus inhibiting the host IFN response. These data provide insight into the interaction between CoVs and host, and offer new clues for the development of therapies against these important viruses.","Liu, Yan; Liang, Qi-Zhang; Lu, Wan; Yang, Yong-Le; Chen, Ruiai; Huang, Yao-Wei; Wang, Bin",Front Immunol,488,16

A series of tools and workbooks have been developed to support ACP uptake amongst the generable population. Yet, their potential for improving ACP uptake in LTC has yet to be examined. This study explored if available ACP tools are acceptable for use in LTC by (a) eliciting staff views on the content and format that would support ACP tool usability in LTC (b) examining if publicly available ACP tools include content identified as relevant by LTC home staff. Ultimately this study aimed to identify the potential for existing ACP tools to improve ACP engagement in LTC. METHODS: A combination of focus group deliberations with LTC home staff (N = 32) and content analysis of publicly available ACP tools (N = 32) were used to meet the study aims. RESULTS: Focus group deliberations suggested that publicly available ACP tools may be acceptable for use in LTC if the tools include psychosocial elements and paper-based versions exist. Content analysis of available paper-based tools revealed that only a handful of ACP tools (32/611, 5%) include psychosocial content, with most encouraging psychosocially-oriented reflections (30/32, 84%), and far fewer providing direction around other elements of ACP such as communicating psychosocial preferences (14/32, 44%) or transforming preferences into a documented plan (7/32, 22%). CONCLUSIONS: ACP tools that include psychosocial content may improve ACP uptake in LTC because they elicit future care issues considered pertinent and can be supported by a range of clinical and non-clinical staff. To increase usability and engagement ACP tools may require infusion of scenarios pertinent to frail older persons, and a better balance between psychosocial content that elicits reflections and psychosocial content that supports communication.","Sussman, Tamara; Kaasalainen, Sharon; Bimman, Rennie; Punia, Harveer; Edsell, Nathaniel; Sussman, Jess",BMC Palliat Care,488,14

In this paper, we described the epidemiological characteristics of the laboratory-confirmed patients with Covid-2019 in the Philippines as of April 3, 2020 and provided recommendations on how to limit the spread of the disease. Data from the DOH NCOV tracker and University of the Philippines Covid-2019 tracker were extracted, from its initiation (January 30, 2020) until the most recent situation report (April 3, 2020). The total number of cases and deaths were stratified by sex, age, and region of the Philippines. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic profile of the confirmed cases. Case fatality rate, in percent, was calculated by dividing the total number of deaths to the total number of confirmed cases. Results revealed that a total of 3,018 cases of Covid-2019 spread were confirmed across 17 regions in the Philippines. These cases occurred over the course of 73 days through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate. The 144 deaths accounted for, equate to 4.51 case fatality rate, seemingly lower compared to its predecessors, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but higher compared to that of United States of America, Germany, mainland China, and neighboring Southeast Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Thailand. Of the 3,018 confirmed cases, majority were male, elderly, and diagnosed in Metro Manila region. Case fatality rates were higher in male and highest among elderly and Filipinos in the Ilocos region. With the surge on the number of cases, precautionary measures should remain a responsibility, and protocols for prevention need to be set.

It is the main export commodity of several countries; thus, contributes towards foreign exchange earnings. Unfortunately, average global rice yield is far below than its genetic potential. Low nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) is among the major reasons for low average yield. Current study evaluated the impact of nitrogen fertilizer application methods (conventional and deep placement) on growth, yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, agronomic N-use efficiency (ANUE), partial factors productivity of applied N (PFP) and economic returns of two different transplanted rice varieties (Basmati-515 and Super-Basmati). Fertilizer application methods significantly affected allometry, yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP and economic returns. Deep placement of N-fertilizer (DPNF) observed better allometric traits, high chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP, yield attributes and economic returns compared to conventional application of N-fertilizer (CANF). Similarly, Basmati-515 had better allometric and yield-related traits, chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP and economic returns than Super-Basmati. Regarding interactions among N-fertilizer application methods and rice varieties, Basmati-515 with DPNF resulted in higher chlorophyll contents, photosynthesis rate, ANUE, PFP, allometric and yield related traits and economic returns than CANF. The lowest values of these traits were observed for Super-Basmati with no application of N-fertilizer. Both varieties had better yield and economic returns with DPNF compared to CANF. It is concluded that DPNF improved yield, ANUE and economic returns; therefore, should be opted to improve productivity of transplanted fine rice. Nonetheless, lower nitrogen doses need to be tested for DPNF to infer whether it could lower N use in rice crop.","Khalofah, Ahlam; Khan, Muhammad Ifnan; Arif, Muhammad; Hussain, Ansar; Ullah, Rehmat; Irfan, Muhammad; Mahpara, Shahzadi; Shah, Rahmat Ullah; Ansari, Mohammad Javed; Kintl, Antonin; Brtnicky, Martin; Danish, Subhan; Datta, Rahul",PLoS One,488,8

Before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Canadian media had switched its tune from “shorter surgical times” to demanding the end of “hallway medicine.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, the message is to keep patients safe at home and out of high-risk settings. With a greater focus on care received outside of the hospital, there is growing emphasis on the role played by community-based care sectors and, in particular, family medicine. However, confusion remains around this sector, including terminology and the role it plays in keeping patients healthy in their communities. Clarity around terminology is essential to guide health system reform both in Canada and globally, and to ensure health system actors are using a single vocabulary. In this article, we clarify the distinctions between primary health care (PHC), primary care, and family medicine and highlight how family medicine is an adaptive and evolving field that meets the needs of patients and communities.

The spike protein is processed by membrane proteases, including TMPRSS2, and either internalises or fuses directly with the cell, leading to infection. We have identified a human cell line that expresses both ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the RT4 urinary bladder transitional carcinoma, and used it to develop a proxy assay for viral interactions with host cells. A tagged recombinant form of the spike protein, containing both the S1 and S2 domains, interacted strongly with RT4 cells as determined by flow cytometry, whereas the S1 domain and the receptor binding domain (RBD) interacted weakly. S1S2 interaction was temperature dependent and increased sharply at 37{degrees}C, suggesting that processing of the intact spike protein is likely to be important in the interaction. S1S2 protein could associate with cells with a low dependence on ACE2 expression, while RBD required the presence of ACE2 for interaction. As the spike protein has previously been shown to bind heparin, a soluble glycosaminoglycan, we used a flow cytometric assay to determine the effect of heparin on spike protein interaction with RT4 cells. Unfractionated heparin inhibited spike protein interaction with an IC50 value of <0.05U/ml whereas two low molecular weight heparins were much less effective. A mutant form of the spike protein, lacking the Arg-rich region proposed to be a furin cleavage site, interacted very weakly with cells and had a lower affinity for unfractionated and lower molecular weight heparin than the wild type spike protein. This indicates that the furin cleavage site might also be a heparin binding site and potentially important in interactions with host cells. Taken together, our data suggest that heparin, particularly unfractionated forms, could be considered to reduce clinical manifestations of COVID-19 by inhibiting continuing viral infection. Author SummarySince the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the world has faced a vast public health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 associates with human cells through interaction of the viral spike protein with the host receptor, ACE2. In the absence of a vaccine, new treatments are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we use a novel technique to demonstrate spike protein interactions with human cells with low levels of ACE2 at the cell surface, suggesting a secondary receptor. We demonstrate the importance of a new heparin-binding site within the viral spike protein for these interactions. We also found that unfractionated heparin was able to bind to the viral spike protein and therefore, potently inhibit viral spike protein interactions with human cells. Our data demonstrate that ACE2 is not absolutely required for spike protein interactions with human cells and furthermore, that unfractionated heparin should be considered as a treatment to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral infection.","Partridge, Lynda J; Urwin, Lucy; Nicklin, Martin JH; James, David C; Green, Luke R; Monk, Peter N",bioRxiv,488,12

This paper uses a novel composite indicator of intersectional (dis) advantages to examine how different (in) equity markers intersect to create (in) equities in contact coverage of MNH services across the continuum of care (CoC) in Nepal. METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted among 1978 women aged 15–49 years who had a live birth in the two years preceding the survey. Data were derived from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) 2016. The three outcome variables included were 1) at least four antenatal care (4ANC) visits, 2) institutional delivery, and 3) postnatal care (PNC) consult for newborns and mothers within 48 h of childbirth. Independent variables were wealth status, education, ethnicity, languages, residence, and marginalisation status. Intersectional (dis) advantages were created using three socioeconomic variables (wealth status, level of education and ethnicity of women). Binomial logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the patterns of (in) equities in contact coverage of MNH services across the CoC. RESULTS: The contact coverage of 4ANC visits, institutional delivery, and PNC visit was 72, 64, and 51% respectively. Relative to women with triple disadvantage, the odds of contact coverage of 4ANC visits was more than five-fold higher (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 5.51; 95% CI: 2.85, 10.64) among women with triple forms of advantages (literate and advantaged ethnicity and higher wealth status). Women with triple advantages were seven-fold more likely to give birth in a health institution (aOR = 7.32; 95% CI: 3.66, 14.63). They were also four times more likely (aOR = 4.18; 95% CI: 2.40, 7.28) to receive PNC visit compared to their triple disadvantaged counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: The contact coverage of routine MNH visits was low among women with social disadvantages and lowest among women with multiple forms of socioeconomic disadvantages. Tracking health service coverage among women with multiple forms of (dis) advantage can provide crucial information for designing contextual and targeted approaches to actions towards universal coverage of MNH services and improving health equity.

An improved understanding of pathogen transmission and the institution of strategies to protect health care providers against infection are needed in infectious disease outbreaks. This review connects what is known about Ebola virus transmission with personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to arrest nosocomial transmission. Methods Articles pertaining to filovirus transmission and PPE in filovirus outbreaks were reviewed and findings are presented. In addition, studies that evaluated PPE and donning and doffing strategies are presented. Findings PPE is one step in a comprehensive infection prevention and control strategy that is required to protect health care providers. Given that the Ebola virus is primarily transmitted through direct contact of mucous membranes and cuts in the skin with infected patients and/or their bodily fluids, it is necessary to cover these potential portals of infection with PPE as part of a structured and instructed donning and doffing procedure. Implications Current recommendations about PPE and the donning and doffing processes are based on anecdotal experience.

Durante estos tiempos sin precedentes, la rápida transición del aprendizaje presencial tradicional al aprendizaje digital se observa como un cambio de paradigma en la educación superior. Inspirándose en el marco teórico de la autodeterminación, este estudio tiene como objetivo examinar el impacto del aprendizaje digital en la motivación de los estudiantes. También plantea la hipótesis del papel mediador, de las necesidades psicológicas básicas, en el nexo entre el aprendizaje digital y la motivación de los estudiantes. 689 estudiantes que han asistido a clases digitales en diez universidades (cinco públicas y cinco privadas) de Pakistán han respondido a la encuesta por Internet. Los resultados de esta investigación no confirman la relación directa entre el aprendizaje digital y la motivación de los estudiantes. Sin embargo, esta relación sí está mediatizada por las percepciones de los estudiantes sobre el grado en que sus necesidades psicológicas básicas han sido satisfechas / no satisfechas. Este estudio contribuye teórica y empíricamente a la literatura tanto de la psicología como de la educación superior, perteneciente al campo del aprendizaje digital que está en proceso de desarrollo. Las implicaciones prácticas de este estudio informan a los responsables de la formulación de políticas en el ámbito académico para que reflexionen sobre las necesidades psicológicas de los estudiantes dentro del entorno de la enseñanza virtual. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced the notion of the “new normal” in daily life through profoundly influencing the way we used to live, study and work. During these unprecedented times, the rapid transition from traditional face-to-face learning to online learning has been viewed as a paradigm shift in higher education. Drawing impetus from the self-determination theoretical framework, the present study aims to examine the impact of the online learning climate on student’s engagement. It also hypothesizes the mediating role of basic psychological needs on the nexus between online learning and students’ engagement. Total 689 students taking online classes in ten (five publics and five private) universities of Pakistan responded to the web-based survey. The present study findings do not support the direct influence of the online learning climate on student engagement, nevertheless, this relationship was mediated by students’ perceptions concerning the extent to which their basic psychological needs were satisfied/ dissatisfied. This study theoretically and empirically contributes to both the psychology and higher education literature, pertaining to the developing field of online learning. The practical implications from this study inform policy-makers in academia to reflect on the students’ psychological needs within virtual teaching environment.","Shah, Sobia Shafaq; Shah, Asif Ali; Memon, Farzana; Kemal, Atika Ahmad; Soomro, Arjumand",,488,3

The aim of our work is to expose the activity of kidney transplantation in Cantabria during the state of alarm, as well as to assess the safety of the transplantation program. Material and methods Retrospective study of kidney transplants performed in our Center from the beginning of the state of alarm until the beginning of the lockdown easing in Cantabria. Descriptive analysis of the demographic data of recipients and their donors, intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes. Comparative analysis with the data of the same period in 2017–2019, by means of the X2 for categorical variables, Student’s T and Mann-Whitney U tests in case of quantitative variables of normal and non-normal distribution, respectively. Results Fifteen kidney transplants were performed in the period described. Delayed renal function (DRF) was seen in 7.5% of patients, and 26.6% showed data of acute rejection; no patient presented COVID-19 disease. Comparative analysis showed a remarkable increase in the number of transplants in comparison with previous periods (15 vs 5.6), at the expense of donors from outside Cantabria (93.3%). We found no statistically significant differences in terms of cold ischemia time (p 0.77), DRF (p 0.73), need for dialysis (p 0.54), or appearance of post-surgical complications (p 0.61). Conclusions The evolution of the pandemic in our region, and the adoption of strict protective measures has allowed the early and safe resumption of the renal transplantation program, increasing the number of transplants performed compared to previous years and maintaining comparable early post-operative results.","Calleja Hermosa, P.; Varea Malo, R.; Campos Juanatey, F.; Rodrigo Calabia, E.; Aguilera Fernández, A.; Fernández Guzmán, E.; Domínguez Esteban, M.; Ballestero Diego, R.; Zubillaga Guerrero, S.; Gutiérrez Baños, J.

Participants (N = 3145, ≥18 y) completed a survey (MeDiWeB) with sociodemographic, anthropometric, and food questions (14-item Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener, 14-MEDAS). The MED and non-MED populations showed moderate (7.08 ± 1.96) and weak (5.58 ± 1.82) MD adherence, respectively, with significant yet small differences across countries (SP > PT > GR > IT > CY > BG > NMK, p-value < 0.001). The MED participants scored higher than the non-MED ones for most of the Mediterranean-typical foods, with the greatest differences found for olive oil (OO) and white meat preference. In most countries, ≥70% of the participants reported quantities of red meat, butter, sweet drinks, and desserts below the recommended cutoff points, whereas <50% achieved the targets for plant-based foods, OO, fish, and wine. Being a woman and increasing age were associated with superior adherence (p-value < 0.001), but differences were rather small. Our results suggest that the campaigns carried out to support and reinforce the MD and to promote plant-based foods have limited success across Southern Europe, and that more hard-hitting strategies are needed.","Quarta, Stefano; Massaro, Marika; Chervenkov, Mihail; Ivanova, Teodora; Dimitrova, Dessislava; Jorge, Rui; Andrade, Vanda; Philippou, Elena; Zisimou, Constantinos; Maksimova, Viktorija; Smilkov, Katarina; Ackova, Darinka Gjorgieva; Miloseva, Lence; Ruskovska, Tatjana; Deligiannidou, Georgia Eirini; Kontogiorgis, Christos A.; Sánchez-Meca, Julio; Pinto, Paula; García-Conesa, María-Teresa",Nutrients,488,1

For this, an instrumental design was carried out with the purpose of analyzing the psychometric properties of the instrument. The sample consisted of 307 participants enrolled in compulsory secondary education. Reliability with fit indices were good in model B (proposed) with composite reliability, global reliability index, and Cronbach’s alpha. The original model (A) presented small problems that had to be adjusted when carrying out the translation. We concluded that adaptation and subsequent validation of the MSLQ instrument into a Spanish context was positive. In this sense, adequate adjustment rates have been achieved. However, in its contextual adequacy, the need arises to modify the presentation of the items alluding to intrinsic motivation due to the difficulty of measuring such a construct. Among the implications reached in this study is the possibility of having a validated instrument for the Spanish adolescent context to measure motivation on educational aspects. Furthermore, this tool can serve as the basis for the design of other instruments that measure this construct in other age ranges.","Segura-Robles, Adrián; Moreno-Guerrero, Antonio-José; Parra-González, María-Elena; López-Belmonte, Jesús",Eur J Investig Health Psychol Educ,488,1

However, RT-PCR kits are costly and take 6-9 hours to confirm infection in the patient. Due to less sensitivity of RT-PCR, it provides high false-negative results. To resolve this problem, radiological imaging techniques such as chest X-rays and computed tomography (CT) are used to detect and diagnose COVID-19. In this paper, chest X-rays is preferred over CT scan. The reason behind this is that X-rays machines are available in most of the hospitals. X-rays machines are cheaper than the CT scan machine. Besides this, X-rays has low ionizing radiations than CT scan. COVID-19 reveals some radiological signatures that can be easily detected through chest X-rays. For this, radiologists are required to analyze these signatures. However, it is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Hence, there is a need to automate the analysis of chest X-rays. The automatic analysis of chest X-rays can be done through deep learning-based approaches, which may accelerate the analysis time. These approaches can train the weights of networks on large datasets as well as fine-tuning the weights of pre-trained networks on small datasets. However, these approaches applied to chest X-rays are very limited. Hence, the main objective of this paper is to develop an automated deep transfer learning-based approach for detection of COVID-19 infection in chest X-rays by using the extreme version of the Inception (Xception) model. Extensive comparative analyses show that the proposed model performs significantly better as compared to the existing models.","Narayan Das, Nripendra; Kumar, Naresh; Kaur, Manjit; Kumar, Vijay; Singh, Dilbag",Ing Rech Biomed,488,20

The purpose of the paper is to analyse the association between knowledge and behaviour of touch screen users based on surveys. This paper presents selected results of a survey conducted at the end of 2019 (pre–COVID–19 survey). The survey was conducted on a group of 172 IT school students. The relationship between responses using a 2D linear model regression and clustering is used. Most respondents believe that bacteria were more common than viruses on touch screens. The respondents declare altruism in terms of a greater willingness to lend their smartphone, rather than to use someone else’s. An interesting result is that respondents often lend their smartphone to others, while being aware that viruses or bacteria are present on the touch screens. The results can be used in terms of changes in the education process of smartphone users in relation to microbiological hazards.","Oszutowska-Mazurek, Dorota; Fastowicz, Jaroslaw; Mazurek, Przemyslaw",Int J Environ Res Public Health,488,16

In contrast to other cities or countries, Taiwan did not enforce strict social lockdowns or mandatory stay-at-home orders to combat COVID-19. The major prevention strategies to the pandemic in Taiwan include promoting social distancing, mandating the wearing of face masks in public areas, and requiring all international arrivals to quarantine for 14 days. Using administrative data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 and ridership from metro stations with the difference-in-differences model, we find that an additional new confirmed case of COVID-19 reduces metro use by 1.43% after controlling for local socio-demographic variables associated with ridership and the number of international arrivals to Taiwan. This result implies that the reduction in metro trips is attributable to decreases in residents' use of public transportation due to perceived health risks. Furthermore, the effect of COVID-19 on metro use disproportionally impacts stations with different characteristics. The effect is more pronounced for metro stations connected to night markets, shopping centers, or colleges. Although decreases in metro ridership lower the revenue of the Taipei Metro System, our results indicate a tradeoff between increased financial burdens of public transportation systems and reducing medical expenses associated with COVID-19.","Chang, Hung-Hao; Lee, Brian; Yang, Feng-An; Liou, Yu-You",J Transp Geogr,488,16

METHODS: Women living in the UK aged ≥18 years with an infant ≤12 months of age completed an anonymous online survey (https://is.gd/covid19newmumstudy). Information/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. RESULTS: From 27.5 to 20-3.6.20, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married/with partner, 66% degree/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered BL and 316 (23%) DL. Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (p < 0.001). 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed/mixed fed versus 39% of BL (p < 0.05). 13% reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient feeding support. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%/9% contacted a mental health professional; 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact/support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby. CONCLUSION: Lockdown has impacted maternal experiences, resulting in distress for many women. Our findings suggest the need for better infant feeding support, especially ‘face-to-face’ support for practical issues; and recognising and supporting mothers who are struggling with mental health challenges or other aspects of their health. The effectiveness of online versus face-to-face contact is currently uncertain, and requires further evaluation.","Vazquez-Vazquez, A.; Dib, S.; Rougeaux, E.; Wells, J.c.; Fewtrell, M.S.",Appetite,488,16

MATERIAL/METHODS: A total of 77 chest CT scans collected from 77 consecutive patients hospitalized because of SARS-CoV-2 were included. The scans were assessed independently by 2 radiologists aware of the patients’ positive results of RT-PCR tests. Each chest CT was assessed according to the 3 scales. To assess the interobserver agreement of CT scan assessments, Cohen’s κ and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. RESULTS: For the overall assessment, the κ was 0.944 and the ICC was 0.948 for the TSS; the κ was 0.909 and the ICC was 0.919 for the CT-S; and the κ was 0.888 and the ICC was 0.899 for the CT-SS.

The greatest difference between epidemiology and toxicology, aside from the observational/experimental basis, is the measure of exposure, which, although it would improve any study, is often difficult to incorporate into epidemiological studies because of the historical nature of exposures.","Gad, S.C.",Encyclopedia of Toxicology,488,18

The most recent results of the literature have focused on the Herpes family viruses (HHV-6 and HHV-4/Epstein-Barr virus) and their possible role in the development of multiple sclerosis. Even if no virus has been identified so far as the multiple sclerosis etiological agent, our aim here is to show that some viruses may be responsible for triggering or sustaining neurological diseases. This is particularly the case for Paramyxoviruses, in the late appearance of functional alterations, Picornaviruses, in inducing a breakdown of immune tolerance, epitope spreading and demyelination, and Herpes viruses in inducing T and B lymphocyte activation, T lymphocytes dysregulation and autoimmunity after their reactivation. Therefore, “common” viruses can play a role as potential modulators of the immune and nervous systems which, in the specific context of dysimmunity and genetic susceptibility, stimulate a favorable background to the development of multiple sclerosis. Tracing and studying viruses in multiple sclerosis patients may improve our understanding of their actual involvement in multiple sclerosis physiopathology.","Giraudon, P.; Bernard, A.",Rev Neurol (Paris),488,1

Here, we present both single-cell TCR-seq and RNA-seq to analyze the dynamics of TCR repertoire and immune metabolic functions of blood T cells collected from recently discharged COVID-19 patients. We found that while the diversity of TCR repertoire was increased in discharged patients, it returned to basal level ~1 week after becoming virus-free. The dynamics of T cell repertoire correlated with a profound shift of gene signatures from antiviral response to metabolism adaptation. We also demonstrated that the top expanded T cell clones (~10% of total T cells) display the key anti-viral features in CD8(+) T cells, confirming a critical role of antigen-specific T cells in fighting against SARS-CoV-2.

The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N = 311) had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p = 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection (p = 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.019) than those with negative viral detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single viral infection; however, there were no significant differences in duration of fever, antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between these two groups. The most commonly identified virus was human rhinovirus. About 27% (n = 83) of patients had multiple viral infections. Overall, the highest percentage of human bocavirus infection was detected in multiple viral infections (79%). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was independently associated with multiple viral infections (p = 0.022), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (p = 0.001) and longer hospitalization duration (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Multiple viral infections were associated with younger age and a higher risk of developing LRTI. However, multiple viral infections did not predict a worse disease outcome. More studies are needed to unveil the interplay between the hosts and different viruses in multiple viral infections.","Yen, Chun-Yu; Wu, Wan-Tai; Chang, Chia-Yuan; Wong, Ying-Chi; Lai, Chou-Cheng; Chan, Yu-Jiun; Wu, Keh-Gong; Hung, Miao-Chiu",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,488,1

RT-PCR and antigen assay were performed using the same material. The sensitivity and specificity of the antigen assay were calculated for different cut-offs, with RT-PCR serving as the reference method. Stored clinical samples that were positive for other respiratory viruses were tested to evaluate cross-reactivity. One third (33/110, 30%) were falsely classified as negative, while no false positives were found using the 200 TCID(50)/mL cut-off for the SARS-CoV-2 antigen as proposed by the manufacturer. This corresponded to a sensitivity of 70% (60–78%) and a specificity of 100% (94–100%). Lowering the cut-off for positivity of the antigen assay to 22.79 or 57.68 TCID(50)/mL increased the sensitivity of the method, reaching a sensitivity of 92% (85–96%) vs. 79% (70–86%) and a specificity of 81% (69–89%) vs. 99% (91–100%), respectively.

Patients with certain protozoan infections have specific anti-α-Gal antibodies, elicited against parasite-derived α-Gal-bearing glycotopes. These glycotopes, however, remain elusive except for the well-characterized glycotope Galα1,3Galβ1,4GlcNAcα, expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi. The discovery of new parasitic glycotopes is greatly hindered by the enormous structural diversity of cell-surface glycans and the technical challenges of classical immunoglycomics, a top-down approach from cultivated parasites to isolated glycans. Here, we demonstrate that reversed immunoglycomics, a bottom-up approach, can identify parasite species-specific α-Gal-bearing glycotopes by probing synthetic oligosaccharides on neoglycoproteins. This method was tested here seeking to identify as-yet unknown glycotopes specific for Leishmania major, the causative agent of Old-World cutaneous leishmaniasis (OWCL). Neoglycoproteins decorated with synthetic α-Gal-containing oligosaccharides derived from L. major glycoinositolphospholipids served as antigens in a chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using sera from OWCL patients and noninfected individuals. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis identified Galpα1,3Galfβ and Galpα1,3Galfβ1,3Manpα glycotopes as diagnostic biomarkers for L. major-caused OWCL, which can distinguish with 100% specificity from heterologous diseases and L. tropica-caused OWCL. These glycotopes could prove useful in the development of rapid α-Gal-based diagnostics and vaccines for OWCL. Furthermore, this method could help unravel cryptic α-Gal-glycotopes of other protozoan parasites and enterobacteria that elicit the natural human anti-α-Gal antibodies.","Montoya, Alba L.; Austin, Victoria M.; Portillo, Susana; Vinales, Irodiel; Ashmus, Roger A.; Estevao, Igor; Jankuru, Sohan R.; Alraey, Yasser; Al-Salem, Waleed S.; Acosta-Serrano, Álvaro; Almeida, Igor C.; Michael, Katja",JACS Au,488,22

However, based on their distinct peptide-binding characteristics, HLA-A*6801 is grouped into A3 supertype, whereas HLA-A*6802 belongs to A2 supertype, similar to HLA-A*0201. Thusfar, the structural basis of the different supertype definitions of these serotyping-identical HLA alleles remains largely unknown. Herein, we determined the structures of HLA-A*6801 and HLA-A*6802 presenting three typical A3 and A2 supertype-restricted peptides, respectively. The binding capabilities of these peptides to HLA-A*6801, HLA-A*6802, and HLA-A*0201 were analyzed. These data indicate that the similar conformations of the residues within the F pocket contribute to close-related peptide binding features of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*0201. However, the overall structure and the peptide conformation of HLA-A*6802 are more similar to HLA-A*6801 rather than HLA-A*0201 which illuminates the similar serotype grouping of HLA-A*6802 and HLA-A*6801.

The commensal epidermal microbiota is believed to provide colonization resistance and other benefits to the host; yet little is known regarding the long-term stability of the epidermal microbiota, and the impact of CHG bathing. We aimed to assess the influence of CHG exposure to the epidermal microbiota and evaluate the long-term stability of the epidermal microbiota. METHODS: The epidermal microbiota of 5 individuals was sampled using thorough swabbing of the calf, and characterized via 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, prior to CHG bathing, and then at 30 minutes, 3 hours, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days postbathing. Roughly 4 months later, samples were collected from the same 5 individuals, using an identical timeline but with no CHG exposure. RESULTS: The epidermal microbiota showed no greater change 30 minutes postexposure to CHG, than was observed in the same individuals during the recovery period, likely representing the normal sample-to-sample variability. Despite that variability, the epidermal microbiota evinced a remarkable degree of intrasubject stability, even over extended periods of time. CONCLUSION: We conclude that single applications of CHG cause minimal, if any, disruption of the epidermal microbiota, and that long-term effects of single applications of CHG on the epidermal microbiota are unlikely.","Wiemken, Timothy L; Ericsson, Aaron C",Am J Infect Control,488,23

Monitoring skin lesions using teledermatology may become increasingly important for several skin diseases, including low‐risk skin cancers. The purpose of this study was to describe the key factors that could serve as barriers or facilitators to skin disease monitoring using mobile health technology (mHealth) in older adults. METHODS: Older adult dermatology patients 65 years or older and their caregivers who have seen a dermatologist in the last 18 months were interviewed and surveyed between December 2019 and July 2020. The purpose of these interviews was to better understand attitudes, beliefs and behaviours that could serve as barriers and facilitators to the use of mHealth and active surveillance to monitor low‐risk skin cancers. RESULTS: A total of 33 interviews leading to 6022 unique excerpts yielded 8 factors, or themes, that could serve as barriers, facilitators or both to mHealth and active surveillance. We propose an integrated conceptual framework that highlights the interaction of these themes at both the patient and provider level, including care environment, support systems and personal values. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings reveal factors influencing patient acceptance of active surveillance in dermatology, such as changes to the patient‐provider interaction and alignment with personal values. These factors were also found to influence adoption of mHealth interventions. Given such overlap, it is essential to address barriers and facilitators from both domains when designing a new dermatology active surveillance approach with novel mHealth technology.

METHODS: We established a retrospective cohort of patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (≥ 18 years old) from two tertiary hospitals: the People’s hospital of Wuhan University and Leishenshan Hospital between February 16, 2020, and April 14, 2020. The diagnosis of the cases was confirmed according to the WHO interim guidance. The data of consecutive severely and critically ill patients with COVID-19 admitted to these hospitals were analyzed. A total of 566 patients from the People’s Hospital of Wuhan University were included in the training cohort and 436 patients from Leishenshan Hospital were included in the validation cohort. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable logistic regression were used to select the variables and build the mortality risk prediction model. RESULTS: The prediction model was resented as a nomograph and developed based on identified predictors, including age, chronic lung disease, C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer levels, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), creatine, and total bilirubin. In the training cohort, the model displayed good discrimination with an AUC of 0.912 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.884–0.940] and good calibration (intercept = 0; slope = 1). In the validation cohort, the model had an AUC of 0.922 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.891-0.953] and a good calibration (intercept = 0.056; slope = 1.161). The decision curve analysis (DCA) demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful. CONCLUSION: A risk score for severely and critically ill COVID-19 patients' mortality was developed and externally validated. This model can help clinicians to identify individual patients at a high mortality risk.","Chen, Bo; Gu, Hongqiu; Liu, Yi; Zhang, Guqin; Yang, Hang; Hu, Huifang; Lu, Chenyang; Li, Yang; Wang, Liyi; Liu, Yi; Zhao, Yi; Pan, Huaqin",Comput Struct Biotechnol J,488,16

Au cours de l’épidémie, les connaissances scientifiques ont évolué et ont permis d’adapter les recommandations de prise en charge. L’objectif de cette étude était d’évaluer l’évolution du recours aux antibiotiques (ATB) au cours de l’épidémie, en lien avec la diffusion de recommandations locales de pratique clinique. Matériels et méthodes L’étude était rétrospective et monocentrique. Tous les patients hospitalisés pour une pneumopathie à SARS-CoV-2 ont été inclus, et classés en trois périodes sur l’année 2020 (P1 du 02/03 au 14/04, P2 du 15/04 au 27/06 et P3 du 07/09 au 06/12). Des recommandations locales d’aide à la prescription d’ATB chez les patients COVID ont été diffusées entre P1 et P2, puis entre P2 et P3. Etaient exclus les patients admis directement en réanimation. Les données cliniques, microbiologiques et les prescriptions d’ATB étaient recueillies. Le critère de jugement principal était le taux d’exposition aux ATB lors des 48 premières heures d’hospitalisation. Les critères de jugement secondaires étaient parmi ces antibiothérapies celles prescrites pour plus de 48h et la durée médiane de l’antibiothérapie. Résultats Ont été inclus 932 patients lors des 3 périodes (507, 123 et 302, respectivement). L’âge médian était de 69 ans [58–81] et 367 étaient des femmes (39 %). Une obésité (IMC>30kg/m2) était présente chez 224 patients (32 %) ; 467 étaient hypertendus (50 %), 279 étaient diabétiques (29 %), 124 insuffisant rénaux chroniques (13 %) et 120 immunodéprimés (13 %). Les répartitions étaient semblables au sein de chaque période, de même que les médianes des variables biologiques: PNN 6,4 G/L [3,6–7,5], CRP 72mg/L [30–128] et PCT 0,1μg/L [0,1–0,3]. À l’admission, une oxygénothérapie≥3L/min était nécessaire pour 42 %, 29 % et 45 % des patients, respectivement (p =0,01). Le taux d’exposition aux ATB au cours de chacune des trois périodes était de 78%, 50% puis 38% (p <0,001). Les ATB initiaux étaient principalement l’amoxicilline/clavulanate et le céfotaxime (54 % et 30 %). Le taux d’antibiothérapies de plus de 48h était de 64%, 45% puis 27 %. La durée médiane des antibiothérapies était de 6jours sur P1 et P2, puis diminuait à 4jours pendant P3 (p <0,001). Au total, 940jours d’ATB ont été économisés lors de P3 par rapport à P1. Enfin, aucune différence sur l’aggravation n’a été constaté entre P1 et P3 (décès, réanimation ou recours à l’oxygénothérapie haut débit). Conclusion Entre mars et décembre 2020, une baisse significative de l’initiation d’antibiothérapies chez les patients COVID-19 a été objectivée passant de 78 à 38%, sans conséquence apparente sur le pronostic. Cette baisse pourrait en partie être expliquée par la rédaction et la diffusion de recommandation locale de prescription et de prise en charge dans le cadre des actions de bon usage des anti-infectieux, ainsi que par la reprise d’une activité transversale de conseil en antibiothérapie.","Thery, A.; Galy, A.; Lepeule, R.; Ourghanlian, C.",Infectious Diseases Now,488,24

DESIGN: Participants were recruited by an online survey in this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire included general demographic characteristics, level of fear and anxiety, and nutritional habits. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7) were used to determine fear and anxiety. SETTING: Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total sample consisted of 1012 adults. RESULTS: In pandemic, fear and anxiety caused individuals to skip breakfast and snacks less, but more at lunch. A positive significant correlation was observed between the increased consumption of yoghurt, cheese and water and FCV-19S scores. There was a positive significant correlation between cheese, legume, nuts-seeds, cake-cookies, dessert and tea consumption and GAD-7 scores. A 1-unit increase in FCV-19S scores affected 1·04 times of increased consumption of yoghurt, kefir, cheese, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry) and rice-pasta. A 1-unit increase in GAD-7 scores affected 1·03 times of increased consumption of egg and fruit (fresh); 1·04 times of increased consumption of cheese and other vegetables; 1·05 times of increased consumption of milk, meat, poultry, fish, legume, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry), cake-cookies and tea; 1·07 times of increased consumption of rice-pasta and coffee and 1·08 times of increased consumption of bread and dessert. CONCLUSIONS: In pandemic, anxiety and fear led to changes in individuals’ nutritional habits and food preferences. Continuous surveillance of psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide. In addition, the effects of these psychological problems on nutrition should be evaluated.","Kaya, Seda; Uzdil, Zeynep; Cakiroğlu, Funda Pinar",Public health nutrition,488,16

The world economy is very threatened by the new situation, which has not bypassed the energy sector either. The mortality rate is relatively high, people are not leaving their homes, which is directly reflected in the increase of the energy consumption in the residential sector. The same is valid for water consumption. For a household located in Kragujevac (Central Serbia), 4 simulation scenarios were analyzed (S1 – reference case, S2 – mild protection measures, S3 – semi-quarantine measures, S4 – complete quarantine) to assess the link between people's behavior (on the one hand) and the consumption of natural gas, electricity and water (on the other hand), in the residential sector, in unforeseen circumstances, such as the COVID-19 virus pandemic. The analysis was conducted numerically for the month of March 2020, using EnergyPlus software packages. In defining the above scenarios, a one-minute time step schedule of people's behavior was used, taking into account the number of family members in the household, their age, occupation, lifestyle, habits (all in accordance with cultural and socio-economic circumstances), as well as the measures taken by the Government of the Republic of Serbia to fight the pandemic. Also, an analysis of energy consumption at the level of the city of Kragujevac for the past three years was made, based on data obtained from public companies – distributors (thermal energy, natural gas, electricity, water). In this paper, an analysis of air quality for the same time period was conducted, which is closely related to energy consumption and limited population movement. The simulatinos show that the consumption of natural gas can increase by 21.26% (S2), electricity by 58.39% (S4), and the consumption of water from the city water supply network by 25.45% (S3) compared to the reference case (S1). On the other hand, based on the invoice for payment of services to distributors, the actual energy consumption that was made on the analyzed house during the month of March 2020 was: natural gas (260.36 Sm(3)), electricity (1 418 kWh), and water (22.5 m(3)). The conducted economic analysis showed that the largest funds at the level of the entire facility were allocated in S3 (27.33% more than in S1), and that the actual costs were 15.09% higher than in S1, and 16.41% lower than in S2.","Cvetković, Dragan; Nešović, Aleksandar; Terzić, Ivana",Energy Build,488,24

This evaluation looked at the potential clinical application of a range of biomarkers, including C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Procalcitonin (PCT) and Mid-Regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), and White Cell Count to support prediction of clinical outcomes. Methods: Adult patients presenting to Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust between April and June 2020 confirmed to have COVID-19 via RT-qPCR were included. Biomarkers were measured in blood samples taken within 24 hours of admission and logistic regression and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves were used to predict disease progression. The endpoints assessed were 30-day all-cause mortality, intubation and ventilation, admission to critical care and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) use. Findings: A total of 135 adult patients were identified. Elevated levels of MR-proADM were shown to have the greatest ability to predict 30-day mortality adjusting for age, cardiovascular disease, renal disease and neurological disease. A significant association was also noted between raised MR-proADM and CRP concentrations and the requirement for critical care admission and non-invasive ventilation, when controlling for covariates. Interpretation: The measurement of biomarkers, particularly MR-proADM and CRP in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection upon admission to secondary care shows significant potential to support clinicians in the early identification of those at increased risk of disease progression and need for higher level care, subsequently enabling prompt escalation in clinical interventions and treatment.","Moore, N.

Numerous genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are now available and in-depth analyses are advancing. These will allow detailed characterization of sequence and protein functions, including comparative studies. Care should be taken when inferring function from sequence information alone, and reverse genetics systems can be used to unequivocally identify key features.

Many foci worldwide have been identified in retirement nursing homes, with a high number of deaths. Our study aims were to evaluate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the retirement nursing homes, the predictors to develop symptoms, and death. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective study enrolling all people living in retirement nursing homes (PLRNH), where at least one SARS-CoV-2 infected person was present. Medical and clinical data were collected. Variables were compared with Student’s t-test or Pearson chi-square test as appropriate. Uni- and multivariate analyses were conducted to evaluate variables’ influence on infection and symptoms development. Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate 30 days mortality predictors, considering death as the dependent variable. We enrolled 382 subjects. The mean age was 81.15±10.97 years, and males were 140(36.7%). At the multivariate analysis, mental disorders, malignancies, and angiotensin II receptor blockers were predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection while having a neurological syndrome was associated with a lower risk. Only half of the people with SARS-CoV-2 infection developed symptoms. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and neurological syndrome were correlated with an increased risk of developing SARS-CoV-2 related symptoms. Fifty-six (21.2%) people with SARS-CoV-2 infection died; of these, 53 died in the first 30 days after the swab’s positivity. Significant factors associated with 30-days mortality were male gender, hypokinetic disease, and the presence of fever and dyspnea. Patients’ autonomy and early heparin treatment were related to lower mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: We evidenced factors associated with infection’s risk and death in a setting with high mortality such as retirement nursing homes, that should be carefully considered in the management of PLRNH.","De Vito, Andrea; Fiore, Vito; Princic, Elija; Geremia, Nicholas; Panu Napodano, Catello Mario; Muredda, Alberto Augusto; Maida, Ivana; Madeddu, Giordano; Babudieri, Sergio",PLoS One,488,1

Several reports suggest that, in severe cases, COVID-19 may cause a hyperinflammatory 'cytokine storm'. However, unlike SARS-CoV infection, high levels of anti-inflammatory mediators have also been reported in COVID-19 patients. One study reported that 16% of COVID-19 patients who died developed secondary infection, which might indicate an immune-suppressed state. We explored kinetics of mHLA-DR expression, the most widely used marker of innate immune suppression in critically ill patients, in COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU. Twenty-four confirmed COVID-19 patients were included, of which 75% was male and 79% had comorbidities. All patients were mechanically ventilated and exhibited large high levels of inflammatory parameters such as CRP and PCT. mHLA-DR expression levels were mostly within the normal range of 15000 - 45000 mAb/cell and showed no change over time. COVID-19 patients displayed notably higher mHLA-DR expression levels compared with bacterial septic shock patients. None of the COVID-19 patients developed a secondary infection. In conclusion, despite a pronounced inflammatory response, mHLA-DR expression kinetics indicate no overt innate immune suppression in COVID-19 patients. These data signify that innate immune suppression as a negative feedback mechanism following PAMP-induced inflammation appears not to be present in COVID-19.","Kox, M.; Frenzel, T.; Schouten, J.; van de Veerdonk, F.; Koenen, H.

Although the spread of SARS-CoV-2 was found to be associated with the PMs, the mechanism by which exposure to DEP increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection is still under discussion. However, diesel fine PM (dPM) elevate the probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it coincides with the increase in the number of ACE2 receptors. Expression of ACE2 and its colocalized activator, transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) facilitate the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the alveolar epithelial cells exposed to dPM. Thus, the coexistence of PM and SARS-CoV-2 in the environment augments inflammation and exacerbates lung damage. Increased TGF-β1 expression due to DEP accompanies the proliferation of the extracellular matrix.

In general, the MDs of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were suggested to play a key role in viral replication by modulating the immune response of the host. The MDs are structurally conserved. They most likely remove ADP-ribose, a common posttranslational modification, from protein side chains. This de-ADP ribosylating function has potentially evolved to protect the virus from the anti-viral ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), which in turn are triggered by pathogen-associated sensing of the host immune system. This renders the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3b a highly relevant drug target in the viral replication process. We here report the near-complete NMR backbone resonance assignment ((1)H, (13)C, (15)N) of the putative Nsp3b MD in its apo form and in complex with ADP-ribose. Furthermore, we derive the secondary structure of Nsp3b in solution. In addition, (15)N-relaxation data suggest an ordered, rigid core of the MD structure. These data will provide a basis for NMR investigations targeted at obtaining small-molecule inhibitors interfering with the catalytic activity of Nsp3b.","Cantini, F.; Banci, L.; Altincekic, N.; Bains, J.

Less than one year after the discovery of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral sequence, these vaccines were approved for use in the European Union (EU) as well as in numerous other countries and mass vaccination efforts began. The so far in the EU approved mRNA vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are based on similar lipid-based nanoparticle carrier technologies; however, the lipid components differ. Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty. METHODS: Current knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI). RESULTS: Based on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts. CONCLUSION: Allergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","Klimek, Ludger; Bergmann, Karl-Christian; Brehler, Randolf; Pfützner, Wolfgang; Zuberbier, Torsten; Hartmann, Karin; Jakob, Thilo; Novak, Natalija; Ring, Johannes; Merk, Hans; Hamelmann, Eckard; Ankermann, Tobias; Schmidt, Sebastian; Untersmayr, Eva; Hötzenecker, Wolfram; Jensen-Jarolim, Erika; Brockow, Knut; Mahler, Vera; Worm, Margitta",Allergo J Int,488,9

More recently, novel SARS-CoV-2 variants have been spreading around the world, and there is growing concern that they may have higher transmissibility and that the protective efficacy of vaccines may be weaker against them. Immediate measures are needed to reduce human exposure to the virus. In this study, the antiviral efficacy of deep-ultraviolet light-emitting diode (DUV-LED) irradiation (280 ± 5 nm, 3.75 mW/cm(2)) against three SARS-CoV-2 variants was evaluated. For the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 variant strains, irradiation of the virus stocks for 1 s resulted in infectious titer reduction rates of 96.3%, 94.6%, and 91.9%, respectively, and with irradiation for 5 s, the rates increased to 99.9%, 99.9%, and 99.8%, respectively. We also tested the effect of pulsed DUV-LED irradiation (7.5 mW/cm(2), duty rate: 50%, frequency: 1 kHz) under the same output conditions as for continuous irradiation and found that the antiviral efficacy of pulsed and continuous irradiation was the same. These findings suggest that by further developing and optimizing the DUV-LED device to increase its output, it may be possible to instantly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with DUV-LED irradiation.","Inagaki, Hiroko; Saito, Akatsuki; Kaneko, Chiho; Sugiyama, Hironobu; Okabayashi, Tamaki; Fujimoto, Shouichi",Pathogens,488,1

Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT) enables early detection of pandemic viruses and plays a vital role in preventing onward transmission. However, the requirement of skilled operators, expensive instrumentation, and biosafety laboratories has hindered the use of NAAT for screening and diagnosis of suspected patients. Here we report development of a fully automated centrifugal microfluidic system with sample-in-answer-out capability for sensitive, specific, and rapid viral nucleic acid testing. The release of nucleic acids and the subsequent reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) were integrated into the reaction units of a microfluidic disc. The whole processing steps such as injection of reagents, fluid actuation by rotation, heating and temperature control, and detection of fluorescence signals were carried out automatically by a customized instrument. We validate the centrifugal microfluidic system using oropharyngeal swab samples spiked with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) armored RNA particles. The estimated limit of detection for armored RNA particles is 2 copies per reaction, the throughput is 21 reactions per disc, and the assay sample-to-answer time is approximately 70 min. This enclosed and automated microfluidic system efficiently avoids viral contamination of aerosol, and can be readily adapted for virus detection outside the diagnostic laboratory.

Restrictions introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased risk of deconditioning in the general population. No empirical evidence of this effect however has been empirically gathered in people living with dementia. Objective. This study aims to identify the causes and effects of COVID-19-related deconditioning in people living with dementia. Design. Longitudinal phenomenological qualitative study. Subjects. Participants living with dementia, their carers and therapists involved in the Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia (PrAISED) process evaluation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods. Qualitative interviews with participants were conducted remotely at two time points. The data were analysed through deductive thematic analysis. Results. Twenty-four participants living with dementia, 19 carers and 15 therapists took part in the study. A self-reinforcing pattern was common, whereby lockdown made the person apathetic, demotivated, socially-disengaged, and frailer. This reduced activity levels, which in turn reinforced the effects of deconditioning over time. Without external supporters, most participants lacked the motivation / cognitive abilities to keep active. Provided the proper infrastructure and support, some participants could use tele-rehabilitation to combat deconditioning. Conclusion. The added risks and effects of deconditioning on people with dementia require considerable efforts from policy makers and clinicians to ensure that they initiate and maintain physical activity in prolonged periods of social distancing. Delivering rehabilitation in the same way as before the pandemic might not be feasible or sustainable and innovative approaches must be found. Digital support for this population has shown promising results, but still remains a challenge.","Di Lorito, C.; Masud, T.; Gladman, J.; Godfrey, M.; Dunlop, M.; Harwood, R. H.",,488,10

The highest excess mortality rate in France linked to COVID-19 is reported in the Seine-Saint-Denis (SSD) district, which is the poorest district of the Greater Paris Area. Our objective was to compare patient characteristics between two districts of Greater Paris and determine whether precarity is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 respiratory disease at hospital admission. We selected patients hospitalized for COVID-19 from three academic hospitals, one located in SSD, and two in the Hauts-de-Seine (HDS) district, a rich district of Greater Paris. All selected patients were prospectively screened on the same day (April 20, 2020). Patients were asked about their SES via a questionnaire and information on smoking habits, comorbidities, and respiratory severity at admission was collected. Results 112 patients were included (58.6% (65/112) men, age: 66.7±16.3 years old, 11.0% (12/109) Africans or Afro-Caribbeans, and 7.7% (8/104) current smokers). COVID-19 was severe in most cases 59.8% (67/112). The distribution of initial severity was similar in both districts, although SSD patients were approximately 10 years younger than HDS patients (61.8±14.0 versus 71.0±17.1 years old, P= 0.002). The proportion of comorbidities was higher in SSD patients, including overweight (29.6±6.08 versus 25.2±5.67, P < 0.001) and diabetes (40.0% (20/110) versus 21.7% (13/110) P= 0.041), than in HDS patients. SSD patients had lower incomes (monthly income under 800€, 37.8% (17/97) versus 19.6% (9/97), P= 0.004), less private insurance coverage (55.8% (29/110) versus 75.9% (44/110) P = 0.043), a lower educational level (High school graduate 24.0% (12/103) 56.6% (30/103)versus P = 0.002) and a higher housing population density (23.7±22.1 versus 37.3±40.4 m2 per 1 habitant, P= 0.027). Although no factor was found to be associated with initial severity in the overall population, age and deprivation index were associated with an increased risk of initial severity in patients under 70 years-old, with an odds ratios of 1.099 (95% CI: 1.038 to 1.178, P = 0.003), and 1.029 per deprivation score point (95% CI:1.003 to 1.059, P = 0.033), respectively. Conclusion Precarity seems to be associated with the initial severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients under the age of 70. Low SES and comorbidities may contribute to the excess mortality observed in SSD, the poorest district of Greater Paris with the youngest population.","Sesé, L.; Nguyen medical, Y.; Giroux Leprieur, E.; Annesi-Maesano, I.; Cavalin, C.; Goupil de Bouillé, J.; Demestier, L.; Dhote, R.; Tandjaoui-Lambiotte, Y.; Bauvois, A.; Teillet, L.; Curac, S.; Beaune, S.; Duchemann, B.; Nunes, H.",Revue des Maladies Respiratoires,488,29

As it is, there is no officially FDA approved drug to alleviate the negative impact of SARS-CoV-2 on human health. Numerous drug targets for neutralizing coronavirus infection have been identified, among them is 3-chymotrypsin-like-protease (3CL(pro)), a viral protease responsible for the viral replication is chosen for this study. This study aimed at finding novel inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease from the natural library using computational approaches. A total of 69,000 compounds from natural product library were screened to match a minimum of 3 features from the five sites e-pharmacophore model. Compounds with fitness score of 1.00 and above were consequently filtered by executing molecular docking studies via Glide docking algorithm. Qikprop also predicted the compounds drug-likeness and pharmacokinetic features; besides, the QSAR model built from KPLS analysis with radial as binary fingerprint was used to predict the compounds inhibition properties against SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease. Fifty ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was carried out using GROMACS software to understand the dynamics of binding. Nine (9) lead compounds from the natural products library were discovered; seven among them were found to be more potent than lopinavir based on energies of binding. STOCK1N-98687 with docking score of −9.295 kcal/mol had considerable predicted bioactivity (4.427 µM) against SARS-CoV-2 3C-like protease and satisfactory drug-like features than the experimental drug lopinavir. Post-docking analysis by MM-GBSA confirmed the stability of STOCK1N-98687 bound 3CL(pro) crystal structure. MD simulation of STOCKIN-98687 with 3CL(pro) at 50 ns showed high stability and low fluctuation of the complex. This study revealed compound STOCK1N-98687 as potential 3CL(pro) inhibitor; therefore, a wet experiment is worth exploring to confirm the therapeutic potential of STOCK1N-98687 as an antiviral agent.","Elekofehinti, Olusola Olalekan; Iwaloye, Opeyemi; Molehin, Olorunfemi R.; Famusiwa, Courage D.",In Silico Pharmacol,488,24

When guided by a framework of compassion, mentoring as a caring action can not only build healthy, transformative relationships but a similar behavior is reciprocated to patients which subsequently can drive patient experience of care. However, examples of on-job mentorship programs for nurses in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) are limited. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to develop an on-job nursing mentorship programme using a compassionate framework aimed at improving nurses’ experience and thus enhancing patient experience in a tertiary care hospital in Pakistan. METHODS: Designed as an intervention development study, it was completed between January 2018–December 2019. The programme was developed by a team composed of service and nursing leadership, director patient experience of care and a compassion specialist using a theory of change model. The package followed a series of steps, a) identification of a framework, b) creation of working group c) needs assessment and d) multiple meetings to frame the model followed by implementing the preconditions for roll-out of the programme with the frontline staff. RESULTS: The eventual outcome was improving the patient’s experience of compassion while the intermediate outcome was to have nurses demonstrate compassionate care. The pre-conditions were identified as: recruitment of staff with appropriate skills for pediatric care, provision of compassionate experience to the frontline nurses by addressing their specific pain points, development of competent head nurses as supervisors and creation of a compassionate culture. To ensure the pre-conditions, various interventions were planned with some implemented through the course of the study while others are in the process of being rolled out. These involved, inclusion of pediatric compassion specific module during orientation of new hires, creation of space to talk about compassionate skills with staff, provision of trainings and mentorship to create competent head nurses, and creating a culture that promoted and recognized compassionate care values. CONCLUSION: The approach helped to delineate feasible pathways for an on-job compassionate mentorship programme enhancing routine supervisors' role as facilitators of compassionate care.

Currently, most evidence is generated through specific research projects, which typically require extra encounters with patients, are costly and entail long delays between the recognition of specific needs in healthcare and the generation of necessary evidence to address those needs. The Swiss Personalised Health Network (SPHN) aims to improve the use of data obtained during routine healthcare encounters by harmonizing data across Switzerland and facilitating accessibility for research. The project “Harmonising the collection of health-related data and biospecimens in paediatric hospitals throughout Switzerland (SwissPedData)” was an infrastructure development project funded by the SPHN, which aimed to identify and describe available data on child health in Switzerland and to agree on a standardised core dataset for electronic health records across all paediatric teaching hospitals. Here, we describe the results of a two-day symposium that aimed to summarise what had been achieved in the SwissPedData project, to put it in an international context, and to discuss the next steps for a sustainable future. The target audience included clinicians and researchers who produce and use health-related data on children in Switzerland. KEY HIGHLIGHTS: The symposium consisted of state-of-the-art lectures from national and international keynote speakers, workshops and plenary discussions. This manuscript summarises the talks and discussions in four sections: (I) a description of the Swiss Personalized Health Network and the results of the SwissPedData project; (II) examples of similar initiatives from other countries; (III) an overview of existing health-related datasets and projects in Switzerland; and (IV) a summary of the lessons learned and future prospective from workshops and plenary discussions. IMPLICATIONS: Streamlined processes linking initial collection of information during routine healthcare encounters, standardised recording of this information in electronic health records and fast accessibility for research are essential to accelerate research in child health and make it affordable. Ongoing projects prove that this is feasible in Switzerland and elsewhere. International collaboration is vital to success. The next steps include the implementation of the SwissPedData core dataset in the clinical information systems of Swiss hospitals, the use of this data to address priority research questions, and the acquisition of sustainable funding to support a slim central infrastructure and local support in each hospital. This will lay the foundation for a national paediatric learning health system in Switzerland.","Rakic, Milenko; Jaboyedoff, Manon; Bachmann, Sara; Berger, Christoph; Diezi, Manuel; do Canto, Philipp; Forrest, Christopher B.; Frey, Urs; Fuchs, Oliver; Gervaix, Alain; Gluecksberg, Amalia Stefani; Grotzer, Michael; Heininger, Ulrich; Kahlert, Christian R.; Kaiser, Daniela; Kopp, Matthias V.; Lauener, Roger; Neuhaus, Thomas J.; Paioni, Paolo; Posfay-Barbe, Klara; Ramelli, Gian Paolo; Simeoni, Umberto; Simonetti, Giacomo; Sokollik, Christiane; Spycher, Ben D.; Kuehni, Claudia E.",BMC Proc,488,16

We estimated cost-effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions such as hand-hygiene, surgical-mask N-95 respirators and surgical mask in general population. METHODS: We performed a decision tree and markov-model based economic evaluation. We estimated total costs and outcomes from public payer's perspective, based on information available through systematic literature search on relative intervention effect during early pandemic phase. We estimated outcomes as number COVID-19 prevented and Quality Adjusted life year (QALY) over one-year time-horizon with one-day cycle-length. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER) was calculated multiple sensitivity analyses were applied to assess parameter uncertainty. RESULTS: Use of surgical mask with hand hygiene, fit tested N-95 respirator, surgical-mask, non-fit tested N-95 and hand-hygiene interventions prevented additional 1139, 1124, 1121, 1043 and 975 COVID-19 cases per-million as compared to using none. Additional costs incurred (in billion) were ₹29.78 ($0.40), ₹148.09 ($1.99), ₹72.51 ($0.98), ₹26.84 ($0.36) and ₹2.48 ($0.03) as well as additional QALYs gained were 357.4, 353.01, 327.95, 351.52 and 307.04 for surgical mask with hand hygiene, fit-tested N-95, non-fit-tested N-95, surgical mask and hand-hygiene respectively.

Results were robust on uncertainty analysis. DISCUSSION: Among the non-pharmacological interventions to be considered for preventing spread of COVID-19, hand hygiene was cost-effective and avoidance of use of surgical masks and respirators by the general public could save resources.","Bagepally, Bhavani Shankara; Haridoss, Madhumitha; Natarajan, Meenakumari; Jeyashree, Kathiresan; Ponnaiah, Manickam",Clin Epidemiol Glob Health,488,20

Our study adds to this literature by utilizing an intersectionality framework to examine the joint influence of race and sex on H1N1 vaccination beliefs and behaviors among non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites (hereafter blacks and whites). Methods Using data from the National H1N1 Flu Survey of U.S. adults, we measured differences in beliefs about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine among black women, black men, white women, and white men. We then estimated a series of nested logistic regression models to examine how race/sex vaccination disparities were influenced by health beliefs, socioeconomic status (SES), pre-existing conditions, and healthcare. Results Black respondents were more likely than white respondents to express reservations about the safety and efficacy of the H1N1 vaccine. Consistent with those beliefs, white females reported the highest rate of H1N1 vaccination (28.4%), followed by white males (26.3%), black males (21.6%), and black females (17.5%). Differences in health beliefs, SES, pre-existing conditions, and healthcare explained lower odds of H1N1 vaccination among white men and black men, relative to white women. However, black women experienced 35-45% lower odds of vaccination than white women across all models, highlighting the intersectional nature of these associations. Discussion The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic provides a cautionary tale about the distribution of new vaccines across large populations with diverse racial, sex, and socioeconomic characteristics. Despite differences between the H1N1 and COVID-19 pandemics, our study warns that many black Americans will forego COVID-19 vaccines unless swift action is taken to address black-white disparities in access to vital resources. Public health stakeholders can also encourage widespread adoption of COVID-19 vaccines by tailoring health promotion messages for different groups of racial minorities, especially groups like black women who face intersecting disadvantages.","Burger, Andrew E.; Reither, Eric N.; Mamelund, Svenn-Erik; Lim, Sojung",Vaccine,488,16

METHODS: A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care pandemic hospital. Sixty COVID-19 patients with cerumen in their external auditory canals were included in the study. Swabs were taken from the external auditory canal of the patients by an experienced otolaryngologist with the test swab. Sampling was done by rotating the sample swab 360° 10 times in each external auditory canal for a total of 20 times. After collection, swabs were placed into 2 mL of the sterile viral transport medium (various manufacturers), then transported and tested as soon as possible after collection. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the cerumen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) samples of any of the 60 patients with positive nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. CONCLUSION: Cerumen cleaning is one of the most common procedures performed by otolaryngologists, and care should be taken during the procedure or due to the possibility of infection from the resulting contaminants. The cerumen contains the secretions of the glands in the external auditory canal and may contain certain pathogens that are actively found in the body. The presence of hepatitis B virus in the cerumen was examined and isolated in the cerumen. In our study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the cerumen was evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 PCR-positive patients. SARS-CoV-2 virus was not detected in the cerumen samples of any of the patients.","Islamoglu, Yuce; Bercin, Sami; Aydogan, Sibel; Sener, Alp; Tanriverdi, Fatih; Gunaydin, Gul Pamukcu; Dinc, Bedia",Ear Nose Throat J,488,24

Police officers are bravely fighting on the front lines of the epidemic. The main purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence and severity of psychological responses among police officers during the COVID-19 pandemic and find influencing factors in depression and anxiety. METHODS: A cross-sectional online questionnaire was administered to police officers in Wuhu through WeChat, and data were collected between March 10 and 26, 2020. A total of 3,561 questionnaires were received, of which 3,517 were considered valid. The questionnaires included demographic information and a psychological survey. The depression scale of the Patient Health QuestionnaireQ9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale were utilized to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: The mean depression score of participants was 4.10±4.87 (0–27), and 12.17%had moderate–severe depression. The mean anxiety score of participants was 3.59±4.228 (0–21), and 8.79% had moderate–severe anxiety. Older and married police officers were at higher risk of anxiety. Those with a bachelor’s degree or above, living near the city center, and taking sleeping pills were at greater risk of depression and anxiety. Auxiliary police had lower depression and anxiety scores. Depression scores were strongly correlated withanxiety scores (r=0.863, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our findings identify factors associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety that can be utilized to develop psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable populations during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Yuan, Lili; Zhu, Lele; Chen, Fangfang; Cheng, Qian; Yang, Qian; Zhou, Zhiming Zhou; Zhu, Yujuan; Wu, Yigao; Zhou, Yong; Zha, Xiaojuan",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,488,15

There are currently few reliable estimates for the P.1 and B.1.351 lineages. We sought to compare the secondary attack rates of SARS-COV-2 mutations and variants in Canada's largest province of Ontario, using a previously validated household-based approach. Methods: We identified individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Ontario's provincial reportable disease surveillance system. Cases were grouped into households based on reported residential address. Index cases had the earliest of symptom onset in the household. Household secondary attack rate was defined as the percentage of household contacts identified as secondary cases within 1-14 days after the index case. Results: We identified 26,888 index household cases during the study period. Among these, 7,555 (28%) were wild-type, 17,058 (63%) were B.1.1.7, 1674 (6%) were B.1.351 or P.1, and 601 (2%) were non-VOC mutants (Table 1). The secondary attack rates, according to index case variant were as follows: 20.2% (wild-type), 25.1% (B.1.1.7), 27.2% (B.1.351 or P.1), and 23.3% (non-VOC mutants). In adjusted analyses, we found that B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 index cases had the highest transmissibility (presumptive B.1.1.7 OR adjusted=1.49, 95%CI 1.36, 1.64; presumptive B.1.351 or P.1 OR adjusted=1.60, 95%CI 1.37, 1.87). Discussion: Substantially higher transmissibility associated with variants will make control of SARS-CoV-2 more difficult, reinforcing the urgent need to increase vaccination rates globally.","Brown, K.

FCoV can be divided into serotypes I and II. The virus that causes FIP (FIPV) is believed to occur sporadically and spread infrequently from cat to cat. Recently, an FIP outbreak from an animal shelter was confirmed in Taiwan. FCoV from all the cats in this shelter were analyzed to determine the epidemiology of this outbreak. Thirteen of 46 (28.2%) cats with typical signs of FIP were identified. Among them, seven cats were confirmed by necropsy and/or histopathological examinations. Despite the fact that more than one FCoV was identified in this multi-cat environment, the eight FIP cats were invariably found to be infected with a type II FCoV. Sequence analysis revealed that the type II FIPV detected from fecal samples, body effusions and granulomatous tissue homogenates from the cats that succumbed to FIP all harbored an identical recombination site in their S gene. Two of the cats that succumbed to FIP were found to harbor an identical nonsense mutation in the 3c gene. Fecal shedding of this type II virus in the effusive form of FIP can be detected up to six days before death. Taken together, our data demonstrate that horizontal transmission of FIPV is possible and that FIP cats can pose a potential risk to other cats living in the same environment.","Wang, Ying-Ting; Su, Bi-Ling; Hsieh, Li-En; Chueh, Ling-Ling",Vet Res,488,9

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.","Kucharski, Adam J.; Edmunds, W.

There was no significant difference in the viral titer and infectivity of these two strains. The S protein content of the F8 viral culture was 0.39 μg/ml, much higher than that of 8X. An inactivated vaccine made from the F8 strain could trigger high levels of the IgG titer and neutralizing antibody titer, which could last for at least 6 weeks and were significantly higher than those from the 8X strain at 1 and 3 weeks post vaccination, respectively.

IL-1α and IL-1β are powerful apical cytokines that instigate multiple downstream processes to affect both innate and adaptive immunity. Multiple studies show that IL-1β is typically activated in macrophages after inflammasome sensing of infection or danger, leading to caspase-1 processing of IL-1β and its release. However, many alternative mechanisms activate IL-1α and IL-1β in atypical cell types, and IL-1 function is also important for homeostatic processes that maintain a physiological state. This review focuses on the less studied, yet arguably more interesting biology of IL-1. We detail the production by, and effects of IL-1 on specific innate and adaptive immune cells, report how IL-1 is required for barrier function at multiple sites, and discuss how perturbation of IL-1 pathways can drive disease. Thus, although IL-1 is primarily studied for driving inflammation after release from macrophages, it is clear that it has a multifaceted role that extends far beyond this, with various unconventional effects of IL-1 vital for health. However, much is still unknown, and a detailed understanding of cell-type and context-dependent actions of IL-1 is required to truly understand this enigmatic cytokine, and safely deploy therapeutics for the betterment of human health.","Pyrillou, Katerina; Burzynski, Laura C.; Clarke, Murray C.

There are a number of measures assessing the construct of defense mechanisms, but only few available instruments reflect the gold-standard theoretical hierarchical organization of defenses. We report on the development of a novel 30 item self-report questionnaire, the DMRS-SR-30, based on the parent instrument, the Defense Mechanism Rating Scales (DMRS). This study tested preliminary reliability and validity of the Italian version of the DMRS-SR-30. We first extracted 30 items from the DMRS Q-sort version (DMRS-Q) and adapted them for a self-reported format. We then applied the DMRS quantitative scoring algorithms to provide proportional scores for the 28 individual defenses and summary scores for seven defense levels and overall defensive functioning (ODF) scores. A dynamic interview was used for assessing participant’s defense mechanisms with the observer-rated DMRS and DMRS-Q. We examined internal consistency of the scales along with criterion, concurrent, convergent and discriminant validity among participants (N = 94) who completed the DMRS-SR-30, SCL-90, BDI, and IES-R. Results showed very good internal consistency for ODF (Cronbach’s alpha = .890) and the high adaptive defense level, whereas some subscales with few items had lower values. Correlation analyses between DMRS-SR-30 and the two DMRS-based observer-rated measures showed very good criterion and concurrent validity for ODF and moderate to high for defense levels subscales. Correlations between the DMRS-SR-30 ODF and SCL-90 GSI, BDI and IES=R (r = −.456, r= −.540, r = −.402, respectively, all p <.001), indicated good convergent validity. Despite the well-known limitations of self-report methods of psychodynamic phenomena, self-report measures are highly practicable for assessing large samples. The DMRS-SR-30 is the first self-assessed measure describing the whole hierarchy of 28 defense mechanisms and providing scores for ODF, defensive categories, defense levels, and individual defenses. Preliminary examination of the Italian version of the DMRS-SR-30 showed promising results of internal consistency, criterion and concurrent validity, and convergent validity and of the measure. Further validation is needed to confirm these findings and explore other aspects of validity and reliability.","Di Giuseppe, Mariagrazia; Perry, John Christopher; Lucchesi, Matilde; Michelini, Monica; Vitiello, Sara; Piantanida, Aurora; Fabiani, Matilde; Maffei, Sara; Conversano, Ciro",Front Psychiatry,488,16

During the lockdown, we observed a significant increase in onset-to-door time (median = 387 vs 161 min, p = 0.001), a significant reduction of the total number of thrombolysis (7 vs 13, p = 0.033), a non-significant increase of thrombectomy (15 vs 9, p = 0.451), and a significant increase in door-to-groin time (median = 120 vs 93 min, p = 0.048). No relevant difference was observed between 2019 and 2020 in the total number of patients admitted. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures, the stroke care pathway changed, involving both pre-hospital and in-hospital performances.","Frisullo, Giovanni; Brunetti, Valerio; Di Iorio, Riccardo; Broccolini, Aldobrando; Caliandro, Pietro; Monforte, Mauro; Morosetti, Roberta; Piano, Carla; Pilato, Fabio; Calabresi, Paolo; Della Marca, Giacomo",Neurol Sci,488,16

AIMS: To study the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 on work practices, lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during shelter-at-home restrictions. METHODS: We added follow-up after completion of a clinical trial among desk workers to longitudinally measure sedentary behaviour, physical activity, sleep, diet, mood, quality of life and work-related health using validated questionnaires and surveys. We compared outcomes assessed before and during COVID-19 shelter-at-home restrictions. We assessed whether changes in outcomes differed by remote working status (always, changed to or never remote) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). RESULTS: Participants (N = 112; 69% female; mean (SD) age = 45.4 (12.3) years; follow-up = 13.5 (6.8) months) had substantial changes to work practices, including 72% changing to remote work. Deleterious changes from before to during shelter-at-home included: 1.3 (3.5)-h increase in non-workday sedentary behaviour; 0.7 (2.8)-point worsening of sleep quality; 8.5 (21.2)-point increase in mood disturbance; reductions in five of eight quality of life subscales; 0.5 (1.1)-point decrease in work-related health (P < 0.05). Other outcomes, including diet, physical activity and workday sedentary behaviour, remained stable (P ≥ 0.05). Workers who were remote before and during the pandemic had greater increases in non-workday sedentary behaviour and stress, with greater declines in physical functioning. Wake time was delayed overall by 41 (61) min, and more so in workers who changed to remote. CONCLUSIONS: Employers should consider supporting healthy lifestyle and well-being among desk workers during pandemic-related social restrictions, regardless of remote working status.","Barone Gibbs, B; Kline, C E; Huber, K A; Paley, J L; Perera, S",Occup Med (Lond),488,24

This study aimed to describe the prevalence of symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its risk factors in children and adolescents aged 0–18 years in Qatar. We conducted a cross-sectional study of all children aged 0–18 years diagnosed with COVID-19 using polymerase chain reaction in Qatar during the period 1st March to 31st July 2020. A generalised linear model with a binomial family and identity link was used to assess the association between selected factors and the prevalence of symptomatic infection. A total of 11 445 children with a median age of 8 years (interquartile range (IQR) 3–13 years) were included in this study. The prevalence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 36.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 35.7–37.5), and it was similar between children aged <5 years (37.8%), 5–9 years (34.3%) and 10 + years (37.3%). The most frequently reported symptoms among the symptomatic group were fever (73.5%), cough (34.8%), headache (23.2%) and sore throat (23.2%). Fever (82.8%) was more common in symptomatic children aged <5 years, while cough (38.7%) was more prevalent in those aged 10 years or older, compared to other age groups. Variables associated with an increased risk of symptomatic infection were; contact with confirmed cases (RD 0.21; 95% CI 0.20–0.23; P = 0.001), having visited a health care facility (RD 0.54; 95% CI 0.45–0.62; P = 0.001), and children aged under 5 years (RD 0.05; 95% CI 0.02–0.07; P = 0.001) or aged 10 years or older (RD 0.04; 95% CI 0.02–0.06; P = 0.001). A third of the children with COVID-19 were symptomatic with a higher proportion of fever in very young children and a higher proportion of cough in those between 10 and 18 years of age.","Musa, Omran A.

Applying the Pontryagin’s Minimum Principle (PMP) to the unconstrained control problems (i.e. without costs of control or resource limitations), we prove that, for all the policies investigated, only bang–bang controls with at most one switch are admitted. When a switch occurs, the optimal strategy is to delay the control action some amount of time and then apply the control at the maximum rate for the remainder of the outbreak. This result is in contrast with previous findings on the unconstrained problems of minimizing the total infectious burden over an outbreak, where the optimal strategy is to use the maximal control for the entire epidemic. Then, the critical consequence of our results is that, in a wide range of epidemiological circumstances, it may be impossible to minimize the total infectious burden while minimizing the epidemic duration, and vice versa. Moreover, numerical simulations highlighted additional unexpected results, showing that the optimal control can be delayed also when the control reproduction number is lower than one and that the switching time from no control to maximum control can even occur after the peak of infection has been reached. Our results are especially important for livestock diseases where the minimization of outbreaks duration is a priority due to sanitary restrictions imposed to farms during ongoing epidemics, such as animal movements and export bans.","Bolzoni, Luca; Bonacini, Elena; Soresina, Cinzia; Groppi, Maria",Math Biosci,488,17

We present relationships of age, sex, and nationality to presenting symptoms. METHODS: International, prospective observational study of 60 109 hospitalized symptomatic patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 recruited from 43 countries between 30 January and 3 August 2020. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate relationships of age and sex to published COVID-19 case definitions and the most commonly reported symptoms. RESULTS: ‘Typical’ symptoms of fever (69%), cough (68%) and shortness of breath (66%) were the most commonly reported. 92% of patients experienced at least one of these. Prevalence of typical symptoms was greatest in 30- to 60-year-olds (respectively 80, 79, 69%; at least one 95%). They were reported less frequently in children (≤ 18 years: 69, 48, 23; 85%), older adults (≥ 70 years: 61, 62, 65; 90%), and women (66, 66, 64; 90%; vs. men 71, 70, 67; 93%, each P < 0.001). The most common atypical presentations under 60 years of age were nausea and vomiting and abdominal pain, and over 60 years was confusion. Regression models showed significant differences in symptoms with sex, age and country. INTERPRETATION: This international collaboration has allowed us to report reliable symptom data from the largest cohort of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19. Adults over 60 and children admitted to hospital with COVID-19 are less likely to present with typical symptoms. Nausea and vomiting are common atypical presentations under 30 years. Confusion is a frequent atypical presentation of COVID-19 in adults over 60 years. Women are less likely to experience typical symptoms than men.

Patients with underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension, and other diseases are more prone to infection. An understanding of the different comorbidities that place patients at the highest risk of COVID-19 pneumonia and other fatal complications associated with COVID-19 is necessary for healthcare professionals. This study aimed to determine the frequency of different comorbid illnesses among COVID-19 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who required admission for the care of their symptoms were included in this observational, cross-sectional study conducted from May 1 to July 30, 2020. The patients were treated at a specialized COVID-19 isolation ward built at the Dow University of Health Sciences at the Ojha campus. The patients were referred from the emergency department, medical and allied wards, and COVID-19 screening units. A detailed history and clinical examination were performed, and comorbidities were evaluated. Results A total of 212 patients were admitted during the study with a mean age of 52 ± 16 years. The study population consisted of 120 (56.6%) males and 92 (43.39%) females, and the most common comorbidities were uncontrolled diabetes with hypertension (n = 56; 26.4%), controlled diabetes (n = 22; 10.37%), obstructive airway disease (n = 16; 7.5%), and interstitial lung disease (n = 14; 6.6%). A total of 48 (22.64%) patients had no comorbidities. Conclusions Most COVID-19-positive patients with pneumonia were male, and common comorbidities included uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, and obstructive and restrictive lung disease. The presence of comorbidities was associated with a marked increase in the risk of morbidity and mortality. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings.","Hussain, Muneer; Iltaf, Samar; Salman, Salma; Ghuman, Faiza; Abbas, Saira; Fatima, Meraj",Cureus,488,12

We assessed whether RPP decreases antibiotic days of therapy and length of hospital stay for pediatric patients with acute respiratory infections. In the inpatient population, patients testing positive with RPP were given fewer antibiotic days of therapy (2.99 vs 4.30 days; P = .032) and had shorter hospital stays (2.84 vs 3.80 days; P = .055) than patients testing negative. In the ED population, patients testing positive with RPP received fewer discharge prescriptions for antibiotics than patients not tested (8.8% vs 41.1%; P < .001). RPP use was more prevalent in admitted patients than in ED patients (78.9% vs 7.3%; P < .001). Our results suggest that RPP testing curbs antibiotic use and decreases length of hospital stay.","Zhu, Chelsea; Sidiki, Sabeen; Grider, Brittany; Fink, Brian; Hubbard, Nicole; Mukundan, Deepa",Clin Pediatr (Phila),488,5

MERS-CoV infection consequences with either hospitalization or death. METHODS: All positive MERS-CoV cases that diagnosed in and reported to a referral hospital in Najran, KSA from March/2014 to December/2018 were revised retrospectively. We identified patients from infection control department and medical records. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: Of the 54 positive MERS-CoV cases, 3 cases were excluded because no available data. Therefore, the final number of the included cases in the study was 51 cases (94.4). Most of the patients were Saudi 36 (70.6%), and majority of cases were reported in the winter 18 (35.3) season. Fever 47 (92.2%), cough 44 (86.3%), and shortness of breath 37 (72.5%) were reported as most common symptoms. Most patients had DM and hypertension. Overall mortality rate was 37.3%, and interestingly the mortality rate dropped sharply over 5 years. In logistic regression analysis, Season and Chronic Kidney disease patients were the only two variables statistically significantly associated with death. The odds of death the patients infected by MERS-CoV during Autumn and Winter season were 4.09 times higher than those patients who infected during Spring and Summer season (OR = 4.09, CI 1.18-14.15, P < 0.026). Compared with MERS-CoV patients who had Non-Chronic kidney diseases, the odds of death the MERS-CoV patients who had chronic kidney diseases were 18.08 times higher (OR = 18.08, CI -2.01-162.99, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The mortality rate of MERS-CoV infection was high. Further studies with large sample sizes are needed to explore the reasons behind the decrease in the mortality rate over the time period.","Al Sulayyim, Hadi J.; Khorshid, Sherif Mohamed; Al Moummar, Satam H.",J Infect Public Health,488,16
