Since infertility is a major concern following chemotherapy, it is important to characterize the drug-specific damage to the reproductive system to help find appropriate protective strategies. This study investigates the damage on neonatal mouse ovary maintained in vitro for 6 days, and exposed for 24 h (on Day 2) to clinically relevant doses of Docetaxel (DOC; low: 0.1 µM, mid: 1 µM, high: 10 µM). Furthermore, the study explores the putative protective action exerted by Tri-iodothyronine (T3; 10(−7) M). At the end of culture, morphological analyses and follicle counts showed that DOC negatively impacts on early growing follicles, decreasing primary follicle number and severely affecting health at the transitional and primary stages. Poor follicle health was mainly due to effects on granulosa cells, indicating that the effects of DOC on oocytes were likely to be secondary to granulosa cell damage. DOC damages growing follicles specifically, with no direct effect on the primordial follicle reserve. Immunostaining and western blotting showed that DOC induces activation of intrinsic, type II apoptosis in ovarian somatic cells; increasing the levels of cleaved caspase 3, cleaved caspase 8, Bax and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, while also inducing movement of cytochrome C from mitochondria into the cytosol. T3 did not prevent the damage induced by the low dose of DOC. These results demonstrated that DOC induces a gonadotoxic effect on the mouse ovary through induction of somatic cell apoptosis, with no evidence of direct effects on the oocyte, and that the damaging effect is not mitigated by T3.","Lopes, Federica; Smith, Rowena; Anderson, Richard A.; Spears, Norah",Mol Hum Reprod,310,1
4306,4306,4306,The Optimal Age of Vaccination Against Dengue with an Age-Dependent Biting Rate with Application to Brazil,13.676913,4.2985888,2020-01-14,"In this paper we introduce a single serotype transmission model, including an age-dependent mosquito biting rate, to find the optimal vaccination age against dengue in Brazil with Dengvaxia. The optimal vaccination age and minimal lifetime expected risk of hospitalisation are found by adapting a method due to Hethcote (Math Biosci 89:29–52). Any number and combination of the four dengue serotypes DENv1–4 is considered. Successful vaccination against a serotype corresponds to a silent infection. The effects of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) and permanent cross-immunity after two heterologous infections are studied. ADE is assumed to imply risk-free primary infections, while permanent cross-immunity implies risk-free tertiary and quaternary infections. Data from trials of Dengvaxia indicate vaccine efficacy to be age and serostatus dependent and vaccination of seronegative individuals to induce an increased risk of hospitalisation. Some of the scenarios are therefore reconsidered taking these findings into account. The optimal vaccination age is compared to that achievable under the current age restriction of the vaccine. If vaccination is not considered to induce risk, optimal vaccination ages are very low. The assumption of ADE generally leads to a higher optimal vaccination age in this case. For a single serotype vaccination is not recommended in the case of ADE. Permanent cross-immunity results in a slightly lower optimal vaccination age. If vaccination induces a risk, the optimal vaccination ages are much higher, particularly for permanent cross-immunity. ADE has no effect on the optimal vaccination age when permanent cross-immunity is considered; otherwise, it leads to a slight increase in optimal vaccination age.

4744,4744,4744,Role of environmental persistence in pathogen transmission: a mathematical modeling approach,13.681711,4.071501,2012-03-01,"During the influenza pandemic in 2009 individuals had the choice of either receiving a vaccination or running the risk of becoming infected with the pandemic influenza virus A (H1N1). For many individuals knowledge of a likely infection and possibly serious health consequences stood in contrast to a vague fear of the vaccination itself. What has a stronger influence on the decision to be vaccinated: the cognitive estimation of risk or the feeling of risk? Based on data collected during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic we tested the relative influence of the cognitive and affective aspects of risk on estimation of the individual willingness to be vaccinated. In doing so we also focused on fear. The results indicate that the feeling of risk had a significant effect on the willingness to be vaccinated. In contrast, the classic, cognitive estimation of a risk was no longer a significant predictor when the feeling of risk was also used to predict the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk to become infected with influenza A (H1N1) substantially increased the willingness to be vaccinated. A highly felt risk regarding the vaccination, on the other hand, decreased the willingness to be vaccinated. Fear of the vaccination significantly decreased the willingness to be vaccinated even when fear of the spreading disease was also very high. The implications of the results for crisis communications will also be discussed.","Betsch, C.; Schmid, P.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,310,1

This guideline can only be used as a blueprint in combination with other specific guidelines, especially those concerned with EC recommendations during production and quality control for various biotech products. A potential risk associated with the production and use of biological products is viral contamination. This contamination may be present in the source material, eg. human blood, human or animal tissues, cell banks, or introduced in the manufacturing process through the use of animal sera (eg. foetal calf serum or trypsin) in cell culture supernatant. The objectives of validation are to establish — ideally both qualitatively as well as quantitatively — the overall level of virus clearance. Evidence of viral clearance must be obtained in all stages of purification and adequate viral removal and/or inactivation must be proven. The method used when validating viral removal and /or inactivation is by challenging the system through the deliberate addition (“spiking”) of significant amounts of virus into the crude material to be purified and to different fractions obtained during the various purification stages. Removal or inactivation of the virus during the subsequent stages of purification and /or inactivation is thereafter determined. Such a quality system is by no means a simple one: it is estimated that in some production lines around 600 Standard Operating Procedures are necessary to guarantee the quality and the safety of the desired biotechnological product. Small companies will probably not be able to perform all procedures needed for obtaining the desired quality of the product. Then, external laboratories may take over a part of the Part II development requirements, which may not be representative for the total of internal Quality Assurance. New developments in the production and quality control of biotechnological products may require that companies should introduce novel, sophisticated methods such as: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), as yet not recommended by the CPMP in detail.","Trijzelaar, Ben",Biotherapy,310,1

These statutes, despite their frequency, are misguided in terms of the goals of the criminal law and the public health aim of reducing overall burdens of disease, for at least three important reasons. First, they identify individual offenders for punishment, a paradigm that is misplaced in the most typical contexts of transmission of infectious disease and even for HIV/AIDS, despite claims of AIDS exceptionalism. Second, although there are examples of individuals who transmit infectious disease in a manner that fits the criminal law paradigm of identification of individual offenders for deterrence or retribution, these examples are limited and can be accommodated by existing criminal laws not devoted specifically to infectious disease. Third, and most importantly, the current criminal laws regarding HIV/AIDS, like many other criminal laws applied to infectious disease transmission, have been misguided in focusing on punishment of the diseased individual as a wrongful transmitter. Instead of individual offenders, activities that enhance the scale of disease transmission—behaviors that might be characterized as ‘transmission facilitation’—are a more appropriate target for the criminal law. Examples are trafficking in human beings (including sex trafficking, organ trafficking, and labor trafficking), suppression of information about the emergence of infection in circumstances in which there is a legally established obligation to disclose, and intentional or reckless activities to discourage disease treatment or prevention. Difficulties remain with justifications for criminalizing even these behaviors, however, most importantly the need for trust in reducing overall burdens of disease, problems in identifying individual responsible offenders, and potential misalignment between static criminal law and the changing nature of infectious disease.","Francis, Leslie Pickering; Francis, John G.",Crim Law Philos,310,1

Two dogs had experimental infections while the third was a spontaneous case. Two stages were identified in the process of demyelination. The earliest evidence of myelin injury was a ballooning change in myelin sheaths involving single or multiple axons. This was followed by a progressive stripping of compact sheaths by the cytoplasmic fingers of phagocytic cells which infiltrated and removed myelin lamellae. Some axonal necrosis also accompanied these changes. Where demyelination occurred, canine distemper viral nucleocapsids were found in astrocytes, macrophages, ependymal cells and infiltrating lymphocytes. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were conspicuous by their apparent lack of infection. Thus it seems that myelin loss cannot be ascribed to oligodendrocyte infection. Perturbed astrocyte function following canine distemper viral infection may cause oedema of myelin sheaths, leading to ballooning and primary demyelination. Cells which phagocytosed myelin were mainly identified as microglial cells with lesser involvement by astrocytes. Rarely, oligodendrocytes also acted as macrophages. Myelin debris was engulfed in bulk or as small droplets into coated pits. Remyelination was present in established plaques although not in great abundance, perhaps due to the diminished oligodendrocyte numbers and a relative increase in immature forms of these cells. These observations are compared to similar changes observed in other demyelinating diseases of animals and man.","Sumummers, Brian A.; Appel, Max J. G.",J Neurocytol,310,7

Yet, the future holds some of the greatest public health challenges in mankind’s history. Global disparities in health; medication safety; climate change; epidemics of obesity and diabetes; an aging world demographic; and emerging infections all represent problems requiring scientific solutions. The solutions to these problems, like the solutions to those in the last century that contributed so greatly to our quality of life, will require paradigm-shifting innovation. To maximize individual innovative potential, one strategy is formal instruction in the methods of innovative thinking. Teaching innovative thinking is rarely integrated into science training. However 40 years of accumulated evidence suggests that formal instruction results in improved thinking skills. I describe here some of the methods integrated into a course for graduate and professional health science students entitled Innovative Thinking. The curriculum consists of three components: recognizing and finding alternatives to habitual cognitive patterns; learning to use tools that enhance idea generation and originality; and harmonizing divergent thinking with the process of convergent thinking that is central to the scientific method. To build more innovative environments, institutions can promote team science, fund staged scientific designs that are heavy on early prototypes, reward and grow the training programs of past innovators, and become less risk averse. Although public health has accomplished much, it must continue to battle major, growing causes of disease and disability. Innovation is the engine of scientific discovery. Releasing the great potential for discovery in all of us must be central to forwarding health and prosperity in the world.","Ness, Roberta B.",Public Health Rev,310,1

The brain is critically dependent on oxygen delivery, and reduced brain tissue oxygen tension (P(bt)O(2)) may result in poor outcome after brain injury. We tested the hypothesis that obesity is associated with compromised P(bt)O(2) after severe brain injury. METHODS: Patients with severe brain injury (GCS score ≤ 8) who underwent continuous P(bt)O(2) monitoring were retrospectively identified from a prospective single-center database. Patients, were classified by body mass index (BMI = weight (kg)/m(2)) and were included if they were obese (BMI ≥ 30) or non-obese (BMI = <30). RESULTS: Sixty-nine patients (mean age 46.4 ± 17.0 years) were included. Mean daily P(bt)O(2) was 25.8 (9.6) mmHg for the 28 obese and 31.8 (12.3) mmHg for the 41 non-obese patients (P = 0.03). Initial P(bt)O(2) and mean daily maximum P(bt)O(2) measurements also were significantly lower in obese patients than in non-obese patients. Univariate predictors of compromised P(bt)O(2) (defined as minutes P(bt)O(2) < 20 mmHg) included elevated BMI (P = 0.02), presence of ARDS (P < 0.01), mean PaO(2) (P < 0.01), maximum FiO(2) (P < 0.01), mean PaO(2):FiO(2) (P < 0.01), and mean CVP (P < 0.01). In multivariable analysis, BMI was significantly associated with compromised P(bt)O(2) (P = 0.02). Sex, age, and mean CVP were also identified as significant predictors of compromised P(bt)O(2); ARDS and PF ratio were not. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe brain injury, obesity was found to be an independent predictor of compromised P(bt)O(2). This effect may be mediated through obesity-related pulmonary dysfunction and inadequate compensatory mechanisms.","Kumar, Monisha A.; Chanderraj, Rishi; Gant, Ryan; Butler, Christi; Frangos, Suzanne; Maloney-Wilensky, Eileen; Faerber, Jennifer; Andrew Kofke, W.; Levine, Joshua M.; LeRoux, Peter",Neurocrit Care,310,1

Sustaining control of VL in terms of proper and prevailing immunity development is a global necessity amid unavailability of a prophylactic vaccine. Screening of experimental proteome of the human disease propagating form of Leishmania donovani (amastigote) can be more pragmatic for in silico mining of novel vaccine candidates. METHODS: By using an immunoinformatic approach, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell-specific epitopes from experimentally reported L. donovani proteins having secretory potential and increased abundance in amastigotes were screened. A chimera linked with a Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) peptide adjuvant was constructed and evaluated for physicochemical characteristics, binding interaction with TLR4 in simulated physiological condition and the trend of immune response following hypothetical immunization. RESULTS: Selected epitopes from physiologically important L. donovani proteins were found mostly conserved in L. infantum, covering theoretically more than 98% of the global population. The multi-epitope chimeric vaccine was predicted as stable, antigenic and non-allergenic. Structural analysis of vaccine-TLR4 receptor docked complex and its molecular dynamics simulation suggest sufficiently stable binding interface along with prospect of non-canonical receptor activation. Simulation dynamics of immune response following hypothetical immunization indicate active and memory B as well as CD4+ T cell generation potential, and likely chance of a more Th1 polarized response. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological approach and results from this study could facilitate more informed screening and selection of candidate antigenic proteins for entry into vaccine production pipeline in future to control human VL.

Similar data for non‐tree species with separated genders are inconclusive. Recent studies on pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms (Arecaceae) suggest that species are either insect‐ or wind‐pollinated. However, the wide variety of inflorescence and floral attributes within the genus suggests mixed pollination mode involving entomophily and anemophily. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the pollination of Chamaedorea costaricana,C. macrospadix,C. pinnatifrons and C. tepejilote in two montane forests in Costa Rica. A complementary morphological analysis of floral traits was carried out to distinguish species groups within the genus according to their most probable pollination mechanism. We conducted pollinator exclusion experiments, field observations on visitors to pistillate and staminate inflorescences, and trapped airborne pollen. A cluster analysis using 18 floral traits selected for their association with wind and insect pollination syndromes was carried out using 52 Chamaedorea species. Exclusion experiments showed that both wind and insects, mostly thrips (Thysanoptera), pollinated the studied species. Thrips used staminate inflorescences as brood sites and pollinated pistillate flowers by deception. Insects caught on pistillate inflorescences transported pollen, while traps proved that pollen is wind‐borne. Our empirical findings clearly suggest that pollination of dioecious Chamaedorea palms is likely to involve both insects and wind. A cluster analysis showed that the majority of studied species have a combination of floral traits that allow for both pollination modes. Our pollination experiments and morphological analysis both suggest that while some species may be completely entomophilous or anemophilous, ambophily might be a common condition within Chamaedorea. Our results propose a higher diversity of pollination mechanisms of Neotropical dioecious species than previously suggested.","Ríos, L. D.; Fuchs, E. J.; Hodel, D.

It can cause a wide range of symptoms, including diffuse alveolar haemorrhage which occurs in a minority of cases but carries a mortality of over 70%. These patients may present with severe acute respiratory failure. The differential diagnosis for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage is broad whereas prompt diagnosis and treatment can be lifesaving. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old previously fit and well trout farm worker presented with a 3-day history of malaise, fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting and jaundice. He developed haemoptysis, severe headaches, neck stiffness and photophobia on the day of emergency admission. He was anaemic and thrombocytopenic. Anuric acute kidney injury (urea 32, creat 507) required immediate haemofiltration. In view of progressive respiratory failure with four-quadrant lung infiltrates on imaging, he was given broad spectrum antibiotics and pulsed methylprednisolone empirically, in case of a vasculitic pulmonary-renal presentation. He was intubated within 48 h of admission. Despite attempted protective ventilatory management, he remained hypoxaemic and developed pneumomediastinum. He was retrieved to a specialist cardiorespiratory intensive care unit on femoro-femoral mobile VV-ECMO. Three days from admission, results showed positive Leptospira IgM and real-time PCR. Serial bronchoscopies showed old and fresh clots, but not the classical progressive late red tinge of the returned lavage fluid. After eight days, VV-ECMO was weaned, he was extubated three days later, and made a full recovery. At 9 months follow-up, he was clinically better, with resolution of the CT scan findings and near normal lung function, albeit with low normal gas transfer. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis is a rare but important differential to be considered in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage presenting to the ICU, especially in young males. A thorough history for occupational or recreational risk factors may offer the diagnostic clue. Most patients recover fully with antibiotics. However, resulting acute severe respiratory failure can ensue. In this situation, early consideration for respiratory ECMO support offers time for clearance of endobronchial clot, parenchymal recovery, and prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury. Steroids have no clear evidence but may be used to avoid delay in treating suspected vasculitic or autoimmune causes of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.","Barnacle, James; Gurney, Stefan; Ledot, Stephane; Singh, Suveer",J Intensive Care,310,1

CIRE/mDC-SIGN is down-regulated upon activation, but unlike hDC-SIGN, incubation with IL-4 and IL-13 did not enhance CIRE/mDC-SIGN expression, indicating differences in gene regulation. Like hDC-SIGN, CIRE/mDC-SIGN bound mannosylated residues. However, we could detect no role for CIRE/mDC-SIGN in T cell–DC interactions and the protein did not bind to pathogens known to interact with hDC-SIGN, including Leishmania mexicana, cytomegalovirus, HIV and lentiviral particles bearing the Ebolavirus glycoprotein. The binding of CIRE/mDC-SIGN to hDC-SIGN ligands was not rescued when CIRE/mDC-SIGN was engineered to express the stalk region of hDC-SIGN. We conclude that there are significant differences in the fine specificity of the C-type lectin domains of hDC-SIGN and CIRE/mDC-SIGN and that these two molecules may not be functional orthologues.","Caminschi, Irina; Corbett, Alexandra J; Zahra, Corina; Lahoud, Mireille; Lucas, Karen M; Sofi, Mariam; Vremec, David; Gramberg, Thomas; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Curtis, Joan; Handman, Emanuela; van Dommelen, Serani L H; Fleming, Peter; Degli-Esposti, Mariapia A; Shortman, Ken; Wright, Mark D",Int Immunol,310,5

A tracheostomy tube inserted through an opening in the patient neck into the trachea is connected to a ventilator for suctioning. Currently, nurses spend millions of person-hours yearly to perform this task. To save significant person-hours, an automated mechatronic tracheostomy system is needed. This system allows for relieving nurses and other carers from the millions of person-hours spent yearly on tracheal suctioning. In addition, it will result in huge healthcare cost savings. Methods: We introduce a novel mechatronic tracheostomy system including the development of a long suction catheter, automatic suctioning mechanisms, and relevant control approaches to perform tracheal suctioning automatically. To stop the catheter at a desired position, two approaches are introduced: 1) Based on the known travel length of the catheter tip; 2) Based on a new sensing device integrated at the catheter tip. It is known that backlash nonlinearity between the suction catheter and its conduit as well as in the gear system of the actuator are unavoidable. They cause difficulties to control the exact position of the catheter tip. For the former case, we develop an approximate model of backlash and a direct inverse scheme to enhance the system performances. The scheme does not require any complex inversions of the backlash model and allows easy implementations. For the latter case, a new sensing device integrated into the suction catheter tip is developed and backlash compensation controls are avoided. Results: Automated suctioning validations are successfully carried out on the proposed experimental system. Comparisons and discussions are also introduced. Significance: The results demonstrate a significant contribution and potential benefits to the mechanical ventilation areas.",,IEEE Trans Biomed Eng,310,22

The loss of control in trafficking these cells contributes to inflammatory diseases. Leukocyte recruitment is a well-orchestrated process that includes several protein families including the large cytokine subfamily of chemotactic cytokines, the chemokines. Chemokines and their receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases. Acute lung injury that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from clinical events including major surgery, trauma, multiple transfusions, severe burns, pancreatitis, and sepsis. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome involves activation of alveolar macrophages and sequestered neutrophils in the lung. The clinical hallmarks of ARDS are severe hypoxemia, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, and normal intracardiac filling pressures. The magnitude and duration of the inflammatory process may ultimately determine the outcome in patients with ARDS. Recent evidence shows that activated leukocytes and chemokines play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. The expanding number of antagonists of chemokine receptors for inflammatory disorders may hold promise for new medicines to combat ARDS.","Puneet, Padmam; Moochhala, Shabbir; Bhatia, Madhav",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,310,1

As dangers facing our communities include terroristic events physicians must be adequately prepared to respond, both medically and ethically. While the ethical principles that govern physician behavior—beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and social justice—are unchanging, fundamental doctrines must change with the new risks inherent to terroristic events.

The high antibacterial activity and low cytotoxicity render this natural compound an interesting alternative against resistant bacteria. The aim of this study is to understand the mechanism of action of AHR on MRSA, using the MRSA/Vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) strain CIP 106760, and to study the AHR effect on lipid bilayers and on the cell wall. Although AHR interacted with lipid bilayers, it did not have a significant effect on membrane passive permeability. Alternatively, bacteria treated with this royleanone displayed cell wall disruption, without revealing cell lysis. In conclusion, the results gathered so far point to a yet undescribed mode of action that needs further investigation.","Pereira, Filipe; Figueiredo, Teresa; de Almeida, Rodrigo F.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of RAMIE using the microanatomy-based concept in the initial introduction phase. METHODS: We have performed more than 500 TEPP procedures as minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE). After performing about 400 cases of MIE, we established a microanatomy-based standardization of UMLND. In October 2018, we introduced RAMIE, and have performed 75 procedures in 20 months. Two groups were analyzed: a group after microanatomy-based standardization in TEPP (100 cases after completing 400 cases of TEPP) and a RAMIE group (75 cases). Finally, 51 paired cases were matched using a propensity score. Furthermore, the change in postoperative short-term outcome for RAMIE in the initial introduction phase was analyzed. RESULTS: Although there were no significant differences between the two groups in the number of upper mediastinal lymph nodes dissected, there was a significant decrease (P = 0.036) in intraoperative blood loss volume with RAMIE, representing a definite benefit for patients. The thoracoscopic operative time for RAMIE decreased by almost 100 min following less than 50 cases of experience, reaching the same level as that for recent TEPP, but with only one-tenth the operator experience. There were no significant differences in the total postoperative morbidity rate including the recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy rate. CONCLUSION: RAMIE has been introduced safely and smoothly using the microanatomy-based concept established in TEPP.","Shirakawa, Yasuhiro; Noma, Kazuhiro; Kunitomo, Tomoyoshi; Hashimoto, Masashi; Maeda, Naoaki; Tanabe, Shunsuke; Sakurama, Kazufumi; Fujiwara, Toshiyoshi",Surg Endosc,310,1

This communication occurs through the response of receptors, located on target organs, to the binding of secreted ligands from source organs. Albeit years of research, the roles these receptors play in tissues is only partially understood. This work presents a new methodology based on the enrichment analysis scores of co-expression networks fed into support vector machines (SVMs) and k-NN classifiers to predict the tissue-specific metabolic roles of receptors. The approach is primarily based on the detection of coordination patterns of receptors expression. These patterns and the enrichment analysis scores of their co-expression networks were used to analyse ~ 700 receptors and predict metabolic roles of receptors in subcutaneous adipose. To facilitate supervised learning, a list of known metabolic and non-metabolic receptors was constructed using a semi-supervised approach following literature-based verification. Our approach confirms that pathway enrichment scores are good signatures for correctly classifying the metabolic receptors in adipose. We also show that the k-NN method outperforms the SVM method in classifying metabolic receptors. Finally, we predict novel metabolic roles of receptors. These predictions can enhance biological understanding and the development of new receptor-targeting metabolic drugs.","Somekh, Judith",Sci Rep,310,11

It is very efficient to apply computer-aided drug design techniques to quickly identify promising drug repurposing candidates, especially after the detailed 3D-structures of key virous proteins are resolved. Taking the advantage of a recently released crystal structure of COVID-19 protease in complex with a covalently-bonded inhibitor, N3,(1) I conducted virtual docking screening of approved drugs and drug candidates in clinical trials. For the top docking hits, I then performed molecular dynamics simulations followed by binding free energy calculations using an endpoint method called MM-PBSA-WSAS.(2–4) Several promising known drugs stand out as potential inhibitors of COVID-19 protease, including Carfilzomib, Eravacycline, Valrubicin, Lopinavir and Elbasvir. Carfilzomib, an approved anti-cancer drug acting as a proteasome inhibitor, has the best MM-PBSA-WSAS binding free energy, −13.82 kcal/mol. Streptomycin, an antibiotic and a charged molecule, also demonstrates some inhibitory effect, even though the predicted binding free energy of the charged form (−3.82 kcal/mol) is not nearly as low as that of the neutral form (−7.92 kcal/mol). One bioactive, PubChem 23727975, has a binding free energy of −12.86 kcal/mol. Detailed receptor-ligand interactions were analyzed and hot spots for the receptor-ligand binding were identified. I found that one hotspot residue HIS41, is a conserved residue across many viruses including COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and HCV.

KB109 is a novel synthetic glycan that was formulated to modulate the gut microbiome composition and metabolic output in order to increase beneficial short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production in the gut. The K031 study is designed to evaluate the safety of KB109 and characterize its impact on the natural progression of COVID-19 in patients with mild to moderate disease. The K032 study is evaluating the effect of KB109 on the gut microbiota structure and function in this same patient population. Additionally, both studies are evaluating measures of health care utilization, quality of life (QOL), laboratory indices, biomarkers of inflammation, and serological measures of immunity in patients who received SSC alone or with KB109. Noteworthy aspects of these outpatient studies include study design measures aimed at limiting in-person interactions to minimize the risk of infection spread, such as use of online diaries, telemedicine, and at-home sample collection. STUDY DESIGN: K031 and K032 are randomized, controlled, open-label, clinical food studies. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion Criteria: • Adults ≥18 years of age • Patients willing and able to give informed consent • Screening/randomization telemedicine visit within 2 days of testing positive test for COVID-19 ○ In K031 study, symptomatic patients at COVID-19 testing must report new or worsening symptoms at baseline that have not been present for more than 5 days ▪ Cardinal COVID-19 symptoms include fever, chills/repeated shaking with chills, cough, shortness of breath, headache, muscle pain, anosmia/ageusia, and sore throat. The 5 additional symptoms include gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance/symptoms (other than diarrhea), diarrhea, fatigue, nasal congestion, and chest tightness ○ In K031, at COVID-19 testing, pre-symptomatic patients must report new cardinal COVID-19 symptoms within 7 days of a positive test and they must be screened and randomized within 5 days of developing symptoms • Mild to moderate COVID-19 and self-reported outpatient management ○ In K032, mild to moderate COVID-19 was defined as having the following symptoms for no more than 72 hours before COVID-19 testing: a self- reported fever or cough (new or exacerbated) or presence of at least 2 of the following: anosmia, sore throat, or nasal congestion • Ability to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol requirements • Consistent internet or cell phone access with a data plan and access to a smartphone, tablet, or computer • The K031 and K032 studies are currently being conducted at 17 clinical institutions throughout the United States.

During SSC, patients should follow the steps as instructed by their healthcare provider to care for themselves and protect other people in the home and community from potentially contracting COVID-19. Management of COVID-19-related symptoms with over-the-counter cough, cold, and anti-pyretic medications by patients is permitted in accordance with the medications’ respective drug facts label or as instructed by the patient’s healthcare provider. Following randomization, patients assigned to receive KB109 and SSC will receive a Kaleido Biosciences, Inc at-home study kit including a thermometer, pulse oximeter, and KB109. During the Intake Period (days 1–14), KB109 will be reconstituted in water by the patient and consumed by the patient twice daily (at least 8 hours apart), following an up-titration dosing schedule: Days 1 to 2: 9 g twice daily for a total daily dose of 18 g Days 3 to 4: 18 g twice daily for a total daily dose of 36 g Days 5 to 14: 36 g twice daily for a total daily dose of 72 g During the intake period, patients will record their daily COVID-19–related symptoms, selected COVID-19 signs (as self-measured using the provided thermometer and pulse oximeter), responses to questions related to QOL measures, health care use measures, and concomitant medications taken in the previous 24 hours. Wellness visits by telephone will be conducted between days 1 and 14 to follow up on patient’s health status and to ascertain compliance with KB109 and completion of questions. On day 14, all patients will undergo a telemedicine visit where the following will be conducted: abbreviated physical examination, assessment of safety and other protocol-specified measures of health, and an evaluation of whether follow-up treatment is recommended owing to a progression of COVID-19 symptoms. If feasible, blood samples for clinical chemistries, biomarkers and serological measure of immunity, and nasal/oropharyngeal swabs for quantitative viral load assessments will be collected. Beginning on day 15, patients in both groups will enter the follow-up period (days 15–35) where COVID-19 signs, symptoms, and health care use indices will be collected. Wellness visits by telephone will be conducted on days 21, 28, and 35 to follow-up on the patient’s health status. On day 35, all patients will undergo a telemedicine visit where the same information as the day 14 telemedicine visit will be collected, including any blood samples. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary outcome for the K031 and K032 studies is to evaluate the safety of KB109 in addition to SSC compared with SSC alone in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 by assessing the number of patients experiencing KB109-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the study. K031 will also evaluate duration of symptoms among outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. This will be as an assessment made during the intake and/or follow-up periods of the following: • Time to resolution of the 13 overall and the 8 cardinal COVID-19–related symptoms from day 1 until the day at which the composite score of the 13 overall and 8 cardinal COVID-19–related symptoms becomes 0 or 1 and remains at 0 or 1 for the rest of the intake period and for the follow-up period • Proportion of patients with a reduction from baseline in each of the 13 overall COVID-19–related symptoms • Proportion of patients in whom symptoms (present at baseline) become absent for each of the 13 overall COVID-19–related symptoms • Change from baseline in the overall composite score of the 13 overall COVID-19–related symptoms and the 8 cardinal COVID-19–related symptoms • Time to resolution of fever (defined as from day 1 until the day at which a patient’s daily maximum temperature achieves and remains below 100.4°F without antipyretic medication) • Proportion of patients with oxygen saturation <95% and <98% on days 14 and 35 • Measures collected from the health care provider wellness visits • Proportion of patients experiencing hospital admissions (all cause and COVID-19–related) • Health care use K032 will evaluate the effect of KB109 in addition to SSC compared with SSC alone on the gut microbiota structure and function in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Before days 1, 14, and 35, microbiota structure (eg, magnitude of change in gut microbiome structure, composition of gut microbiome) will be analysed by methods such as nucleic acid sequencing and gut microbiome function will be analysed via levels of stool inflammatory biomarkers (eg, lipocalin) and gut microbiome metabolites (eg, SCFA). The health of outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 will be evaluated during the intake and follow- up periods by: measures of QOL; measures collected from the healthcare provider wellness visits; the proportion of patients experiencing hospital admissions; health care use, the proportions of patients with oxygen saturation <95% and <98%, and the proportion of patients with temperature below 100.4 °F without an anti-pyretic medication. Potential exploratory outcome measures may include: changes from baseline (day 1) in laboratory measures, specific biomarkers of infection, serology, inflammation (eg, D-dimer, lipocalin, cytokines, IgM/IgG sero-conversion, and neutralization assays), and viral load in outpatients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in the presence and absence of KB109. RANDOMISATION: All patients deemed eligible for the studies will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to KB109 in addition to SSC or SSC alone group using an interactive response technology system. Randomization will be stratified by study site/center, age groups (≥18–<45 years, ≥45–<65 years, ≥65 years), and comorbidity status (yes, no). BLINDING (MASKING): These studies are open-label; therefore, no blinding is necessary. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): K031 will enroll approximately 350 to 400 (175–200 patients per group) whereas K032 will enroll approximately 50 patients (25 per group).

METHODS: A YouTube search was performed on April 1, 2020 using the term “restless legs syndrome” in the Korean language. Two reviewers coded the source, content, and demographics of the included videos. Video quality was assessed using the modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) instrument. RESULTS: Among the 80 videos analyzed, 44 (55.0%) were reliable, and 36 (45.0%) were misleading. There was a trend toward a higher number of mean daily views in the misleading videos than in the reliable videos. Most of the misleading videos (72.2%) advocated complementary and alternative medicine as a primary treatment for RLS. Although the reliable videos had higher mDISCERN scores than the misleading videos, the overall quality of the reliable videos was low.

Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., sensory dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms) precede motor symptoms, appear at all stages, and impact the quality of life, but they frequently go unrecognized and remain untreated. Even when identified, traditional dopamine replacement therapies have little effect. We discuss here the pathology of two PD-associated non-motor symptoms: olfactory dysfunction and depression. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms in PD and predates the onset of motor symptoms. It is accompanied by early deposition of Lewy pathology and neurotransmitter alterations. Because of the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and an increased risk of progression to PD, olfactory testing can potentially be a specific diagnostic marker of PD in the prodromal stage. Depression is a prevalent PD-associated symptom and is often associated with reduced quality of life. Although the pathophysiology of depression in PD is unclear, studies suggest a causal relationship with abnormal neurotransmission and abnormal adult neurogenesis. Here, we summarize recent progress in the pathology of the non-motor symptoms of PD, aiming to provide better guidance for its effective management.","Bang, Yeojin; Lim, Juhee; Choi, Hyun Jin",Arch Pharm Res,310,1

Although Bangladesh is in the world’s thalassaemia belt, the information on this disease is scarce. Additionally, the awareness of this life threatening, but potentially preventable disease is surprisingly poor. However, mass awareness is pivotal for the development of an effective preventive strategy. In this context, the understanding of parental perspectives is essential to grasp the magnitude of the problem. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the parental knowledge gaps and perceptions regarding thalassemia, the barriers confronted by the parents for caring for their thalassaemic children and their attitude to prenatal screening and prenatal diagnosis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between January 2018 and December 2018 at a dedicated thalassemia hospital located in Dhaka. A structured questionnaire was used for face-to-face interviews with parents of thalassaemic children. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data. RESULTS: Of 365 respondents, nearly all respondents (97%) had not heard about the term, ‘thalassemia’ before the disease was diagnosed in their children; all (100%) were unscreened for carrier status prior to marriage. Mean knowledge scores were significantly higher in respondents with higher income and education. Most respondents (~ 91%) had a guilty feeling for not undergoing premarital screening. Only around 36% of them had heard about prenatal diagnosis. Approximately 25% participants would consider prenatal diagnosis in a future pregnancy, while 70% of them were unsure and only ~ 5% would decline prenatal diagnosis. Only 9.3% mothers had prenatal diagnosis in a previous pregnancy. Nearly 80% of the parents faced difficulty for obtaining blood donors regularly and a similar proportion (~ 81%) of them did not receive support from any organized blood clubs. More than 40% of the parents reported they felt socially stigmatized. CONCLUSION: This study suggests poor parental knowledge regarding thalassaemia including prenatal diagnosis and the challenges faced while caring for their children. These findings would be of paramount importance in planning and devising effective prevention and intervention strategies in Bangladesh as well as other countries with similar sociocultural setting.","Hossain, Mohammad Sorowar; Mahbub Hasan, Md.; Petrou, Mary; Telfer, Paul; Mosabbir, Abdullah Al",Orphanet J Rare Dis,310,5

AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of hypertension in a rural agrarian community in Edo North, Nigeria. SETTING: The study was carried out in Ayua, a community in Edo North, southern Nigeria. METHODS: This cross-sectional descriptive study involved the use of a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire to obtain relevant data. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and glucose were recorded. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. RESULTS: Two hundred and nineteen participants aged > 15 years completed the study with a mean age of 54.03 ± 16.61 years and females comprising 159 (72.6%) of the total. The prevalence of hypertension was 27.9% (in 61 participants). Twenty-one (9.8%) respondents gave a family history of hypertension. The mean BMI amongst respondents was 27.10 ± 6.61 kg/m(2). Obesity and pre-obesity were found in 58 (26.5%) and 71(32.4%) respondents, respectively. The determinants of hypertension were age and BMI. Compared with those who were less than 40 years old, those aged 40–65 years and > 65 years had 1.9 and 4.2 times increased odds of developing hypertension, respectively. Similarly, compared with the non-obese, obese participants had 2.3 times increased odd of having hypertension. CONCLUSION: Hypertension was highly prevalent in this rural community.

Complicating matters, discrepancies abound—particularly for interleukin 6 (IL-6)—possibly due to differences in sex, species/strain, and/or the brain regions studied. METHODS: As such, we clarified how cytokine expression changes with age by using a Bioplex and Western blot to measure multiple cytokines across several brain regions of both sexes, using 2 mouse strains bred in-house as well as rats obtained from NIA. Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were used as appropriate. RESULTS: In the ventral hippocampus of C57BL/6J mice, we found age-related increases in IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17, eotaxin, G-CSF, interfeuron δ, KC, MIP-1a, MIP-1b, rantes, and TNFα that are generally more pronounced in females, but no age-related change in IL-5, MCP-1, or GM-CSF. We also find aging is uniquely associated with the emergence of a module (a.k.a. network) of 11 strongly intercorrelated cytokines, as well as an age-related shift from glycosylated to unglycosylated isoforms of IL-10 and IL-1β in the ventral hippocampus. Interestingly, age-related increases in extra-hippocampal cytokine expression are more discreet, with the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and cerebellum of male and female C57BL/6J mice demonstrating robust age-related increase in IL-6 expression but not IL-1β. Importantly, we found this widespread age-related increase in IL-6 also occurs in BALB/cJ mice and Brown Norway rats, demonstrating conservation across species and rearing environments. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, age-related increases in cytokines are more pronounced in the hippocampus compared to other brain regions and can be more pronounced in females versus males depending on the brain region, genetic background, and cytokine examined.

It has been linked to the overconsumption of Advanced Glycation End-Products (AGEs), and/or macronutrients which lead to an increase in local and systemic pro-inflammatory biomarkers in humans and animal models. This review provides a summary of research into biomarkers of diet-induced CLGI in murine models, with a focus on AGEs and obesogenic diets, and presents the physiological effects described in the literature. Diet-induced CLGI is associated with metabolic endotoxemia, and/or gut microbiota remodeling in rodents. The mechanisms identified so far are centered on pro-inflammatory axes such as the interaction between AGEs and their main receptor AGEs (RAGE) or increased levels of lipopolysaccharide. The use of murine models has helped to elucidate the local and systemic expression of CLGI mediators. These models have enabled significant advances in identification of diet-induced CLGI biomarkers and resultant physiological effects. Some limitations on the translational (murine → humans) use of biomarkers may arise, but murine models have greatly facilitated the testing of specific dietary components. However, there remains a lack of information at the whole-organism level of organization, as well as a lack of consensus on the best biomarker for use in CLGI studies and recommendations as to future research conclude this review.","Nogueira Silva Lima, Matheus Thomaz; Howsam, Michael; Anton, Pauline M.; Delayre-Orthez, Carine; Tessier, Frédéric J.",Nutrients,310,1

Pregnant women who become infected with influenza have hospitalization rates comparable to non-pregnant women with high-risk medical conditions. Other than influenza, little is known about the consequences of viral-related ARI on the pregnant woman and the fetus. Our objective was to determine the respiratory viruses causing ARI and their clinical outcomes during pregnancy. METHODS: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled prospectively at a Houston clinic between October 1, 2015 and April 30, 2016 during their regular prenatal visits. Pregnant women were enrolled if they reported having symptoms of ARI or were healthy within the preceding two weeks. Nasal-pharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory viruses by real time-PCR. Clinical outcomes and complications of illness were obtained at enrollment and two weeks after the initial visit. RESULTS: A total of 155 pregnant women were enrolled. The average age at enrollment was 30.7 years among women with ARI and 29.7 among healthy controls. Average gestational age at enrollment was 26.0 weeks among women with ARI and 26.3 among healthy controls. Among the 91 healthy controls, 10 (11%) tested positive for a respiratory virus, with rhinovirus (n = 6) being the most common of the viruses detected. On the other hand, of the 81 cases of ARI, 51 (63%) tested positive for a virus. The most frequently detected viruses were rhinovirus (n = 22), coronavirus (n = 14), and respiratory syncytial virus (n = 8). Twelve patients reported fever during the course of their ARI. Seventeen ARI patients reported at least one symptom of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI). Of those patients with LRTI, two reported decreased fetal heart rate and one was hospitalized for her illness. CONCLUSION: Respiratory viruses were frequently detected in pregnant women with ARI. One-third of pregnant women with viral ARI had evidence of LRTI. Hospitalization and non-reassuring fetal heart tones were among the complications reported by pregnant women with LRTI. Viral ARI during pregnancy appears common and is associated with significant morbidity.

Boston Children’s Hospital cared for 2796 international patients in 2016 but lacked an infection risk screening process for these patients, placing patients and staff at risk. We developed the Assessing Infection Risks for Safe Healthcare of International Patients (AIRSHIP) protocol to identify risks to guide infection prevention and control (IPC) measures. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team of IPC, infectious diseases, and International Health Services (IHS) experts assessed current IHS intake procedures and stakeholder engagement. We then developed AIRSHIP, devising standardized processes and forms to (1) assess underimmunization, MDRO and tuberculosis history, recent exposures, and current symptoms and (2) triage cases for catch-up immunization, urgent healthcare evaluation, and/or IPC intervention (Figure 1). We piloted incorporation of AIRSHIP into existing intake procedures. We tracked process, outcome, and balancing measures to evaluate feasibility, effectiveness, and acceptability to families (Figure 2) and made iterative improvements through Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles. RESULTS: For our first 13 cases, we completed pre-arrival family and referring provider interviews in 5 cases and on-arrival family interviews in 8 cases (in no cases were both pre-arrival and on-arrival interviews feasible). We were able to assign a risk category in all cases, identifying 5 patients with infection risks (38%) and 4 who were undervaccinated (30%). In 7 of 8 cases (88%) in which on-arrival interviews were performed, the interview and referring provider records yielded complete and reliable data. The average duration of family interviews was 18 minutes. All 13 families reported being “very satisfied” with AIRSHIP. CONCLUSION: International patients often present with active infections and are commonly undervaccinated. A feasible and effective strategy for infection risk screening of international patients is review of records pre-arrival, together with on-arrival family interview to gather additional data and identify acute symptoms and exposures.

However, these antibodies, intended to protect the host, may sometimes prove beneficial to the virus, by facilitating viral entry and replication in the target cell. This phenomenon, known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection, is a result of interaction of virus–antibody immune complexes with Fcγ and/or complement receptors on certain types of host cells and promotes viral entry into the host cells. The internalized immune complexes then modulate host immune response so as to enhance viral replication and aggravate disease severity.

We developed and validated some modifications of the IFN-γ ELISPOT assay to optimize immunological monitoring of various cancer vaccine trials. Taking into consideration that the main mechanism of cell-mediated cytotoxicity is the release of cytolytic granules that contain, among others, cytolytic protein Granzyme B (GrB), we developed the GrB ELISPOT assay. Extensive studies demonstrated that the GrB ELISPOT assay is specific, accurately measures the rapid release of GrB, is more sensitive than the 51Cr-release assay, and that it may be successfully applied to measuring CTL precursory frequency in PBMC from cancer patients. Assuming that immunological assays that demonstrate recognition of native tumor cells (tumor-specific) may be more clinically relevant than assays that demonstrate recognition of tumor protein or peptide (antigen-specific), we developed and validated the Autologous Tumor IFN-γ ELISPOT assay using PBMC from idiotype vaccinated lymphoma patients as effectors and autologous B cell lymphoma tumor cells as targets. The precursor frequency of tumor-reactive T cells was significantly higher in the postvaccine PBMC, compared with prevaccine samples in all patients tested. Furthermore, the specificity of these T cells was established by the lack of reactivity against autologous normal B cells. These results demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating tumor-specific T cell responses when autologous, primary tumor cells are available as targets. Modifications of ELISPOT assay described in this chapter allow more comprehensive assessment of low frequency tumor-specific CTL and their specific effector functions and can provide valuable insight with regards to immune responses in cancer vaccine trials.","Malyguine, Anatoli",Analyzing T Cell Responses,310,1

Their excellent antigen presentation potential can contribute to the activation of other cells of the immune system, and evidence is emerging that specialized subsets of these cells, that may be increased with age, can influence the cell-mediated immune system in antitumor responses. They can also regulate immune responses, to avoid autoreactivity and excessive inflammation. Deficiencies in regulatory B cells may be beneficial in cancer but will only exacerbate the inflammatory environment that is a hallmark of aging. The B cell role as antibody producers is particularly important, since antibodies perform numerous different functions in different environments. Although studying tissue responses in humans is not as easy as in mice, we do know that certain classes of antibodies are more suited to protecting the mucosal tissues (IgA) or responding to T-independent bacterial polysaccharide antigens (IgG(2)) so we can make some inference with respect to tissue-specific immunity from a study of peripheral blood. We can also make inferences about changes in B cell development with age by looking at the repertoire of different B cell populations to see how age affects the selection events that would normally occur to avoid autoreactivity, or increase specificity, to antigen.","Dunn-Walters, Deborah K.; O’Hare, Joselli Silva",Handbook of Immunosenescence,310,1

In the communities of people committed to a common goal, the management of resources and services becomes very important. We chose the application domain of human disease research and control. A characteristic of the domain is that trusted databases exist but their schemas are often poorly or not documented. The network of biomedical databases forms a loose federation of autonomous, distributed, heterogeneous data repositories ripe for information integration. Grid services will provide a dynamic way to use resources in such a large distributed scientific environment while the use of ontology enables the system to carryout reasoning at 3 levels: a) available information in all Bio-Databases (Grid nodes) worldwide, b) reasoning about the retrievable information from each node, c) reasoning about the retrieved information and presenting it in a meaningful format for users. We adopted the ontology design methodology of DOGMA and developed Generic Human Disease Ontology (GenDO) that contains common general information regarding human diseases. The information is represented in 4 “dimensions”: (a) disease types, (b) causes (c) symptoms and (d) treatments. We illustrate how this GenDO helps to produce Specific Human Disease Ontologies (SpeDO) on request. We show how the combination of two different but complementary techniques, namely Grid computing and ontology, results in a dynamic and intelligent information system.

Clinically, atopy is expressed by asthma, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and atopic dermatitis. It has been recognized that the “atopic march” evolves from food allergy and atopic dermatitis in the first 2 years of life, followed by asthma and allergic rhinitis. Over the past 30 years, the prevalence of allergies and asthma has increased significantly in developed countries, and asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Evidence indicates that environmental factors acting early in life, including respiratory viral infections, exposure to pets and microbial products, day-care attendance, breast feeding, and exposure to allergens, tobacco smoke and other pollutants, are key events for establishment of sensitization and development of chronic, persistent symptoms of allergic diseases [1]. It is thought that gene—environment interactions play a crucial role in these processes. Therefore, attempts to successfully prevent development of allergic diseases should be a priority. At present, there are no genetic markers for atopy or asthma which could be used routinely in clinical practice and family history of atopy has been used to identify children genetically at-risk of developing allergic diseases.

New mechanisms of resistance continue to emerge and spread globally, threatening our ability to treat common infections. The overuse and misuse of antimicrobials both in the human and animal field, and their dispersion in the environment pose a risk for selection of mechanisms of resistance of germs.

This discovery, dating to 1873, laid the foundation for the discovery of chromosomes and, later, the fundamental biologic processes of mitosis and meiosis [1]. But, while cellular growth and proliferation were understood to be essential to the emergence of multicellular organisms, the corollary — that controlled cell death must be part of this calculus of cellular homeostasis — was not appreciated until quite recently. Although cell death was first described in 1859 by Virchow, it took more than a century to appreciate the importance of programmed cell death as a physiological process that eliminated unwanted cells [2]. The term ‘apoptosis’ was coined in 1972 by Kerr, Wyllie, and Currie to describe a distinct type of cell death characterized by the degradation of cellular constituents into membrane-bound apoptotic bodies [3].

Moreover, in recent decades immunotherapy has become the mainstream therapy, which highlights the tremendous potential of immune response mediators, including vaccines for prevention and treatment of various forms of cancer. However, despite the tremendous advances in microbiology and immunology, there are several vaccine preventable diseases which still lack effective vaccines. Classically, weakened forms (attenuated) of pathogenic microbes were used as vaccines. Although the attenuated microbes induce effective immune response, a significant risk of reversion to pathogenic forms remains. While in the twenty-first century, with the advent of genetic engineering, microbes can be tailored with desired properties. In this review, I have focused on the use of genetically modified bacteria for the delivery of vaccine antigens. More specifically, the live-attenuated bacteria, derived from pathogenic bacteria, possess many features that make them highly suitable vectors for the delivery of vaccine antigens. Bacteria can theoretically express any heterologous gene or can deliver mammalian expression vectors harboring vaccine antigens (DNA vaccines). These properties of live-attenuated microbes are being harnessed to make vaccines against several infectious and noninfectious diseases. In this regard, I have described the desired features of live-attenuated bacterial vectors and the mechanisms of immune responses manifested by live-attenuated bacterial vectors. Interestingly anaerobic bacteria are naturally attracted to tumors, which make them suitable vehicles to deliver tumor-associated antigens thus I have discussed important studies investigating the role of bacterial vectors in immunotherapy. Finally, I have provided important discussion on novel approaches for improvement and tailoring of live-attenuated bacterial vectors for the generation of desired immune responses.","Kumar, Sudeep",Pharmaceuticals from Microbes,310,1

This research adopted a qualitative case study approach with semi-structured interviews for collecting data. A total of 15 interviews were conducted with an online retail company’s staff and management who had responsibility for managing cybersecurity. A thematic analysis method was used to analyse the qualitative data. The research findings show that the company is facing internal and external threats to their information systems and their technical defences are not very effective at present.

Emphasis is initially placed upon the bone osteoclast, the skeletal muscle myotube and the placental syncytiotrophoblast. The widespread occurence of MNGCs in a range of pathological situations is discussed, with emphasis upon the broad involvement of the macrophage in inflammatory responses. Many viruses produce cell fusion in vivo and in vitro when cell cultures are infected. Several examples are given. A clear distinction is drawn between viral fusion from “without” and viral fusion from “within” the cell. The cytopathic effect (CPE) of the animal and human retroviruses is discussed in considerable detail. The in vivo and in vitro formation of lymphocytic and macrophage MNGCs by HIV-1 is given extensive coverage. The possible significance of the presence of brain MNGCs of macrophage/microglial origin as a cellular feature of AIDS dementia is discussed. A new hypothesis is advanced relating to the possible role of endogenous C-type retrovirus in the physiological fusion of the invasive placental cytotrophoblasts to create the syncytiotrophoblast. The evolutionary and developmental significance of such an event in relation to the evolution of the placental mammals is discussed. The possible importance of MNGC formation in the depletion of the CD4(+) population of T-lymphocytes in vivo in the clinical progression of the AIDS-related complex and AIDS is related to the potent fusogenic effect of HIV-1 when cell cultures are infected.","Harris, J.R.",Micron,310,1

Existing studies mainly focus on high detection accuracy, which often requires large volumes of data on contents, source credibility or propagation. In this paper we focus on early detection of rumours when data for information sources or propagation is scarce. We observe that tweets attract immediate comments from the public who often express uncertain and questioning attitudes towards rumour tweets. We therefore propose to learn user attitude distribution for Twitter posts from their comments, and then combine it with content analysis for early detection of rumours. Specifically we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) CNN and BERT neural network language models to learn attitude representation for user comments without human annotation via transfer learning based on external data sources for stance classification. We further propose CNN-BiLSTM- and BERT-based deep neural models to combine attitude representation and content representation for early rumour detection. Experiments on real-world rumour datasets show that our BERT-based model can achieve effective early rumour detection and significantly outperform start-of-the-art rumour detection models.","Tian, Lin; Zhang, Xiuzhen; Wang, Yan; Liu, Huan",Advances in Information Retrieval,310,1

It aims to enhance the performance of text-based image retrieval by boosting the rank of relevant images using visual information. Hypergraph has been widely used for relevance estimation, where textual results are taken as vertices and the re-ranking problem is formulated as a transductive learning on the hypergraph. The potential of the hypergraph learning is essentially determined by the hypergraph construction scheme. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel data representation technique named adaptive collaborative representation for hypergraph learning. Compared to the conventional collaborative representation, we consider the data locality to adaptively select relevant and close samples for a test sample and discard irrelevant and faraway ones. Moreover, at the feature level, we impose a weight matrix on the representation errors to adaptively highlight the important features and reduce the effect of redundant/noisy ones. Finally, we also add a nonnegativity constraint on the representation coefficients to enhance the hypergraph interpretability. These attractive properties allow constructing a more informative and quality hypergraph, thereby achieving better retrieval performance than other hypergraph models. Extensive experiments on the public MediaEval benchmarks demonstrate that our re-ranking method achieves consistently superior results, compared to state-of-the-art methods.","Bouhlel, Noura; Feki, Ghada; Amar, Chokri Ben",Advances in Information Retrieval,310,1

The particles measured 65–70 nm in diameter, and it was possible to detect individual capsomeres on many of these particles. The capsomeric pattern identified on the particles corresponded to an icosahedrally symmetric T = 19 capsid. Distinctive five-fold vertices, usually appearing as darker spots on the capsid, were an additional feature of these particles. The capsid structure, which is skew, could readily be distinguished from the T = 25 capsid of adenovirus and the holey capsids of rotavirus and reovirus.

This study aims to verify the indications of nCPAP used in the paediatric emergency department (PED) at the Ambroise Paré Hospital compared to those used in the PICU and to evaluate the efficiency of nCPAP to stabilize the respiratory function of infants with acute severe bronchiolitis before medicalized transport to the PICU. PROCEDURE: A retrospective French study was conducted on infants with severe bronchiolitis ventilated by nCPAP in the PED at the Ambroise Paré Hospital, from winter 2009 to winter 2011. RESULTS: Out of the 31 infants, 16% were formerly prematurely born with otherwise no significant medical history. Postnatal age was 2 months. The rate of nCPAP performed for apneas (single indication of nCPAP for severe bronchiolitis according to the 2006 French medical consensus) was 17%. At least two indications of nCPAP used in the PICU were found for every patient. Babies were transferred within 2 h of nCPAP to the PICU. Clinical improvement was already observed with significantly slower respiratory rate and normalization of capnia and pH (P < 0.001) and without any complication at the PED. NCPAP was pursued in the PICU in 84% of the cases. The average duration of nCPAP was of 2.7 days, with the duration of hospitalization in the PICU of 4.2 days. CONCLUSION: The nCPAP is a useful respiratory support technique which is easy to implement in the PED.","Lopes, A. -A.; Sznajder, M.; Chevallier, B.; Soussan, V.",,310,1

In this article, I review H5N1's phylogeographic properties, including mechanisms for its evolving virulence. The novel contribution here is the attempt to integrate these with the political economies of agribusiness and global finance. Particular effort is made to explain why H5N1 emerged in southern China in 1997. It appears the region's reservoir of near‐human‐specific recombinants was subjected to a phase change in opportunity structure brought about by China's newly liberalized economy. Influenza, 200 nm long, seems able to integrate selection pressures imposed by human production across continental distances, an integration any analysis of the virus should assimilate in turn.","Wallace, Robert G.",Antipode,310,1

Die orale Applikation des Impfstoffes erfolgte in säurefesten Kapseln; alle Sauen bildeten TGE‐Virusantikörper in Serum, Kolostrum und Milch. Die Auftrennung der Immunglobuline von Kolostrum und Milchproben ergab, daß nach Immunisierung ein hoher IgA‐Anteil in der Gammaglobulinfraktion stimuliert wird.

Die meisten Ferkel zaigten lediglich schwachen bis mittelgradigen Durchfall nach der Testinfektion. In den Würfen mit Todesfällen waren stärkere Erkrankungen die Regel. Nach oraler Kapselapplikation von Viruslyophilisat in Pulverform betrug die Schutzrate nur 50 % (7 von 14 Ferkeln).

SUMMARY: Attempts to develop an immunoprophylaxis against Transmissible Gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs III. Passive immune transfer after oral vaccination with the attenuated TGE virus strain Bl Using the TGE virus strain Bl that had been attenuated during 300 passages in porcine thyroid cell cultures 14 pregnant sows were orally and oronasally immunized twice — 5 and 2 weeks before parturition. The application of the vaccine was carried out in acid‐stable capsules. All sows developed antibodies against TGE virus in serum, colostrum and milk. The separation of immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk showed that high IgA levels are stimulated in the gammaglobulin fraction after immunization. After intake of colostrum and milk from sows, which were immunized orally and oronasally with fluid virus material in capsules, 90 % of the piglets (78 out of 87 animals) were protected against a challenge infection with 100–500 LD(50). Most of the piglets showed diarrhea after challenge. Only in litters with fatal cases was a profuse diarrhea observed regularly. After oral capsule application of viral lyophilisate in powder form the protection rate was only 50 % (7 out of 14 piglets). Only one of ten piglets from a sow immunized parenterally with a commercially available vaccine for comparative reasons survived the challenge. The results are discussed with respect to the use of strain Bl as live vaccine in the control of TGE.

Immunotransfert passif après vaccination de truies gestantes par voie orale avec la souche TGE atténuée Bl En utilisant la souche TGE Bl, qui avait été atténuée par 300 passages en cultures de cellules de la thyroide porcine, 14 truies gestantes étaient immunisées par voie orale et oronasale environ 5 et 2 semaines avant la date de naissance. Le vaccin était appliqué en capsules inattaquables par les acides; toutes les truies développaient des anticorps anti‐TGE dans le sérum, le colostrum et le lait. Après immunisation et séparation des immunoglobulines colostrales et lactiques une fraction importante de l'IgA était retrouvée dans les gammaglobulines. Protection contre une infection expérimentale avec 100–500 unités LD(50) de la souche TGE Miller a été obtenue en 90 % (78 de 87 animaux) des porcelets qui avaient reçu du colostrum et du lait provenant des truies immunisées par voie orale ou oronasale (suspension virale encapsulée). Après infection, la plupart des porcelets ne montrait qu'une diarrhée faible ou moyenne. Des signes cliniques plus sévères étaient observés dans les portées avec mortalité. Une protection de seulement 50 % (7 sur 14 porcelets) était constatée après application du virus lyophilisé en capsules par voie orale. Dans le but de comparaison une truie avait été immunisée avec un vaccine commercial par voie parentérale; seul un porcelet sur dix animaux infectés était protégé contre une infection expérimentale. Les résultats de ces expériences sont discutés par rapport à l'utilisation de la souche Bl comme vaccin vivant contre la TGE.

The word arbovirus is an abbreviation for arthropod-borne virus of vertebrates; it defines a concept not related to the chemical, physical, or morphological properties of the virion. Arboviruses are viruses that are maintained in nature principally, or to an important extent, through biological transmission between susceptible vertebrate hosts by hematophagous arthropods. In the strict sense, the definition of arbovirus requires that the cycle of biological propagation from arthropod to vertebrate and back to arthropod be observed under controlled conditions as it occurs in nature. Properties of a virus that are not directly related to the transmission cycle, though helpful at times for orientation, should not be entertained as defining criteria. Easy isolation and propagation by intracerebral inoculation into newborn or adult mice or the inactivation of the virus by lipid solvents are properties shared with other viruses not remotely suspected of being arthropod-borne such as herpes and rabies.","CASALS, JORDI",Comparative Virology,310,1

Current state-of-the-art models for brain tissue segmentation and disease classification require multiple modalities for training and inference. However, the acquisition of all of these modalities are expensive, time-consuming, inconvenient and the required modalities are often not available. As a result, these datasets contain large amounts of unpaired data, where examples in the dataset do not contain all modalities. On the other hand, there is smaller fraction of examples that contain all modalities (paired data) and furthermore each modality is high dimensional when compared to number of datapoints. In this work, we develop a method to address these issues with semi-supervised learning in translating between two neuroimaging modalities. Our proposed model, Semi-Supervised Adversarial CycleGAN (SSA-CGAN), uses an adversarial loss to learn from unpaired data points, cycle loss to enforce consistent reconstructions of the mappings and another adversarial loss to take advantage of paired data points.

With the recent advances in Future Internet design, multiple new network architectures, especially Information-Centric Networks (ICN) have emerged. Given the ubiquity of networks based on the Internet Protocol (IP), it is likely that we will have a number of different interconnecting network domains with different architectures, including ICNs. Their interoperability is important, but at the same time difficult to prove. A formal tool can be helpful for such analysis. ICNs have a number of unique characteristics, warranting formal analysis, establishing properties that go beyond, and are different from, what have been used in the state-of-the-art because ICN operates at the level of content names rather than node addresses. We need to focus on node-to-content reachability, rather than node-to-node reachability. In this paper, we present a formal approach to model and analyze information-centric interoperability (ICI). We use Alloy Analyzer’s model finding approach to verify properties expressed as invariants for information-centric services (both pull and push-based models) including content reachability and returnability. We extend our use of Alloy to model counting, to quantitatively analyze failure and mobility properties. We present a formally-verified ICI framework that allows for seamless interoperation among a multitude of network architectures.

Unlike most existing video object segmentation methods that can only handle a trimmed video in which all video frames contain the target objects, we address a more practical and difficult problem, i.e., joint multi-object detection and segmentation from an untrimmed video where the target objects do not always appear per frame. In particular, our method consists of two modules, i.e., object decision module and object segmentation module. The object decision module is used to detect the objects and decide which target objects need to be separated out from video. As there are usually two or more target objects and they do not always appear in the whole video, we introduce the data association into object decision module to identify their correspondences among frames. The object segmentation module aims to separate the target objects identified by object decision module. In order to extensively evaluate the proposed method, we introduce a new dataset named UNVOSeg dataset, in which [Formula: see text] of the video frames do not contain objects.

But even quick recoveries imply big full‐year losses: An initial 18% slump in consumption would still imply a full‐year loss of 9%, even if spending recovered to pre‐pandemic levels in four quarters. If recovery took eight quarters, the full‐year loss would be an enormous 14%.",,,310,1

It is based on the results of the research project “Changing gender relations through digital transformation” (Hans Böckler Foundation). Various effects have been observed: For example, mobile working and home office enable part-time workers to increase their contractual working hours; flexible digital work provides emotional and time relief in the event of spontaneous emergencies such as child illness; however, the extent of invisible and unpaid overtime is also increasing. In most cases, this does not lead to a reorganisation or redistribution of unpaid domestic and care work. Nevertheless, there are signs of shifts in the domestic division of labour. This article presents the central results of the project and discusses them with regard to their implications for gender inequality. Practical Relevance: The text provides information on current experiences with flexible working times and places from a gender perspective. It provides indications of conducive and obstructive conditions for reducing inequalities in the responsibility for care work and in domestic division of labour.

Little evidence is available to guide the weaning process and optimal timing of tracheostomy tube removal. The purpose of the study was to investigate the value of endoscopic assessment in the tracheostomy decannulation decision. RESULTS: The study included 154 tracheostomized adult patients. Bedside assessment was done for 112 patients, and the other 42 patients were deceased. The results of bedside assessment lead to successful decannulation in 18 patients (16%), while 94 patients (84%) were unfit for decannulation. The most common cause of unfitness was aspiration and poor swallowing in 41% of patients. The endoscopic assessment was done for 59 patients out of 94 patients that were unfit for decannulation; thirteen patients of them were fit for decannulation (22%). The final status of the patients before discharge was decannulated in 31 cases and 81 patients were discharged with a tracheostomy. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated the importance of endoscopic assessment in the decannulation decision of tracheostomized patients. A large proportion of patients who are unfit for decannulation by bedside assessment could be fit after endoscopic assessment. Endoscopic assessment is essential particularly in tracheostomized patients who have failed to achieve decannulation through conventional protocols.","Youssef, Gamal; Abdulla, Kamal M.",Egypt J Otolaryngol,310,1

The curves predicted by these methods typically follow a Gaussian distribution with a decay rate of infections similar to the climbing rate before the peak. However, as seen from the recent COVID-19 data from the US and European countries, the decay in the number of infections is much slower than their increase before the peak. Therefore, the estimates of the final epidemic size from these models are often underpredicted. In this work, we propose two data-driven models to improve the forecasts of the epidemic during its decay. These two models use Gaussian and piecewise-linear fits of the infection rate respectively during the deceleration phase, if available, to project the future course of the pandemic. For countries, which are not yet in the decline phase, these models use the peak predicted by epidemiological models but correct the infection rate to incorporate a realistic slow decline based on the trends from the recent data. Finally, a comparative study of predictions using both epidemiological and data-driven models is presented for a few most affected countries.","Ranjan, Rajesh",Trans Indian Natl,310,1

Tensor Cores are special processing units that perform [Formula: see text] matrix multiplications on FP16 inputs with FP32 precision, and return the result on FP32. The proposed method adopts the Ozaki scheme, an accurate matrix multiplication algorithm based on error-free transformation for matrix multiplication. The proposed method has three prominent advantages: first, it can be built upon the cublasGemmEx routine using Tensor Core operations; second, it can achieve higher accuracy than standard DGEMM, including the correctly-rounded result; third, it ensures bit-level reproducibility even for different numbers of cores and threads. The achievable performance of the method depends on the absolute-value range of each element of the input matrices. For example, when the matrices were initialized with random numbers over a dynamic range of 1E+9, our DGEMM-equivalent implementation achieved up to approximately 980 GFlops of FP64 operation on the Titan RTX GPU (with 130 TFlops on Tensor Cores), although cublasDgemm can achieve only 539 GFlops on FP64 floating-point units.

This leads to a novel problem – given full network structure and a subset of vertices that correspond to measured protein endpoints, infer connectivity between those vertices.

The key point of aspect sentiment classification is to capture valuable information from sentence. Existing methods have acknowledged the importance of the relationship between the target and the sentence. However, these approaches only focus on the local information of the target, such as the positional relationship and the semantic similarity between the words in a sentence and the target. Moreover, the global information of the interaction of words in sentence and their influence on the final prediction of sentiment polarity are ignored in related works. To tackle this issue, the present paper proposes Joint Modeling of Local and Global Attention (LGAJM), with the following two aspects: (1) the study develops a position-based attention network concentrating on the local information of semantic similarity and position information of the target. (2) In order to fetch global information, such as context information and interaction between words in sentences, the self-attention network is introduced. Besides, a BiGRU-based gating mechanism is proposed to weight the outputs of these two attention networks. The model is evaluated on two datasets: laptop and restaurant from SemEval 2014.

Political considerations that influence prevention activities, with examples from the pandemic and from more typical prevention initiatives in schools and communities, are presented. The definitions of prevention science and prevention interventions are delineated, and a brief summary of prevention history is given. The relationship between health disparities and COVID-19 is discussed. Two theoretical perspectives that may help to inform effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention measures, Health Belief Model and Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior, are summarized. The article emphasizes the importance of adapting prevention applications to the intended recipients, especially ethnic and cultural groups. The need to strengthen prevention training in graduate education and strategies to reform the education to meet accreditation and licensing standards are suggested.","Romano, John L.",,310,1

Validated growth-based AST according to EUCAST or CLSI (European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute) recommendations is currently suggested to guide the antimicrobial therapy. Any new AST should be validated against these standard methods. Many rapid diagnostic techniques can already provide pathogen identification. Some of them can additionally detect the presence of resistance genes or resistance proteins, but usually isolated pure cultures are needed for AST. We discuss the value of the technologies applying nucleic acid amplification, whole genome sequencing, and hybridization as well as immunodiagnostic and mass spectrometry-based methods and biosensor-based AST. Additionally, we evaluate the potential of integrated systems applying microfluidics to integrate cultivation, lysis, purification, and signal reading steps. We discuss technologies and commercial products with potential for Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) and their capability to analyze polymicrobial samples without pre-purification steps. The purpose of this critical review is to present the needs and drivers for AST development, to show the benefits and limitations of AST methods, to introduce promising new POCT-compatible technologies, and to discuss AST technologies that are likely to thrive in the future.","Vasala, Antti; Hytönen, Vesa P.; Laitinen, Olli H.",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,310,1

The studies provide unprecedented insights on a variety of applications, e.g., literature review and collaboration analysis. However, visual information (e.g., figures) that is widely employed for storytelling and methods description are often neglected. We present VIStory, an interactive storyboard for exploring visual information in scientific publications. We harvest a new dataset of a large corpora of figures, using an automatic figure extraction method. Each figure contains various attributes such as dominant color and width/height ratio, together with faceted metadata of the publication including venues, authors, and keywords. To depict these information, we develop an intuitive interface consisting of three components: (1) Faceted View enables efficient query by publication metadata, benefiting from a nested table structure, (2) Storyboard View arranges paper rings—a well-designed glyph for depicting figure attributes, in a themeriver layout to reveal temporal trends, and (3) Endgame View presents a highlighted figure together with the publication metadata. We illustrate the applicability of VIStory with case studies on two datasets, i.e., 10-year IEEE VIS publications, and publications by a research team at CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV conferences. Quantitative and qualitative results from a formal user study demonstrate the efficiency of VIStory in exploring visual information in scientific publications.

The common point of pandemics is their serious negative effects on the global economy. Considering the food supply chain, one of the most important sectors of the economy, it has seen that COVID-19 has an impact on the whole process from the field to the consumer. In the light of recent challenges in food supply chain, there is now considerable concern about the food production, processing, distribution, and demand. COVID-19 resulted the movement restrictions of workers, changes in demand of consumers, closure of food production facilities, restricted food trade policies and financial pressures in food supply chain. Therefore, governments should facilitate the movement of workers and agri-food products. In addition, small farmers or vulnerable peoples should be supported financially. Facilities should change the working conditions and maintain the health and safety of employees by altering safety measures. Food protectionist policies should be avoided to prevent an increase in food prices. In conclusion, each country must realize the severity of the situation and sometimes should tighten or loosen the measures according to spreadability of the pandemic. The supply chain also should be flexible enough to respond to the challenges in the food supply chain.

However, the extent of changes within the profession was unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on the employment, service delivery, stress, and hope of music therapy professionals in the United States. Music therapists (N = 1,196) responded to a 51-item survey including questions related to employment and service delivery. The study also included the Adult Hope Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). Results indicated that many music therapists experienced changes in their positions, including a decrease in client contact hours and an increase in using alternative services, such as telehealth. Changes in service hours and delivery were higher for individuals who worked in private practice than for other settings. Primary respondent concerns included being a carrier of COVID-19, being isolated from loved ones, and income loss. Compared with prior general population samples from the United States, respondents reported higher levels of hope, with a majority of respondents also reporting a high level of hope for the profession. Respondents also indicated a moderate level of perceived stress on the PSS-10. Open response comments provided additional insights into the situational stressors and feelings of hope at this time in the pandemic.

To analyse the supply shock, we classify industries as essential or non-essential and construct a Remote Labour Index, which measures the ability of different occupations to work from home. Demand shocks are based on a study of the likely effect of a severe influenza epidemic developed by the US Congressional Budget Office. Compared to the pre-COVID period, these shocks would threaten around 20 per cent of the US economy’s GDP, jeopardize 23 per cent of jobs, and reduce total wage income by 16 per cent. At the industry level, sectors such as transport are likely to be output-constrained by demand shocks, while sectors relating to manufacturing, mining, and services are more likely to be constrained by supply shocks. Entertainment, restaurants, and tourism face large supply and demand shocks. At the occupation level, we show that high-wage occupations are relatively immune from adverse supply- and demand-side shocks, while low-wage occupations are much more vulnerable. We should emphasize that our results are only first-order shocks—we expect them to be substantially amplified by feedback effects in the production network.","del Rio-Chanona, R Maria; Mealy, Penny; Pichler, Anton; Lafond, François; Farmer, J Doyne",,310,1

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, many conferences now are being postponed or canceled. Usually, they bring together a complex network of academic and nonacademic professionals to discuss and disseminate new knowledge. The practice of ‘conferencing’ also includes activities that go far beyond the exchange of information. Conferences constitute social spaces where researchers encounter other researchers, establish new contacts, maintain old contacts, hold exploratory talks, and initiate collaborations. Academic conferences therefore can yield a plenitude of scientific and societal impacts. In the past, much progress has been made in measuring the impact of financial investments in science. There is, however, no shared understanding of how to measure the impact of academic conferences. Against the background of the time and money that is spent on both visiting and organizing conferences, it is important to understand the ways in which conferences generate impact. The coronavirus pandemic also shows that it is important to implement digital technologies like tools for virtual conferencing. This article uses qualitative and quantitative data to examine the conference activities of young scholars from German universities and to study how they profit from attending conferences. It is shown that conferences play a significant role in the qualification process.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to close contacts in different settings. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Close contacts of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Guangzhou, China. PARTICIPANTS: 3410 close contacts of 391 index cases were traced between 13 January and 6 March 2020. Data on the setting of the exposure, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing, and clinical characteristics of index and secondary cases were collected. Measurement: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases were confirmed by guidelines issued by China. Secondary attack rates in different settings were calculated. RESULTS: Among 3410 close contacts, 127 (3.7% [95% CI, 3.1% to 4.4%]) were secondarily infected. Of these 127 persons, 8 (6.3% [CI, 2.1% to 10.5%]) were asymptomatic. Of the 119 symptomatic cases, 20 (16.8%) were defined as mild, 87 (73.1%) as moderate, and 12 (10.1%) as severe or critical. Compared with the household setting (10.3%), the secondary attack rate was lower for exposures in healthcare settings (1.0%; odds ratio [OR], 0.09 [CI, 0.04 to 0.20]) and on public transportation (0.1%; OR, 0.01 [CI, 0.00 to 0.08]). The secondary attack rate increased with the severity of index cases, from 0.3% (CI, 0.0 to 1.0%) for asymptomatic to 3.3% (CI, 1.8% to 4.8%) for mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% to 6.8%) for moderate, and 6.2% (CI, 3.2% to 9.1%) for severe or critical cases. Index cases with expectoration were associated with higher risk for secondary infection (13.6% vs. 3.0% for index cases without expectoration; OR, 4.81 [CI, 3.35 to 6.93]). LIMITATION: There was potential recall bias regarding symptom onset among patients with COVID-19, and the symptoms and severity of index cases were not assessed at the time of exposure to contacts. CONCLUSION: Household contact was the main setting for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among close contacts increased with the severity of index cases.

Digital platforms are known to foster convergence and generativity. For the consulting industry, digital platforms offer the potential to win new customer groups who have not previously purchased consulting services before. If digital platforms for the mediation of consulting services are established by incumbent consulting companies, the new platform-based business models for the consulting market will appear. Since network effects fuel platforms, the launch phase of a platform is a serious challenge. In this paper, we examine the launch of a digital platform for the algorithmic consulting (AC) approach, due to its promising market potential. In order to research the adaptability of digital platforms for AC consulting, we perform a qualitative study of electronic documents on the actions of three successful crowdsourcing platforms. The preliminary results comprise 14 success factors for the platform launch that will be validated in a follow-up practical application. The open nature of platform design in the areas of customer access, cooperation with other platforms, interfaces, and communication appeared to be particularly important for a successful platform launch. All identified success factors can be applied to AC services and the consulting market in the future.","Kaselow, Andreas; Petrik, Dimitri; Feja, Sven",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,310,28

Traditional knowledge systems defy the application of standard measures of innovation such as patents and patent citations. However, the continuity in content of these knowledge systems, which are studied using modern publication standards prescribed by academic journals, indicate a kind of adaptive innovation that we track using an author-affiliation based measure of homophily. Our investigation of this measure and its relationship with currently accepted standards of journal quality clearly shows how systems of knowledge can continue in an unbroken tradition without becoming extinct.

Irradiated alveolar epithelial cells promote radiation-related pneumonitis and fibrosis. However, the role of lung stem cells (LSCs) in the development of radiation-induced lung injury is still unclear. In this study, we found that both LSCs and LSC-derived type II alveolar epithelial cells (AECII) can repair radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks, but the irradiated LSCs underwent growth arrest and cell differentiation faster than the irradiated AECII cells. Moreover, radiation drove LSCs to fibrosis as shown with the elevated levels of markers for epithelial-mesenchymal transition and myofibroblast (α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA)) differentiation in in vitro and ex vivo studies. Increased gene expressions of connective tissue growth factor and α-SMA were found in both irradiated LSCs and alveolar cells, suggesting that radiation could induce the fibrogenic differentiation of LSCs. Irradiated LSCs showed an increase in the expression of surfactant protein C (SP-C), the AECII cell marker, and α-SMA, and irradiated AECII cells expressed SP-C and α-SMA. These results indicated that radiation induced LSCs to differentiate into myofibroblasts and AECII cells; then, AECII cells differentiated further into either myofibroblasts or type I alveolar epithelial cells (AECI). In conclusion, our results revealed that LSCs are sensitive to radiation-induced cell damage and may be involved in radiation-induced lung fibrosis.","Wang, Lu-Kai; Wu, Tsai-Jung; Hong, Ji-Hong; Chen, Fang-Hsin; Yu, John; Wang, Chun-Chieh",Stem Cells Int,310,1

As an applied social science, group dynamics is not only aiming for a better organization of interactions and work processes. Since its beginnings it rather pursues an eminently political claim. Its emancipatory endeavor is about enabling participation and co-creation of social contexts, be it in groups, organizations or the social life in general. Considering current trends of organizational training and consulting, predominantly focusing on the enhancement of performance and self-optimization, this line of tradition seems to be clearly out of sight. The uneasiness that emerges, asks for more in-depth discussions. The article builds on these roots and reconstructs the inherent political dimension of group dynamics.

While some could already achieve successes or consolidate themselves in 2019, most were hoping to continue pressuring governments and building momentum in 2020. The global pandemic squandered these hopes rapidly: collective decision making, still in the domain of governments, became a crucial factor in fighting the crisis, and protest movements as independent actors did not have a direct response. Simultaneously, public space as an arena for conflict articulation became inaccessible due to anti-pandemic efforts. Protestors were thus driven out of the center of public spaces and into the periphery, where they employed decentralized techniques in order to maintain their mobilization and to compete with state institutions in offering policy choices regarding anti-pandemic efforts. While limiting repertoires of protest movements, new conflict arenas allow them to sustain mobilization for future protest movements and continue challenging state actors.

METHOD: A systematic study was performed on the effects of Kilo-V and Mega-V X-rays on the cell morphology, viability, membrane permeability, DNA damage, and gene transfection of 293 T and CHO cells. RESULTS: The Kilo-V X-rays of very low doses from 0.01 to 0.04 Gray in principle didn’t induce any significant change in cell morphology, growth, membrane permeability, and cause DNA damage. The Mega-V X-ray had a damage threshold between 1.0 and 1.5 Gray. The 0.25 Gray Mega-V-X-ray could promote cell growth and gene transfer, while the 1.5 Gray Mega-V X-ray damaged cells. CONCLUSION: The very low dose of KV X-rays is safe to cells, while the effects of Mega-V-X-rays are dose-dependent. Mega-V-X-rays with a dose higher than the damage threshold would be harmful, that between 1.0 -1.5 Gray can evoke dual effects, whereas 0.25 Gray MV X-ray is beneficial for both cell growth and gene transfer, thus would be suitable for radiation-enhanced gene transfection.","Wang, Zhuo; Lv, Ming-Yue; Huang, Yao-Xiong",Dose Response,310,24

The shortage of commercial VTM for the transport of specimens for PCR testing has created a situation in which laboratories would need to manufacture their own in-house VTM as commonly used commercial VTM is unavailable. However, there is sparse literature on the emergency manufacture of VTM. Here, we describe the VAMC experience in manufacturing/quality control on its own VTM. RESULTS: VTM was manufactured by pathology and laboratory medicine using strict aseptic technique with Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) 500 ml bottle with phenol red, sterile heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) gentamicin sulfate (50 mg/mL) and amphotericin B (250 ug/ml). First, 50 ml of amphotericin B and 50 ml of gentamicin sulfate were mixed. Then 10 ml of FBS was mixed with the HBSS bottle and then 2 ml of the gentamicin/amphotericin B mixture was also mixed into the HBSS bottle. 3 ml aliquots were made from this mixture to constitute individual tubes of VTM for clinical use. Sterility for each batch (after 24-hour incubation at 37o C in the CO2 incubator) was assessed visually and by culture on a blood agar, chocolate agar, and thioglycolate mediums. An efficacy check was performed for each batch by spiking positive and negative controls into the VTM aliquots; RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 was executed to verify the medium did not degrade viral RNA and produced expected results for room temperature, refrigerated, and frozen samples. Previously manufactured VTM without phenol red also underwent sterility and efficacy checks. RESULTS: VTM was successfully manufactured in-house, allowing testing to continue despite the shortage. Sterility and efficacy checks on all lots and bottles from which the VTM aliquots were made passed with no growth detected and efficacy passing with all expected positives and negatives resulting as expected. CONCLUSION: To the author’s knowledge, this represents the first published abstract on VTM manufacture in this most unprecedented crisis involving COVID-19. In this national emergency with corresponding shortage of testing supplies including commercial VTM, the in-house manufacture of VTM is both feasible and prudent to ensure continuity of testing and quality patient/laboratory care.","Petersen, J M; Dalal, S; Jhala, D",Am J Clin Pathol,310,16

Because of its ability to evade immune surveillance through rapid antigenic drift and antigenic shift, broad-spectrum vaccines seem increasingly important. METHODS: A mAb named 3C12 from an immortalized hybrid cell was generated via immunizing mice with HA2 protein from A/chicken/Anhui/BRI99/2016 (AH/BRI99/16, H9N2) generated by prokaryotic expression. Then, its broad-spectrum activity was analyzed by WB and IFA. Next, the minimal linear epitope was identified via analyzing the reaction of a series of HA truncations with 3C12. Finally, the protective effects of 3C12 were evaluated in vitro and in vivo infection experiments. RESULTS: The mAb could react with the viruses of subtypes H1, H2, H5, H8, H9, H12, H13, H16, and HA protein of H18 in group 1, but failed to react with viruses in group 2. The minimal linear epitope targeted by the mAb was (433)NAELLVL(439) in full length of HA and localized in the C-helix region of HA2 (residue 95-101, HA2 numbering). What’s more, the mAb 3C12 inhibited H1, H2, H5, H8, H9, H12, H13 and H16 virus-replication in vitro and also has shown effectiveness in preventing and treating disease in mice challenged with lethal dose of AH/BRI99/16 (H9N2) virus in vivo. These results suggested that the broadly reactive anti-HA stem mAb 3C12 exhibited prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we have demonstrated that the linear epitope identified in this study could be a novel target for developing broad-spectrum influenza diagnostics or vaccine design, and the HA2-based monoclonal antibody is indeed a promising strategy for broad-spectrum protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses.","Huang, Jingjin; Huang, Nan; Fan, Menglu; Zhao, Lingcai; Luo, Yan; Ding, Pingyun; Tian, Miao; Liu, Qingzheng; Guo, Yanna; Zhao, Jinhua; Zheng, Yiqing; Zhang, Haitao; Ping, Jihui",Virol J,310,15

This study aimed to identify the impact of the perceived fears of COVID-19 virus infection on the quality of life and the emergence of burnout syndrome among physicians in Egypt during the COVID-19 outbreak. This cross-sectional study was conducted between May 10th and June 9th, 2020, and included 320 Egyptian physicians who were working during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The participants were interviewed using the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Maslach Burnout Inventory, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) for assessment of the perceived fears of COVID-19 virus infection, associated anxiety and depressive symptoms, burnout symptoms, and quality of life, respectively. RESULTS: Overall, most physicians were females (63%). Ideas about death, moderate-to-severe anxiety, and depressive symptoms were reported by 11, 28, and 29% of physicians, respectively. For burnout symptoms, high emotional exhaustion, high depersonalization, and low personal accomplishment were reported by 20, 71, and 39% of physicians, respectively. The perceived fear of COVID-19 virus infection was positively correlated with anxiety, depression, and burnout emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization symptoms, and negatively correlated with personal accomplishment and all quality of life domains. CONCLUSIONS: Egyptian physicians experienced higher levels of COVID-19-related fears, anxiety, and depressive and burnout symptoms. There was a robust correlation between these perceived fears, and higher burnout symptoms, and poor quality of life among physicians. Specific interventions should be tailored to minimize the physical and mental burdens on the physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Abdelghani, Mohamed; El-Gohary, Hayam M.; Fouad, Eman; Hassan, Mervat S.",Middle East Curr Psychiatry,310,16

The core tenet of this research is that relationships are crucial to the development of a sense of belonging. However, within the Higher Education (HE) sector, our processes, and therefore how we interact with students, are becoming more and more automated. None more so than during the Covid-19 pandemic and the ‘new normal’ in HE. This paper considers how we, as a profession, might support each student’s developing sense of belonging within a sector that is shifting towards increased digitalisation. This is achieved through considering the political agenda that drives the creation of digital education and some of the assumptions that underpin the movement towards it. As a result, a theoretical platform is created to consider the areas where digitisation impacts on teaching staff, and on students, and how this relates to each student’s sense of belonging within HE. The inclusion of two case studies has provided the opportunity to answer two key questions: (1) What is important to students developing a personal sense of belonging in HE during their first few weeks in a university? (2) How can the differentiated human touch be provided by ‘third space’ professionals both in person and virtually?","Cureton, Debra; Jones, Jenni; Hughes, Julie",Postdigit Sci Educ,310,1

We previously observed that liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) using chloroformmethanol-water at a ratio (1:1:1) was superior at detecting antibacterial activities and significant quantities of antibacterial compounds. Herein, we demonstrate that antibacterial secondary metabolites are produced from G. boninense mycelia. Antibacterial compounds were monitored in concurrent biochemical and biophysical experiments. The combined methods included high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), fourier transform infrared (FTIR), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The antibacterial compounds derived from mycelia with chloroform-methanol extraction through LLE were isolated via a gradient solvent elution system using HPTLC. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds was observed to be the most potent against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and multidrug-resistant S. aureus NCTC 11939. GC-MS, HPLC, and FTIR analysis confirmed two antibacterial compounds, which were identified as 4,4,14α-trimethylcholestane (m/z = 414.75; lanostane, C(30)H(54)) and ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3β-ol (m/z = 396.65; ergosterol, C(28)H(44)O). With the aid of spectroscopic evaluations, ganoboninketal (m/z = 498.66, C(30)H(42)O(6)), which belongs to the 3,4-seco-27-norlanostane triterpene family, was additionally characterized by 2D-NMR analysis. Despite the lack of antibacterial potential exhibited by lanostane; both ergosterol and ganoboninketal displayed significant antibacterial activities against bacterial pathogens. Results provide evidence for the existence of bioactive compounds in the mycelia of the relatively unexplored phytopathogenic G. boninense, together with a robust method for estimating the corresponding potent antibacterial secondary metabolites.

The virus has a large coding capacity to deploy an arsenal of molecules antagonizing the host functions. In the present work, we have studied the only known E2 viral-conjugating enzyme, UBCv1 that is encoded by the I215L gene of ASFV. UBCv1 was expressed as an early expression protein that accumulates throughout the course of infection. This versatile protein, bound several types of polyubiquitin chains and its catalytic domain was required for enzymatic activity. High throughput mass spectrometry analysis in combination with a screening of an alveolar macrophage library was used to identify and characterize novel UBCv1-host interactors. The analysis revealed interaction with the 40S ribosomal protein RPS23, the cap-dependent translation machinery initiation factor eIF4E, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin 4B. Our data show that during ASFV infection, UBCv1 was able to bind to eIF4E, independent from the cap-dependent complex. Our results provide novel insights into the function of the viral UBCv1 in hijacking cellular components that impact the mTORC signaling pathway, the regulation of the host translation machinery, and the cellular protein expression during the ASFV lifecycle.","Barrado-Gil, Lucía; Del Puerto, Ana; Muñoz-Moreno, Raquel; Galindo, Inmaculada; Cuesta-Geijo, Miguel Ángel; Urquiza, Jesús; Nistal-Villán, Estanislao; Maluquer de Motes, Carlos; Alonso, Covadonga",Front Microbiol,310,11

There are currently no licensed DNA and mRNA vaccines; therefore, if any of the COVID-19 candidates are successful, this might be the push nanotechnology needs for vaccine development. DNA, mRNA, and recombinant protein delivered into the targeted host cells to build immunity against the coronavirus would not have been feasible without nanoparticles as a delivery vehicle. Nanoparticles provide the solutions to address the unmet delivery challenges associated with the use of naked DNA plasmids or mRNA for vaccine development. Such solutions provide the ability to deliver DNA plasmids or mRNA vaccine in areas previously unreachable. In addition, nanotechnology-based vaccines are easy to design, synthesize, or scale up in larger volume compared to the traditional vaccine approaches (e.g., inactivated and live-attenuated strains). Nanotechnology thus has great potential to be a vital tool for tackling the COVID-19 outbreak and may be a crucial technology to prevent future infectious disease outbreaks.","Mufamadi, Maluta Steven",MRS Bull,310,1

It is a mixture of ~ 200 compounds but its characteristic flavour and fragrance primarily come from vanillin. While the importance of its wide usage in flavour and fragrance is well established, there have been limited investigations to evaluate its bioactive potential. However, a few studies have reported a promising array of bioactivities that could be exploited for multiple therapeutic applications. Recently, bioactive properties of vanillin, such as neuroprotection, anticarcinogenic, and antioxidant are gaining attention. Besides this, vanillin and its synthetic analogues are found to regulate gene expression and exhibit biological activities. Therefore, here we summarize the potential bioactivates of vanillin and its derivative with an aim to change the perspective from being a popular flavour to a new age therapeutics molecule.

This study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns and effective reproduction number of this explosive epidemic. Weekly notified dengue cases were extracted from the National Early Warning, Alert, Response and Surveillance (NEWARS) database to describe the spatial and temporal patterns of the epidemic. The time-varying, temperature-adjusted cohort effective reproduction number was estimated over the course of the epidemic. The dengue epidemic occurred between 29 April and 8 December 2019 over 32 weeks, and included 5935 cases. During the epidemic, dengue expanded from six to 44 subdistricts. The effective reproduction number was <3 for most of the epidemic period, except for a ≈1 month period of explosive growth, coinciding with the monsoon season and school vacations, when the effective reproduction number peaked >30 and after which the effective reproduction number declined steadily. Interventions were only initiated 6 weeks after the end of the period of explosive growth. This finding highlights the need to reinforce the national preparedness plan for outbreak response, and to enable the early detection of cases and timely response.","Tsheten, Tsheten; Mclure, Angus; Clements, Archie C.

Results from initial clinical studies of personalized neoantigen-based vaccines, enabled by the availability of rapid and cost-effective sequencing and bioinformatics technologies, have demonstrated robust tumour-specific immunogenicity and preliminary evidence of antitumour activity in patients with melanoma and other cancers. Herein, we provide an overview of the complex process that is necessary to generate a personalized neoantigen vaccine, review the types of vaccine-induced T cells that are found within tumours and outline strategies to enhance the T cell responses.

This paper analyses the use of one such site, Chegg, which offers “homework help” and other academic services to students. Chegg is often presented as a file sharing site in the academic literature, but that is just one of many ways in which it can be used. As this paper demonstrates, Chegg can and is used for contract cheating This is despite the apparent existence of an Honour Code on Chegg which asks students not to breach academic integrity. With pandemic led safety considerations leading to increased online teaching and assessment, the paper analyses data relating to how Chegg is used by students in five STEM subjects, namely Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Physics and Chemistry. The results show that students are using Chegg to request exam style questions. They demonstrate that contract cheating requests can be put live and answered within the short duration of an examination. The number of student requests posted for these five subjects increased by 196.25% comparing the time period April 2019 to August 2019 with the period April 2020 to August 2020. This increase corresponds with the time when many courses moved to be delivered and assessed online. The growing number of requests indicates that students are using Chegg for assessment and exam help frequently and in a way that is not considered permissible by universities. The paper concludes by recommending that academic institutions put interventions in place to minimise the risk to educational standards posed by sites such as Chegg, particularly since increased online teaching and assessment may continue after the pandemic.","Lancaster, Thomas; Cotarlan, Codrin",Int J Educ Integr,310,1

One likely reason is the political elites to whom partisans listen. As a means of shoring up support, President Trump largely downplayed but at times hyped the severity of the virus. Do these messages influence the perceived seriousness of the virus’s death toll, how the president is evaluated as well as support for and compliance with social distancing guidelines? Results suggest that Republican identifiers had by early June crystallized their views on the virus’s seriousness, the president’s performance, and social distancing policies and behaviors. Unexpectedly, information critical of President Trump’s policy decisions produced a backlash causing people to show less concern about the virus’s death toll and rate the president’s performance even more highly.","Moniz, Philip",,310,1

The Healthy Brain Initiative’s State and Local Public Health Partnerships to Address Dementia: The 2018‐2023 Road Map calls for addressing the special needs of people with dementia and caregivers in emergency preparedness/response. METHOD: During the coronavirus (COVID‐19) pandemic, public health professionals play a critical role in protecting people living with dementia, their caregivers and families. The Alzheimer's Association and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) educated public health professionals and partners about the unique challenges associated with dementia during the pandemic and steps to tailor the emergency response. Homes in the community, acute care and long‐term care are three settings that require unique public health responses. RESULT: Challenges encountered vary by setting. In homes and the community, people living with dementia and their caregivers have been affected by the suspension of adult day services, social events, congregate meals, respite care, peer support groups, community education, physical activity classes and more, including virtual delivery of non‐urgent primary care, case management and behavioral health. Many emergency departments and hospitals adopted no‐visitor policies to reduce transmission of COVID‐19; however, caregivers for people living with dementia provide essential medical and emotional support that aids diagnosis and treatment. Long‐term care (LTC) facilities are especially prone to COVID‐19 outbreaks due to the concentration of vulnerable older adults, many with some form of cognitive impairment. Provision of person‐centered dementia care is hampered by no‐visitor policies without caregiver allowances and limited training of professionals working in LTC facilities during the crisis. CONCLUSION: Taking immediate public health actions will not only help minimize the negative impacts of COVID‐19 on people living with dementia and their caregivers, but also support effective, efficient delivery of person‐centered care. Through this session, public health professionals will quickly learn about challenges posed by dementia in these settings, immediate steps to better protect health and safety for this population, and resources their departments can use.

As is one of the primary sources for diesel distillates, light cycle oil (LCO), having the advantages of inheriting similar density and boiling point range to diesel fuels, but high contents of aromatics, sulfur, and nitrogen, needs to be upgraded before being utilized. This work reports a trinary porous SiO(2)–Al(2)O(3)–TiO(2) (SAT) synthesized by sol–gel method and used as the NiMo catalyst support for the LCO hydro-upgrading. NiMo/Al(2)O(3)-zeolite (AZ) was used as a reference to evaluate the performances of the NiMo/SAT. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, Pyridine-FTIR, and TEM; and evaluated in a 20-mL fixed-bed microreactor using a Fluid Catalytic Cracking LCO as feedstock. It was found that the SAT support possessed a high surface area, high pore volume, and good acid properties. The NiMo/SAT catalyst exhibited even better hydrodesulfurization, hydrodenitrogenation, and hydrodearomatization performances than NiMo/AZ when the reaction was performed at 375 °C and 1100 psi. Compared with the zeolite addition catalyst, the SAT catalyst has the advantages of simple synthesis procedures and low input cost.","Hu, Wanpeng; Zhang, Haiping; Wang, Min; Pu, Jianglong; Rogers, Kyle; Wang, Hui; Ng, Siauw; Xu, Ruoqian",J Porous Mater,310,1

Here we used within-subject peripheral blood gene expression over time to correlate with the within-subject lung metabolic activity, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) to identify biological processes and pathways underlying overall resolution of lung inflammation. We used next-generation RNA sequencing and [(18)F]FDG PET-CT data, collected at diagnosis, week 4, and week 24, from 75 successfully cured PTB patients, with the [(18)F]FDG activity as a surrogate for lung inflammation. Our linear mixed-effects models required that for each individual the slope of the line of [(18)F]FDG data in the outcome and the slope of the peripheral blood transcript expression data correlate, i.e., the slopes of the outcome and explanatory variables had to be similar. Of 10,295 genes that changed as a function of time, we identified 639 genes whose expression profiles correlated with decreasing [(18)F]FDG uptake levels in the lungs. Gene enrichment over-representation analysis revealed that numerous biological processes were significantly enriched in the 639 genes, including several well known in TB transcriptomics such as platelet degranulation and response to interferon gamma, thus validating our novel approach. Others not previously associated with TB pathobiology included smooth muscle contraction, a set of pathways related to mitochondrial function and cell death, as well as a set of pathways connecting transcription, translation and vesicle formation. We observed up-regulation in genes associated with B cells, and down-regulation in genes associated with platelet activation. We found 254 transcription factor binding sites to be enriched among the 639 gene promoters. In conclusion, we demonstrated that of the 10,295 gene expression changes in peripheral blood, only a subset of 639 genes correlated with inflammation in the lungs, and the enriched pathways provide a description of the biology of resolution of lung inflammation as detectable in peripheral blood. Surprisingly, resolution of PTB inflammation is positively correlated with smooth muscle contraction and, extending our previous observation on mitochondrial genes, shows the presence of mitochondrial stress. We focused on pathway analysis which can enable therapeutic target discovery and potential modulation of the host response to TB.","Odia, Trust; Malherbe, Stephanus T.; Meier, Stuart; Maasdorp, Elizna; Kleynhans, Léanie; du Plessis, Nelita; Loxton, Andre G.; Zak, Daniel E.; Thompson, Ethan; Duffy, Fergal J.; Kuivaniemi, Helena; Ronacher, Katharina; Winter, Jill; Walzl, Gerhard; Tromp, Gerard",Front Immunol,310,30

As known, COVID-19 is the most dangerous disease worldwide; nowhere, an effective drug has been found yet. To limit its spread, it is essential to find a rational method that shows the spread of this virus by relying on many infected people’s data. A model consisting of three artificial neural networks’ (ANN) functions was developed to predict COVID-19 separation in Iraq based on real infection data supplied by the public health department at the Iraqi Ministry of Health. The performance efficiency of this model was evaluated, where its performance efficiency reached 81.6% when employed four statistical error criteria as mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R(2)), and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NC). The severity of the virus’s spread across Iraq was assessed in a short term (in the next 6 months), where the results show that the spread severity will intensify in this short term by 17.1%, and the average death cases will increase by 8.3%.

Ultrasound elastography has become a research hotspot because it can accurately measure soft tissue lesions. Displacement estimation is the most important step in ultrasound elastography. At present, the phase zero search method is an accurate and fast displacement estimation method. However, when the displacement exceeds 1/4 wavelength, it is invalid. The accuracy of block matching method is not high, but it is suitable for large displacement, so it can overcome this shortcoming. It is worth noting that the quality-guided block matching method has good robustness under complex mutation conditions. It can provide prior knowledge to increase the robustness of the phase-zero search under large displacement conditions. So we propose a novel displacement estimation method for real time tissue ultrasound elastography, which combines the quality-guided block matching method and the phase-zero search method. The experimental results show that this method is more accurate, faster and robust than other displacement estimation methods.","Li, Hong-an; Zhang, Min; Yu, Keping; Qi, Xin; Tong, Jianfeng",Mobile Netw Appl,310,1

High resolution LiDAR data and advanced digital surface modeling techniques have been used for determining the available suitable rooftop area and estimating the technical solar PV potential of the C&I rooftops. For the C&I study area of Aversa Nord (South Italy), we find that the suitable rooftops have annually a total electric power potential of 50.75 [Formula: see text] . For this area, an annual average PM(2.5) concentrations of about 13 μg/m(3) results in a nearly 5% annual solar insolation reduction.

Patents have been subject to critical views, especially in the era of software where the innovation might be based on non-technological improvements, sometimes arising from new business models, social behavior or trends. For patents to support innovation in its beneficial contribution to society and avoid abuse, a high-quality patent system should be ensured. Many people believe that this requires in the first place to exclude from patent protection those inventions that are purely non-technical. In this paper, the authors analyze the legal situation at the European Patent Office (EPO), considered as setting amongst the worldwide strictest standards in terms of software patentability, and wherein patents are granted only to technology advances. Within this context, the case of software simulators is discussed, since this is directly linked to intangible software inventions and since it is the subject of a case on a point of law pending before the EPO highest instance, such that its outcome may impact patentability of modern software technologies. In conclusion, the authors argue in favor of maintaining the present EPO practice on simulators, as this is seen as a fair balance in Europe between patent protection for intangible inventions based on technology while excluding from patent protection those inventions that are non-technical arrangements.","Baccelli, Michele; Kobayashi, Kazuto; Sereboff, Steven C.; Hiratsuka, Mitsuyoshi",Human-Centric Computing in a Data-Driven Society,310,1

Its vital importance has been sharply underscored following the outbreak of COVID-19, in response to which we have seen the institution of extreme legal measures—such as the UK’s Coronavirus Act 2020—in efforts to control and contain the spread of the disease. The pandemic has also starkly exposed the complex nature of the regulatory challenges, nationally, internationally, and globally, to which such public health problems give rise. In approaching these, and other questions concerning the public’s health, such as non-communicable disease, public health law, as a field, brings notable distinctive features: these include a practical focus on populations, institutions, the prevention of ill health, protection of good health, and the promotion of positive states of well-being; and concomitant critical approaches rooted in theories of social justice as contrasted with more narrow biomedical ethics. Such features make it in some senses atypical territory within the field of health law. Furthermore, the inherent role of political institutions places law conceptually within public health in a way that may be seen as distinguishable from law’s relationship with clinical medicine. This chapter explains how the broad reach and distinct features of public health require a commensurately broad approach to conceptualising public health law, and how distinct practical and theoretical features may be integrated into academic public health law. It also shows how public health law, with its distinct conceptualisations concerning ‘the body’ of medical jurisprudence, can both challenge and enrich medico-legal studies, and bring important perspectives within the broader field of health law.","Coggon, John",A Jurisprudence of the Body,310,19

In the run-up to the June 8, 2017 British general election, Facebook was used to filter mainstream newspaper articles mentioning Europe and Brexit. The UK’s Supreme Court ruled that the proroguing of Parliament in the Autumn of 2019, by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, was illegal. Closure had prevented further scrutiny of the Brexit process. Johnson was forced to reconvene Parliament and answer his critics on all sides. Johnson’s language that day was deemed at best divisive and at worst hate speech.

The Japanese proposal that the UK might join the new CPTPP offers an intriguing possibility, but the UK should push for membership for it too of both Taiwan and South Korea. But if the UK is to build successful new relationships, its leaders, policy makers and businesses need to cast aside old-fashioned stereotypes and patronising assumptions. They need to move beyond relations built on soundbites such as the ‘ golden era,’ and instead seek to build relationships based on shared values, mutual respect and understanding and a willingness to learn. It will require a readiness to engage in patient negotiations, in consensus-building and in multilateral diplomacy.

The main focus was on the under-graduate and post-graduate international students in various universities of India. This study employed a qualitative design as the data were collected through semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that the attitude of students towards online testing was positive even though they experienced worry and anxiety. Moreover, students used self-strategies to overcome such challenges such as improving their self-confident and motivating themselves during online tests. In terms of ICT skills, the findings showed that students did not face any challenges during the online testing, which supported the idea that is online testing does not require professional skills, and students could improve their ICT skills as a main requirement for 21st century education. Additionally, the findings of the study showed that there were other online testing challenges faced by students, including the transmission from traditional tests into online tests, and the poor connection of the internet. However, online testing advantages outweighed the challenges, especially when online testing is considered to be a good alternative method in such critical stations like the outbreak of COVID-19, and it would be suitable for future online learning. Accordingly, online testing should receive more focus by Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to get along with the educational requirements of the 21st century.","Alkamel, Mohammed Adulkareem A.; Chouthaiwale, Santosh S.; Yassin, Amr Abdullatif; AlAjmi, Qasim; Albaadany, Hanan Yahia",Emerging Technologies During the Era of COVID-19 Pandemic,310,16

It puts the main emphasis on the access of the US military forces to any place of the contemporary world and their projections over long distances.

All these doctrinal documents are based on a sophisticated cascade of arguments which confirms the neorealist emphasis on the role of ideology as a secondary actor. This cascade has six levels: the American way of life (AWL), its pillars, foreign actors (challengers) who could threaten the AWL, the instruments that they have at their disposal, the US determination to eliminate these threats, and the key instruments that it can use with the aim to defeat these challengers. These doctrines are very closely intertwined with regularly organised military exercises in the post-Soviet space, which lead to a growing number of military incidents and a disturbing military tension in this explosive area of our continent.

Despite Australia’s wealth, recent studies have shown that health and wellbeing, as well as a sense of belonging, have declined in Australian society and schools. The aim of this chapter is to investigate to what extent SRE/RI can contribute to addressing this problem. Educationalists have become aware of the importance of positive psychology (Seligman 2002), developing on the earlier theories of Maria Montessori ([1915] 1997). They have also developed a better understanding of the concept of the “greater good” and the psychological problems created by the contemporary focus on individual needs rather than community needs. The study of (Chen and Vanderweele 2018) demonstrates the centrality of belief in a higher spiritual being, of prayer, both public and private, as well as meditation, as directly producing positive health outcomes and protecting against negative behaviours. As well, Nielsen (2010) has demonstrated the importance of gratitude as a factor in giving and this is a key component of all religious prayer. These important findings are discussed in this chapter as well as our research findings from 58 interviews with directors, teachers and graduates either individually or in focus groups of the six main faith groups: Christianity (18), Islam (12), Buddhism (9), Hinduism (7), Judaism (7) and Baha’i (5). The chapter concludes with an explanation of the connections between spirituality, wellbeing and religious belief.

He was started on prednisone with a good response. We conclude that subacute thyroiditis should be considered in the work up of fever of unknown origin even in the absence of classical signs and symptoms. LEARNING POINTS: Fever of unknown origin is a rare sole presentation of subacute thyroiditis. The classic signs and symptoms may not be manifest at the time of presentation. Normal thyroid function tests and elevated markers of inflammation often make infections, malignancy and autoinflammatory conditions the prime consideration. Imaging of the thyroid gland may point to a morphologic aberration and prompt a thyroid biopsy.

We find that the long-run relationship between tourism and output is positive and is characterized by a substantially faster adjustment of output after a negative shock than after a positive one. Using asymmetric error-correction model analysis the results show that the short-term adjustment path occurs through the level of output for negative deviations from the long-run equilibrium, thus supporting the tourism-led growth hypothesis. Linear quantile regression (QR) analysis indicates that the impact of tourism remains positive across the output distribution, but the effect is more pronounced at the lower quantiles of output while at the higher quantiles of output it becomes weaker and statistically insignificant. Furthermore, applying asymmetric QR analysis there is evidence that tourism growth exhibits an asymmetric impact on output growth. Our results have important policy implications, since the tourism-led growth hypothesis is a useful policy recommendation, but it should not be considered a panacea.","Lolos, Sarantis; Palaios, Panagiotis; Papapetrou, Evangelia",Port Econ J,310,1

Jocelynne Scutt draws on research finding that pornographic representations of women are implicated, alongside the modelling and fashion industries. Visions of how women should look, the appearance of our external body parts and the shape of our features, are embedded within women’s and men’s psyche, reflecting the demand that catwalk and photographic models starve or stick to minimalist diets to maintain child-like and young teenaged bodies on grown women. Television and film play their part, whilst the Covid-19 move to online meetings for business as well as companionable communication through Zoom and similar programmes brings women’s own bodies into sharp relief. Consumer protection laws, negligence actions and criminal laws governing body modification and genital mutilation may provide some avenue of redress and limitation on the ever-widening scope of the aesthetic, cosmetic and plastic surgery industry in manipulating women’s bodies. Universal regulation of the beauty industry and its myriad workers engaged in plumping, waxing, threading, injecting and shaving women’s bodies into plastic reproductions of themselves is becoming more likely. Yet ultimately it is women who will resist this production and servicing, which treats women as palettes to be worked upon by experts schooled in the production of women—not just women’s bodies—as if they know best what is a woman and how a woman should look. Jocelynne Scutt observes that some women are fighting back. Some have had implants removed, and some promote Our Bodies Our Selves as the way forward. Whether women can recover a vision celebrating the real bodies of real women is the question. With procedures invading every part of our bodies, this question is important, the answer is vital.","Scutt, Jocelynne A.","Beauty, Women's Bodies and the Law",310,11

These very small spacecraft, plus small hosted payloads, or tiny space experiments that are carried out in the Nanoracks experimental platform on board the International Space Station provide a gateway into space that can allow students to conduct experiments without huge multimillion dollar investments. The commercial uses of “smallsats” for 1-unit cubesats and below are extremely rare. Increasingly, there are commercial systems, however, that are using 3U cubesats particularly for automatic identification services (AIS) and for messaging, machine to machine (M2M), and Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity. The other prime commercial applications by 3U and above cubesats are for remote sensing with lower resolution in cases where rapid updates of information and data analytics are the prime purpose of a small satellite constellation. Thus small space units such as cubesats and even smaller pocketqubes are typically used for student or scientific experiments or used for proof of concept for a much larger follow-on activity. This means that most commercial networks are using the larger class of microsats and minisats for their constellation designs. Thus this chapter is focused on the burgeoning growth of “smallsats” for commercial networks and the “NewSpace” or “Space 2.0” constellations that employ larger spacecraft. These satellites are still far smaller than the typical commercial and space agency research spacecraft that has grown to the size that ranges from 1000 Kg on up many thousands of Kgs. There is now a huge and rapidly growing new commercial market for what are called “microsats” (e.g., 10–100 kg or 22–220 pounds) and “minisats” (e.g., 100–500 kg or 220–1100 pounds). Others, however, define minisats as being from 100 kg up to 1000 kg (or 220–2200 pounds). These types of “smallsats” unlike those discussed in the preceding chapter are typically being deployed for commercial missions and applications and most often for large constellations to create a global service. Space agencies, military agencies, and established research organizations are finding that these smaller but highly capable satellites can be used for scientific exploration in orbit and in deep space and for proof of concept for larger missions. These microsatellites and minisats are most often launched in low Earth orbit (LEO) but not exclusively so. GEO-orbiting spacecraft and deep space missions can also use this type of “smallsat” that are performing ever more complex and difficult missions. Even radarsats that require substantial power levels because they require “active sensing” have been deployed as constellations using this type of smallsat such as Canada’s most recent Radarsat Constellation. This chapter provides the background of the earlier “smallsat” constellations that failed financially, the resurgence in the technologies, financial support, markets for these new “smallsat” systems, and the regulatory and other challenges still to be faced in this highly dynamic market that is still in what might be considered a second shakeout phase of development.","Pelton, Joseph N.; Laufer, Rene",Handbook of Small Satellites,310,1

In this work, a novel MBRL method is proposed, called Risk-Aware Model-Based Control (RAMCO). It combines uncertainty-aware deep dynamics models and the risk assessment technique Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR). This mechanism is appropriate for real-world application since it takes epistemic risk into consideration. In addition, we use a model-free solver to produce warm-up training data, and this setting improves the performance in low-dimensional environments and covers the shortage of MBRL’s nature in the high-dimensional scenarios. In comparison with other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, we show that it produces superior results on a walking robot model. We also evaluate the method with an Eidos environment, which is a novel experimental method with multi-dimensional randomly initialized deep neural networks to measure the performance of any reinforcement learning algorithm, and the advantages of RAMCO are highlighted.","Yu, Chen; Rosendo, Andre",Front Robot AI,310,1

Polysaccharides in several (traditional) plant extracts have been shown to be immunostimulatory, and some studies suggest beneficial effects against respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to (i) identify the active polysaccharide constituents from affordable and renewable crops (bell pepper and carrot) using activity-guided fractionation, (ii) evaluate in vitro effects on innate immune responses (phagocytosis and cytokine secretion), microbiota modulation and production of short chain fatty acids, followed by (iii) the evaluation of effects of a bell pepper extract enriched for the active component in a human proof of concept study. We identified rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I) as the nutricophore responsible for the immunostimulatory activity with substantial structural and functional equivalence between bell pepper (bp) and carrot (c). The in vitro studies showed that bpRG-I and cRG-I comprise similar immune- and microbiota modulatory potential and the human study demonstrated that bpRG-I was well tolerated and enhanced innate immune responsiveness in vivo.

Methods: We conducted a survey-based study during a series of open meetings related to pregnancy and parenting. Before and after the pediatrician’s lecture related to vaccinations, listeners completed the visual analogue scales (VAS, 0–15 cm), evaluating (1) self-declared knowledge on vaccinations and (2) how they perceive the safety and efficacy of this preventive method. Results: In total, 484 women aged 30 ± 4 years participated in the lecture (pregnant = 68%; ≥1 children = 56%). Participants declared to have more comprehensive knowledge on preventive vaccinations and perceived vaccines to be safer and more useful (the role for the immunity) after vs. before the lecture (median VAS: 10.4 vs. 7.2, 10.8 vs. 8.7, and 11.0 vs. 10.4 cm, all p < 0.001). Importantly, the prevalence of vaccine-related adverse events was also assessed as being higher after the lecture (median VAS: 9.9 vs. 8.0 cm, p < 0.001). The increase in self-declared knowledge on vaccinations and perceived need for vaccinations (delta VAS—VAS after minus before the lecture, expressed as % of baseline) was lower among participants who rated the lecture less vs. more useful.

Due to their effectiveness at filtering aerosols that could potentially contain viruses, the N95-type filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) are frequently used by healthcare workers and first responders. However, due to a shortage of domestic N95 FFRs in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, internationally produced respirators were imported and deployed under an Emergency Use Authorization by the Food and Drug Administration. Due to concerns raised at the time, there was an urgent need to verify their effectiveness and usability. In this study, we summarize our characterization of the nanoparticulate filtration performances of 136 such respirators, measured between April 1 and June 30, 2020. Our results indicate that about 42% of the respirators showed filtration efficiencies better than 90% (≤10% penetration), but only 17% performed better than 95% (≤5% penetration). On the other hand, about 35% showed filtration efficiencies below 80% (≥20% penetration). A representative subset of devices was analyzed for the origin of such variations in filtration performance. We found that filtration efficiency increased with the level of electrostatic charge on the FFRs and that the poor performance of the internationally sourced FFRs could be traced to a lack of electrostatic filtration mechanisms. Furthermore, electrostatics shifted the particle size at which aerosol penetration through the FFR was maximal from around 200 nm to less than 100 nm for the highest-performing FFRs, a size range that largely goes undetected in standardized tests.","Hao, Junli; Passos de Oliveira Santos, Rachel; Rutledge, Gregory C.",ACS Appl Nano Mater,310,6

Both DNA and VLP vaccine candidates were developed and characterized, which express CHIKV structural genes (C-E3-E2-6K-E1). Mice were immunized twice, with different protocols, followed by immunological detection and CHIKV Ross challenge. The highest antigen-specific IgG and neutralizing activity were induced by DNA and VLP co-immunization, while the highest cellular immunity was induced by DNA vaccination alone. Although all vaccine groups could protect mice from lethal CHIKV challenge, demonstrated as reduced viral load in various tissues, without weight loss, mice co-immunized with DNA and VLP exhibited the mildest histopathological changes and lowest International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria (INHAND) scores, in comparison to mice with either DNA or VLP vaccination alone.

The aim of this study was to explore patient attitudes to surgery and theatre efficiency in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and assess a potential framework for the delivery of such services. METHODS: Prospectively collected data on theatre timings and procedures completed per session used to assess theatre efficiency using 40 patients from June 2019 and 85 patients from June 2020. Information on patient compliance with 14-day household isolation and attitudes to surgery were collected prospectively over a 7-week period using a questionnaire (37 patients included). Follow up data was collected via telephone consultation a minimum of 2 weeks after discharge. RESULTS: Significant reduction in the number of points per session (p = 0.02) with a mean of 3.19 in 2019 and 2.42 in 2020. Only 18 of 31 patients were compliant with pre-operative isolation with individual failures accounting for 4 of 13 and failures by household members accounting for 9. Impact on COVID-19 and precautions on patient anxiety was mixed. No patients required symptomatic COVID-19 swab. INTERPRETATION: With the restrictions of COVID-19 there are significant problems with theatre efficiency, in effect losing an operation a list. Furthermore, compliance with pre-operative isolation was poor.

The importance of vaccination (v) during the Covid19 (CV19) pandemic has been widely discussed in the media. To ascertain the receptiveness of type 2 diabetics (T2D) to fluv during the CV19 pandemic and their acceptance of an eventual CV19 vaccine (CVv) we carried out telephone interviews with 34 unselected T2D pts in Montreal, Quebec post the 1(st) wave of CV19 in that region. Pts were asked if they planned taking the fluv and/or an eventual CVv, reasons for reticence to v, and attitudes toward and compliance with public health (PH) directives. They were also asked their primary source of health related information. Recent HbA1c and insulin use were recorded. Thirty four T2Ds were surveyed, 22 M 50–87 yrs (mean 69.2) and 12 F 49–84 yrs (mean 68.8). Eleven M and 5 F were on insulin. HbA1c ranged from 5.9–13.0 (mean 7.3). None of the pts had recently discussed v with a healthcare provider (HCP). One pt received his health related information from Facebook, the others from mainstream media. None had contraindications to v. None had been diagnosed with CV19. Past influenza history was unknown. Forty one percent (14/34) of pts, 11 M 50–86 yrs (mean 66.0) and 3 F 49–66 yrs (mean 59.0) did not plan to take the fluv. They explained their decisions as never having taken fluv (12 pts) or having been ill despite having taken it (2 pts). Neither accessibility nor cost were issues. Two F, 62 and 66 yrs, who refused fluv also refused CVv. Six M aged 60–86 yrs (mean 70.5) and 1 F aged 73 yrs were planning to wait to access real life safety (6pts) or efficacy (1pt) data before accepting CVv. All pts claimed to be following PH guidelines including social distancing, hand washing, and mask recommendations; 91.2% (31/34) fully agreed with PH policies, 2 were in moderate agreement and 1 thought PH policy was not strict enough. Of the latter 3 pts none planned on taking the fluv. One planned taking the CVv, 1 planned not to, and the 3rd planned to wait before deciding. Despite a long history of use, recommendations by experts, and free and easy accessibility, T2D pts questioned after the 1(st) wave of CV19 are not convinced of the fluv’s importance. Despite high case numbers and being themselves at high risk, not all T2Ds are willing to unequivocally accept a potential Health Canada sanctioned CVv. This study underlines the important work HCPs have ahead in educating and reassuring pts with regard to vaccination.","Gilfix, Reisa; Elstein, Jack; Elstein, Eleanor",J Endocr Soc,310,16

Globally, one of every five jobs can be performed from home. In low-income countries, this ratio drops to one of every 26 jobs. Failing to account for internet access yields upward biased estimates of the resilience of poor countries, lagging regions, and poor workers. Since better paid workers are more likely to be able to work from home, COVID-19 is likely to exacerbate inequality, especially in richer countries where better paid and educated workers are insulated from the shock. The overall labor market burden of COVID-19 is bound to be larger in poor countries, where only a small share of workers can work from home and social protection systems are weaker. Across the globe, young, poorly educated workers and those on temporary contracts are least likely to be able to work from home and more vulnerable to the labor market shocks from COVID-19.","Garrote Sanchez, Daniel; Gomez Parra, Nicolas; Ozden, Caglar; Rijkers, Bob; Viollaz, Mariana; Winkler, Hernan",World Bank Res Obs,310,16

Laryngeal injury following intubation is a common occurrence, therefore this study aims to analyse airway, voice, and swallow (AVS) outcomes of patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis and compares it to intubated non-COVID-19 respiratory patients and other ICU admissions. METHOD: We collected data from inpatient records, and follow-up clinics on intubated adult patients discharged from a tertiary care hospital ICU between 01/03/20 and 30/04/20. Patients were assessed with the AVS Scale, Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), and Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10). RESULTS: 86 patients were admitted with COVID-19 pneumonitis, 17 patients were admitted with non-COVID-19 respiratory failure, and 26 patients were admitted with a non-respiratory diagnosis. The COVID-19 cohort demonstrated higher rates of AVS difficulties (airway 59% vs 44% and 31%, voice 40% vs 19% and 19%, swallow 21% vs 6% and 12%). VHI-10 and EAT-10 scores showed no significant differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients intubated for COVID-19 pneumonitis reported higher rates of AVS difficulties against non-COVID-19 reasons for intubation. Robust prospective screening protocols are essential to improving patient outcomes by highlighting and therefore managing laryngological sequelae that occur following intubation.","Miu, K; Miller, B; Tornari, C; Slack, A; Murphy, P; Ahmed, I; Burnay, V; Karagama, Y",Br J Surg,310,1

To do so, HIV-1, like other viruses, developed strategies to use several cellular processes to its advantage, but had also to come to terms with an arsenal of cellular innate defense proteins, or antiviral factors, that target more or less efficiently, virtually every step of the virus replicative cycle. Among antiviral restriction factors, the family of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) has emerged as a crucial component of cellular innate defenses for their ability to interfere with both early and late phases of viral replication by inhibiting cellular and viral membranes fusion. Here, we review the enormous advances made since the discovery of IFITMs as interferon-regulated genes more than thirty years ago, with a particular focus on HIV-1 and on the elements that modulate its susceptibility or resistance towards members of this family. Given the recent advances of the field in the elucidation of the mechanism of IFITM inhibition and on the mechanism(s) of viral resistance, we expect that future years will bring novel insights into the definition of the multiple facets of IFITMs and on their possible use for novel therapeutical approaches.","Marziali, Federico; Cimarelli, Andrea",Cells,310,17

METHODS: College students (n = 459; aged 18–23) at a midwestern university participated in the study. Participants completed an online survey in mid-April 2020, which included the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form and amended versions of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaires. Spearman rho correlation coefficients were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: Higher GI mean total scores were significantly related to higher vigorous and moderate intensity physical activity total minutes for the overall sample (rs = 0.112, P < 0.05); and for participants identifying as female (rs = 0.134, P < 0.05). Higher GI mean total scores were significantly related to longer sleep duration for the overall sample (rs = 0.111, P < 0.05) and for participants identifying as male (rs = 0.258, P < 0.01). In males, longer sleep duration was also significantly related to a decrease in sleep quality (rs = –.226, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The findings reveal a positive correlation between GI symptoms and vigorous and moderate-intensity activity.

In most of the developing countries, HCW disposal management has become one of the fastest-growing challenges for urban municipalities and healthcare providers. Determining the location for HCW disposal centers is a relatively complex process due to the involvement of various alternatives, criteria, and strict government guidelines about the disposal of HCW. The objective of the paper is to introduce the WASPAS (weighted aggregated sum product assessment) method with Fermatean fuzzy sets (FFSs) for the HCW disposal location selection problem. This method combines the score function, entropy measure, and classical WASPAS approach within FFSs context. Next, a combined procedure using entropy and score function is proposed to estimate the criteria weights. To do this, a novel score function with its desirable properties and some entropy measures are introduced under the FFSs context. Further, an illustrative case study of the HCW disposal location selection problem on FFSs is established, which evidences the practicality and efficacy of the developed approach. Comparative discussion and sensitivity analysis are made to monitor the permanence of the introduced framework. The final results approve that the proposed methodology can effectively handle the ambiguity and inaccuracy in the decision-making procedure of HCW disposal location selection.","Mishra, Arunodaya Raj; Rani, Pratibha",Complex Intell,310,8

Second year, Doctor of Physical Therapy (DPT) students were surveyed regarding their learning experiences during an online Foundational Sciences course that included a mix of anatomy, physiology, pathology and pharmacology instruction. The purpose was to gain perceptions into best strategies for online instruction for those content areas that promoted course objective competency with an emphasis on learner engagement. Fifty‐four DPT students were surveyed following the completion of an 8‐week summer semester Foundational Sciences course at the University of the Incarnate Word, School of Physical Therapy, DPT program. The 7‐question anonymous survey addressed content delivered both synchronously (live) and asynchronously (prerecorded or self‐regulated) with regard to time, synchronous class size and format (large group vs. breakout room), use of asynchronous voiceovers and video tutorials, and rating of specific activities promoting engagement. Open feedback questions addressed virtual course elements that students identified as most and least supportive of content mastery. Fifty responses were collected (93% response rate). Findings from the survey indicated a preference for synchronous sessions of 1.5 hr (94%) in length with the combination of both large and small group (breakout room) sessions (90%). Sixty percent of respondents preferred having a mix of synchronous classes with the entire cohort of 54 learners and smaller synchronous sessions with half the cohort. While 50% indicated a preference for more asynchronous PowerPoint voiceovers, 46% indicated that they preferred not having asynchronous voiceovers that aligned with every synchronous class. Activities promoting engagement received mixed ratings overall using a 5‐point Likert scale ranging from poor to excellent. Activities that received majority satisfactory ratings included Poll Everywhere (44%), Zoom annotation tool (40%), Zoom breakout room activities (44%) and StudyMate flashcards (56%). Activities with roughly equivalent ratings for satisfactory, very good and excellent included asynchronous voiceovers (28‐36%) and Kahoot quizzes (26‐38%). The inclusion of guest speakers was least favorable (32% combined poor and fair responses) out of all the activities utilized to enhance engagement. Respondent open feedback indicated that accessibility to recorded synchronous sessions and asynchronous voiceovers were most valuable to their learning. Question interruptions during synchronous sessions and discussion‐based breakout room sessions with less structure was least helpful to their learning. Respondents consistently identified optimal duration and format of online instructional delivery but varied in their responses related to activities promoting learner engagement. This finding could be attributed to variations in learning styles and merits further study.

Despite constant efforts from the authorities to monitor and control the disease, sylvatic rabies is a current issue in Amazon's communities. The inequalities among Amazon areas challenge the expansion of high-tech services and limit the implementation of active laboratory surveillance to effectively avoid outbreaks in human and non-human hosts, which also reproduces a panorama of vulnerability in risk communities. Because rabies is a preventable disease, the prevalence in the particular context of the Amazon area highlights the failure of surveillance strategies to predict spillovers and indicates the need to adapt the public policies to a “One Health” approach. Therefore, this work assesses the distribution of free care resources and facilities among Pará's regions in the oriental Amazon; and discusses the challenges of implanting One Health in the particular context of the territory. We indicate a much-needed strengthening of the sylvatic and urban surveillance networks to achieve the “Zero by 30” goal, which is inextricable from multilateral efforts to combat the progressive biome's degradation.","Bastos, Victor; Mota, Roberta; Guimarães, Mylenna; Richard, Yuri; Lima, André Luis; Casseb, Alexandre; Barata, Gyovanna Corrêa; Andrade, Jorge; Casseb, Livia Medeiros Neves",Front Public Health,310,5

Among seven Eimeria species infecting chickens, E. acervulina is a highly prevalent, moderately pathogenic species. Thus, it is valuable for the study of transfection and for use as a potential as vaccine vector. In this study, a plasmid containing expression cassette with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP) and 12 copies of extracellular domain of H9N2 avian influenza virus M2 (M2e) protein was used for the transfection. Nucleofected sporozoites were inoculated into birds through wing vein. Recombinant E. acervulina oocysts with 0.1% EYFP+ and RFP+ populations were collected from the feces of the inoculated birds. The fluorescent rate of transgenic parasites reached over 95% after nine successive propagations with a pyrimethamine selection in vivo and fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) of progeny oocysts. The expression of M2e in the transgenic parasites (EaM2e) was confirmed by Western blot and its cytoplasm localization in sporozoites was displayed by an indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Meanwhile, we found that the fecundity of EaM2e was equivalent to that of wild type E. acervulina (EaWT). Taken together, the stable transfection of E. acervulina was successfully established. Future studies will focus on whether transgenic E. acervulina can serve as a live vaccine vector.","Zhang, Sixin; Tang, Xinming; Wang, Si; Shi, Fangyun; Duan, Chunhui; Bi, Feifei; Suo, Jingxia; Hu, Dandan; Liu, Jie; Wang, Chaoyue; Suo, Xun; Liu, Xianyong",Vaccines (Basel),310,1

Drawing on long-term fieldwork (2015–2017) in northern Jordan, I argue that seasonal migration was a livelihoods strategy for Syria’s rural poor long before 2011, serving as their old-age provision and contributing to rural development. Since 2011, conflict-induced displacement and border closures have reshaped Syrians’ transnational kinship-based networks: geographically, but also with regard to the diversification of sources of income and gendered responsibilities. In Jordan, Syrian refugees mobilize pre-war transnational ties to access jobs in agriculture and the humanitarian sector, and distribute their income through kinship-based cross-border networks. These ethnographic findings challenge a localized understanding of refugee livelihoods, demonstrating that the household economies of refugees, migrants, and those left behind, in Syria, Jordan, the Gulf countries, and now Europe, are intertwined. In closing, I provide recommendations about how a networked understanding of refugee livelihoods can inform the COVID-19 emergency response, and help create decent jobs for displaced people in the Global South.","Zuntz, Ann-Christin",J Refug Stud,310,1

Limited data have been published regarding the consequences of this transition. We aimed to understand (1) infectious diseases (ID) fellowship programs’ recruitment efforts and the effect of virtual recruitment on application and interview numbers and (2) the number of programs to which matched applicants applied and interviewed and applicants’ perspectives on virtual recruitment. METHODS: In 2020–2021, we surveyed all US ID fellowship program directors (PDs) and matched applicants. Descriptive data analysis was performed on quantitative survey items. Free-text responses were analyzed through a quantitative content analysis approach. RESULTS: The PD response rate was 68/158 (43%); the applicant response rate was at least 23% (85/365). PDs reported a 27% increase in mean number of applications received and a 45% increase in mean number of applicants interviewed compared with the previous year. Applicants especially valued the online program structure information, PD program overview videos, didactic and curriculum content, and fellow testimonials and profiles. Most applicants preferred interviews lasting no more than 40 minutes and interview days lasting no more than 5 hours. Nearly all (60/64, 94%) PDs adequately learned about candidates; most (48/64, 75%) felt unable to showcase their program as well as when in-person. Most PDs (54/64, 84%) and applicants (56/73, 77%) want an option for virtual recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: Virtual recruitment enabled programs to accommodate more applicants and highlighted applicants’ preferences for programs’ augmented online presences and time-limited interview days. Most programs and applicants want an option for virtual interviews.","Rockney, Danica; Benson, Constance A; Blackburn, Brian G; Chirch, Lisa M; Konold, Victoria J L; Luther, Vera P; Razonable, Raymund R; Tackett, Sean; Melia, Michael T",Open Forum Infect Dis,310,1

In this study, proteome-mining and immunoinformatics approaches were applied to identify novel antigenic proteins and to construct a multi-epitope vaccine against C. chauvoei. All proteins of C. chauvoei strains were retrieved from the NCBI Microbial Genome Database containing both genomic and proteomic data of prokaryotes. The proteins were analyzed to exclude non-redundant sequences and to determine antigenic, virulent, and non-allergenic vaccine candidates through several online tools, resulting in seven protein candidates. Cytotoxic T and B cell epitopes of these proteins were evaluated through the tools present in the immune epitope database and the prioritized antigenic epitopes were then conjugated via appropriate linkers to construct the vaccine candidate. After the evaluation of physicochemical properties of the construct, the tertiary structure was modeled and refined through trRosetta and GalaxyRefine, respectively. The quality of the 3D structure was validated by ERRAT score, z-score, and Ramachandran plot and the construct was then docked with bovine Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) using ClusPro. The docked complex was subjected to Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area in the HawkDock server and normal mode analysis in the iMODS simulation suite to assess the binding energy and stability of the complex, respectively. Overall, the vaccine construct was found stable and energetically feasible for bovine TLR 4 binding. Therefore, it can be used as a multi-epitope vaccine construct in clostridial vaccines to control the blackleg disease.

We conducted a retrospective analysis on five immunocompetent patients (aged ⩾14 years) with adenovirus pneumonia who visited our fever clinic between 1 February 2020 and 29 February 2020. The symptoms at clinical onset were fever, with cough and phlegm production either absent or appearing several days after disease onset. One patient with severe disease exhibited dyspnoea and a rapid development of respiratory failure. A subset of patients had concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms. The results of blood tests revealed normal leukocyte counts, decreased lymphocyte counts and increased C-reactive protein levels. The imaging findings resembled those of bacterial pneumonia, and pleural effusions were present in some cases. Most patients had a good prognosis with symptomatic treatment and supportive care. However, one patient with severe disease and a MuLBSTA score of >12 had a poor prognosis and ultimately died. Immunocompetent youths and adults may develop adenovirus pneumonia, and severe cases are at the risk of death. Since no effective treatments for adenovirus pneumonia are currently known, the early diagnosis and provision of symptomatic treatment and supportive care should be adopted to prevent the development and progression of severe disease.","Zhao, Bo; Yang, TengFei; Zheng, Rui",Epidemiol Infect,310,1

The long history of domestication and the presence of diverse agroecologies in Ethiopia create unique opportunities to study the effect of environmental selective pressures. Species distribution models (SDMs) and Phenotypic distribution models (PDMs) can be applied to investigate the relationship between environmental variation and phenotypic differentiation in wild animals and domestic populations. In the present study we used SDMs and PDMs to detect environmental variables related with habitat suitability and phenotypic differentiation among nondescript Ethiopian indigenous chicken populations. 34 environmental variables (climatic, soil, and vegetation) and 19 quantitative traits were analyzed for 513 adult chickens from 26 populations. To have high variation in the dataset for phenotypic and ecological parameters, animals were sampled from four spatial gradients (each represented by six to seven populations), located in different climatic zones and geographies. Three different ecotypes are proposed based on correlation test between habitat suitability maps and phenotypic clustering of sample populations. These specific ecotypes show phenotypic differentiation, likely in response to environmental selective pressures. Nine environmental variables with the highest contribution to habitat suitability are identified. The relationship between quantitative traits and a few of the environmental variables associated with habitat suitability is non-linear. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating species and phenotypic distribution modeling approaches in characterization of livestock populations, delineation of suitable habitats for specific breeds, and understanding of the relationship between ecological variables and quantitative traits, and underlying evolutionary processes.","Kebede, Fasil Getachew; Komen, Hans; Dessie, Tadelle; Alemu, Setegn Worku; Hanotte, Olivier; Bastiaansen, John W.

This paper systematically reviews the body of empirical evidence that has emerged over the last three decades on deferred taxes in the fields of value relevance and earnings management. A bibliographic analysis and a narrative synthesis are presented within a thematic categorization framework. Key results indicate that existing research focuses on the US setting. There is substantial evidence for the value relevance of various deferred tax items but limited evidence that firms use deferred taxes to manage their earnings.

At the same time, tertiarization in Russia differs from the processes taking place in developed countries. An article based on EuroStat and World Bank data compared the structures of gross value added and employment in the tertiary sector in Russia and Europe. Rosstat data are applied to analyze the results of transformation of the tertiary sector of Russia in the post-Soviet period and Russian regions are typologized according to the structure of gross value added in the tertiary sector and employment dynamics. In addition, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020 on the dynamics of the tertiary sector is considered based on quarterly tax receipt data from the Federal Tax Service. It was revealed that Russia’s declining lag in the 1990–2000s in the share of the tertiary sector in the economy stabilized. However, the country did not succeed in approaching the world leaders, due to a later entry into the tertiarization process, the weighted structure of the economy, the peculiarities of the settlement pattern, and the unstable dynamics of disposable income and inertia in the transformation of the way of life. The level of development of the tertiary sphere, which played an important role in overcoming the negative social consequences of the transition to a market economy, is highly differentiated among federal subjects. Quantitative and qualitative growth of the tertiary sphere is characteristic of no more than 15 of the most advanced regions. In most of the rest, it is more of an adaptative nature against the background of a recession in other sectors of the economy. The stability of the tertiary sector in a crisis period depends on the ratio of its more inertial nonmarket and vulnerable market subsectors. Both strong regions with moderate diversification of the tertiary sector and the weakest regions, where market sectors are represented mainly by retail trade, are in the zone of greatest risk.","Safronov, S.

The soils of the three urban cemeteries in Carazinho were sampled, with 5 internal and external points, with 3 repetitions at depths of 0–20 and 20–40 cm, adding 180 samples to measure the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cr and Pb (g kg(−1)), considering the analytical sequence: (1) analysis in triplicate with mean deviation (RDS); (2) R2 of the analytical curve; (3) traceability of the pattern of each metal; (4) quantification limit of each metal (QL), with the performance of nitroperchloric digestion of the samples and the determinations of metals by flame modality atomic absorption spectrometry. Quantitative data on deaths by COVID-19 were analyzed by univariate modeling of time series, in the integrated autoregressive moving averages model. The results of this study were made available to fifteen architects, who attributed future solutions for environmentally sustainable cemeteries. The results showed high levels of copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) in the soil of the cemeteries studied.

METHODS From October 2000 to December 2006, radical surgery was planned in 211 patients who presented early-stage cancer of the cervix. Both ISB and Tc99 were used to detect the SLNs. In all cases, we proceeded with laparoscopy for the identification and removal of the SLNs, followed by a complete pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without para-aortic node sampling. The SLNs were sent for frozen section (1 level) and were ultra-staged (6 levels) for final pathology. Detection rate, sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated. RESULTS Among the 211 patients, ISB (n=152) identified at least 1 SLN in 92.8% of the cases. With Tc99 (n=166), the detection rate of SLN increased to 96.9%. When both techniques were used together (n=107), Tc99 was significantly better than ISB by 7.8% (p=0.0094) and at least 1 SLN (hot and/or blue) was found in 99.1% of the cases. In 16.7% of patients, a SLN was located in aberrant sites, including 3.8% in the para-aortic area. Thirty-three out of the 211 patients (15.6%) had lymph node metastases. When considering only the 181 patients with bilateral SLNs identified, the NPV of SLN is 100% after ultra staging on final pathology and 94.2% on frozen section (FS). CONCLUSION Sentinel node mapping is feasible using laparoscopy. The radio-isotopic technique adds significantly to the rate of detection. The main benefits of SLN mapping in cervical cancer are the detection of micro-metastases on ultra staging which might be missed on routine pathological evaluation, and identification of aberrant drainage sites. However, the current frozen section techniques lack sensitivity to identify very small metastases and need refinement. SLN mapping should become the standard of care in the modern management of cervical cancer and complete pelvic lymphadenectomy could be avoided when bilateral SLNs are detected in patients with lesions less than 2 cm.","Roy, Michel; Bouchard-Fortier, Geneviève; Popa, Ion; Grégoire, Jean; Renaud, Marie-Claude; Têtu, Bernard; Plante, Marie",Gynecologic oncology,310,22

ARDS in influenza-infected mice is associated with reduced levels of liponucleotides (essential precursors for de novo phospholipid synthesis) in alveolar type II (ATII) epithelial cells. Because surfactant phospholipid synthesis is a primary function of ATII cells, we hypothesized that disrupting this process could contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of influenza-induced ARDS. The goal of this study was to determine whether parenteral liponucleotide supplementation can attenuate ARDS. C57BL/6 mice inoculated intranasally with 10,000 pfu/mouse of H1N1 influenza A/WSN/33 virus were treated with CDP-choline (100 μg/mouse, i.p.) +/- CDP-diacylglycerol 16:0/16:0 (10 μg/mouse, i.p.) once daily from 1-5 days post-inoculation (to model post-exposure influenza prophylaxis) or as a single dose on day 5 (to model treatment of patients with ongoing influenza-induced ARDS). Daily post-exposure prophylaxis with CDP-choline attenuated influenza-induced hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, alterations in lung mechanics, impairment of alveolar fluid clearance, and pulmonary inflammation without altering viral replication. These effects were not recapitulated by daily administration of CTP and/or choline. Daily co-administration of CDP-diacylglycerol significantly enhanced the beneficial effects of CDP-choline and also modified the ATII cell lipidome, reversing the infection-induced decrease in phosphatidylcholine and increasing levels of most other lipid classes in ATII cells. Single-dose treatment with both liponucleotides at 5 days post-inoculation also attenuated hypoxemia, altered lung mechanics, and inflammation. Overall, our data show that liponucleotides act rapidly to reduce disease severity in mice with severe influenza-induced ARDS.","Rosas, Lucia E; Doolittle, Lauren M; Joseph, Lisa M; El-Musa, Hasan; Novotny, Michael V; Hickman-Davis, Judy M; Hite, R Duncan; Davis, Ian C",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,310,5

Furthermore, turnover rates for contract nurses were found to be as high as five to eight times of those for full-time nurses. Because high turnover rates are likely to induce negative impacts on the stability of care provided in the absence of staffing continuity, the association between nursing employment arrangement and nursing care quality is attracting greater attention. PURPOSE This study was designed to investigate the work status of contract versus full-time nurses at a public hospital in Taiwan and to examine the impact of such on work-related attitudes, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance. METHODS Samples were recruited from a public hospital in Taiwan. In addition to self-rated items, researchers used supervisor-rated structured questionnaires for job performance to attenuate the possible effect of common method bias. The study investigated the impact of hospital nurse employment status on work-related attitudes, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance using a regression model that included the critical work-related attitudes variables of job satisfaction and organizational commitment. RESULTS Study findings included the following: (a) organizational commitment, job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, and job performance correlate positively with one another. (b) No significant difference between contract and full-time nurses was found in terms of organizational commitment, job satisfaction, organizational citizenship behavior, and self-rated job performance. However, when rated by supervisors, reported job performance levels for full-time nurses were significantly higher than those of contract nurses. (c) Organizational citizenship behavior exhibited a mediating effect between job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and job performance. CONCLUSIONS In this study, supervisors gave higher job performance ratings to full-time nurses than to contract nurses. This result deserves further investigation.","Chu, Cheng-I; Hsu, Yao-Feng",The journal of nursing research : JNR,310,31

Covalent, targeted labeling, such as with a SNAP-tag, uses synthetic dyes to label specific proteins in vivo for studying processes such as endocytosis or to use super-resolution microscopy. Despite the potential, such chemical tagging has not been used effectively in plants. A major drawback has been the limited knowledge regarding cell wall and membrane permeability of the available synthetic dyes. Out of 31 synthetic dyes tested here, 26 were taken up into BY-2 cells, while eight were not. This creates sets that can serve to measure endocytosis. Three of the dyes that were able to enter the cells, SNAP-tag ligands of diethylaminocoumarin, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and silicon-rhodamine (SiR) 647 were used to SNAP-tag α-tubulin. Successful tagging was verified by live cell imaging and visualization of microtubule arrays in interphase and during mitosis in Arabidopsis seedling. Fluorescence activation-coupled protein labeling (FAPL) with DRBG-488 was used to observe PIN2 endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole as well as preferential delivery of newly synthesized PIN2 to the actively forming cell plate during mitosis.

Statin patients were older and had higher rates of comorbidities, including coronary artery disease, diabetes, and hypertension (p<0.0001 for all).The rate of AKI in the statin (16%) and nonstatin patients (14%) (p=0.60) and CKD progression based on Kaplan-Meier estimates (p=0.57) were similar between both the groups. Subgroup analysis of the 271 (80%) patients with hilar clamping also had similar rates of AKI, in statin users 10% vs 12% in nonusers (p=0.50). Multivariate analysis of factors affecting CKD progression confirmed these findings. Oncologic progression was not affected by statin therapy (p=0.90). CONCLUSION Statin medications do not appear to influence perioperative renal function following RPN, in either clamped or unclamped procedures. Continuation of these medications may be continued perioperatively, but any effect on renal functional or oncologic outcomes was not elucidated in this study.","Krane, L Spencer; Sandberg, Jason Michael; Rague, James T; Hemal, Ashok K",Journal of endourology,310,1

In this experiment, a total of 450 broiler chickens were assigned to four experimental and control groups. The birds received organic Zn at the rate of 50 mg/kg (OZ-50) and 60 mg/kg (OZ-60) or inorganic Zn at the rate of 50 mg/kg (IZ-50) and 60 mg/kg (IZ-60) for an experimental period of 30 days. Significantly (P < 0.05) higher feed consumption, body weight, feed conversion ratio, and production efficiency factor (PEF) were recorded in OZ-50. Similarly, antibody titer against infectious bronchitis (IB) and PON1 activity was higher (P < 0.05) in OZ-50 compared with the control group. In addition, significantly (P < 0.05) higher villus dimensions and goblet cell count were recorded for the group OZ-50 compared with other treatments. It was concluded that the organic form of Zn was superior in improving the growth, histological features of intestines, humoral response, and PON1 activity in broiler.","Chand, Naila; Zahirullah,; Khan, Rifat Ullah; Shah, Muqadar; Naz, Shabana; Tinelli, Antonella",Tropical animal health and production,310,16

Afterwards, for many years, the clinical application of serum LDH measurement has been limited to the evaluation of anemias and to as a rough prognostic tool for certain tumors. Content In the last few years, significant changes have happened. First, the test has been confirmed as a robust predictor of poor outcomes in many neoplastic conditions. Furthermore, in the Revised International Staging System adopted in the 2015 by the International Myeloma Working Group, LDH acts as determinant of disease biology in differentiating myeloma stages. Finally, in the last few months, LDH is definitively reborn given its proven significant contribution in defining the COVID-19 severity. Conclusions This increased clinical role calls for an improvement of LDH assay standardization through the implementation of traceability of results of clinical samples to the available reference measurement system.","Panteghini, Mauro",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,310,27

For wider use, three neutral electrolyzed water-based gels, namely, HOCl-containing aqueous gels were prepared with a thickening/gelling agent in this study. We evaluated their microbicidal effects against four strains and storage stabilities indicated by available chlorine concentration. Immediately after preparation, all gels (70 ppm) could completely remove microbes by a 3-min treatment. The gel prepared with xanthan gum remarkably reduced its available chlorine concentration even under shaded and refrigerated storage conditions, failing to maintain its microbicidal effect following 1-day storage, whereas other gels, prepared with carboxyvinyl polymer or agar, maintained effective concentration (>20 ppm), with high microbicidal effects following 9-day and 21-day storage, respectively. Neutral electrolyzed water-based gels might be useful to remove oral microbes. Based on our results, agar is the most suitable thickening/gelling agent from the viewpoint of storage stability.","Nagamatsu, Yuki; Nagamatsu, Hiroshi; Ikeda, Hiroshi; Shimizu, Hiroshi",Dental materials journal,310,5

Long-term glucose control has been recognized as a risk factor for postoperative complications. In the foot and ankle literature, long-term glycemic control as a potential perioperative risk factor is not well studied. Our goal was to investigate whether hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was independently associated with postoperative complications in a retrospective cohort study. METHODS Three hundred twenty-two patients with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the study to assess risk factors associated with postoperative foot and ankle surgery complications. RESULTS Bivariate analyses showed that HbA1c level and having at least one comorbidity were associated with postoperative infections. However, after adjusting for other covariates, the only significant factor was HbA1c level, with each increment of 1% increasing the odds of infection by a factor of 1.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.99). For postoperative wound-healing complications, bivariate analyses showed that body mass index, having at least one comorbidity, and HbA1c level were significant factors. After adjusting for other covariates, the only significant factors for developing postoperative wound complications were having at least one comorbidity (odds ratio, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.22-3.37) and HbA1c level (each 1% increment) (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.02-1.53). CONCLUSIONS In this retrospective study, HbA1c level had the strongest association with postoperative foot and ankle surgery complications in patients with diabetes.","Humphers, Jon M; Shibuya, Naohiro; Fluhman, Benjamin L; Jupiter, Daniel",Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association,310,1

Several tools were already available in 2008. The majority allowed the recanalization of acutely occluded intracranial arteries with acceptable levels of safety and efficacy, and with occasional failures. CASE PRESENTATION On 3 March 2008, a 67-year-old woman was treated 3.5 h after the clinical onset of a right hemispheric stroke due to an embolic middle cerebral artery (MCA) M1 occlusion. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score prior to treatment was 10. Mechanical thrombectomy with a microbrush yielded a significant amount of thrombotic material without recanalization. Given the urgency of the situation, the uncertain outcome in the case of a persistent occlusion of the right M1 segment and the fact that no other device was available, a Solitaire stent was deployed within the occluded right M1 segment. After several minutes of incubation, the expanded stent was slowly withdrawn under continuous aspiration with instantaneous removal of the entire thrombus and complete recanalization of the right MCA with reperfusion of the whole MCA supply territory. Digital subtraction angiography showed neither peripheral emboli nor vasospasm. The patient made a complete clinical recovery with an NIHSS score of 0 at the 30 day follow-up. CONCLUSION The Solitaire stent was initially developed for the endovascular treatment of wide necked intracranial aneurysms but has been demonstrated to be safe and efficacious for intracranial thrombectomy. This was the first successful human clinical use of a Solitaire stent for this purpose and the ignition spark for the development of a whole generation of new devices, now called stent retrievers.","Pérez, Marta Aguilar; Miloslavski, Elina; Fischer, Sebastian; Bäzner, Hansjörg; Henkes, Hans",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,310,1

New York City was swiftly declared the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States as case numbers grew exponentially in a matter of days, quickly threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the health care system. This burgeoning crisis led practitioners across specialties to adapt and mobilize rapidly. Plastic surgeons and trainees within the New York University Langone Health system faced uncertainty in terms of future practice, in addition to immediate and long-term effects on undergraduate and graduate medical education. The administration remained vigilant and adaptive, enacting departmental policies prioritizing safety and productivity, with early deployment of faculty for clinical support at the front lines. The authors anticipate that this pandemic will have far-reaching effects on the future of plastic surgery education, trends in the pursuit of elective surgical procedures, and considerable consequences for certain research endeavors. Undoubtedly, there will be substantial impact on the physical and mental well-being of health care practitioners across specialties. Coordinated efforts and clear lines of communication between the Department of Plastic Surgery and its faculty and trainees allowed a concerted effort toward the immediate challenge of tempering the spread of coronavirus disease of 2019 and preserving structure and throughput for education and research. Adaptation and creativity have ultimately allowed for early rebooting of in-person clinical and surgical practice. The authors present their coordinated efforts and lessons gleaned from their experience to inform their community's preparedness as this formidable challenge evolves.","Berman, Zoe P; Diep, Gustave K; Alfonso, Allyson R; Ramly, Elie P; Bluebond-Langner, Rachel; Bernstein, G Leslie; Rodriguez, Eduardo D",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,310,1

To test this hypothesis, eight volunteers completed three incremental exercise tests to exhaustion: (a) 18 °C ambient temperature (CON); (b) 38 °C (HEAT); and (c) 38 °C with addition of CO2 to inspiration to prevent the hyperventilation-induced reduction in PaCO2 (HEAT + CO2 ). In HEAT and HEAT + CO2 , rectal temperature was elevated prior to the exercise tests by means of hot water submersion and was higher (P < 0.05) than in CON. Compared with CON, ventilation was elevated (P < 0.01), and hence, PaCO2 reduced in HEAT. This caused a reduction (P < 0.05) in mean cerebral artery velocity (MCAvmean ) from 68.6 ± 15.5 to 53.9 ± 10.0 cm/s, which was completely restored in HEAT + CO2 (68.8 ± 5.8 cm/s). Cerebral oxygenation followed a similar pattern. V ˙ O 2 m a x was 4.6 ± 0.1 L/min in CON and decreased (P < 0.05) to 4.1 ± 0.2 L/min in HEAT and remained reduced in HEAT + CO2 (4.1 ± 0.2 L/min). Despite normalization of MCAvmean and cerebral oxygenation in HEAT + CO2 , this did not improve exercise performance, and thus, the reduced MCAvmean in HEAT does not seem to limit exercise performance.","Keiser, S; Flück, D; Stravs, A; Hüppin, F; Lundby, C",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,310,1

Data on the safety and efficacy of this treatment for posterior circulation aneurysms are limited. OBJECTIVE To present our posterior circulation flow diverter experience, outcomes and morbidity in comparison with recent studies. METHODS A retrospective chart and imaging review of six patients with seven aneurysms in posterior circulation vessels, treated with flow diverter technology was carried out. A literature review was performed using standard online search tools. RESULTS We included five saccular and two fusiform posterior circulation aneurysms. An average of two flow diverters was placed for each patient. Adjunctive coiling was used in three cases. Follow-up at an average of 14.5 months showed complete angiographic occlusion in 4 (57.1%) cases, including one patient with in-stent thrombosis and major brainstem stroke at 4.5 months, a week after self-discontinuing dual antiplatelet therapy. Two other patients developed small periprocedural strokes but had excellent recovery. One death occurred 18 months after the initial procedure. No aneurysm rupture or parenchymal hemorrhage was seen. Overall, 5 (71%) cases, all with saccular aneurysms, had good clinical outcome (modified Rankin score (mRS) 0-1). Fusiform basilar aneurysms had markedly worse outcomes (mRS 5 and 6). Our literature review yielded six other studies with 100 additional patients. Overall, good outcome was seen in 74.3%, with a 12.3% average mortality and 11% permanent neurologic deficit rate. Complete occlusion varied from 43% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS Flow diversion may be a possible treatment in carefully selected patients with high-risk atypical posterior circulation aneurysms, with poor natural history and no optimal treatment strategy. Symptomatic and fusiform large aneurysms appear to carry the highest risk. Further studies are necessary to assess the role of flow diversion in the posterior circulation.","Toth, Gabor; Bain, Mark; Hussain, M Shazam; Moskowitz, Shaye; Masaryk, Thomas; Rasmussen, Peter; Hui, Ferdinand",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,310,1

Classical approaches to study this problem have focused in infected humans, mainly at hospitals. Nevertheless, antibiotic resistance can expand through different ecosystems and geographical allocations, hence constituting a One-Health, Global-Health problem, requiring specific integrative analytic tools. Antibiotic resistance evolution and transmission are multilayer, hierarchically organized processes with several elements (from genes to the whole microbiome) involved. However, their study has been traditionally gene-centric, each element independently studied. The development of robust-economically affordable whole genome sequencing approaches, as well as other -omic techniques as transcriptomics and proteomics, is changing this panorama. These technologies allow the description of a system, either a cell or a microbiome as a whole, overcoming the problems associated with gene-centric approaches. We are currently at the time of combining the information derived from -omic studies to have a more holistic view of the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance. This synthesis process requires the accurate integration of -omic information into computational models that serve to analyse the causes and the consequences of acquiring AR, fed by curated databases capable of identifying the elements involved in the acquisition of resistance. In this review, we analyse the capacities and drawbacks of the tools that are currently in use for the global analysis of AR, aiming to identify the more useful targets for effective corrective interventions.","Gil-Gil, Teresa; Ochoa-Sánchez, Luz Edith; Baquero, Fernando; Martínez, José Luis",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,310,1

Previous studies reported that, comparing with IFN-α, IFN-λ exhibited stronger induction of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) at the transcriptional level in intestinal epithelia cells and stronger inhibition of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In this study, the different mechanisms of ISGs upregulation induced by IFN-α and IFN-λ1 were compared at the mRNA and protein levels in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell model (IPEC-J2). It was proved that IFN-λ1 consistently exhibited stronger stimulation effects at both levels. At the mRNA level, 132 genes were significantly upregulated upon IFN-λ1 stimulation, while 42 genes upon IFN-α stimulation. At the protein level, 47 proteins were significantly upregulated upon IFN-λ1 stimulation, but only 8 proteins were upregulated upon IFN-α stimulation. The shared upregulated genes/proteins by IFN-λ1 in both transcriptional and translational omics, especially the regulation factors of ISG15, were involved in the Jak-STAT signaling pathway. Comparing to IFN-α, IFN-λ1 could induce more consistent up-regulation of the key ISGs (ISG15, USP18, OASL, and RSAD2) post induction from 3 h to 24 h by RT-qPCR validation. It was further confirmed that ISG15 and RSAD2 could inhibit PEDV infection in dose-dependent manners through functional analysis. This study provided the solid evidence that IFN-λ1 could induce more unique and higher ISGs expression level, which exhibited anti-PEDV effects in porcine intestinal epithelial cell.","Zhao, Mingzhi; Li, Liang; Zhai, Linhui; Yue, Qi; Liu, Hongyu; Ren, Suping; Jiang, Xingwei; Gao, Fenghua; Bai, Shanshan; Li, Honghao; Zhang, Ying; Xu, Hongwei; Zhang, Liying; Liu, Pinghuang; Tan, Minjia; Yu, Qun",Journal of proteome research,310,17

In this context, ECMO can be used as a bridging procedure to recovery, VAD or transplantation. While being supported by ECMO, most centers tend to keep their patients well sedated and supported by invasive ventilation. This may be associated with an increased risk of therapy-related morbidity and mortality. In order to optimize clinical management in pediatric patients with ECMO therapy, we report our strategy of veno-arterial ECMO (VA-ECMO) in extubated awake and conscious patients. We therefore present data of six of our patients with CS, who were treated by ECMO being awake without continuous analgosedation and invasive ventilation. Of these six patients, four were <1 year and two >14 years of age. Median time on ECMO was 17.4 days (range 6.9-94.2 days). Median time extubated, while receiving ECMO support was 9.5 days. Mean time extubated was 78 % of the total time on ECMO. Three patients reached full recovery of cardiac function on ""Awake-VA-ECMO,"" whereas the other three were successfully bridged to destination therapy (VAD, heart transplantation, withdrawal). Four out of our six patients are still alive. Complications related to ECMO therapy (i.e., severe bleeding, site infection or dislocation of cannulas) were not observed. We conclude that ""Awake-VA-ECMO"" in extubated, spontaneously breathing conscious pediatric patients is feasible and safe for the treatment of acute CS and can be used as a ""bridging therapy"" to recovery, VAD implantation or transplantation.","Schmidt, F; Jack, T; Sasse, M; Kaussen, T; Bertram, H; Horke, A; Seidemann, K; Beerbaum, P; Koeditz, H",Pediatric cardiology,310,32

We report the effect of intravenous alteplase on long-term survival after ischaemic stroke of participants in the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3). METHODS In IST-3, done at 156 hospitals in 12 countries (Australia, Europe, and the UK), participants (aged >18 years) were randomly assigned with a telephone voice-activated or web-based system in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with intravenous 0·9 mg/kg alteplase plus standard care or standard care alone within 6 h of ischaemic stroke. We followed up participants in the UK and Scandinavia (Sweden and Norway) for survival up to 3 years after randomisation using data from national registries and compared survival in the two groups with proportional hazards survival analysis, adjusting for key prognostic variables. IST-3 is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN25765518. FINDINGS Between May 5, 2000, and July 27, 2011, 3035 participants were enrolled in IST-3. Of these, 1948 (64%) of 3035 participants were scheduled for analysis of 3 year survival, and 1946 (>99%) of these were included in the analysis (967 [50%] in the alteplase plus standard care group and 979 [50%] in the standard care alone group). By 3 years after randomisation, 453 (47%) of 967 participants in the alteplase plus standard care group and 494 (50%) of 979 in the standard care alone group had died (risk difference 3·6% [95% CI -0·8 to 8·1]). Participants allocated to alteplase had a significantly higher hazard of death during the first 7 days (99 [10%] of 967 died in the alteplase plus standard care group vs 65 [7%] of 979 in the standard care alone group; hazard ratio 1·52 [95% CI 1·11-2·08]; p=0·004) and a significantly lower hazard of death between 8 days and 3 years (354 [41%] of 868 vs 429 [47%] of 914; 0·78 [0·68-0·90]; p=0·007). INTERPRETATION Alteplase treatment within 6 h after ischaemic stroke was associated with a small, non-significant reduction in risk of death at 3 years, but among individuals who survived the acute phase, treatment was associated with a significant increase in long-term survival. These results are reassuring for clinicians who have expressed concerns about the effect of alteplase on survival.

Clinicians are afforded substantial deference in prescribing practices and other treatments falling within the realm of the actual practice of medicine, including prescribing for off-label indications. Yet clinicians are not necessarily free to promote a medication for the same off-label indication they may have just prescribed for a patient. While trends in jurisprudence appear to be favoring clinicians' freedom to promote prescription medication for any use, in a majority of jurisdictions, the U.S. government can still bring considerable weight to bear on clinicians promoting off-label uses of prescription medications. We review the relevant laws and regulations pertaining to off-label prescription and promotion, as well as the possible legal consequences. The regulations pertaining to physician and pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding off-label drug use are complex. Suggestions are provided to help physicians better navigate the medical-legal landscape when prescribing or promoting medications for off-label use.

In particular, survivors of critical illness have significantly elevated risk of developing lasting cognitive impairment and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we examine the role of endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids in neuropsychiatric outcomes following critical illness. Illness is marked by acute elevation of free cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) suppression, which typically normalize after recovery; however, prolonged dysregulation can sometimes occur. High glucocorticoid levels can cause lasting alterations to the plasticity and structural integrity of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and this mechanism may plausibly contribute to impaired memory and cognition in critical illness survivors, though specific evidence is lacking. Glucocorticoids may also exacerbate inflammation-associated neural damage. Conversely, current evidence indicates that glucocorticoids during illness may protect against the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We propose future directions for research in this field, including determining the role of persistent glucocorticoid elevations after illness in neuropsychiatric outcomes, the role of systemic vs. neuroinflammation, and probing unexplored lines of investigation on the role of mineralocorticoid receptors and the gut-brain axis. Progress toward personalized medicine in this area has the potential to produce tangible improvements to the lives patients after a critical illness, including Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Hill, Alice R; Spencer-Segal, Joanna L",Endocrinology,310,1

METHODS We conducted a quality-improvement initiative from May 28-June 25, 2020, during the first 4 weeks of universal SARS-CoV-2 testing in the Barnes-Jewish Hospital labor and delivery unit. All consecutive patients presenting for delivery without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) symptoms were offered testing over four 1-week phases. Phase I documented the rate of testing uptake. Phase II recorded patients' reasons for declining testing. Phase III used phase II findings to create and implement shared decision-making tools. Phase IV offered each patient who declined nasopharyngeal testing an oropharyngeal alternative. The primary outcome was rate of SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake by phase. RESULTS Of 270 patients, 223 (83%) accepted testing and 47 (17%) declined. Maternal age and mode of delivery were similar between groups, whereas testing uptake was higher among nulliparous, White, Hispanic, or privately insured patients. There was a significant increase in the primary outcome of SARS-CoV-2 testing across phases I-IV, from 68% to 76% to 94% to 95%, respectively (Somers' D 0.45; 95% CI of association 0.30-0.59). The most commonly cited reason for declining testing was concern regarding testing discomfort. In subgroup analyses by race and insurance type, there was a significant increase in testing uptake across phases I-IV for Black patients (56%, 54%, 91%, 92%; Somers' D 0.36; 95% CI of association 0.28-0.64), White patients (76%, 93%, 96%, 100%; Somers' D 0.59; 95% CI of association 0.38-0.8), those with Medicaid insurance (60%, 64%, 88%, 92%; 95%; Somers' D 0.39; CI of association 0.22 to 0.56), and those with private insurance (77%, 96%, 97%, 100%; Somers' D 0.63; 95% CI of association 0.40-0.86). CONCLUSION Universal SARS-CoV-2 testing uptake significantly increased through a rapid-cycle improvement initiative.

Studies demonstrate its use to be an independent risk factor for postoperative wound infection. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is the most common bacteria found in postoperative mesh infection. No reports are available on the sequelae of surgical energy use for open ventral hernia repair (oVHR) with mesh. We hypothesized that increasing amounts of surgical energy will result in higher infectious burden after oVHR with composite multifilament polyester mesh (Parietex™ PCO). METHODS New Zealand rabbits underwent bridging oVHR with Parietex™ PCO and were divided into three surgical treatment groups: (1) scalpel alone, (2) 120 J of energy, and (3) 600 J of energy. The bioprosthesis was then inoculated with 105 colony-forming units of MRSA. Rabbits were survived for 7 days with daily physical examination. Complete blood count, basci metabolic panel, and blood cultures were performed on postoperative days one, four, and seven. Surviving rabbits were killed, and meshes explanted for MRSA colony counts. RESULTS Rabbits receiving the most surgical energy developed signs and symptoms of severe sepsis and wound necrosis within 24 h. In comparison, rabbits receiving no surgical energy had significantly less MRSA recovered from explanted mesh, significantly less bacteremia, and fewer adhesions. CONCLUSIONS Increased use of surgical energy promoted greater colonization, exaggerated septic response to bacterial contamination, and more severe adhesions. In the absence of devitalized tissue, rabbits can effectively limit bacterial contamination. These findings support the surgical principles of proper tissue handling and highlight the detrimental effects of indiscriminant surgical energy usage, thus emphasizing the importance of programs such as Fundamental Use of Surgical Energy.","Fernandez-Moure, Joseph S; Van Eps, Jeffrey L; Peress, Lilia; Cantu, Concepcion; Olsen, Randall J; Jenkins, Leslie; Cabrera, Fernando J; Tasciotti, Ennio; Weiner, Bradley K; Dunkin, Brian J",Surgical endoscopy,310,1

Methods: The study subjects were derived from the follow-up cohort of chronic hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis who received antiviral therapy in the Department of Infectious Diseases of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University from February 2004 to September 2019. LC patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. The life-table method was used to calculate the incidence of liver cancer. Multivariable Cox regression model was used to analyze the risk factors that may affect the development of liver cancer in patients with LC. A subgroup analysis was conducted in liver cirrhotic patients who developed liver cancer to evaluate the effectiveness of antiviral treatment compliance. The (2) test was used for rate comparison. Results: The median follow-up time of 198 LC cases treated with NAs was 6.0 years (1.0-15.3 years). By the end of the visit: (1) 16.2% (32/198) of LC patients had developed liver cancer, and the cumulative incidence of liver cancer in 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 years were 0, 8.9%, 14.3%, 18.6%, and 23.4%, respectively, with an average annual incidence of 3.1%. Among the 32 cases with liver cancer, 68.7% had developed small liver cancer (22/32). (2) Univariate Cox model analysis showed that the development of liver cancer was related to four factors, i.e., the presence or absence of LC nodules, whether the baseline was first-line medication, the family history of liver cancer, and patient compliance. The results of multivariate Cox model analysis showed that poor patient compliance and baseline non-first-line medication were risk factors for liver cancer. (3) The results of log-rank test subgroup analysis showed that the 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with hardened nodules was significantly higher than that of patients without hardened nodules (21.7% vs. 11.5%, P = 0.029). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with non-first-line drugs was significantly higher than that of patients with first-line drugs (22.0% vs.8.2%, P = 0.003). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with poor compliance was significantly higher than that of patients with good compliance (21.3% vs. 12.7%, P = 0.014). The 5-year cumulative incidence of liver cancer in patients with a family history of liver cancer was significantly higher than that of patients without a family history of liver cancer (22.3% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.006). (4) Compared with patients with poor compliance, patients with good compliance had higher HBV DNA negative serconversion rate (98.7% vs. 87.8%, P = 0.005), and a lower virological breakthrough rate (12.1% vs. 29.3%, P = 0.007). Conclusion: The long-term NAs antiviral therapy can reduce the risk of liver cancer, but it cannot completely prevent the development of liver cancer, especially in patients with a family history of liver cancer and baseline hardened nodules (high risk of liver cancer). Furthermore, the complete management can improve patient compliance, ensure the efficacy of antiviral therapy, and reduce the risk of liver cancer development, so to achieve secondary prevention of liver cancer, i.e., early detection, diagnosis and treatment.","Zang, W W; Su, M H; Ling, X Z; Wang, R M; Cao, B C; Wu, Y L; Deng, D L; Wei, H L; Liang, X S; Jiang, J N",Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,310,31

CD4+ T helper 17 (Th17) cells, characterized by IL-17 production, play important roles in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, among others) and in the host response to infection and cancer. Here, we demonstrate that human CD4+ T cells cells exposed to a Th17-differentiating milieu are significantly more resistant to immune suppression by CD8+ T cells compared to control Th0 cells. This resistance is mediated, in part, through the action of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17AF heterodimer through their receptors (IL-17RA and IL-17RC) on CD4+ T cells themselves, but not through their action on CD8+ T cells or APC. We further show that IL-17 can directly act on non-Th17 effector CD4+ T cells to induce suppressive resistance, and this resistance can be reversed by blockade of IL-1β, IL-6, or STAT3. These studies reveal a role for IL-17 cytokines in mediating CD4-intrinsic immune resistance. The pathways induced in this process may serve as a critical target for future investigation and immunotherapeutic intervention.","Crawford, Michael P; Sinha, Sushmita; Renavikar, Pranav S; Borcherding, Nicholas; Karandikar, Nitin J",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,310,27

In addition to StO2, broadband NIRS devices (using hundreds of wavelengths of light) may be able to measure the oxidation state of mitochondrial cytochrome aa3 (Cytox) which reflects the subcellular energetic state. We hypothesize that broadband NIRS devices can measure Cytox independent of changes in hemoglobin saturation. METHODS In this prospective non-randomized study, 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats (300 g) were anesthetized with isoflurane, tracheally intubated, and ventilated with 100% O2 containing 2% isoflurane. They were subsequently instrumented with a broadband NIRS device that used a halogen light source coupled to an emitting fibreoptic cable. Three receiving fibreoptic cables were utilized; one analyzed the light source and the other two were directed at the base of the skull. Each receiving fibre was connected to a spectrometer to measure light intensity. Sodium cyanide (NaCN) 5 mg·kg-1 iv was injected in order to produce cytochrome aa3 reduction. Two to three minutes after injection, oxygen was eliminated and 100% nitrogen (i.e., anoxia) was used for ventilation in order to induce a reduction in both cytochrome aa3 and hemoglobin desaturation. Changes in the cytochrome oxidation state and hemoglobin oxygenation were calculated using a broadband algorithm and compared before and after both the NaCN and anoxia interventions. RESULTS The NaCN injection resulted in a decrease in median [interquartile range (IQR)] deoxyhemoglobin (-0.014 [-0.29 to -0.005] arbitrary units [AU]; P < 0.001), an increase in oxyhemoglobin (0.013 [-0.011 to 0.031] AU; P < 0.001), and a reduction in cytochrome aa3 (-0.015 [-0.020 to -0.011] AU; P < 0.001). Anoxia resulted in an increase in median [IQR] deoxyhemoglobin (0.13 [0.11 to 0.18] AU; P < 0.001), a decrease in oxyhemoglobin (-0.17 [-0.22 to -0.15] AU; P < 0.001), and a reduction in cytochrome aa3 (-0.04 [-0.06 to -0.03] AU; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION Broadband NIRS can effectively measure the directionality of changes in both Cytox and StO2 by uncoupling the cytochrome and hemoglobin signals through inhibition of the electron transport chain and anoxia.","Thiele, Robert H; Ikeda, Keita; Wang, Yunzhen; Bartz, Raquel R; Zuo, Zhiyi",Canadian journal of anaesthesia = Journal canadien d'anesthesie,310,1

In addition, the efficacy of a copper surface for inactivation of human norovirus (HuNoV) GII.4 Sydney and GI.3B Potsdam strains was evaluated by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay. Results of time-dependent inactivation of viruses on copper, bronze, and brass coupons revealed that 15 min of surface treatments of each of the copper and copper alloys achieved >4-log reduction of purified TV, as assessed by plaque assay, while up to 20 min of copper alloy surface treatments only achieved ∼2-log reduction, as assessed by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay. As assessed by PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay, 10 min of copper surface treatments achieved reductions of 3 and 4 log units for HuNoVs GII.4 Sydney and GI.3B Potsdam, respectively. Results from this study suggest that even though PGM-MB-RT-qPCR assay underestimated the efficacy of copper alloy surface inactivation of TV, copper alloy surfaces were able to effectively inactivate TV and HuNoVs. Therefore, copper alloys can be used as a preventive measure to prevent HuNoV infection and are an effective surface treatment for HuNoVs.

Less is known about the outcomes following robotic-assisted splenectomy (RS) for this indication. Our aim was to describe outcomes of RS to LS in pediatric patients with hematologic disorders in our institution. METHODS A single institution retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients undergoing LS vs. RS from 2014 to 2019. Patient demographics, diagnosis, spleen size, hospital length of stay (LOS), operative time, post-operative opioid use, and hospital charges were evaluated. Standard univariate analyses were performed. RESULTS Twenty-four patients were included in the study (14 LS, 10 RS). The mean spleen size at the time of surgery was larger in the RS group compared to LS (14.5 cm vs. 12.2 cm, p = 0.03). Operative time between the two cohorts was comparable (RS 140.5 vs LS 154.9 min). Median LOS for RS was shorter than LS (2.1 vs. 3.2 days, p = 0.02). Cumulative postoperative opioid analgesic requirements were not significantly different between the groups (17.4 mg vs. 30.5 mg). The median hospital charges, including the surgical procedure and hospital stay were higher in the RS group ($44,724 RS vs $30,255 LS, p = 0.01). CONCLUSION Robotic splenectomy is a safe and feasible option for pediatric patients with hematologic disorders, and was associated with decreased LOS but higher charges compared to laparoscopic splenectomy. Further studies are required to delineate the optimal use and potential benefits of robot-assisted surgical techniques in children.

In this investigation, a functionalization post-synthesis method was used to assess the ability of an adapted SBA-15 surface as a sorbent to load the drug from an aqueous medium. Different characterization approaches were used to determine the characterization of the substance before and after functionalization such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nitrogen adsorption-desorption porosimetry (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) BET surface area analysis, and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). Batch adsorption testing was carried out in a single adsorption device to find the impact of multiple variables on the drug amoxicillin charge output. The following parameters were studied: 0-72 hr. contact time, 20-120 mg/l initial concentration, and 20-250 mg of NH2-SBA-15 dose. The outcomes from such experiments revealed the strong influence and behavior of the amino-functional group to increase the drug's load. Drug delivery outcomes studies found that amoxicillin loading was directly related to NH2-SBA-15 contact time and dose, but indirectly related to primary concentration. It was observed that 80% of amoxicillin was loaded while the best release test results were 1 hour and 51%.","Alazzawi, Haneen F; Salih, Issam K; Albayati, Talib M",Drug delivery,310,1

The CV/D-S showed high stability, acid-responsive drug release, high biocompatibility with tumor-specific cellular uptake, and target-ability that preferably resulted in the in vitro and in vivo anticancer performance. Most importantly, the Dox in the DDS can induce significant ICD while Sfn was able to remodel the TME, downregulate Treg, activate effector T cells and relieve programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression.

To bridge this gap, we investigated how the body temperatures of active amphibians varied along an elevation gradient in the Arun and Tamor River catchments in eastern Nepal Himalaya in the present study. Amphibian assemblages were sampled from May to July in both 2014 and 2015 using nocturnal time-constrained visual encounter surveys, and the body temperature of each individual was directly measured using a digital infrared thermometer in the field. A combination of linear regression and hierarchical partitioning analyses was used to determine the effects of elevation and environmental variables on the body temperatures of active amphibians. In total, the body temperatures of 599 amphibian individuals belonging to 28 species from six families were recorded. Our results indicated that amphibian body temperature exhibited monotonically declining trends with increasing elevations in eastern Nepal Himalaya. Interestingly, this tread was much more pronounced in subtropical (lowland) areas than in warm and cool temperate regions. Inter- and intraspecies variations in body temperature were large, which can be attributed to distinct habitat utilization among species and the change in vegetation cover in different bioclimatic zones. Among all environmental variables, substrate temperature and water temperature were the best predictors of the amphibian body temperature. Overall, this study revealed amphibian body temperature patterns along an elevation gradient in eastern Nepal Himalaya, which were principally driven by temperature-related environmental factors. We believe our results can provide important information on amphibian physiological traits, which may help ecologists predict their responses to future climate change and formulate protection strategies.","Khatiwada, Janak R; Zhao, Tian; Jiang, Jianping",Journal of thermal biology,310,1

This may be because corticosteroids are ineffective in relieving the sarcoidosis patient's symptoms/dysfunction or because the clinician has determined that the risks of corticosteroids outweigh their benefits. Interestingly, when corticosteroids truly fail to improve a sarcoidosis patient's condition, it is very rarely because of failure of the drug as an anti-granulomatous agent; rather, it is usually because the patient's symptoms were unrelated to active sarcoid granulomas. In this manuscript, we review the causes of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis. The clinician should consider these causes when confronted with a sarcoidosis patient who is either not responding to corticosteroids, developing corticosteroid side-effects, or is at significant risk of developing such side-effects. We believe that determining the cause of corticosteroid refractory sarcoidosis may aid the clinicians in optimizing the care of sarcoidosis patients and clinical researchers in appropriately stratifying patients for clinical trials.","Goldman, Chananya; Judson, Marc A",Respiratory medicine,310,28

We searched six electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science) for articles reporting multimorbidity profiles. The identified profiles were synthesised with multidimensional scaling, stratified by type of statistical analysis used in the derivation of profiles. The 51 studies that met inclusion criteria reported results of 98 separate analyses of multimorbidity profiling, with a total of 407 multimorbidity profiles identified. The statistical techniques used to identify multimorbidity profiles were exploratory factor analysis, cluster analysis of diseases, cluster analysis of people, and latent class analysis. Reporting of methodological details of statistical methods was often incomplete. The discernible groupings of multimorbidity took the form of both discrete categories and continuous dimensions. Mental health conditions and cardio-metabolic conditions grouped along identifiable continua in the synthesised results of all four methods. Discrete groupings of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with asthma, falls and fractures with sensory deficits and of Parkinson's disease and cognitive decline where partially replicable (identifiable in the results of more than one method), while clustering of musculoskeletal conditions and clustering of reproductive systems were each observed only in one statistical approach. The two most replicable multimorbidity profiles were mental health conditions and cardio-metabolic conditions. Further studies are needed to understand aetiology and evolution of these multimorbidity groupings. Guidelines for strengthening the reporting of multimorbidity profiling studies are proposed.","Busija, Ljoudmila; Lim, Karen; Szoeke, Cassandra; Sanders, Kerrie M; McCabe, Marita P",European journal of epidemiology,310,1

Bile acids are active factors in intestines and influence the replication of enteric viruses. Currently, the role of bile acids on PDCoV replication is unknown. In this study, we tested the effects of different types of bile acids on the replication of PDCoV in cell culture. We found that physiological concentrations of bile acids chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) had antiviral activity against PDCoV in porcine kidney cell line (LLC-PK1) and porcine small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). In IPEC-J2 cells, CDCA and LCA inhibited PDCoV replication at post-entry stages by inducing the production of interferon (IFN)-λ3 and IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) via G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). In summary, bile acids CDCA and LCA restricted PDCoV infection and LCA functioned through a GPCR-IFN-λ3-ISG15 signaling axis in IPEC-J2 cells. Our results may open new avenues for the development of antiviral drugs to treat PDCoV infection in pigs.","Kong, Fanzhi; Niu, Xiaoyu; Liu, Mingde; Wang, Qiuhong",Veterinary microbiology,310,1

This study reviewed the efficacy of physiotherapist-led physical activity (PLPA) interventions at improving PA levels. DATA SOURCES Twelve databases were searched using terms related to both physiotherapy and PA. English-language studies of all designs in adults were included. Meta-analyses were conducted separately for interventions measuring the following: (1) participants meeting recommended PA levels; (2) total PA at short- and long-term follow-up; and (3) total PA achieved after short and long PLPA interventions. Pooled effects were calculated using a fixed-effects model as standardized mean differences (SMDs). Nonstatistical analysis was used to identify the effect of PLPA interventions on the volume of PA performed at different intensities. MAIN RESULTS From an initial 4140 studies, 8 were retained, and risk of bias ranged from low to high. Meta-analysis showed the odds of adults meeting minimum recommended PA levels were doubled in groups provided a PLPA intervention [OR = 2.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.35-3.43]. Total PA levels were increased in the short term (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI = 0.03-0.27) but not in the long term. Longer term interventions did not improve outcomes. Nonstatistical analysis identified that PLPA interventions were efficacious at increasing the amount of PA adults performed at all intensities. CONCLUSIONS Clinic-based PLPA interventions delivered in private practice, primary care, and outpatient settings were efficacious at increasing PA in adults at risk of NCDs. Improvements did not last long term and were not enhanced with longer interventions.","Kunstler, Breanne E; Cook, Jill L; Freene, Nicole; Finch, Caroline F; Kemp, Joanne L; OʼHalloran, Paul D; Gaida, James E",Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine,310,1

Bats, in black and white.",13.622051,4.3009744,2010,"OBJECTIVE To investigate the relationship between the changes of inflammatory cytokine levels and prognosis of patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). METHODS A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical date of critical COVID-19 patients undergoing IMV who were hospitalized in Wuhan Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from February 4th to March 25th in 2020 were collected. At the same time, the inflammatory cytokine levels including interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) at 48 hours before IMV and 48 hours after IMV of all the patients, as well as the 48 hours after weaning or right before death were recorded. Multivariate unconditional Logistic regression analysis was used to screen the independent risk factors of death during hospitalization. RESULTS Among the 43 patients, 13 patients improved and 30 died. Compared with the survival group, the patients in the non-survival group were older (years old: 67.6±7.3 vs. 58.5±11.9, P < 0.05), with higher rates of hypertension, diabetes and coronary heart disease (53.3% vs. 15.4%, 63.3% vs. 23.1%, 26.7% vs. 0%, all P < 0.05), and the time from onset to admission to hospital, admission to ICU and IMV were longer (days: it was 9.17±5.00 vs. 5.07±2.49, 17.10±7.11 vs. 12.23±5.05, and 17.90±7.46 vs. 12.61±5.60, respectively, all P < 0.05). The IL-6 and TNF-α levels on 48 hours after IMV in the non-survival patients increased significantly as compared with those before 48 hours and the surviving patients. Especially, the IL-6 levels increased significantly as compared with those at 48 hours after IMV and 48 hours after weaning in the surviving patients [ng/L: 800.00 (194.25, 2 000.00) vs. 22.03 (6.66, 28.21), 3 204.00 (1 264.88, 5 000.00) vs. 5.00 (3.98, 12.27), both P < 0.01]. The IL-10 level before death in the non-survival patients increased significantly as compared with that at 48 hours after weaning in the surviving patients [ng/L: 55.89 (26.07, 100.14) vs. 3.53 (2.76, 12.36), P < 0.05]. There were no significant differences in the levels of IL-2 and IL-4 between the two groups at every time point. The variables of age, basic diseases, the IL-6 level after IMV were included in the multivariate unconditional Logistic regression analysis, which showed that age [odds ratio (OR) = 0.821, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 0.695-0.968], hypertension (OR = 0.027, 95%CI was 0.002-0.378), diabetes mellitus (OR = 0.054, 95%CI was 0.005-0.611), coronary heart disease (OR = 0.042, 95%CI was 0.002-0.968) and the IL-6 level after IMV (OR = 0.902, 95%CI was 0.819-0.994) were independent risk factors for death during hospitalization in patients with critical COVID-19 undergoing IMV (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS The levels of inflammatory cytokine including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α increased significantly with aggravation in critical COVID-19 patients undergoing IMV, especially IL-6. IL-6 was an independent risk factor for death of critical COVID-19 patients undergoing IMV.","Shan, Hongwei; Lyu, Zheng; Xiao, Yan; Li, Chunyang; Wang, Jian; He, Liping; Chen, Fengying",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,310,4

Some patients with inoperable disease have small-volume lung metastases that are amenable to thermal ablation. We report our results after radiofrequency ablation (RFA). METHODS This is a retrospective study of patients treated from 2007 to 2012 in whom the intention was to treat all sites of disease and who had a minimum CT follow-up of 4 months. Treatment was performed under general anesthesia/conscious sedation using cool-tip RFA. Follow-up CT scans were analyzed for local control. Primary tumor type, location, grade, disease-free interval, prior resection/chemotherapy, number and size of lung tumors, uni- or bilateral disease, complications, and overall and progression-free survival were recorded. RESULTS Twenty-two patients [15 women; median age 48 (range 10-78) years] with 55 lung metastases were treated in 30 sessions. Mean and median tumor size and initial number were 0.9 cm and 0.7 (range 0.5-2) cm, and 2.5 and 1 (1-7) respectively. Median CT and clinical follow-up were 12 (4-54) and 20 (8-63) months, respectively. Primary local control rate was 52 of 55 (95 %). There were 2 of 30 (6.6 %) Common Terminology Criteria grade 3 complications with no long-term sequelae. Mean (median not reached) and 2- and 3-year overall survival were 51 months, and 94 and 85 %. Median and 1- and 2-year progression-free survival were 12 months, and 53 and 23 %. Prior disease-free interval was the only significant factor to affect overall survival. CONCLUSION RFA is a safe and effective treatment for patients with small-volume sarcoma metastases.","Koelblinger, Claus; Strauss, Sandra; Gillams, Alice",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,310,31

Overall, the trend of total consumption (defined daily dose [DDD] per 1,000 patient-days) of glycopeptides, including vancomycin and teicoplanin, significantly increased during 2000 to 2003 and remained stable during 2004-2009. Vancomycin consumption significantly increased during 2003 and decreased after 2004. A significant decrease in the resistance rate with time was found for oxacillin- and gentamicin-resistant S. aureus. In contrast, the rates of vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterocci increased significantly. A significant correlation was found between the increased use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems and the decreased prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In contrast, the increased use of teicoplanin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, and carbapenems was correlated with the increased prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). In conclusion, this 10-year study in a single institution identified different correlations between the prescription of antibiotics and the resistance rates of MRSA and VRE. Strict implementation of infection control policy based on these correlates would be helpful in decreasing the presence of these multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.","Lai, C C; Wang, C Y; Chu, C C; Tan, C K; Lu, C L; Lee, Y L; Huang, Y T; Lee, P I; Hsueh, P R",European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,310,1

However, postponement of transplants may cause diseases to get worse and increase the number in wait lists. We believe that, with precautions, transplant does not pose a risk during pandemic. Here, we aimed to evaluate our transplant results, which we safely performed during a 6-month pandemic period. MATERIALS AND METHODS Until September 2020, 3140 kidney and 667 liver transplants have been performed in our centers. We evaluated 38 kidney transplants and 9 liver transplants procedures performed during the pandemic (March 1 to September 2, 2020). Recipient and donor candidates were screened for COVID-19 with polymerase chain reaction and thoracic computed tomography. All recipients had routine immunosuppressive protocol. During hospitalization at our COVID-19-free transplant facility, we restricted the interactions during multidisciplinary rounds. RESULTS During the pandemic, 38 kidney transplants with an average length of hospital stay of 8.1 days were performed. Mean serum creatinine values of recipients were 0.91, 0.86, and 0.74 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. During the pandemic, 9 living donor liver transplants (1 adult, 8 pediatric) were performed with an average length of hospital stay of 17.1 days. Mean serum total bilirubin levels were 0.9, 0.5, and 0.4 mg/dL on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. Mean serum aspartate aminotransferase levels were 38.1, 28.3, and 22.3 U/L on postoperative days 7, 30, and 90, respectively. All recipients and donors were successfully discharged. Only 1 liver recipient died (on day 55 after discharge as a result of oxalosis-induced heart failure). CONCLUSIONS According to our results, when precautions are taken, transplant does not pose a risk to patients during the pandemic period. We attribute the safety and success shown to our newly developed protocol in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Akdur, Aydincan; Karakaya, Emre; Ayvazoglu Soy, Ebru H; Yarbug Karakayali, Feza; Yildirim, Sedat; Torgay, Adnan; Sayin, Cihat Burak; Coskun, Mehmet; Moray, Gokhan; Haberal, Mehmet",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation,310,1

However, the molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 haven't been fully elucidated, making the identification of novel strategies for targeted therapy challenging. This study aimed to systematically identify the molecular mechanisms and high-frequency core traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) targeting PF secondary to COVID-19 through network pharmacology and data mining. METHODS The molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 were identified by mapping the COVID-19 differentially expressed gene and known targets associated with PF, protein-protein interactions network analysis, and enrichment pathway analysis; then the high-frequency core TCM targeting PF secondary to COVID-19 were identified by data mining and ""Key targets related to PF secondary to COVID-19 - Ingredients"" and ""Key ingredients-key herbs"" network analysis; and last we validated the interaction between the key ingredients and key targets by molecular docking. RESULTS The molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19 were mainly related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. Among these, cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6), TNF, and IL-1β were identified as the key targets associated with PF secondary to COVID-19. The high-frequency core TCM targeting these key targets were identified, including ingredients of quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, emodin, triptolide, resveratrol, and herb of Polygonum cuspidatum. Finally, our results were validated by quercetin and resveratrol both well docked to IL-6, TNF, and IL-1β protein, with the estimated docking energy <0 kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS This study identified the cytokines-related molecular mechanisms of PF secondary to COVID-19, and the high-frequency core TCM against PF by targeting IL-6, TNF, and IL-1β. Which provides new ideas for the discovery of small molecular compounds with potential therapeutic effects on PF secondary to COVID-19.","Yu, Mei-Xiang; Song, Xin; Ma, Xiao-Qin; Hao, Chen-Xia; Huang, Jing-Jing; Yang, Wan-Hua",Annals of palliative medicine,310,16

To address this issue, it is essential to determine levels of anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress, and sources of stress, and to identify subgroups of HCWs at a higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS We conducted a cross-sectional study of symptoms of mental illness in HCWs in the area surrounding Detroit, Michigan. The online survey included questions about demographics, health and clinical factors, and sources of stress. Several tools were used to assess psychiatric symptoms among HCWs, including the Perceived Stress Scale, the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item assessment, and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5. The adequacy of personal protective equipment, patient resources, and training for highly contagious diseases were rated. RESULTS The sample (N = 129) was predominantly female (51.2%) and White (65.9%), with 30.2% screening positive for clinical follow-up to assess anxiety, 20.9% for moderate to severe depression, and 16.3% for elevated traumatic stress. Differences were found by self-reported psychiatric diagnosis and chronic conditions, and role on treatment teams. CONCLUSIONS Frontline HCWs demonstrate high levels of stress and trauma symptoms.

We investigated whether halving antibiotic courses would reduce antibiotic-resistance genes (ARG) in the intestinal microbiomes of patients treated for gram-negative bacteraemia. METHODS This nested prospective cohort study included adult patients hospitalized at Geneva University Hospitals (Switzerland) participating in the PIRATE randomized trial assessing non-inferiority of shorter antibiotic courses (7 versus 14 days) for gram-negative bacteraemia ('cases') and, simultaneously, hospitalized patients with similar demography and comorbidity yet no antibiotic therapy ('controls'). Stool was collected from case and control patients on days 7, 14, 30 and 90 after antibiotic initiation (day 1) and days 7 and 14 after admission, respectively, and analysed by whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing. The primary outcome was ARG abundance at day 30; secondary outcomes included microbiota-species composition and clustering over time. FINDINGS Forty-five patients and 11 controls were included and evaluable; ARG analyses were conducted on the 29 per-protocol patients receiving 7 (±2) days or 14 (±3) days of antibiotic therapy. At day 30, ARGs were not detected at similar abundance in patients receiving 7 and 14 days (median counts/million [mCPM]: 96 versus [vs] 71; p=.38). By day 30, total ARG content between both groups was not significantly different from that of controls at D7 (362 and 370 mCPM vs 314 mCPM, p=.24 and 0.19). There were no significant differences amongst antibiotic-treated patients at any timepoint in bacterial diversity or clustering, but Shannon species diversity was significantly reduced compared to controls through day 14 (median 3.12 and 3.24 in the 7-day and 14-day groups vs 3.61 [controls]; p=.04 and 0.012). Patients treated for 14 days had reduced faecal phage content during and after therapy compared to other patient groups. INTERPRETATION Reducing antibiotic durations by half did not result in decreased abundance of ARGs in patients treated for gram-negative bacteraemia, nor did it improve microbiota species diversity.

No study has correlated MPD size and malignancy considering the anatomic site of the gland (head versus body-tail). Our aim was to analyze the significance of MPD in pancreatic head/body-tail as a predictor of malignancy in main-duct/mixed IPMNs. METHODS Retrospective analysis of resected patients between 2009-2018. Malignancy was defined as high-grade dysplasia and invasive carcinoma. MPD diameter was measured with magnetic resonance imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was utilized to identify optimal MPD cut-off for malignancy. Independent predictors of malignancy were searched. RESULTS Malignancy was detected in 74% of 312 identified patients. 213 patients (68.3%) had IPMNs of the pancreatic head and 99 (31.7%) of the body-tail. ROC analysis identified 9 and 7 mm as the optimal MPD cut-offs for malignancy in IPMNs of head and body-tail of the pancreas, respectively. Multivariate analysis confirmed that MPD ≥9 mm (pancreatic head), and ≥7 mm (body-tail) were independent predictors of malignancy along with macroscopic solid components, positive cytology and elevated CA 19-9. The risk of malignancy was low for IPMNs with MPD ≤8 mm (pancreatic head) or ≤6 mm (pancreatic body-tail) unless high-risk stigmata or multiple worrisome features were present. CONCLUSIONS Different thresholds of MPD dilation are associated with malignancy in IPMNs of the head and body-tail of the pancreas. The risk of malignancy for IPMNs with MPD ≤8 mm (pancreatic head) or ≤6 mm (pancreatic body-tail) lacking high-risk stigmata or multiple worrisome features is low.","Crippa, Stefano; Aleotti, Francesca; Longo, Enrico; Belfiori, Giulio; Partelli, Stefano; Tamburrino, Domenico; Di Salvo, Francesca; De Cobelli, Francesco; Romano, Luigi; Arcidiacono, Paolo Giorgio; Petrone, Maria Chiara; Zamboni, Giuseppe; Lena, Marco Schiavo; Doglioni, Claudio; Falconi, Massimo",Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,310,16

It is now becoming apparent that there is a pattern to these inconsistencies. A recent large trial has shown that high-dose intermittent bolus vitamin D therapy is ineffective at preventing rickets - the condition that is most unequivocally caused by vitamin D deficiency. There is a plausible biological explanation since high-dose bolus replacement induces long-term expression of the catabolic enzyme 24-hydroxylase and fibroblast growth factor 23, both of which have vitamin D inactivating effects. Meta-analyses of vitamin D supplementation in prevention of acute respiratory infection and trials in tuberculosis and other conditions also support efficacy of low dose daily maintenance rather than intermittent bolus dosing. This is particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic given the well-documented associations between COVID-19 risk and vitamin D deficiency. We would urge that clinicians take note of these findings and give strong support to widespread use of daily vitamin D supplementation.","Griffin, George; Hewison, Martin; Hopkin, Julian; Kenny, Rose Anne; Quinton, Richard; Rhodes, Jonathan; Subramanian, Sreedhar; Thickett, David",Clinical medicine,310,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed a retrospective review of transports of subjects with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 from sending hospitals to tertiary care hospitals in Boston. Follow-up data were obtained for patients transported between March 1st and April 20th, 2020. RESULTS Of 254 charts identified, 250 patients were transported. Nine patients (3.5%) had cardiac arrest prior to transport. Twenty-nine (11.6%) had hypotension, 22 (8.8%) had a critical desaturation, and 4 (1.6%) had both en route. Hospital follow-up data were available for 189 patients. Of those intubated during their hospitalization, 44 (25.0%) had died, 59 (33.5%) had been extubated, and 13 (17.6%) had been discharged alive.

In addition to well-known tandem duplication, duplication can occur such that a duplicated DNA fragment is inserted at another location in the genome. Here, we report several genomic regions in the human genome that could be best explained by two types of insertion-based duplication mechanisms, where a duplicated DNA fragment was modified structurally and then inserted into the genome. In one process, the DNA fragment is turned into an extrachromosomal circular DNA, cut somewhere in the circle, and reintegrated into another location in the genome. And in the other, the DNA fragment forms a ""lariat structure"" with a ""knot"", the strand is swapped at the knot, and is then reintegrated into the genome. Our results suggest that insertion-based duplication may not be a simple process; it may involve a complicated procedures such as structural modification before reintegration.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a counter-regulatory enzyme that converts angiotensin-2 to Ang-(1-7) form in the renin-angiotensin system. Several studies have been analyzed the correlation between ACE2 and COVID-19. Indeed, ACE2/Ang (1-7) system protects the lung against acute respiratory distress syndrome by its anti-inflammatory/anti-oxidant function. However, SARS-Cov-2 can use ACE2 for host cell entry. Expression of ACE2 can be altered by several factors, including hypertension, diabetes and obesity, which also could increase the severity of COVID-19 infection. Besides, since androgens increase the expression of ACE-2, males are at higher risks of COVID-19 infection. Although reported statistics showed a significantly different infection risks of COVID-19 between adults and children, the reason behind the different responses is still unclear. This review proposes the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of SARS-COV-2 induced pneumonia. The previous meta-analysis regarding the effect of ACE polymorphism on the severity of pneumonia showed that polymorphism only affects the adult's illness severity and not the children. Two recent meta-analyses examined the effect of ACE polymorphism on the prevalence and mortality rate of COVID-19 and reported contradicting results.

OBJECTIVE This study aims to understand the perspectives of leaders involved in implementing information exchange between VA and non-VA providers via a community HIE. METHODS We interviewed operational, clinical, and information technology leaders at one VA facility and its community HIE partner. Respondents discussed their experiences with VA-HIE, including barriers and facilitators to implementation, and the associated impact on health care providers. Transcribed interviews were coded and analyzed using immersion-crystallization methods. RESULTS VA and community HIE leaders found training to be a key factor when implementing VA-HIE and worked cooperatively to provide several styles and locations of training. During recruitment, a high-touch approach was successfully used to enroll patients and overcome their resistance to opting in. Discussion with leaders revealed the high levels of complexity navigated by VA providers and staff to send and retrieve information. Part of the complexity stemmed from the interconnected web of information systems and human teams necessary to implement VA-HIE information sharing.

It is unclear how certain species of mycobacteria transition from environmental bacteria to clinical pathogens, or what genetic elements influence the differences in virulence among strains of the same species. A potential mechanism of genetic evolution and diversity within mycobacteria is the presence of integrated viruses called prophages in the host genome. Prophages may act as carriers of bacterial genes, with the potential of altering bacterial fitness through horizontal gene transfer. In this study, we quantify the frequency and composition of prophages within mycobacteria isolated from clinical samples and compare them against the composition of PhagesDB, an environmental mycobacteriophage database. METHODS Prophages were predicted by agreement between two discovery tools, VirSorter and Phaster, and the frequencies of integrated prophages were compared by growth rate. Prophages were assigned to PhagesDB lettered clusters. Bacterial virulence gene frequency was calculated using a combination of the Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) and the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center virulence database (Patric-VF) within the gene annotation software Prokka. CRISPR elements were discovered using CRT. ARAGORN was used to quantify tRNAs. RESULTS Rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) were more likely to contain prophage than slowly growing mycobacteria (SGM). CRISPR elements were not associated with prophage abundance in mycobacteria. The abundance of tRNAs was enriched in SGM compared to RGM. We compared the abundance of bacterial virulence genes within prophage genomes from clinical isolates to mycobacteriophages from PhagesDB. Our data suggests that prophages from clinical mycobacteria are enriched for bacterial virulence genes relative to environmental mycobacteriophage from PhagesDB. CONCLUSION Prophages are present in clinical NTM isolates. Prophages are more likely to be present in RGM compared to SGM genomes. The mechanism and selective advantage of this enrichment by growth rate remain unclear. In addition, the frequency of bacterial virulence genes in prophages from clinical NTM is enriched relative to the PhagesDB environmental proxy. This suggests prophages may act as a reservoir of genetic elements bacteria could use to thrive within a clinical environment.","Glickman, Cody; Kammlade, Sara M; Hasan, Nabeeh A; Epperson, L Elaine; Davidson, Rebecca M; Strong, Michael",Virology journal,310,1

Conventional recordings with disc electrodes suffer from significant crosstalk from adjacent muscles and electrode-to-muscle fiber orientation problems, while concentric ring electrodes (CREs) offer enhanced spatial selectivity and axial isotropy. The aim of this work was to evaluate CRE performance in sEMG recordings of the swallowing muscles. Bipolar recordings were taken from 21 healthy young volunteers when swallowing saliva, water and yogurt, first with a conventional disc and then with a CRE. The signals were characterized by the root-mean-square amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, myopulse, zero-crossings, median frequency, bandwidth and bilateral muscle cross-correlations. The results showed that CREs have advantages in the sEMG analysis of swallowing muscles, including enhanced spatial selectivity and the associated reduction in crosstalk, the ability to pick up a wider range of EMG frequency components and easier electrode placement thanks to its radial symmetry. However, technical changes are recommended in the future to ensure that the lower CRE signal amplitude does not significantly affect its quality.

SPA surgery appears to be safe and feasible, but the exposure and handling of tissue may not be optimal. Therefore, the performance of SPA surgery with different instruments used and conventional laparoscopy is compared. METHODS Fifteen participants (>50 laparoscopic procedures) performed three basic tasks (translocation, clip & cut, and tissue dissection, based on the fundamentals of laparoscopic surgery) in the box trainer in laparoscopy and SPA settings with both (conventional) crossed and curved instruments. All participants completed a questionnaire, which asked their opinion on the use of instruments and preference. RESULTS Translocation was performed significantly faster in both laparoscopy and SPA crossed than SPA curved (means, 130.3 and 137.7 vs. 170.7 sec; p < 0.001 and p = 0.005). The errors also were less in laparoscopy and SPA crossed (means, 0.9 and 1.2 vs. 1.6), but not significant. The time to complete the dissection was almost equal between laparoscopy and SPA curved settings, but took longer for SPA crossed, although not significantly (148.1 and 150.8 vs. 179.5 sec). The errors only differed significantly between laparoscopy and SPA crossed (means, 0.5 vs. 1.27; p = 0.044). Fourteen participants still favored conventional laparoscopy and one SPA curved. They also thought SPA curved was better than crossed (means, 3.6 vs. 2.47; p = 0.003) and that exposure is superior in curved (means, 3.4 vs. 2.27; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS Although conventional laparoscopy may appear most effective for proper dissection and exposure of tissue, single-port access surgery shows potential. Especially in the tissue dissection task, there is no significant difference in time or errors between conventional laparoscopy and SPA surgery, using specially designed curved instruments. Although the participants favor conventional laparoscopy, this could evolve to a more accepting mind when SPA surgery becomes more available and used in the clinical setting.","Botden, Sanne; Strijkers, Rob; Fransen, Sofie; Stassen, Laurents; Bouvy, Nicole",Surgical endoscopy,310,1

As the innate immune response is critical for controlling viruses, the nature of this response in bats and how it may differ from that in other mammals are of great interest. Using next-generation transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq), we profiled the transcriptional response of Pteropus vampyrus bat kidney (PVK) cells to Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus known to elicit a strong innate immune response in mammalian cells. The Pteropus genus is a known reservoir of Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV). Analysis of the 200 to 300 regulated genes showed that genes for interferon (IFN) and antiviral pathways are highly upregulated in NDV-infected PVK cells, including genes for beta IFN, RIG-I, MDA5, ISG15, and IRF1. NDV-infected cells also upregulated several genes not previously characterized to be antiviral, such as RND1, SERTAD1, CHAC1, and MORC3. In fact, we show that MORC3 is induced by both IFN and NDV infection in PVK cells but is not induced by either stimulus in human A549 cells. In contrast to NDV infection, HeV and NiV infection of PVK cells failed to induce these innate immune response genes. Likewise, an attenuated response was observed in PVK cells infected with recombinant NDVs expressing the NiV IFN antagonist proteins V and W. This study provides the first global profile of a robust virus-induced innate immune response in bats and indicates that henipavirus IFN antagonist mechanisms are likely active in bat cells. IMPORTANCE Bats are the reservoir host for many highly pathogenic human viruses, including henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and filoviruses, and many other viruses have also been isolated from bats. Viral infections are reportedly asymptomatic or heavily attenuated in bat populations. Despite their ecological importance to viral maintenance, research into their immune system and mechanisms for viral control has only recently begun. Nipah virus and Hendra virus are two paramyxoviruses associated with high mortality rates in humans and whose reservoir is the Pteropus genus of bats. Greater knowledge of the innate immune response of P. vampyrus bats to viral infection may elucidate how bats serve as a reservoir for so many viruses.","Glennon, Nicole B; Jabado, Omar; Lo, Michael K; Shaw, Megan L",Journal of virology,310,1

We then related these derived anxiety factors to performance on a Flanker Task of cognitive control, in order to further validate these factors. Data were collected from 195 patients with nonpsychotic chronic or recurrent major depression or dysthymic disorder. At baseline, participants completed self-report measures of anxiety, depression, and other related symptoms (mania, suicidality) and clinicians administered a structured diagnostic interview and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, including anxiety/somatization items. Four discrete factors (State Anxiety, Panic, Neuroticism/Worry, and Restlessness/Agitation) emerged, with high degrees of internal consistency. Discriminant and convergent validity analyses also yielded findings in the expected direction. Furthermore, the neuroticism/worry factor was associated with Flanker Task interference, such that individuals higher on neuroticism/worry responded more incorrectly (yet faster) to incongruent vs. congruent trials whereas individuals higher on the fear/panic factor responded more slowly, with no accuracy effect, to the Flanker Task stimuli. These results parse anxiety into four distinct factors that encompass physiological, psychological, and cognitive components of anxiety. While state anxiety, panic and neuroticism/worry are related to existing measures of anxiety, the Restlessness/Agitation factor appears to be a unique measure of general anxious arousal. Furthermore, two factors were independently validated through the Flanker Task. These results suggest that these anxiety domains have distinct behavioral profiles and could have differential responses to distinct treatments.","Trombello, Joseph M; Pizzagalli, Diego A; Weissman, Myrna M; Grannemann, Bruce D; Cooper, Crystal M; Greer, Tracy L; Malchow, Ashley L; Jha, Manish K; Carmody, Thomas J; Kurian, Benji T; Webb, Christian A; Dillon, Daniel G; McGrath, Patrick J; Bruder, Gerard; Fava, Maurizio; Parsey, Ramin V; McInnis, Melvin G; Adams, Phil; Trivedi, Madhukar H",Journal of psychiatric research,310,1

However, its feasibility and safety have not been fully established. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of single-port LF (sLF) in our institution. sLF was attempted in 11 patients and was completed without the additional ports in 3 patients (27%). The remaining 8 patients required the addition of 1 to 3 ports to complete LF. Median operating time and blood loss were 221 minutes and 20 mL, respectively (intention-to-treat). No major complications were noted. All patients showed uneventful postoperative recovery and clinical improvement of their preoperative symptoms with satisfactory cosmetic outcome. sLF is technically feasible and safe, although the use of extra ports should be positively considered to ensure the safety and quality of LP.","Miyazaki, Yasuhiro; Nakajima, Kiyokazu; Yamasaki, Makoto; Miyata, Hiroshi; Kurokawa, Yukinori; Takiguchi, Shuji; Fujiwara, Yoshiyuki; Mori, Masaki; Doki, Yuichiro","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",310,1

Here, we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of SM bacteremia and to identify the risk factors of hemorrhagic pneumonia caused by SM in patients with hematologic diseases. METHODS The clinical records of 55 patients diagnosed with hematologic diseases and SM bacteremia were retrospectively reviewed. We compared patients' clinical characteristics and outcomes between the hemorrhagic pneumonia group and non-hemorrhagic pneumonia group. RESULTS Twenty-seven (49.1%) patients developed hemorrhagic pneumonia. The overall mortality rate of SM bacteremia was 67.3%. Hemorrhagic pneumonia (adjusted HR 2.316, 95% CI 1.140-4.705; P = 0.020) was an independent risk factor of 30-day mortality in hematological patients with SM bacteremia. Compared with the non-hemorrhagic pneumonia group, patients in the hemorrhagic pneumonia group were older and showed clinical manifestations as higher proportions of isolated SM in sputum culture, neutropenia and elevated procalcitonin (PCT). Multivariate analysis showed that neutropenia, high levels of PCT, prior tigecycline therapy within 1 month were independent risk factors associated with hemorrhagic pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS Neutropenia, high level of PCT and prior tigecycline therapy within 1 month were significant independent predictors of hemorrhagic pneumonia in hematologic patients with SM bacteremia. Due to no effective antibiotics to prevent hemorrhagic pneumonia, prophylaxis of SM infection and its progression to hemorrhagic pneumonia is particularly important.","Zhu, Lixia; Wang, Lulu; Zhang, Yuping; Chen, Rongrong; Li, Xueying; Sun, Jianai; Zhou, De; Zhu, Mingyu; Zheng, Xiaolong; Li, Li; Zhu, Jingjing; Xie, Mixue; Yang, Xiudi; Yu, Wenjuan; Tong, Hongyan; Zhu, Honghu; Xie, Wanzhuo; Jin, Jie; Ye, Xiujin",BMC infectious diseases,310,16

The evidence that the hospital can be a place where one might contract the infection and spread the disease has drastically reduced non-COVID-19 accesses to emergency rooms (ER) and to elective non-COVID-19 hospital activities. If this, on one hand, results in reducing improper access to the ER and hospital, on the other hand it substantiates the risk of underestimating problems not connected to COVID-19, such as an increased delay in the diagnosis and treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular emergencies. In addition, the need to reorganize hospital activities to treat patients suffering from serious COVID-19 disease forms forces us to reflect on how to safely manage patients who stay at home with milder COVID-19 disease forms and the need to keep the most vulnerable subjects, such as patients with chronic heart failure, away from the hospital. The problem is furtherly amplified by the uncertain trend of the epidemic, by the duration of forced isolation and limited mobility measures and by the inadequate integration between hospital and territory, especially in high-risk areas such as residences for the elderly or in socially and economically fragile environments. Our opinion is that a syndemic approach, which considers the complex interplay between social, economic, environmental and clinical problems, can be the most appropriate and achieved by means the contribution of telemedicine and telecardiology, intended as integration and not as an alternative to traditional management. A flexible use of telematic tools, now available for teleconsultation, and/or remote monitoring adapted to the needs of clinical, family and social-health contexts could allow the creation of integrated and personalized management programs that are effective and efficient for the care of patients.","Tarantini, Luigi; Navazio, Alessandro; Cioffi, Giovanni; Turiano, Giovanni; Colivicchi, Furio; Gabrielli, Domenico",Giornale italiano di cardiologia,310,1

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate whether IN is effective even in treatment-refractory cases, such as in those with steroid dependency and anti-TNF refractoriness. METHODS In the INDIGO study, 86 patients with active UC were randomly assigned to an IN group (0.5-2.0 g daily) or placebo group. The rate of clinical response (CR), mucosal healing (MH), and change in fecal calprotectin (FCP) levels was compared between refractory [patients with steroid-dependent disease, previous use of anti-TNF-α, and concomitant use of immunomodulators (IM)] and non-refractory patients. We also analyzed factors predicting CR and MH at week 8. RESULTS The rates of CR of IN group were significantly higher than placebo group, even in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p < 0.001), previous use of anti-TNF-α (p = 0.002), and concomitant use of IM (p = 0.013). The rates of MH in IN group were significantly higher than in placebo group in patients with steroid-dependent disease (p = 0.009). In the IN group, median FCP levels, at week 8, were significantly lower than baseline in patients with steroid-dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α (p < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the previous use of anti-TNF-α was not a predictive factor for CR and MH at week 8. CONCLUSIONS In a sub-analysis of data from a randomized placebo-controlled trial, we found that IN may be useful even in patients with steroid-dependent disease and patients with the previous use of anti-TNF-α.","Naganuma, Makoto; Sugimoto, Shinya; Fukuda, Tomohiro; Mitsuyama, Keiichi; Kobayashi, Taku; Yoshimura, Naoki; Ohi, Hidehisa; Tanaka, Shinji; Andoh, Akira; Ohmiya, Naoki; Saigusa, Keiichiro; Yamamoto, Takayuki; Morohoshi, Yuichi; Ichikawa, Hitoshi; Matsuoka, Katsuyoshi; Hisamatsu, Tadakazu; Watanabe, Kenji; Mizuno, Shinta; Abe, Takayuki; Suzuki, Yasuo; Kanai, Takanori",Journal of gastroenterology,310,29

The typical symptoms of Kawasaki disease include changes to the lips and oral cavity, including reddening of the lips and strawberry tongue, the diffuse injection of oral and pharyngeal mucosa, a rash (including redness at the site of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin inoculation), and changes to peripheral extremities, which in the initial stage include the reddening of palms and soles and edema, and in the convalescent stage include periungual desquamation and non-suppurative cervical lymphadenopathy. One of the patients had mild, transient bilateral conjunctival redness, and the other patient had a fever. However, chest imaging revealed multiple lung nodules, and echocardiography revealed coronary artery dilatation. Based on the symptoms, the laboratory indicators and echocardiography, diagnoses of incomplete Kawasaki disease were confirmed. The physicians provided treatments to the patients that significantly alleviated their conditions, including intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aspirin. The coronary arteries of the two infants returned to normal, and the lung nodules of the two infants disappeared.

METHODS A total of 626 cases of RSS surgeries were performed by 3 gynecologic surgeons at Ewha Womans University Medical Center, Robot Surgery Center from November 2014 to January 2018 were collected retrospectively. All of the patients' charts were reviewed, and the clinical characteristics and surgical variables were analyzed. RESULTS Among the total of 626 cases, there were 220 cases of RSS myomectomy (RSSM), 182 cases of RSS hysterectomy (RSSH), 195 of RSS adnexectomy, 24 of RSS sacrocolpopexy (RSS SCP) and 5 were classified as other RSS surgeries. The patient's mean age was 38.98 ± 10.07 years. There was 3.99 ± 2.15 min of mean docking time and 117.78 ± 51.18 min of mean operating time. The surgical variables were analyzed annually. The total operating time was seen to decrease significantly according to each period. The docking time declined significantly and gradually after 1 year. We also analyzed each of the surgical types by time. The operating time of RSSH, RSSM, RSS adnexectomy and RSS SCP fell over time. The tendency found was for operating time to decline sharply following the first 10 cases. When we analyzed the data at annual intervals, the operating time was most significantly less and stable following the first year. There were a few intraoperative or perioperative complications in 16 cases (2.6%). CONCLUSION Robotic single-site surgery is a feasible and safe procedure for treating various kinds of gynecologic diseases. The learning curve was approximately 10 cases of RSS surgery in gynecologic disease, having a greater amount of experience at performing RSS surgery was revealed to be key to achieving better surgical outcomes.","Yoo, Hae K; Cho, Ahyoung; Cho, Eun H; Kim, Soo J; Shim, Ji E; Lee, Sa R; Jeong, Kyungah; Moon, Hye-Sung",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,310,1

This study aims to explore the role of mitochondrial genomic variations in ischemic stroke, and to uncover the nuclear genes involved in this relationship. Eight hundred and thirty Taiwanese patients with a history of ischemic stroke and 966 normal controls were genotyped for their mitochondrial haplogroup (Mthapg). Cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids) harboring different Mthapgs were used to observe functional differences under hypoxia-ischemia. RNA sequencing (RNASeq) was conducted to identify the particularly elevated mRNA. The patient study identified an association between Mthapg F1 and risk of ischemic stroke (OR 1.72:1.27-2.34, p = 0.001). The cellular study further demonstrated an impeded induction of hypoxic inducible factor 1α in the Mthapg F1 cybrid after hypoxia-ischemia. Additionally, the study demonstrated that Mthapg F cybrids were associated with an altered mitochondrial function, including decreased oxygen consumption, higher mitochondrial ROS production, and lower mitochondrial membrane potential. Mthapg F cybrids were also noted to be prone to inflammation, with increased expression of several inflammatory cytokines and elevated matrix metalloproteinase 9. The RNASeq identified significantly elevated expressions of angiopoietin-like 4 in Mthapg F1 cybrids after hypoxia-ischemia. Our study demonstrates an association between Mthapg F and susceptibility to ischemic stroke.","Tsai, Meng-Han; Kuo, Chung-Wen; Lin, Tsu-Kung; Ho, Chen-Jui; Wang, Pei-Wen; Chuang, Jiin-Haur; Liou, Chia-Wei",Cells,310,31

It will discuss the treatment options currently available and the importance of preventing pulmonary exacerbations. RECENT FINDINGS The basis for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations remains unchanged over the past 15 years and whilst there have been trials exploring alternative antibiotics, there has been little change. However, there are ongoing studies that are expected to establish a platform for identifying best practices. Chronic cystic fibrosis therapies have been shown to reduce pulmonary exacerbations. In the era of new CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) modulator therapies, the number of pulmonary exacerbations are expected to be even fewer. However, it is unclear whether the other chronic therapies can be discontinued without losing their benefits in reducing exacerbations. SUMMARY Although there is no universal definition of a pulmonary exacerbation in cystic fibrosis, proposed definitions have many similarities. We have outlined the current recommendations for treatment of pulmonary exacerbations, including the duration and location of treatments. We have also summarized the key therapies used for prevention of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.","Ng, Christabella; Nadig, Tejaswi; Smyth, Alan R; Flume, Patrick",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,310,24

To our surprise, many people have been tested positive twice. Few cases of true reinfections involved genetic alterations in the virus. Appearance of multiple positive tests may be due to human errors or remnant genetic material, but genetic modification in virus represents very serious issue of controlling this pandemic. It is the need of the day that all the gaps and deficiencies, represented by variable response of adaptive immune system toward this infection, be filled and rectified. We have discussed reinfections with variable outcomes along with the possible reasons for variable response. Phenomena such as T cell memory, absence of cross-reactive immunity, T cell exhaustion, drawbacks pertaining to neutralizing antibodies, and immune enhancement are crucial areas by which adaptive immune response can weaken considerably. Earlier and stronger herd immunity is also at the mercy of strong adaptive immune system to avoid future pandemics by the same microorganism. Likewise, consequences of this phenomenon should also be considered during vaccine development as resources worth billions are being used and staked. Many countries have entered the second/third waves of COVID-19. Therefore, we need to come up with ways toward uniform strengthening of adaptive immune response to fight off this pandemic. Also, to develop and maintain constant resistance to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the mentioned weakened links in the chain of adaptive immunity may be explored to keep viral invasion and physiological damage to minimum.","Ahsan, Haseeb; Sonn, Jong Kyung; Lee, Young Sup; Islam, Salman Ul; Khalil, Saifullah Khan",Viral immunology,310,27

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with LPS at different concentrations or at different time points. Cells were also pretreated with 30 μM ROCK inhibitor Y27632 for 30 min or different concentrations of TSG for 24 h and then were incubated with 100 μg/ml LPS for another 24 h. The results showed that LPS treatment significantly reduced endothelial cell viability, increased LDH release, and promoted cell necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, which was dramatically inhibited by TSG pretreatment. Furthermore, LPS induction significantly enhanced the expression of RhoA, ROCK1, and ROCK2 and the activation of ROCK; these effects were reduced by TSG pretreatment. The suppression of either RhoA or ROCK significantly improved LPS-induced endothelial cell viability, and reduced cell necrosis and LDH release. In addition, LPS treatment promoted F-actin skeleton rearrangement and contraction ring formation around the plasma membrane, which was greatly inhibited by the suppression of the RhoA/ROCK pathway or TSG pretreatment. In conclusion, TSG may inhibit F-actin cytoskeletal remodeling by blocking RhoA/ROCK signaling and thus reduce LPS-induced endothelial cell toxicity.","Qi, Yan; Liang, Xiuying; Hu, Xia; He, Haiyan; Tang, Lian; Yao, Wenjuan",General physiology and biophysics,310,1

In this research, we focus on the religiosity of communities to examine whether religiosity helps or hinders adherence to mitigation policies such as shelter-in-place directives. Prior research has made opposing predictions as to the influence of religiosity. One stream predicts greater adherence because of rule-abiding norms and altruistic tendencies, whereas another has predicted lower adherence as a reaction against the restriction of personal and religious freedom. We used shelter-in-place directives as an intervention in a quasiexperiment to examine adherence over 30 days as a function of religiosity in the most populous metropolitan areas in the United States. When a shelter-in-place directive had not been imposed, religiosity did not affect people's movements.

Nursing education must respond to these changing times by redesigning classroom instruction. Flipped learning (FL) is a proposed method for teaching advanced practice nurses that is student-centered and engaging, both critical areas for contemporary learners. This qualitative study explored the perspectives and experiences of the family nurse practitioner faculty and the family nurse practitioner nursing students who participated in FL. The type and level of FL practices faculty can apply to support students coming to class prepared to engage in active learning activities was also investigated. The study used an insider action research design. There were two arms of the study, faculty and student. Ten faculty-led learning circles with four faculty and three family nurse practitioner student focus groups, each with six students, were held over the course of the study. Thematic findings were developed from both student and faculty data. The results revealed that family nurse practitioner students had a positive attitude toward FL. Many expressed FL provided perceptions of gained confidence, personalized learning, increased engagement, and preparedness for classroom instruction. Overall, faculty preferred FL over traditional teaching approaches. Several active learning activities were used by faculty with clinical case studies being the most preferred by student participants. This study confirms FL is a plausible and promising approach to traditional classroom instruction. However, more robust studies are needed to determine its benefits in advanced practice nursing education.","Murphy, Nancy; Strong, Caron; Jones, Gloria",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,310,1

The presence of a N-O bond in the ring prevents the planar geometry of the aromatic system and induces a strong decrease in the basicity of the guanidine moiety. While DIBAL-H appeared to be the most efficient reducing agent because it exhibited high diastereoselectivity, we observed various behaviors of the Mitsunobu reaction on the resulting β-aminoalcohol, leading to either inversion or retention of the configuration depending on the steric hindrance in the vicinity of the hydroxy group. The physicochemical properties (pKa and log D) and hepatic stability of several AOXD derivatives were experimentally determined and found that the AOXD scaffold possesses promising properties for drug development. Moreover, we synthesized alchornedine, the only natural product with the AOXD scaffold.

RESULTS There were 58 males and 57 females with a mean age of 55 years (± 13.7). Cirrhosis was found in 23 patients. Resections were performed for malignant disease in 62.6% (n = 72) and for benign disease in 37.4% (n = 43). Major hepatectomy was performed in 26 patients (22.4%). Mean liver ischemia period was 27.1 min (± 13.9). The mortality rate was 1.7% and the morbidity rate was 22.6%. Cumulative clamping time (t = 3.61, P < 0.001) and operation time (t = 2.38, P < 0.019) were significantly correlated with AST alterations (D-AST). Cumulative clamping time (t = 5.16, P < 0.001) was significantly correlated with D-ALT. Operation time (t = 5.81, P < 0.001) was significantly correlated with D-LDH. CONCLUSIONS Intermittent PTC under low CVP was performed with low morbidity and mortality. Intermittent PTC can be safely applied up to 60 minutes in both normal and impaired livers.","Topaloglu, Serdar; Yesilcicek Calik, Kıymet; Calik, Adnan; Aydın, Coskun; Kocyigit, Sema; Yaman, Huseyin; Kutanis, Dilek; Karabulut, Erdem; Dohman, Davut; Orem, Asim; Arslan, Mithat Kerim",BioMed research international,310,30

Rate constants and branching ratios for single electron transfer (SET), two H-abstractions (HA) and seven radical adduct formation (RAF) reactions of ●OH with 2AP were evaluated using transition state theory (TST). The RAF at C8-position of 2AP is noted as the dominant process, which constitute almost 46.1% of overall reaction routes. The SET mechanism accounts for the second major pathway (39.6%) followed by RAF at C6-position (14.3%). Qualitative profiling of transformation products (TPs, i.e. the non-radical end products) of ●OH (formed via sonochemical method) reactions of 2AP by LC-Q-TOF/MS technique has demonstrated the formations of 14 molecular species. Among the 14 TPs (designated as TP1 to TP14), the lowest and highest mass to charge ratio (m/z) were respectively observed at 129 and 269 in ESI-MS positive ionization mode. The identities of all TPs have been proposed on the basis of elemental composition of [M+H]+ ions and their respective MS-MS fragments. Four TPs (including guanine) are considered as obtained directly from primary transients by radical elimination, radical-radical combination/disproportionation reactions. Formations of other 10 TPs are postulated as result of successive self- and/or cross-reactions of primary transients/four first generation TPs with reagents such as ●OH, O2 and solvent H2O molecules.","Prasanthkumar, Kavanal P; Rayaroth, Manoj P; Alvarez-Idaboy, Juan Raúl",The journal of physical chemistry.

Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are becoming more common with some healthcare-associated pneumonia events. Early detection of MDRO risk improves the outcomes; however, MDROs risk in pneumonia with sepsis is unknown. This study investigated the disease outcomes of pneumonia with septic shock in patients admitted in the emergency department (ED) intensive care unit (ICU), a population with a high prevalence of MDROs, after early screening of MDROs risk. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, patients with pneumonia and early septic shock (n = 533) admitted to the ED at the Taipei Tzu Chi Hospital from 2013 to 2019 were selected. The study population was divided into four subgroups after the MDROs risk and screening procedure were completed within 1 or 6 hours of admission. ICU mortality and multidrug antibiotic therapy were compared. RESULTS The high-risk MDROs groups had higher percentage of P. aeruginosa than the low-risk group. Furthermore, the appropriate ED first antibiotics were higher in the 1-hour subgroup than in the 6-hour subgroup of the high-risk MDROs group. In multivariate analysis, the 6-hour high-risk MDROs group had an adjusted odds ratio of 7.191 (95% CI: 2.911-17.767, p < 0.001) and 2.917 (95% CI:1.456-5.847, p = 0.003) for ICU mortality and multidrug therapy in the ICU, respectively, after adjusting for other confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS MDRO screening within 1 hour is recommended following admission of patients with pneumonia and early septic shock in the ED, especially in areas with a high prevalence of MDROs.","Yiang, Giou-Teng; Tzeng, I-Shiang; Shui, Hao-Ai; Wu, Meng-Yu; Peng, Ming-Yieh; Chan, Chih-Yu; Chan, Edward D; Wu, Yao-Kuang; Lan, Chou-Chin; Yang, Mei-Chen; Huang, Kuo-Liang; Wu, Chih-Wei; Chang, Chia-Hui; Su, Wen-Lin",Shock,310,31

This study determined the level of knowledge, attitude, practices, and impact of COVID-19 infection on healthcare workers (HCWs) working in a South-Eastern Nigerian state. METHODOLOGY This was a web-based, cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers in South-eastern, Nigeria during the lockdown period. Socio-demographic profile, knowledge of COVID-19, fears and impact concerning COVID-19, attitude of health workers to work, preventive practices during this pandemic period were obtained. Data were analysed using STATA 16.0. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests of association were used to determine the association between variables, with the significance level set at p < 0.05. RESULTS A total of 403 health care workers participated in the study. Majority of participants (n = 357, 88.59%) had good knowledge and good preventive practices (n = 328, 81.39%) of COVID-19. A significant proportion of respondents had a poor attitude to work (n = 101, 25.06%) and an attitude of indifference (n = 233, 57.82%). Almost half (48.64%) of participants had been negatively affected by COVID-19. Knowledge significantly influenced practice (p = 0.029). Lack of Personal protective equipment, fear of dying and going to common places, had a significant impact on the attitude of workers. CONCLUSION Good knowledge which influenced practice, high use of preventive practices, with associated poor and indifferent attitude was noted among healthcare workers. Fear of death and lack of personal protective equipment had a strong impact on attitude. Female HCWs had poorer attitude to work than males.","Mbachu, Chioma Ngozichukwu Pauline; Azubuike, Chimaobi Marie-Claire; Mbachu, Ikechukwu Innocent; Ndukwu, Chizalu Ifeyinwa; Ezeuko, Amaka Yves-Ann; Udigwe, Ifeoma Bridget; Nnamani, Chioma Phyllis; Umeh, Uche Marian; Ezeagwuna, Dorothy Amauche; Onah, Stanley Kenechi; Eze, Henry Obinna; Okereke, Uzoma Chidi; Orji-Ifeanyi, Esther Nkiruka",Journal of infection in developing countries,310,16

In this work, we explore whether Netrin-1 (NT-1) overexpression facilitates white matter repairing and remodeling. Adult CD-1 mice received stereotactic injection of adeno-associated virus carrying NT-1 gene (AAV-NT-1). One week after gene transfer, mice underwent 60 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion. The effect of NT-1 on neural function was evaluated by neurobehavioral tests. Proliferated oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), newly matured oligodendrocytes, and remyelination were semi-quantified by immunohistochemistry. The role of NT-1 in oligodendrogenesis was further explored by examining specific NT-1 receptors and their function. Netrin-1 overexpression was detected in neurons and astrocytes 2 weeks after AAV-NT-1 gene transfer and significantly improved the neurobehavioral outcomes compared with the control (P<0.05). In comparison with the control, proliferated OPCs, newly matured oligodendrocytes, and remyelination were greatly increased in the ipsilateral hemisphere of AAV-NT-1-transduced mice. Furthermore, both NT-1 receptors deleted in colorectal carcinoma and UNC5H2 were expressed on OPCs whereas only UNC5H2 was expressed in myelinated axons. Our study indicated that NT-1 promoted OPC proliferation, differentiation, and increased remyelination, suggesting that NT-1 is a promising factor for white matter repairing and remodeling after ischemia.","He, Xiaosong; Li, Yaning; Lu, Haiyan; Zhang, Zhijun; Wang, Yongting; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,310,12

We provide here a review of currently available data regarding the CC neuroimaging and neuropathological alterations in BD. MATERIALS AND METHODS After an exploratory search of the MEDLINE, we first identified all English-written articles that provide separate data for BD patients and report original experimental data on cingulate gyrus. Subsequently, we selected those including neuroimaging or neuropathological data. Among the 161 articles updated through June 2007, 81 articles were retained using this procedure. RESULTS The review of in vivo volumetric imaging data, as well as ex vivo morphometric and histological studies indicates that BD patients show volume changes of the subgenual ACC (sgACC-BA 25 and part of 24) during the early stages of the disease. Whether this phenomenon is due to neuronal and glial depletion or damage of corticocortical connections is still a matter of debate. The resting state activity in the left BA 25 appears to be state dependent showing significant increase during mania and decrease during depressive phases. The presence of a deficient GABAergic activity in ACC is also documented. Pharmacological treatment partly restores BD-related functional imaging changes. CONCLUSION The present review reveals the striking discrepancies of the experimental results present both for functional and structural imaging studies but also for neuropathological analyses. Methodological and conceptual limitations are addressed with particular reference to the heterogeneity of BD clinical patterns. We also critically discuss the validity of CC changes as possible trait- or state-markers of the disease.","Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N; Giannakopoulos, Panteleimon; Kövari, Eniko; Bouras, Constantin",Brain research reviews,310,24

Our objective was to evaluate virtual clinics in orthopaedic practice and determine how to use them effectively and sustainably. METHODS We surveyed 100 consecutive patients participating in orthopaedic virtual phone clinic (VPC) at an academic hospital to evaluate patient satisfaction against face-to-face (F2F) consultations and obtain suggestions for improving patient experience, and we surveyed 23 clinicians who conducted orthopaedic VPCs in 2020. Data were correlated with clinic outcomes, reason for consultation, diagnosis, patient age and clinician grade. Consultation duration, clinician-associated costs and reimbursement were analysed. Significance was tested using two-tailed Student's t-test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS Patient satisfaction (out of 5) for VPC was significantly lower than F2F (4.1 vs 4.5, p=0.0003), and a larger proportion of VPC scored <3 compared with F2F (11% vs 2%). Higher VPC scores were associated with appointments for delivering results and where patients felt clinical examination was not needed. Patients suggested introducing video capability, adhering to appointment time and offering the choice of VPC or F2F. Mean clinician satisfaction scores for VPC were 4.3/5 and suggested indications for VPC included: routine surveillance, communication of results, discussing/consenting for surgery and vulnerable patients. Integrating video, providing private rooms and offering patients time intervals for VPC were recommended. Current National Health Service VPC structures uses greater clinician resources and generates lower reimbursement than F2F consultations, resulting in 11.5% reduction in reimbursement. CONCLUSION VPC plays a valuable role when clinical evaluation has been performed or considered not necessary. Offering the choice of VPC or F2F, adding video capability and providing a time interval for VPC may reduce resource use and increase satisfaction. We recommend renegotiating VPC tariffs and cost-neutral modifications of clinic structure.","Pradhan, Raj; Peeters, Wouter; Boutong, Sara; Mitchell, Chris; Patel, Rahul; Faroug, Rad; Roussot, Mark",BMJ open quality,310,17

Despite this, the tools for a detailed analysis of ligand-GPCR interactions are limited. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate how ligand binding to GPCRs can be followed in real-time on living cells. This was conducted using two model systems, the radiolabeled porcine peptide YY (pPYY) interacting with transfected human Y2 receptor (hY2R) and the bombesin antagonist RM26 binding to the naturally expressed gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR). By following the interaction over time, the affinity and kinetic properties such as association and dissociation rate were obtained. Additionally, data were analyzed using the Interaction Map method, which can evaluate a real-time binding curve and present the number of parallel interactions contributing to the curve. It was found that pPYY binds very slowly with an estimated time to equilibrium of approximately 12h. This may be problematic in standard end-point assays where equilibrium is required. The RM26 binding showed signs of heterogeneity, observed as two parallel interactions with unique kinetic properties. In conclusion, measuring binding in real-time using living cells opens up for a better understanding of ligand interactions with GPCRs.","Xu, Bo; Varasteh, Zohreh; Orlova, Anna; Andersson, Karl; Larhammar, Dan; Björkelund, Hanna",Biochemical and biophysical research communications,310,16

There are important knowledge gaps regarding treatment decisions for HCT recipients with these infections and in the identification of risk factors that predict infection severity. Here, we review recent data on paramyxovirus infections in HCT recipients focusing on risk factors, new diagnostic and prognostic tools, and management including new drugs and vaccines under development. RECENT FINDINGS Multiplexed molecular assays associated with immunodeficiency scoring index for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) have improved our understanding of the epidemiology of RSV and other paramyxovirus infections and the risk factors for worse outcomes. Novel antiviral drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and vaccines are under evaluation with mixed preliminary results. SUMMARY Advances in our knowledge of paramyxovirus infections in HCT recipients in the last two decades contributed to better strategies for management and prevention of these infections. A widespread understanding of how to stratify HCT recipients with paramyxovirus infections who would benefit most from antiviral therapy remains to be ascertained.

This study investigated persistence and transmission dynamics of ON1 by grouping 406 randomly selected RSV-positive specimens submitted to Public Health Ontario from August 2011 to August 2012; RSV-A-positive specimens were genotyped. We identified 370 RSV-A (181 NA1, 135 NA2, 51 ON1 3 GA5) and 36 RSV-B positive specimens. We aligned time-stamped second hypervariable region (330 bp) of G-gene sequence data (global, n = 483; and Ontario, n = 60) to evaluate transmission dynamics. Global data suggests that the most recent common ancestor of ON1 emerged during the 2008-2009 season. Mean evolutionary rate of the global ON1 was 4.10 × 10(-3) substitutions/site/year (95% BCI 3.1-5.0 × 10(-3)), not significantly different to that of Ontario ON1. The estimated mean reproductive number (R0 = ∼ 1.01) from global and Ontario sequences showed no significant difference and implies stability among global RSV-A ON1. This study suggests that local epidemics exhibit similar underlying evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics to that of the persistent global RSV-A ON1 population. These findings underscore the importance of continual molecular surveillance of RSV in order to gain a better understanding of epidemics.","Duvvuri, Venkata R; Granados, Andrea; Rosenfeld, Paul; Bahl, Justin; Eshaghi, Alireza; Gubbay, Jonathan B",Scientific reports,310,1

The mean knowledge score was 9.92 ± 2.37/14 and 94.44% secured at least above-average score. The subjects had a positive (70%) attitude towards the CoViD 19 situation and 77% of subjects followed good preventive practices. However, we found that women, people with low education and nonmedical background were associated with poor knowledge and practices. The attitude was poor in subjects occupant in physical works.

In this study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of intravenous thrombolysis in stroke patients on prescribed antiplatelet therapy in the WAKE-UP trial. Methods WAKE-UP was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to study the efficacy and safety of MRI-guided intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase in patients with an acute stroke of unknown onset time. The medication history of all patients randomized in the WAKE-UP trial was documented. The primary safety outcome was any sign of hemorrhagic transformation on follow-up MRI. The primary efficacy outcome was favorable functional outcome defined by a score of 0-1 on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days after stroke, adjusted for age and baseline stroke severity. Logistic regression models were fitted to study the association of prior antiplatelet treatment with outcome and treatment effect of intravenous alteplase. Results Of 503 randomized patients, 164 (32.6%) were on antiplatelet treatment. Patients on antiplatelet treatment were older (70.3 vs. 62.8 years, p < 0.001), and more frequently had a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and previous stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and hemorrhagic transformation on follow-up imaging did not differ between patients with and without antiplatelet treatment. Patients on prior antiplatelet treatment were less likely to achieve a favorable outcome (37.3% vs. 52.6%, p = 0.014), but there was no interaction of prior antiplatelet treatment with intravenous alteplase concerning favorable outcome (p = 0.355). Intravenous alteplase was associated with higher rates of favorable outcome in patients on prior antiplatelet treatment with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.106 (95% CI 1.047-4.236). Conclusions Treatment benefit of intravenous alteplase and rates of post-treatment hemorrhagic transformation were not modified by prior antiplatelet intake among MRI-selected patients with unknown onset stroke. Worse functional outcome in patients on antiplatelets may result from a higher load of cardiovascular co-morbidities in these patients.","Frey, Benedikt M; Boutitie, Florent; Cheng, Bastian; Cho, Tae-Hee; Ebinger, Martin; Endres, Matthias; Fiebach, Jochen B; Fiehler, Jens; Ford, Ian; Galinovic, Ivana; Königsberg, Alina; Puig, Josep; Roy, Pascal; Wouters, Anke; Magnus, Tim; Thijs, Vincent; Lemmens, Robin; Muir, Keith W; Nighoghossian, Norbert; Pedraza, Salvador; Simonsen, Claus Z; Gerloff, Christian; Thomalla, Götz",Neurological research and practice,310,7

Several studies have investigated the role of CBX family members in cancer. However, the function and prognostic value of diverse CBX family members in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. In the present study, we reveal that CBX family members are overexpressed in NSCLC tissue compared with normal lung tissue, with the exception of CBX6. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that high expression of CBX1 and CBX3 are correlated with overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), disease-free interval (DFI), and progression-free interval (PFI) for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients. Furthermore, regression model analysis suggests that CBX3 may be suitable as an independent prediction factor for OS and PFI in patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Additionally, CBX3 mRNA expression was found to be associated with tumor diameter and lymph node metastasis. Gene Enrichment Analysis (GESA) suggests that CBX3 is involved in the cell cycle and P53 signaling pathways. Aberrant expression of CBX3 in LUAD is correlated with DNA copy number alteration (CNA). In summary, our data imply that CBX3 plays an important role in promotion of lung adenocarcinoma and may thus have potential as a prognostic biomarker and molecular therapeutic target for the disease.","Xie, Xiaobin; Ning, Yue; Long, Jie; Wang, Hongyan; Chen, Xiaowei",FEBS open bio,310,1

Although many zoonotic transmissions occur on industrial-scale factory farms, public discussions mainly blame wild animal (""wet"") markets or focus on reactionary solutions, posing a psychological obstacle to preventing future pandemics. In two pre-registered studies early in the 2020 pandemic, we examined whether British adults fail to recognize factory farming in causing pandemics, and whether such dismissal represents motivated cognition. Cross-sectional data (Study 1, N = 302) confirmed that people blame factory farms and global meat consumption less than wild animal trade and consumption or lack of government preparedness, especially among meat-committed persons. Experimental exposure (Study 2, N = 194) to information blaming factory farms (vs. wild animal markets) produced lower endorsement of preventive solutions than of reactionary solutions, which was exacerbated among meat-committed persons. These findings suggest that people, especially those highly committed to eating meat, willfully disregard solutions targeting animal agriculture and global meat consumption to prevent future pandemics precisely because such solutions implicate their dietary habits. Better understanding motivated beliefs about the causes of and solutions to pandemics is critical for developing interventions.","Dhont, Kristof; Piazza, Jared; Hodson, Gordon",Appetite,310,31

The biofilm that plays an important role in the virulence of P. aeruginosa is under the regulation of quorum sensing and two-component regulatory systems of bacteria. Curcumin, an active phenolic extract of turmeric has shown an inhibitory effect on the biofilm formation of some pathogenic bacteria. Thus, the present study aims to evaluate the effect of Nano-Curcumin on the expression of major regulatory genes involved in biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa. Materials and Methods The biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 was assessed in the presence of 15, 20, and 25 µg/mL concentrations of Nano-Curcumin using the microplate titer method. The effect of Nano-Curcumin on the expression level of regulatory genes were determined by relative reverse transcriptase-realtime PCR. Results In the absence of Nano-Curcumin, P. aeruginosa strain ATCC 10145 strongly produced biofilm (3+) and in the presence of 15 and 20 µg/mL, biofilm formation was reduced to moderate (2+) and weak biofilm producer (1+), respectively. Nano-Curcumin at a concentration of 25µg/mL inhibited biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. The expression of regulatory genes was not affected by biofilm inhibitory concentrations of Nano-Curcumin. Conclusion The antibiofilm mechanism of Curcumin is not related to the downregulation of regulatory systems of P. aeruginosa and probably it prevents the formation of a complete biofilm structure.","Sharifian, Parastoo; Yaslianifard, Somayeh; Fallah, Parviz; Aynesazi, Siavash; Bakhtiyari, Mahmood; Mohammadzadeh, Mohammad",Infection and drug resistance,310,10

In this study, we used an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) antibody (MN-14) tagged with both a radiolabel ((111)In) and a fluorophore (IRDye 800CW) for radionuclide detection and intraoperative fluorescence imaging, respectively. METHODS For this purpose, we prepared and characterized the dual-labeled antibody (111)In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-MN-14-IRDye 800CW and performed 4 studies on mice with subcutaneous and intraperitoneal CEA-expressing tumors: a dose escalation study to determine the optimal MN-14 protein dose, a biodistribution study comparing dual-labeled MN-14 and radiolabeled MN-14, a study to determine the optimal time for SPECT and fluorescence imaging after injection of dual-labeled MN-14, and finally a SPECT and fluorescence image-guided surgery study using this dual-labeled antibody. RESULTS The optimal protein dose of dual-labeled MN-14 was 10 μg per mouse, yielding a tumor-to-blood ratio of 3.5 within 72 h. The biodistribution of (111)In-DTPA-MN-14-IRDye 800CW in mice with subcutaneous LS174T tumors showed tumor uptake after 3 d (19.7% ± 17.0% injected dose/g) comparable to that of (111)In-DTPA-MN-14 but higher accumulation in the liver. The optimal time for imaging after administration of the dual-labeled antibody was 2-3 d after injection. Finally, in mice with intraperitoneally growing LS174T tumor nodules that received (111)In-DTPA-MN-14-IRDye 800CW, intraperitoneal tumor nodules could be localized with SPECT imaging after 3 d and subsequently resected using fluorescence image-guided surgery. CONCLUSION Thus, we showed the feasibility for assessment and image-guided resection of CEA antigen-expressing tumors using dual-labeled MN-14. Both radionuclide detection and fluorescence imaging may provide useful information to improve localization of tumors and radical excision of tumor tissue. Because humanized MN-14 (labetuzumab) is available for clinical use, translation to a clinical setting is the next step.","Rijpkema, Mark; Oyen, Wim J; Bos, Desiree; Franssen, Gerben M; Goldenberg, David M; Boerman, Otto C","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",310,31

The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that some infectious diseases are related to the occurrence of PD. METHODS The case-control study, conducted in Belgrade during the period 2001-2005, comprised 110 subjects diagnosed for the first time as PD cases, and 220 controls chosen among patients with degenerative joint disease and some diseases of the digestive tract. RESULTS According to logistic regression analysis, PD was significantly related to mumps [odds ratio adjusted on occupation and family history of PD (aOR) = 7.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.77-16.36], scarlet fever (aOR = 12.18, 95% CI = 1.97-75.19), influenza (aOR = 8.01, 95% CI = 4.61-13.92), whooping cough (aOR = 19.90, 95% CI = 2.07-190.66) and herpes simplex infections (aOR = 11.52, 95% CI = 2.25-58.89). Tuberculosis, measles and chicken pox were not associated with PD. Other infectious diseases we asked for were not reported (12 diseases), or were too rare (four diseases) to be analysed. CONCLUSION The results obtained are in line with the suggestion that some infectious diseases may play a role in the development of PD.","Vlajinac, Hristina; Dzoljic, Eleonora; Maksimovic, Jadranka; Marinkovic, Jelena; Sipetic, Sandra; Kostic, Vladimir",The International journal of neuroscience,310,16

The present study is intended at designing and performing a trial experiment on using motion-sensing technology to perform image manipulation and X-ray acquisition function (the activities a radiographer frequently performs during an X-ray examination) under an experimental setup. Based on the author's clinical experience, several gesture commands were designed carefully to complete a single X-ray examination. Four radiographers were randomly recruited for the study. They were asked to perform gesture commands in front of a computer integrated with a gesture-based touchless controller. The translational movements of the tip of their thumb and index finger while performing different gesture commands were recorded for analysis. Although individual operators were free to decide the extent of movement and the speed at which their fingers and thumbs moved while performing these gesture commands, the result of our study demonstrated that all operators could perform our proposed gesture commands with good consistency, suggesting that motion-sensing technology could, in practice, be integrated into radiographic examinations. To summarize, although the implementation of motion-sensing technology as an input command in radiographic examination might inevitably slow down the examination throughput considering that extra procedural steps are required to trigger specific gesture commands in sequence, it is advantageous in minimizing the potential of the pathogen contamination during image operation and image processing that leads to cross infection.","Li, Ellis Chun Fai; Lai, Christopher Wai Keung",Radiological physics and technology,310,16

Whether this finding was anecdotal or similar viruses are common components of feline virome is still unclear. Also, the potential impact of this virus on feline health is uncertain. Herewith, a case-control study was performed to investigate whether this novel parvovirus may play a role as enteric pathogen, screening samples collected from cats with and without AGE signs. Furthermore, we extended the research by testing archival paired oropharyngeal and ocular samples collected from cats with or without upper respiratory tract disease (URTD). FeChPV DNA was detected at high prevalence rate (36.8%, 14/38) in clinical cases, representing the most frequently identified enteric virus, followed by feline panleukopenia parvovirus (23.7%, 9/38), feline coronavirus (5.3%, 2/38), feline kobuvirus (5.3%, 2/38) and noroviruses (5.3%, 2/38). The different prevalence rates of FeChPV between the case and control group were statistically significant, suggesting a possible association of the virus with acute gastro-enteric disease. The virus was also detected at low rate in the respiratory samples of cats with (3.3%, 6/183) or without URTD (4.3%, 6/140), although there was no significant association between FeChPV and URTD. The complete VP encoding gene was determined for five viruses and the nearly full-length genome was reconstructed for three viruses, namely 313R/2019/ITA, 284R/2019/ITA and 49E/2019/ITA. In the NS1-based tree the Italian strains clustered tightly with the two FeChPV prototypes detected in Canada, within a monophyletic cluster related to but clearly distinct from canine chaphamaparvovirus, currently classified in the species Carnivore chaphamaparvovirus 1 (CaChPV-1).","Di Profio, Federica; Sarchese, Vittorio; Palombieri, Andrea; Fruci, Paola; Massirio, Ivano; Martella, Vito; Marsilio, Fulvio; Di Martino, Barbara",Transboundary and emerging diseases,310,8

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is radically altering both socio-economic and health care scenarios. METHODS On April 4, 2020, at 13.30 CET, a webinar was broadcasted, organized by Global Neuro and supported by WFNS. Expert neurosurgeons from 6 different countries (China, Italy, South Korea, USA, Colombia and United Kingdom) reported on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their health care systems and neurosurgical activity. RESULTS The first part focused on the epidemiology until that date. The USA were the most affected State with 450.000 cases, followed by Italy (140.000 cases and 19.000 casualties), China (83.305 cases and 3.345 had died), South Korea (10.156 cases with 177 casualties), the UK (38.168 cases and 3.605 deaths) and Colombia (1.267 cases and 25 deaths). The second part concerned Institution and staff reorganization. In every country all surgical plans have been modified. In Wuhan the staff was enrolled in COVID-units. In New York, the Mount Sinai Health System was in lockdown mode. In South Korea, sterilizing chambers have been placed. In Italy some Departments were reorganized in a Hub and Spoke fashion. In the Latin American region, they adopted special measures for every case. In the UK a conference center has been used to accommodate intensive care unit (ICU) beds. The third part was about neurosurgical practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Wuhan the main hospital was used for urgent non-COVID patients. In New York the neurosurgeon staff work in ICU as advanced practitioner (APP). In South Korea every patient is screened. In Italy the on-duty Hub neurosurgeons have been doubled. In the Latin American region recommendations have been developed by some neurosurgical societies. In the UK local non-specialists and traumatologists neurosurgical experts are collaborating in terms of best practice. The final part touched upon how to perform safe surgery and re-start after the pandemic. In China elective surgical procedures are performed very carefully. In New York, surgery planning will be based on patient's viral load. In South Korea and in Italy disinfection plans and negative-pressure O.R. were created. In the Latin American region, the aim is to have a rapid testing system. In the UK they have developed flowcharts to guide trauma patient management. CONCLUSIONS In general, the pandemic scenario was presented as a thought-provoking challenge in all countries which requires tireless efforts for both maintaining emergency and elective neurosurgical procedures.","Fontanella, Marco M; Saraceno, Giorgio; Lei, Ting; Bederson, Joshua B; You, Namkyu; Rubiano, Andres M; Hutchinson, Peter; Wiemeijer-Timmer, Frédérique; Servadei, Franco",Journal of neurosurgical sciences,310,4

METHODS We performed a cross-sectional study from 37 geographically diverse US children's hospitals. We included ED encounters between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, transformed into time-series data. We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019. We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts. RESULTS 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6.4%) occurred during 2020. ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65.1% decrease in April relative to 2010-2019. In forecasting models, encounters for depression and diabetic ketoacidosis remained within the 95% confidence interval [CI]; fever, bronchiolitis, hyperbilirubinemia, skin/subcutaneous infections and seizures occurred within the 80-95% CI during the portions of 2020, and all other diagnoses (abdominal pain, otitis media, asthma, pneumonia, trauma, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections) occurred below the predicted 95% CI. CONCLUSION Pediatric ED utilization has remained low following the COVID-19 pandemic, and below forecasted utilization for most diagnoses. Nearly all conditions demonstrated substantial declines below forecasted rates from the prior decade and which persisted through the end of the year. Some declines in non-communicable diseases may represent unmet healthcare needs among children.

The procedure was performed using a single 15-mm-diameter umbilical incision with two 5-mm-diameter port sites. RESULTS The study enrolled 36 women and 19 men with a mean age of 28 years (range, 18-78 years). The procedure was achieved for 41 patients (74.5%). The mean operative time was 39 min (range, 14-111 min). There was no mortality. The postoperative complication rate was 5.4% (3 complications in 3 patients), and the median hospital stay was 39 h (range, 8-240 h). CONCLUSION The SILA technique is safe and feasible for selected patients with noncomplicated acute appendicitis. Compared with other transumbilical techniques of appendectomy, SILA has the advantages of feasibility without endoscopic skills and an acceptable operative time. Technical refinements and accomplished learning probably will enable its wider use for more patients with acute appendicitis.","Chouillard, Elie; Dache, Arnaud; Torcivia, Adriana; Helmy, Nada; Ruseykin, Ivan; Gumbs, Andrew",Surgical endoscopy,310,27

Among them, 25% of all case were diagnosed with metastasis and 50% occurs metastasis during the development of disease. Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor, and is used for treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer alone or combined with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Integrin-beta 1 (ITGB1), which is also known as CD29, and plays an important role in development of malignant cancers. However, the effect of ITGB1 in promoting the anti-tumor effect of cetuximab is not fully understand. METHODS The model of ITGB1 inhibition and overexpression was firstly constructed in LS174T cells, and the viability of cells in each group was detected using CCK-8 assay. The expression of key factors in tumor formation process at transcription level was detected using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method. The expression of key proteins in metastasis process, cell apoptosis and activation of Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway was detected using western blotting analysis. And the concentration of key factors of in tumor formation process in cultured medium of LS174T cells were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. RESULTS We found that cetuximab could inhibit the proliferation of LS174T cells, and inhibition of ITGB1 enhanced this effect while overexpression of ITGB1 reduced this effect. We further found that cetuximab could inhibit the expression and secretion of extracellular matrix degradation related molecules in cultured medium and transcription level. Besides, we also found that the expression of key factors in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix degradation related proteins were also reduced after cetuximab treatment. These effects might be mediated by Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling pathway and enhanced after inhibition of ITGB1 expression. CONCLUSION Inhibition of ITGB1 might be a new therapeutic method in colorectal cancer.","Yang, Xiaohui; Wang, Shuai; Yu, Weihua; Zheng, Yixiong; Wu, Yulian",Medicine,310,27

Electrocorticography electrodes located in subdural, epidural, and intravascular positions show promise as long-term neural prostheses. However, chronic implantation affects the electrochemical environments of these arrays. METHODS In the present work, the effect of electrode location on the electrochemical properties of the interface was compared. The impedances of the electrode arrays were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy in vitro in saline and in vivo four-week postimplantation. RESULTS There was not a significant effect of electrode location (subdural, intravascular, or epidural) on the impedance magnitude, and the effect of the electrode size on the impedance magnitude was frequency dependent. There was a frequency-dependent statistically significant effect of electrode location and electrode size on the phase angles of the three arrays. The subdural and epidural arrays showed phase shifts closer to -90° indicating the capacitive nature of the interface in these locations. The impact of placing electrodes within a blood vessel and adjacent to the blood vessel wall was most obvious when looking at the phase responses at frequencies below 10 kHz. CONCLUSION Our results show that intravascular electrodes, like those in subdural and epidural positions, show electrical properties that are suitable for recording. These results provide support for the use of intravascular arrays in clinically relevant neural prostheses and diagnostic devices. SIGNIFICANCE Comparison of electrochemical impedance of the epidural, intravascular, and subdural electrode array showed that all three locations are possible placement options, since impedances are in comparable ranges.","John, Sam E; Apollo, Nicholas V; Opie, Nicholas L; Rind, Gil S; Ronayne, Stephen M; May, Clive N; Oxley, Thomas J; Grayden, David B",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,310,1

In this study, we aimed to investigate the protective role of Elamipretide in the cryopreservation of bull's sperm. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study included 36 healthy Simmental bulls with an average age of 2 ± 0.5 years housed individually in pens. Two ejaculates were collected from each bull using an artificial vagina at 7 a.m. Subsequently, the semen was extended with animal protein-free commercial BIOXcell® extender (IMV Technologies, L'aigle, France) to a final concentration of 160x106 spermatozoa/mL, and rated in terms of motile sperm percentage, progressive motility, viability and morphological abnormality of spermatozoa. Semen samples that showed more than 60% motility and 60% viability, were selected for the experiment. The fresh semen was then divided into five equal fractions. The first fraction was left for the control group (without Elamipretide), to the next were added in succession 0.1; 1; 5; and 10 μM of Elamipretide TFA (Trifluoroacetic) (MedChemExpress, USA). After that semen was subjected to freezing and thawing. Next semen was assessed for motility, viability, mitochondrial membrane potential and acrosome integrity, and antioxidant activity (SOD, CAT, MDA). RESULTS It has been shown that a concentration of 5 and 10 μM proved to be the most effective in terms of tested parameters of the quality of sperm cells subjected to cryopreservation. CONCLUSION In conclusion, addition of the Elamipretide to the cryopreservation extender significantly improved frozen-thawed sperm cells quality and their function. The results of this study indicate that Elamipretide can be used as a cryoprotective agent to protect cells against the devastating effects of oxidative stress and increasing sperm survival after cryopreservation.","Kowalczyk, Alicja; Czerniawska Piątkowska, Ewa",Andrology,310,24

The history of past human coronavirus outbreaks resulting in similar health emergencies suggests there will be a substantial prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among COVID-19 survivors. To prepare neuropsychologists for the difficult task of differentiating PTSD-related from neuropathology-related deficits in the oncoming wave of COVID-19 survivors, we integrate research across a spectrum of related areas. METHODS Several areas of literature were reviewed: psychiatric, neurologic, and neuropathological outcomes of SARS and MERS patients; neurological outcomes in COVID-19 survivors; PTSD associated with procedures common to COVID-19 patients; and differentiating neuropsychological deficits due to PTSD from those due to acquired brain injuries in other patient groups. CONCLUSIONS Heightened risk of PTSD occurred in MERS and SARS survivors. While data concerning COVID-19 is lacking, PTSD is known to occur in patient groups who undergo similar hospital courses, including ICU survivors, patients who are intubated and mechanically ventilated, and those that experience delirium. Research with patients who develop PTSD in the context of mild traumatic brain injury further suggests that PTSD may account for some or all of a patient's subjective cognitive complaints and neuropsychological test performance. Recommendations are provided for assessing PTSD in the context of COVID-19.","Kaseda, Erin T; Levine, Andrew J",The Clinical neuropsychologist,310,1

The aim of this study was to present the real-world experiences of Solitaire-FR-related adverse events by reviewing the MAUDE (Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience) as published on the United States Food and Drug Administration website. In total, 85 adverse events related to the use of the Solitaire FR stent were reported between March 2012 and October 2014. In 80 patients these adverse events were attributable to inadvertent detachment of the device. Thirteen of these 80 patients (16%) died after the procedure. Morbidity data were available in 62 patients, among whom 11 (18%) had suffered a procedure-related injury. Detachment occurred at the first, second, and third pass in nine (21%), 21 (49%), and 13 (30%) of the 43 patients for whom this information was available, respectively.

METHODS 52 consecutive TPL indicated for congenital pulmonary airway malformation or interlobar pulmonary sequestration performed between 2009 and 2019 were reviewed prospectively to compare patients with absent fissure and no visible interlobar pulmonary artery (IPA) treated by stapling (group A; n = 10), incomplete fissure with partially visible IPA treated with an Enseal® or LigaSure™ device (group I; n = 17), and complete fissure with fully visible IPA treated by electrocautery (group C; n = 25). RESULTS Patient demographics were similar. Mean age at TPL was 2.82 years (range 0.03-9.81). Mean duration of follow-up was 4.77 years (range 0.33-10.19). Operative time and duration of chest tube insertion were similar (p = NS). Intraoperative blood loss was significantly lower in group C compared with group I (p = 0.028).

Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), an endoplasmic reticulum-based redox chaperone required for the functions of various fibrosis-related proteins; however, the mechanisms of action of PDIA3 in pulmonary fibrosis are not fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES To examine the role of club cells and PDIA3 in the pathology of pulmonary fibrosis and the therapeutic potential of inhibition of PDIA3 in lung fibrosis. METHODS Role of PDIA3 and aberrant club cells in lung fibrosis was studied by analyses of human transcriptome dataset from Lung Genomics Research Consortium, other public resources, the specific deletion or inhibition of PDIA3 in club cells and blocking SPP1 downstream of PDIA3 in mice. RESULTS PDIA3 and club cell secretory protein (SCGB1A1) signatures are upregulated in IPF compared with control patients. PDIA3 or SCGB1A1 increases also correlate with a decrease in lung function in patients with IPF. The bleomycin (BLM) model of lung fibrosis showed increases in PDIA3 in SCGB1A1 cells in the lung parenchyma. Ablation of Pdia3, specifically in SCGB1A1 cells, decreases parenchymal SCGB1A1 cells along with fibrosis in mice. The administration of a PDI inhibitor LOC14 reversed the BLM-induced parenchymal SCGB1A1 cells and fibrosis in mice. Evaluation of PDIA3 partners revealed that SPP1 is a major interactor in fibrosis. Blocking SPP1 attenuated the development of lung fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS Our study reveals a new relationship with distally localised club cells, PDIA3 and SPP1 in lung fibrosis and inhibition of PDIA3 or SPP1 attenuates lung fibrosis.","Kumar, Amit; Elko, Evan; Bruno, Sierra R; Mark, Zoe F; Chamberlain, Nicolas; Mihavics, Bethany Korwin; Chandrasekaran, Ravishankar; Walzer, Joseph; Ruban, Mona; Gold, Clarissa; Lam, Ying Wai; Ghandikota, Sudhir; Jegga, Anil G; Gomez, Jose L; Janssen-Heininger, Yvonne Mw; Anathy, Vikas",Thorax,310,1

Unfortunately, hand hygiene adherence of healthcare workers (HCWs) in Japan is suboptimal according to previous studies. OBJECTIVES Our objectives were to evaluate hand hygiene adherence among physicians and nurses before touching hospitalized patients and to evaluate changes in hand hygiene adherence after a multimodal intervention was implemented. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a pre- and postintervention study with HCWs at four tertiary hospitals in Niigata, Japan. Hand hygiene observations were conducted from June to August 2018 (preintervention) and February to March 2019 (postintervention). INTERVENTION The multimodal hand hygiene intervention recommended by the World Health Organization was tailored to each hospital and implemented from September 2018 to February 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We observed hand hygiene adherence before touching patients in each hospital and compared rates before and after intervention. Intervention components were also evaluated. RESULTS There were 2,018 patient observations preintervention and 1,630 postintervention. Overall, hand hygiene adherence improved from 453 of 2,018 preintervention observations (22.4%) to 548 of 1,630 postintervention observations (33.6%; P < .001). Rates improved more among nurses (13.9 percentage points) than among doctors (5.7 percentage points). Improvement varied among the hospitals: Hospital B (18.4 percentage points) was highest, followed by Hospitals D (11.4 percentage points), C (11.3 percentage points), and Hospital A (6.5 percentage points). CONCLUSIONS A multimodal intervention improved hand hygiene adherence rates in physicians and nurses in Niigata, Japan; however, further improvement is necessary. Given the current suboptimal hand hygiene adherence rates in Japanese hospitals, the spread of COVID-19 within the hospital setting is a concern.","Saitoh, Akihiko; Sato, Kiyomi; Magara, Yoko; Osaki, Kakuei; Narita, Kiyoko; Shioiri, Kumiko; Fowler, Karen E; Ratz, David; Saint, Sanjay",Journal of hospital medicine,310,17

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of hearing loss among somatosensory tinnitus patients with temporomandibular disorders and to assess the influence of tinnitus on patients' quality of life. Method An otolaryngologist examined 585 patients in order to detect and evaluate the presence of tinnitus. Subjects were evaluated using the Portuguese version of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. An analysis of the somatic component of tinnitus was performed. Tinnitus was rated according to its onset (at least 6 months) and intensity with a visual analog scale. The sample was composed of 100 patients with somatosensory tinnitus divided into two groups: Group 1 (with temporomandibular disorder, n = 85) and Group 2 (without temporomandibular disorder, n = 15). The audiological evaluation was composed of pure-tone audiometry, high-frequency audiometry, tympanometry, and transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions. The impact of tinnitus on quality of life was assessed by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory adapted and validated to Portuguese language. Results Pure-tone audiometry did not differ with statistical significance between groups (p = .29), neither did the high-frequency audiometry results (p = .74). Tinnitus Handicap Inventory scores also did not show any differences between Groups 1 and 2 (p = .67). Conclusions Subjects with somatosensory tinnitus, who also have temporomandibular disorders, do not seem to have hearing impairment. Also, they do not have a higher quality of life handicap when compared to those without tinnitus and temporomandibular disorder.","Hilgenberg-Sydney, Priscila Brenner; Saldanha, Aline Dantas Diógenes; Lopes, Andréa Cintra; Conti, Paulo César Rodrigues",American journal of audiology,310,19

However, traditional air quality assessments may fail to provide comprehensive, real-time monitoring of air quality because of the sparse distribution of air quality monitoring stations. Overcoming some key limitations of traditional surface monitoring data, Web-based social media platforms, such as Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook, provide a promising tool and novel perspective for environmental monitoring, prediction, and evaluation. This study aims to investigate the relationship between PM2.5 levels and people's emotional intensity by observing social media postings. This study defines the ""emotional intensity"" indicator, which is measured by the number of negative posts on Weibo, based on Weibo data related to haze from 2016 and 2017. This study estimates sentiment polarity using a recurrent neural networks model based on LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and verifies the correlation between high PM2.5 levels and negative posts on Weibo using a Pearson correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression model. This study makes the following observations: (1) Taking the two-year data as an example, this study recorded the significant influence of PM2.5 levels on netizens' posting behavior. (2) Air quality, meteorological factors, the seasons, and other factors have a strong influence on netizens' emotional intensity. (3) From a quantitative viewpoint, the level of PM2.5 varies by 1 unit, and the number of negative Weibo posts fluctuates by 1.0168 units. Thus, it can be concluded that netizens' emotional intensity is significantly positively affected by levels of PM2.5. The high correlation between PM2.5 levels and emotional intensity and the sensitivity of social media data shows that social media data can be used to provide a new perspective on the assessment of air quality.","Shan, Siqing; Ju, Xijie; Wei, Yigang; Wang, Zijin",International journal of environmental research and public health,310,1

METHODS We asked our students to install the multiplatform Fiji viewer with Beth Israel PET/CT plugin (http://petctviewer.org) on their personal computers and connect to a central image database in the university network based on the public domain orthanc server (https://orthanc-server.com). At the end of course, we conducted an anonymous student survey. RESULTS The new system was online within eight days, including regulatory approval. All 76 students (100 %) in the fifth year completed their course work, reading five anonymized PET/CT cases as planned. 41 (53 %) students answered the survey. Fiji was challenging to install with a mean score of 1.8 on a 5-point Likert scale (5 = easy, 1 = difficult). Fiji was more difficult to use (score 3.0) than the previously used diagnostic workstations in the hospital (score 4.1; p < 0.001, paired t-test).

No previous systematic review has provided conclusive data on catheter-related infection (CRI) occurrence after NST introduction, nor have previous studies performed meta-analysis or graded the evidence. AIMS To systematically evaluate the effects of implementing an NST for hospitalised adults on PN and compare these with standard care. METHODS This was a systematic review and meta-analysis, pre-registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020218094). On November 24, 2020, PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Clinical Key were searched. Clinical trials and observational studies with a standard care comparator were included. Primary outcome was relative reduction in CRI rate. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate effects, and evidence was rated using Cochrane and GRADE methodologies. RESULTS Twenty-seven studies with 8166 patients were included. Across 10 studies, NST introduction reduced the CRI rate (IRR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19-0.53) with -8 (95% CI: -12 to -5) episodes per 1000 catheter days compared with standard care. Hypophosphataemia occurred less frequently (IRD = -12%, 95% CI: -24% to -1%) and 30-day mortality decreased (IRD = -6%, 95% CI: -11% to -1%). Inappropriate PN use decreased, both judged by indication (IRD = -18%, 95% CI: -28% to -9%) and duration (IRD = -21%, 95% CI: -33% to -9%). Evidence was rated very low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS This study documents the clinical impact of introducing an NST, with moderate-grade evidence for the reduction of CRI occurrence compared with standard care. Further, NST introduction significantly reduced metabolic complications, mortality, and inappropriate PN use.","Eriksen, Marcel Kjaersgaard; Crooks, Benjamin; Baunwall, Simon Mark Dahl; Rud, Charlotte Lock; Lal, Simon; Hvas, Christian Lodberg",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,310,10

MATERIALS AND METHODS A qualitative descriptive study was conducted in participants with MNCD recruited from two residential settings. Participants exergamed for 15 min, three times per week for 8 weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in all participants of the trial after 4 and 8 weeks. Audio files were transcribed and subsequently a thematic content analysis was performed using NVivo 12. Activity logs including adherence and attrition rates were kept. RESULTS Thirty-one participants with MNCD participated (median age = 85 (67-93) years; 77.4% women; Mini-Mental State Examination score = 19 (10-25)). Four broad themes emerged: (1) cognitive effects; (2) physical effects; (3) psychosocial effects and (4) motivators. The tailored exergame program was perceived as enjoyable. It stimulated participants' attention, concentration, reaction time, and memory. Participants reported improvements in balance, flexibility, and gait. Exergaming made participants energetic and calm. The attrition rate was 0% and the mean attendance rate was 79.3%. CONCLUSIONS The results indicate that standing balance exergaming is feasible, beneficial, and engaging in people with MNCD.

METHODS An analysis of medical data from weekly, community-based physical activity events (parkrun) at 702 UK locations over a 6-year period (29 476 294 participations between 2014 and 2019) was conducted in order to define the incidence and clinical correlates of serious life-threatening, non-life-threatening and fatal medical encounters. RESULTS 84 serious life-threatening encounters (overall incidence rate=0.26/100 000 participations) occurred including 18 fatalities (0.056/100 000 participations). Statistical modelling revealed that the probabilities of serious life-threatening encounters were exceptionally low, however, male sex, increasing age, slower personal best parkrun time and less prior running engagement/experience (average number of runs per year and number of years as a parkrun participant) were associated with increased probability of serious life-threatening encounters. These were largely accounted for by cardiac arrest (48/84, 57%) and acute coronary syndromes (20/84, 24%). Non-life-threatening medical encounters were mainly attributed to tripping or falling, with a reported incidence of 39.2/100 000 participations. CONCLUSIONS Serious life-threatening and fatal medical encounters associated with parkrun participation are extremely rare. In the context of a global public health crisis due to inactivity, this finding underscores the safety and corollary public health value of community running/walking events as a strategy to promote physical activity.","Pedlar, Charles R; Myrissa, Kyriaki; Barry, Megan; Khwaja, Iman G; Simpkin, Andrew J; Newell, John; Scarrott, Carl; Whyte, Greg P; Kipps, Courtney; Baggish, Aaron L",British journal of sports medicine,310,17

Alphavirus replication sites consist of numerous bulb-shaped membrane invaginations (spherules), which contain the double-stranded replication intermediates. Time course studies with Semliki Forest virus (SFV)-infected cells were combined with live-cell imaging and electron microscopy to reveal that the replication complex spherules of SFV undergo an unprecedented large-scale movement between cellular compartments. The spherules first accumulated at the plasma membrane and were then internalized using an endocytic process that required a functional actin-myosin network, as shown by blebbistatin treatment. Wortmannin and other inhibitors indicated that the internalization of spherules also required the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The spherules therefore represent an unusual type of endocytic cargo. After endocytosis, spherule-containing vesicles were highly dynamic and had a neutral pH. These primary carriers fused with acidic endosomes and moved long distances on microtubules, in a manner prevented by nocodazole. The result of the large-scale migration was the formation of a very stable compartment, where the spherules were accumulated on the outer surfaces of unusually large and static acidic vacuoles localized in the pericentriolar region. Our work highlights both fundamental similarities and important differences in the processes that lead to the modified membrane compartments in cells infected by distinct groups of positive-sense RNA viruses.","Spuul, Pirjo; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Kääriäinen, Leevi; Ahola, Tero",Journal of virology,310,33

METHODS This study adopted a repeated cross-sectional design and surveyed unionized nurses in British Columbia (BC), Canada on three occasions: September 2019 (Time 1, pre-pandemic), April 2020 (Time 2, early-pandemic) and June 2020 (Time 3). RESULTS A total of 10,117 responses were collected across three timepoints. This study found a significant increase of 10% to 15% in anxiety and depression between Time 1 and 2, and relative stability between Time 2 and 3, with Time 3 levels still higher than Time 1 levels. Cross-sector analyses showed similar patterns of findings for acute care and community nurses. Long-term care nurses showed a two-fold increase in the prevalence of anxiety early pandemic, followed by a sharper decline mid pandemic. CONCLUSIONS COVID-19 has had short- and mid-term mental health implications for BC nurses particularly among those in the long-term care sector. Future research should evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of health workers in different contexts, such as jurisdictional analyses, and better understand the long-term health and labour market consequences of elevated mental health symptoms over an extended time period.","Havaei, Farinaz; Smith, Peter; Oudyk, John; Potter, Guy G",Annals of epidemiology,310,16

BACKGROUND SCAFFOLD was a prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trial in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis (angiographically defined as symptomatic ≥50% or asymptomatic ≥80%) at increased risk for adverse events from carotid endarterectomy. Interim 30-day analysis demonstrated low rates of death/stroke/myocardial infarction (DSMI; 3.0%) and stroke (1.1%) in a high surgical risk population. METHODS The rate of DSMI within 30 days plus ipsilateral stroke between 31 days and 1 year (primary endpoint) was compared to a predetermined performance goal. Secondary outcomes of freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR; diameter stenosis ≥80% by core lab angiography, or ≥50% with clinical symptoms) and restenosis (≥80% diameter stenosis by core lab angiography) are reported as Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimates. RESULTS Of the 312 patients enrolled and treated, 264 were eligible per protocol and evaluable for major adverse events at 30 days, and 244 (92%) of these were evaluable at 1 year. The proportion of patients with DSMI at 1 year was 4.5% and was significantly lower than the prespecified performance goal of 16.9% (p < .00001). The proportion with ipsilateral stroke from 31 to 365 days was 1.2%. The KM estimates of 1-year event probability were 1.6% for CD-TLR and 1.2% for restenosis. CONCLUSIONS Use of the mesh-covered GCS in the SCAFFOLD trial demonstrated 100% technical success and low rates of both periprocedural and late stroke, with durable patency at 1 year.

Biomechanical factors may play a key role in the aetiology of knee OA, therefore, a broad class of interventions involves the application or wear of devices designed to mechanically support knees with OA. These include gait aids, bracing, taping, orthotics and footwear. The literature regarding efficacy of mechanical interventions has been conflicting or inconclusive, and this may be because certain subgroups with knee OA respond better to mechanical interventions. Our primary aim is to identify subgroups with knee OA who respond favourably to mechanical interventions. METHODS AND ANALYSIS We will conduct a systematic review to identify randomised clinical trials of any mechanical intervention for the treatment of knee OA. We will invite lead authors of eligible studies to share individual participant data (IPD). We will perform an IPD meta-analysis for each type of mechanical intervention to evaluate efficacy, with our main outcome being pain. Where IPD are not available, this will be achieved using aggregate data. We will then evaluate five potential treatment effect modifiers using a two-stage approach. If data permit, we will also evaluate whether biomechanics mediate the effects of mechanical interventions on pain in knee OA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No new data will be collected in this study. We will adhere to institutional, national and international regulations regarding the secure and confidential sharing of IPD, addressing ethics as indicated. We will disseminate findings via international conferences, open-source publication in peer-reviewed journals and summaries posted on websites serving the public and clinicians.

We described the indications, clinical characteristics, socio-economic circumstances and outcomes of children enroled in a tracheostomy home care programme in South Africa. METHODS We performed a retrospective chart review of children receiving a tracheostomy and enroled in the Breatheasy programme at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town. Medical and background characteristics were recorded. Influences of socio-economic variables and underlying medical conditions on length of hospital stay, unplanned readmissions and mortality in the first year after discharge were evaluated. RESULTS In the period 2008-2012, 157 patients were discharged home with a tracheostomy. Median hospital stay after tracheostomy insertion was significantly longer when parents had incomplete schooling compared to completed secondary school or higher education; 30 days (IQR 21-53) versus 23 days (IQR 16-33), respectively. Unplanned readmissions in the first year were documented for 72 patients (45.9%). The risk for unplanned readmission was 2.6 times higher in families with substance abuse the risk of respiratory infections was two-fold in case of household cigarette smoke exposure (OR 2.3.) Tracheostomy-related mortality was low (1.2%). An underlying medical condition was the only independent significant risk factor for mortality (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.8-14.3). CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that despite difficult socio-economic circumstances, home ventilation of children with a tracheostomy is safe, provided caregivers are adequately trained and supported.","Groenendijk, Ilse; Booth, Jane; van Dijk, Monique; Argent, Andrew; Zampoli, Marco",International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,310,1

During times of surge testing or enhanced pandemic surveillance, public health laboratories (PHLs) may experience overwhelming demand for testing, even while the prevalence of positive specimens remains low. To improve laboratory capacity and testing efficiency during surges, we evaluated whether nasopharyngeal (NP)/throat swab specimens can be pooled and tested for the presence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus without a reduction in sensitivity. Pools of 10 specimens were extracted and concentrated upon elution on the MagNA Pure LC instrument, and real-time PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast platform, using the CDC swine influenza virus real-time RT-PCR detection panel (rRT-PCR swine flu panel). Specimens in positive pools were singly re-extracted and retested by PCR to identify individual positive samples. Initial studies showed that spiking a pool of nine negative specimens (100 μl each) or 900 μl of virus transport medium with 100 μl of a positive clinical specimen caused no loss of sensitivity by rRT-PCR testing. Pools containing either multiple positive specimens or specimens positive for other respiratory viruses also showed no negative effect on crossing threshold (C(T)) values. To test the robustness of the pooling protocol, a panel of 50 blinded samples was sent to three PHLs and tested in five pools of 10. All PHLs correctly identified the positive specimens. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using a pooling strategy to increase capacity and conserve resources during surge testing and periods of enhanced influenza surveillance when the prevalence is low.","Van, Tam T; Miller, Joseph; Warshauer, David M; Reisdorf, Erik; Jernigan, Daniel; Humes, Rosemary; Shult, Peter A",Journal of clinical microbiology,310,1

However, the distinct expression pattern of factors associated with the IFNα/β pathway in different CNS resident cell populations implicate complex cooperative pathways in IFNα/β induction and responsiveness. Herein we show that mice devoid of IFNAR1 signaling in calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha (CaMKIIα) expressing neurons (CaMKIIcre:IFNARfl/fl mice) infected with a mildly pathogenic neurotropic coronavirus (MHV-A59) developed severe encephalomyelitis with hind-limb paralysis and succumbed within 7 days. Increased virus spread in CaMKIIcre:IFNARfl/fl mice compared to IFNARfl/fl mice not only affected neurons in the forebrain, but also the mid-hind brain and spinal cords, but excluded the cerebellum. Infection was also increased in glia. The lack of viral control in CaMKIIcre:IFNARfl/fl relative to control mice coincided with sustained Cxcl1 and Ccl2 mRNAs, but a decrease in mRNA levels of IFNα/β pathway genes as well as Il6, Tnf, and Il1β between days 4 and 6 post infection (p.i.). T cell accumulation and IFNγ production, an essential component of virus control, were not altered. However, IFNγ responsiveness was impaired in microglia/macrophages irrespective of similar pSTAT1 nuclear translocation as in infected controls. The results reveal how perturbation of IFNα/β signaling in neurons can worsen disease course and disrupt complex interactions between the IFNα/β and IFNγ pathways in achieving optimal antiviral responses.IMPORTANCE IFNα/β induction limits CNS viral spread by establishing an antiviral state, but also promotes blood brain barrier integrity, adaptive immunity and microglia/macrophage activation. However, the extent to which glial or neuronal signaling contributes to these diverse IFNα/β functions is poorly understood. Using a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus encephalomyelitis model this report demonstrates an essential role of IFNα/β receptor 1 (IFNAR1) specifically in neurons to control virus spread, regulate IFNγ signaling, and prevent acute mortality. The results support that effective neuronal IFNAR1 signaling compensates for their low basal expression of genes in the IFNα/β pathway compared to glia. The data further highlight the importance of tightly regulated communication between the IFNα/β and IFNγ signaling pathways to optimize antiviral IFNγ activity.","Hwang, Mihyun; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,310,1

Therefore, cancer patients require higher level measures for preventing and treating infectious diseases. furthermore, cancer patients may bear additional risk due to the restriction of access to the routine diagnostic and therapeutic services during such epidemic. Since most of the attention of health systems is towards patients affected with COVID-19, the need for structured and unified approaches to COVID-19 prevention and care specific to cancer patients and cancer centers is felt more than ever.

To assess if all this might be safely achieved with a robot, this study aimed at qualifying the aseptic preparation process with the robotic system APOTECAchemo. METHODS The aseptic compounding of patient-individual cytostatic solutions was simulated with media fill simulation tests to qualify the performance according to European GMP Annex 1. The contamination in the environment was measured in critical places using settle plates, contact plates, active air sampling and particle counting. Media-fill simulation tests were prepared in 3 production batches. The second part of the study evaluated the microbiological shelf-life of commercial drug vials after repeated puncturing. On six days, fifty syringes of 15 ml media were prepared from the same 50 vials with the robot. After each preparation, vials were covered with an IVA seal upon unloading from the robot to protect them from microbiological contamination. RESULTS No microbiological contamination was found in any of the 96 media fill preparations, nor in any of the 300 syringes that were prepared with repeated puncturing. The compounding area met class A limits, while class A criteria were not fulfilled by the contact plates and settle plates placed on the right side of the loading area. There, the average colony forming units (cfu) were 3 and 1.17, respectively, meeting class B criteria. CONCLUSIONS Robotical compounding of cytostatic drugs with APOTECAchemo meets the microbiological requirements of the European GMP. In addition, the robot can reuse vials repeatedly and safely, thereby enabling extended usage.","Geersing, T H; Franssen, E J F; Pilesi, F; Crul, M",European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,310,1

This review summarises the data and outlines the potential challenges in the field of long-acting antiretroviral therapy (ART). RECENT FINDINGS In recent years, monthly and two monthly long-acting injectable ART in the form of cabotegravir and rilpivirine has shown safety and efficacy in large-scale phase 3 randomised control trials. Also, agents with novel mechanisms of action, such as Lenacapavir, have been tested in early-phase studies and are currently being tested in phase 2-3 clinical trials; if successful, this may allow six-monthly dosing schedules. SUMMARY However, despite evidence that suggests that these therapies are efficacious and acceptable to patients, the challenge of integrating these agents into our current healthcare infrastructure and making these novel agents cost-effective and available to the populations most likely to benefit remains. The next frontier for long-acting therapy will be to introduce these agents in a real-world setting ensuring that the groups most in need of long-acting therapy are not left behind.","Thornhill, John; Orkin, Chloe",Current opinion in infectious diseases,310,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS This prospective monocentric study included consecutive patients before aortic valvular replacement. All patients underwent: i), 1.5T CMR with pre and post contrast T1 mapping sequence and ECV computation; ii), serum quantification of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and iii), myocardial biopsies were collected during surgery to assess collagen volume fraction (CVF). Patients with coronary artery disease were excluded. Correlation between native T1, ECV, CVF and serum biomarkers were assessed using Pearson correlation test. Agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV with global ECV was assessed using Bland-Altman test. RESULTS Twenty-one patients, 16 with aortic stenosis and 5 with aortic regurgitation were included. There were 12 men and 9 women with a mean age of 74.1±6.8 (SD) years (range: 32-84 years). Mean global ECV value was 26.7±2.7 (SD) % (range: 23.4-32.5%) and mean CVF value was 12.4±9.7% (range: 3.2-25.7%). ECV assessed at the basal anteroseptal segment correlated moderately with CVF (r=0.6; P=0.0026). There was a strong correlation and agreement between basal anteroseptal ECV and global ECV, (r=0.8; P<0.0001; bias 5.4±6.1%) but no correlation between global ECV and CVF (r=0.5; P=0.10). Global ECV poorly correlated with serum TIMP-1 (r=0.4; P=0.037) and MMP-2 (r=0.4; P=0.047). No correlation was found between serum biomarkers and basal anteroseptal- ECV or native T1. CONCLUSION In patients with severe aortic valvulopathy, diffuse myocardial fibrosis assessed by anterosepto-basal ECV correlates with histological myocardial fibrosis. Anteroseptobasal ECV strongly correlates with global ECV, which poorly correlates with TIMP-1 and MMP-2, serum biomarkers involved in the progression of heart failure.","Foussier, C; Barral, P A; Jerosh-Herold, M; Gariboldi, V; Rapacchi, S; Gallon, A; Bartoli, A; Bentatou, Z; Guye, M; Bernard, M; Jacquier, A",Diagnostic and interventional imaging,310,6

Although immunosuppressed individuals are thought to be at an increased risk of severe disease, little is known about their clinical presentation, disease course, or outcomes. METHODS We report 15 kidney transplant recipients from the Columbia University kidney transplant program who required hospitalization for confirmed COVID-19, and describe their management, clinical course, and outcomes. RESULTS Patients presented most often with a fever (87%) and/or cough (67%). Initial chest x-ray most commonly showed bilateral infiltrates, but 33% had no acute radiographic findings. Patients were managed with immunosuppression reduction and the addition of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Although 27% of our patients needed mechanical ventilation, over half were discharged home by the end of follow-up.

This study used data from a systematic literature review that examined the intersection between climate change, migration, and health. The study aimed to synthesize policy recommendations in the peer-reviewed literature, regarding this type of environmental migration with respect to health, to strengthen the evidence-base. Systematic searches were conducted in four academic databases (PubMed, Ovid Medline, Global Health and Scopus) and Google Scholar for empirical studies published between 1990-2020 that used any study design to investigate migration and health in the context of climate change. Studies underwent a two-stage protocol-based screening process and eligible studies were appraised for quality using a standardized mixed-methods tool. From the initial 2425 hits, 68 articles were appraised for quality and included in the synthesis. Among the policy recommendations, six themes were discernible: (1) avoid the universal promotion of migration as an adaptive response to climate risk; (2) preserve cultural and social ties of mobile populations; (3) enable the participation of migrants in decision-making in sites of relocation and resettlement; (4) strengthen health systems and reduce barriers for migrant access to health care; (5) support and promote optimization of social determinants of migrant health; (6) integrate health into loss and damage assessments related to climate change, and consider immobile and trapped populations. The results call for transformative policies that support the health and wellbeing of people engaging in or affected by mobility responses, including those whose migration decisions and experiences are influenced by climate change, and to establish and develop inclusive migrant healthcare.","Nayna Schwerdtle, Patricia; Stockemer, Julia; Bowen, Kathryn J; Sauerborn, Rainer; McMichael, Celia; Danquah, Ina",International journal of environmental research and public health,310,7

Methods Data from a Chinese multi-institutional registry and the US SEER database on stage I to IIIA resected NSCLC (2001 to 2008) were analyzed for the relationship between the ELN count and stage migration and overall survival (OS) by using multivariable models. The series of the mean positive LNs, odds ratios (ORs), and hazard ratios (HRs) were fitted with a LOWESS smoother, and the structural break points were determined by Chow test. The selected cut point was validated with the SEER 2009 cohort. Results Although the distribution of ELN count differed between the Chinese registry (n = 5,706) and the SEER database (n = 38,806; median, 15 versus seven, respectively), both cohorts exhibited significantly proportional increases from N0 to N1 and N2 disease (SEER OR, 1.038; China OR, 1.012; both P < .001) and serial improvements in OS (N0 disease: SEER HR, 0.986; China HR, 0.981; both P < .001; N1 and N2 disease: SEER HR, 0.989; China HR, 0.984; both P < .001) as the ELN count increased after controlling for confounders. Cut point analysis showed a threshold ELN count of 16 in patients with declared node-negative disease, which were examined in the derivation cohorts (SEER 2001 to 2008 HR, 0.830; China HR, 0.738) and validated in the SEER 2009 cohort (HR, 0.837). Conclusion A greater number of ELNs is associated with more-accurate node staging and better long-term survival of resected NSCLC. We recommend 16 ELNs as the cut point for evaluating the quality of LN examination or prognostic stratification postoperatively for patients with declared node-negative disease.","Liang, Wenhua; He, Jiaxi; Shen, Yaxing; Shen, Jianfei; He, Qihua; Zhang, Jianrong; Jiang, Gening; Wang, Qun; Liu, Lunxu; Gao, Shugeng; Liu, Deruo; Wang, Zheng; Zhu, Zhihua; Ng, Calvin S H; Liu, Chia-Chuan; Horsleben Petersen, René; Rocco, Gaetano; D'Amico, Thomas; Brunelli, Alessandro; Chen, Haiquan; Zhi, Xiuyi; Liu, Bo; Yang, Yixin; Chen, Wensen; Zhou, Qian; He, Jianxing",Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,310,1

Many studies investigating the effects of such practices fail to include an active control group. Given the frequency with which people are selecting such interventions as a form of self-management, it is important to determine their effectiveness. Thus, this review investigates the effects of practices that include yoga asanas, with and without mindfulness-based stress reduction, compared to an active control, on physiological markers of stress. MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials published in English compared practices that included yoga asanas, with and without mindfulness-based stress reduction, to an active control, on stress-related physiological measures. The review focused on studies that measured physiological parameters such as blood pressure, heart rate, cortisol and peripheral cytokine expression. MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SocINDEX, PubMed, and Scopus were searched in May 2016 and updated in December 2016. Randomised controlled trials were included if they assessed at least one of the following outcomes: heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability, mean arterial pressure, C-reactive protein, interleukins or cortisol. Risk of bias assessments included sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of assessors, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. Meta-analysis was undertaken using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software Version 3. Sensitivity analyses were performed using 'one-study-removed' analysis. Subgroup analysis was conducted for different yoga and control group types, including mindfulness-based stress reduction versus non-mindfulness-based stress reduction based interventions, different populations, length of intervention, and method of data analysis. A random-effects model was used in all analyses. RESULTS Forty two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Interventions that included yoga asanas were associated with reduced evening cortisol, waking cortisol, ambulatory systolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, high frequency heart rate variability, fasting blood glucose, cholesterol and low density lipoprotein, compared to active control. However, the reported interventions were heterogeneous. CONCLUSIONS Practices that include yoga asanas appear to be associated with improved regulation of the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system in various populations.","Pascoe, Michaela C; Thompson, David R; Ski, Chantal F",Psychoneuroendocrinology,310,24

However, in laparoscopic rectal surgery, the overall conversion rate is nearly 20%. Transanal TME combined with laparoscopy, known as Hybrid NOTES, is a less invasive procedure that provides adequate solutions to some of the limitations of rectal laparoscopy. Transanal TME via TEO with technical variants (intracorporeal resection and anastomosis, TEO review of the anastomosis) attempts to standardize and simplify the procedure. METHOD Prospective observational study was used describe and assess the technique in terms of conversion to open surgery, overall morbidity, surgical site infection and hospital stay. The sample comprised consecutive patients diagnosed with rectal tumor less than 10 cm from the anal verge who were candidates for low anterior resection using TME (except T4). Demographic, surgical, postoperative, and pathological variables were analyzed, as well as morbidity rates. RESULTS From September 2012 to August 2014, 32 patients were included. The conversion rate was 0%. Overall morbidity was 31.3%, SSI rate was 9.4%, and mean hospital stay was 8 days. Oncological radical criteria were achieved with pathological parameters of 94% of complete TME and a median circumferential margin of 13 mm. CONCLUSION The introduction of technical variants of TEO for transanal resection can facilitate a procedure that requires extensive experience in transanal and laparoscopic surgery.

Silicosis, a type of pneumoconiosis, is caused by inhaling respirable crystalline silica (RCS) dust. Although silicosis can be fatal, it is completely preventable. Hundreds of thousands of workers globally are at risk of being exposed to RCS at the workplace from various activities in many industries. Currently, in Australia and internationally, there are a range of methods used for the respiratory surveillance of workers exposed to RCS. These methods include health and exposure questionnaires, spirometry, chest X-rays, and HRCT. However, these methods predominantly do not detect the disease until it has significantly progressed. For this reason, there is a growing body of research investigating early detection methods for silicosis, particularly biomarkers. This literature review summarises the research to date on early detection methods for silicosis and makes recommendations for future work in this area. Findings from this review conclude that there is a critical need for an early detection method for silicosis, however, further laboratory- and field-based research is required.","Austin, Emma K; James, Carole; Tessier, John",International journal of environmental research and public health,310,1

Automated lung infections classification using chest X-ray (CXR) images could strengthen diagnostic capability when handling COVID-19. However, classifying COVID-19 from pneumonia cases using CXR image is a difficult task because of shared spatial characteristics, high feature variation and contrast diversity between cases. Moreover, massive data collection is impractical for a newly emerged disease, which limited the performance of data thirsty deep learning models. To address these challenges, Multiscale Attention Guided deep network with Soft Distance regularization (MAG-SD) is proposed to automatically classify COVID-19 from pneumonia CXR images. In MAG-SD, MA-Net is used to produce prediction vector and attention from multiscale feature maps. To improve the robustness of trained model and relieve the shortage of training data, attention guided augmentations along with a soft distance regularization are posed, which aims at generating meaningful augmentations and reduce noise. Our multiscale attention model achieves better classification performance on our pneumonia CXR image dataset. Plentiful experiments are proposed for MAG-SD which demonstrates its unique advantage in pneumonia classification over cutting-edge models.

Tapentadol is a central analgesic with an improved tolerability profile that may be particularly beneficial to the elderly CLBP. METHODS We performed an observational retrospective study to comparatively assess the efficacy and tolerability of tapentadol in young and elderly patients with severe CLBP. Sixtyfive young patients (< 65 years) and 87 elderly patients (≥ 65 years) were titrated on tapentadol extended release to their optimal dose (25-250 mg bid) over 1 month and, then, maintained at that dose for 3 months. The primary endpoint were changes from baseline in 24-h pain intensity on a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at month-4 of treatment (titration plus maintenance periods). Patients were assessed for several efficacy and tolerability outcomes using a battery of scales and tests for neuropathic pain intensity, quality of life and sleep, and cognitive and gastrointestinal functions. RESULTS At pretreatment, young and elderly patients had similar pain intensities with younger patients presenting with more intense depressive and neuropathic pain symptoms, and lesser comorbidities and durations of pain (P < 0.05). Thirty-eight patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events occurring mostly during titration. Treatment with tapentadol was associated with comparable and clinically meaningful pain reductions in 24-h NRS from baseline to treatment month-4 both in young and elderly patients (- 5.3 ± 1.4 and - 4.8 ± 2.1; P < 0.01); a 50% pain relief was achieved in 66% and 58% of young and elderly patients. The percentage of patients with a neuropathic component decreased similarly in young and elderly patients (from 38 to 0% and from 19 to 3%; P < 0.01). Quality of life and sleep improved. The performances in global cognition and sustained attention tasks remained stable or improved across all age group. CONCLUSIONS These findings indicate that tapentadol extended release maintains efficacy and good tolerability in CLBP patients with advancing age.","Freo, Ulderico; Furnari, Maurizio; Ambrosio, Francesco; Navalesi, Paolo",Aging clinical and experimental research,310,1

Optimizations focusing on the following aspects are considered: (1) employing n-type SiNW and controlling the impurity doping concentration of SiNW at approximately 2 × 1016-6 × 1016 atoms/cm3 to obtain a suitable charge density, (2) minimizing the SiNW width to 16.0 nm to increase the surface area-to-volume ratio, (3) using a native oxide layer on SiNW as a gate insulator to transport the captured charge molecules closer to the SiNW surface, (4) modifying the SiNW surface by 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid coupling to form a high-density self-assembled monolayer for enhancing the stability bound molecules, and (5) functionalizing the SiNW with ovalbumin molecules for specifically capturing the target immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. The sensing performance was evaluated by detecting IgG with concentrations ranging from 6 aM to 600 nM and control experiments. The SiNW biosensor revealed ultrahigh sensitivity and specific detection of target IgG with a measured limit of detection of 6 aM. The integration of the critical SiNW biosensor factors provides a significant possibility of a rapid and ultrasensitive diagnosis of diseases at their early stages.","Zhang, Hui; Kikuchi, Naoki; Ohshima, Noriyasu; Kajisa, Taira; Sakata, Toshiya; Izumi, Takashi; Sone, Hayato",ACS applied materials & interfaces,310,1

The presence of various receptors or components of the renin - angiotensin system in the skin, and particularly in melanocytes, determines the possible influence on this tissue by the so-called angiotensin receptor blockers or sartans. Thiazide diuretics can further influence the processes of carcinogenesis in all forms of skin cancer - melanocytic and non-melanocytic. AREAS COVERED We present a 67-year-old patient treated for a period of 3 years with a combined preparation containing Telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide 80 mg/12.5 mg. Within 2 years, the patient observed the rapid development of a nevus that progressed to melanoma and was subsequently identified histopathologically as nevus-associated cutaneous melanoma with a 0.6 mm thickness, Clark IV. Following surgical treatment, no tumor progression has occurred to date. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient who developed a nevus-associated cutaneous melanoma after combination therapy with generic sartan and hydrochlorothiazide. EXPERT OPINION We discuss the diverse but mutually potentiating pro-carcinogenic effects of this class of agents, potentially leading to the development of cutaneous melanoma.","Tchernev, Georgi; Patterson, James W",Expert review of clinical pharmacology,310,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS CAMP Air was developed using an iterative process with input from stakeholders and incorporating usability testing results (n = 14 adolescents). To test CAMP Air's initial impact, 61 adolescents from two New York City public high schools (n = 37) and from clinics, community-based organizations, and third-party recruitment services (i.e., community sample; n = 24) were enrolled in a randomized pilot trial. Participants were randomized to CAMP Air (n = 30) or information-and-referral control intervention (n = 31). A point-person worked with school participants to complete CAMP Air. RESULTS CAMP Air participants were satisfied with the intervention and its value for supporting self-management, completing on average 6 of 7 modules. Relative to controls, CAMP Air participants demonstrated significantly improved asthma knowledge, asthma control, night wakening and school absences, and less risk for urgent care visits. Adolescents enrolled in schools completed more modules and had significantly fewer nights woken and school absences than community enrollees. CONCLUSION CAMP Air improves asthma outcomes among adolescents with uncontrolled asthma. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS A web-based intervention CAMP Air is a promising intervention. When a point-person works with adolescents, CAMP Air's access and impact are improved.","Bruzzese, Jean-Marie; George, Maureen; Liu, Jianfang; Evans, David; Naar, Sylvie; DeRosier, Melissa E; Thomas, James M",Patient education and counseling,310,7

OBJECTIVES To determine whether physical activity is associated with bleeding in elderly patients taking anticoagulants. PATIENTS/METHODS In a prospective multicenter cohort study of 988 patients aged ≥ 65 years receiving anticoagulants for venous thromboembolism, we assessed patients' self-reported physical activity level. The primary outcome was the time to a first major bleeding, defined as fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding in a critical site, or bleeding causing a fall in hemoglobin or leading to transfusions. The secondary outcome was the time to a first clinically relevant non-major bleeding. We examined the association between physical activity level and time to a first bleeding by using competing risk regression, accounting for death as a competing event. We adjusted for known bleeding risk factors and anticoagulation as a time-varying covariate. RESULTS During a mean follow-up of 22 months, patients with a low, moderate, and high physical activity level had an incidence of major bleeding of 11.6, 6.3, and 3.1 events per 100 patient-years and an incidence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding of 14.0, 10.3, and 7.7 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. A high physical activity level was significantly associated with a lower risk of major bleeding (adjusted sub-hazard ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.72). There was no association between physical activity and non-major bleeding. CONCLUSIONS A high level of physical activity is associated with a decreased risk of major bleeding in elderly patients receiving anticoagulant therapy.","Frey, P M; Méan, M; Limacher, A; Jaeger, K; Beer, H-J; Frauchiger, B; Aschwanden, M; Rodondi, N; Righini, M; Egloff, M; Osterwalder, J; Kucher, N; Angelillo-Scherrer, A; Husmann, M; Banyai, M; Matter, C M; Aujesky, D",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,310,1

Although vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 are being developed at a record-breaking pace, the majority of those that are licensed or currently registered in clinical trials are formulated as an injectable product, requiring a tightly regulated cold-chain infrastructure, and primarily inducing systemic immune responses.Areas covered: Here, we shed light on the status of inhaled vaccines against viral pathogens, providing background to the role of the mucosal immune system and elucidating what factors determine an inhalable vaccine's efficacy. We also discuss whether the development of an inhalable powder vaccine formulation against SARS-CoV-2 could be feasible. The review was conducted using relevant studies from PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar.Expert opinion: We believe that the scope of vaccine research should be broadened toward inhalable dry powder formulations since dry vaccines bear several advantages. Firstly, their dry state can tremendously increase vaccine stability and shelf-life. Secondly, they can be inhaled using disposable inhalers, omitting the need for trained health-care personnel and, therefore, facilitating mass-vaccination campaigns. Thirdly, inhalable vaccines may provide improved protection since they can induce an IgA-mediated mucosal immune response.","Heida, Rick; Hinrichs, Wouter Lj; Frijlink, Henderik W",Expert review of vaccines,310,22

In this report, we show that the murine hepatitis virus nsp2 sequence was tolerated in ORF1b with an in-frame insertion between nsp13 and nsp14 and in place of ORF4. Alternate encoding or duplication of the nsp2 gene sequence resulted in differences in nsp2 expression, processing, and localization, was neutral or detrimental to replication, and did not complement an ORF1a Deltansp2 replication defect.

Results from previous studies lack details needed for practical use. This is a mathematical analysis and model building study of day 3 cleavage stage embryo transfers. A total of 996 embryos were transferred in 274 fresh and 83 frozen embryo transfers. Embryo morphology was divided into 4 groups based on number of cells and fragmentation percentage. Each embryo transfer was modeled as an equation equating the sum of the live birth rates of the transferred embryos to the number of live births that resulted. The least squares solution to the system of embryo transfer equations was determined using linear algebra. This analysis was repeated for ages 35 to 42 years old at oocyte retrieval. The best fit live birth rates per embryo in the age group centered on 35 years old were 29%, 13%, 10%, and 9% for embryos in the 8-cell with ≤ 5% fragmentation, 8-cell with > 5% fragmentation, 9-12 cell, and 6-7 cell groups, respectively. Cleavage stage embryos with fewer than 6 cells on day 3 had very low best fit live birth rates close to 0% at age 39 years and were excluded from the primary analysis to prevent overfitting. These live birth rates can be used with a simple embryo transfer model to predict rates of single and multiple gestation prior to a planned cleavage stage embryo transfer.","Awadalla, Michael; Vestal, Nicole; McGinnis, Lynda; Ahmady, Ali",Reproductive sciences,310,1

METHODS This study includes 51 consecutive patients having operations for external rectal prolapse (ERP) in a tertiary centre between October 2009 and December 2012. Of these, 17 patients had RVMR and 34 underwent LVMR. The groups were matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grades. The same operative technique and mesh was used and follow up was 12 months. Data was collected on patient demographics, surgery duration, blood loss, duration of hospital stay and operative complications. Functional outcomes were measured using the faecal incontinence severity index (FISI) and Wexner faecal incontinence scoring. Quality of life was scored using SF36 questionnaires pre and postoperatively. RESULTS All patients were female except three (median 59, range 25-89). There was one laparoscopic converted to open procedure. RVMR procedures were longer in duration (p = 0.013) but with no difference in blood loss between the groups. The average duration of stay was 2 days in both groups. There were six minor postoperative complications in LVMR procedures and none in the RVMR group. Pre and postoperative Wexner and FISI scoring were significantly lower in the RVMR group (p = 0.042 and p = 0.024, respectively). SF-36 questionnaires showed better scoring in physical and emotional component in RVMR group (p = 0.015). There was no recurrence in either group during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Both LVMR and RVMR are similar in terms of safety and efficacy. Although not randomized, this data may suggest a better functional outcome and quality of life in patients having RVMR for ERP.","Mehmood, Rao K; Parker, Jody; Bhuvimanian, L; Qasem, Eyas; Mohammed, Ahmed A; Zeeshan, Muhammad; Grugel, Kirsten; Carter, Paul; Ahmed, Shakil",International journal of colorectal disease,310,16

The weighted mean differences (WMDs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS Five eligible RCTs were included. Compared with standard oral refeeding, early oral refeeding significantly decreased the length of hospital stay (WMD: -2.22, 95%CI: -3.37 to -1.08, p = 0.0001). Although there was heterogeneity (I2 = 56%, p = 0.06), subgroup analysis of the refeeding criteria (immediate group and hungry group) eliminated the heterogeneity.

Rapid and detailed workup as well as the initiation of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is critical to avoid sepsis and to reduce mortality. Although a definitive source of infection is frequently not identified, the severely immunosuppressed status of the AML patient undergoing cytotoxic therapy results in a high risk for a wide array of bacterial, fungal and viral etiologies. AREAS COVERED The authors herein review the diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the neutropenic leukemia patient based on the current knowledge. Special consideration is given to the rapidly changing therapeutic landscape in AML, creating new challenges in the management of infectious complications. For review of the current literature, Pubmed database was searched with articles from 1970-2020. Articles were searched based upon guidelines for treatment, pathogens, prophylaxis, management, and therapeutic landscape for the neutropenic patient with acute myelogenous leukemia. EXPERT OPINION Multidrug resistant organisms pose a major challenge in the management of neutropenic fever patients with hematologic malignancies - including AML. Future directions to improve outcomes demand innovative treatment approaches as well as advances in biomarker research to facilitate diagnosis and disease monitoring. Recent achievements in AML-targeted therapy led to an increased incidence of differentiation syndrome, a potentially life-threatening side effect that frequently resembles clinical infection and requires prompt recognition and aggressive intervention.","Peseski, Andrew M; McClean, Mitchell; Green, Steven D; Beeler, Cole; Konig, Heiko",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,310,1

Likewise, biotechnological applications, such as nucleic acid detection, DNA amplification, and gene cloning, require high specificity in DNA synthesis catalyzed by DNA polymerases. However, errors in DNA polymerization (such as mis-incorporation and mis-priming) can significantly jeopardize the specificity. Herein, we report our discovery that the specificity of DNA enzymatic synthesis can be substantially enhanced (up to 100-fold higher) by attenuating DNA polymerase kinetics via the phosphorothioate dNTPs. This specificity enhancement allows convenient and sensitive nucleic acid detection, polymerization, PCR, and gene cloning with complex systems (such as human cDNA and genomic DNA). Further, we found that the specificity enhancement offered higher sensitivity (up to 50-fold better) for detecting nucleic acids, such as COVID-19 viral RNAs. Our findings have revealed a simple and convenient strategy for facilitating specificity and sensitivity of nucleic acid detection, amplification, and gene cloning.","Hu, Bei; Wang, Yitao; Sun, Shichao; Luo, Guangcheng; Zhang, Shun; Zhang, Jun; Chen, Lu; Huang, Zhen",Analytical chemistry,310,25

More importantly, affirmatively phrased questions like Which one should I choose?, framed either as an instruction to make the choice or as material unrelated to the study, produced more choice repetition than presenting either no question at all or a control question. In contrast, negatively phrased questions like Which one should I not choose? decreased behavior repetition.

We aimed to produce pooled estimates of mortality risks among people with opioid use disorder (OUD), with a focus upon all-cause mortality, and also overdose-specific causes of death. DESIGN Systematic review and meta-analysis of cohorts of people with OUD involving illicit opioids with data on all-cause or overdose-specific mortality. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Of 4247 papers, 92 were eligible, reporting on 101 cohorts that measured all-cause mortality and opioid-overdose mortality. Cohorts (n = 101-229,274) were in North America, Australia, several Eastern and Western European countries, and Asia. MEASUREMENT Titles/abstracts and full texts were independently screened by 2 reviewers, with discrepancies resolved via a third reviewer. We extracted data on crude mortality rates (CMRs) per 1000 person-years (PY); we imputed CMRs where possible if not reported by study authors. We also calculated mortality relative risks. Data were pooled using random-effects models; potential reasons for heterogeneity were explored using subgroup analyses and meta-regressions. FINDINGS The overall all-cause CMR was 18.7 per 1000 PY (95% confidence interval [CI] 17.1-20.3). The overall overdose-specific CMR was 7.0 per 1000 PY (95% CI 6.1-8.0). All-cause and overdose-specific mortality were substantially higher in low/middle-income countries, among those with HIV, and among people who use injection drugs. CONCLUSIONS Individuals with OUD carry a high risk of all-cause and overdose-specific mortality. Potentially modifiable risk factors, such as HIV and injection drug use, were predictive of mortality risk and are amenable to global efforts aiming to improve access to OUD treatment and targeted harm reduction efforts.","Bahji, Anees; Cheng, Breagh; Gray, Samantha; Stuart, Heather",Journal of addiction medicine,310,1

However, this technology usually relies on the availability of large labelled datasets, a requirement hard to meet in the context of a virus outbreak. To overcome this challenge, a semi-supervised deep learning model using both labelled and unlabelled data is proposed. We develop and test a semi-supervised deep learning framework based on the Mix Match architecture to classify chest X-rays into Covid-19, pneumonia and healthy cases. The presented approach was calibrated using two publicly available datasets. The results show an accuracy increase of around 15% under low labelled / unlabelled data ratio. This indicates that our semi-supervised framework can help improve performance levels towards Covid-19 detection when the amount of high-quality labelled data is scarce. Also, we introduce a semi-supervised deep learning boost coefficient which is meant to ease the scalability of our approach and performance comparison. © 2020 IEEE","Calderon-Ramirez, S.; Giri, R.; Yang, S.; Moemeni, A.; Umaña, M.; Elizondo, D.; Torrents-Barrena, J.; Molina-Cabello, M.

While Bolsonaro’s narrative was predominantly beatific, centered on the government, Trump’s was mostly horrific, centered on the elite. Trump signified the pandemic as a subject and an enemy to be defeated, whereas Bolsonaro portrayed it as a circumstance. Finally, both leaders defined the people as working people, therefore their concerns about the pandemic were focused on the people’s ability to work.","Cervi, Laura García Fernando Lladó Carles Marín",Social Sciences,310,31

The present study examined how sport consumers appraise stress and engage in coping behaviors resulted from sport lockout due to the global pandemic. Design/methodology/approach This study examined the relationship between sport fans' psychological dispositions, threat appraisal and coping strategies among professional sport fans in the USA. A panel of sport fans (N = 446) representative of the US adult population participated in an online survey in the fourth week of April, 2020 when no major sport leagues made a return from the lockout due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Findings Results of this present study showed that anger, aggressiveness and need for affiliation increased threat perceptions toward the COVID-19 lockout, which subsequently had significant effect on emotion-focused and disengagement coping behaviors. Research limitations/implications This is the first empirical study that examined stress and coping behavior among sport fans in the global public health crisis context. Our findings show what triggers stress appraisals and how fans cope with them. Practical implications Findings suggest that segmenting sport fans based on psychological dispositions could be useful in predicting fans that will engage in coping behaviors. Social implications While the hope is to return to normal postpandemic, COVID-19 might not be the last. We are uncertain whether there might be another potential pandemic-related sport lockdown. Understanding how lack of sport events can create distress in sport fans and have important public health implications. Originality/value The findings provide empirical evidence on how sport consumers respond to the pandemic-related sport lockdown and cope with the unprecedented situation. The findings of this study contribute to the sport management literature as we are unsure whether the sport industry might face this challenging situation in the future again.","Kwon, Y.; Kwak, D.

Design/methodology/approach: A scoping review was conducted to examine the learning outcomes within and between online and face-to-face (F2F) university teaching programmes. Findings: Although previous research has supported a “no significant difference” position, the review of 91 comparative studies during 2000–2020 identified 37 (41%) which found online teaching was associated with better learning outcomes, 17 (18%) which favoured F2F and 37 (41%) reporting no significant difference. Purpose-developed online content which supports “student-led” enquiry and cognitive challenge were cited as factors supporting better learning outcomes. Research limitations/implications: This study adopts a pre-defined methodology in reviewing literature which ensures rigour in identifying relevant studies. The large sample of studies (n = 91) supported the comparison of discrete learning modes although high variability in key concepts and outcome variables made it difficult to directly compare some studies. A lack of methodological rigour was observed in some studies. Originality/value: As a result of COVID-19, online university teaching has become the “new normal” but also re-focussed questions regarding its efficacy. The weight of evidence from this review is that online learning is at least as effective and often better than, F2F modalities in supporting learning outcomes, albeit these differences are often modest. The findings raise questions about the presumed benefits of F2F learning and complicate the case for a return to physical classrooms during the pandemic and beyond. © 2021, Garry John Stevens, Tobias Bienz, Nidhi Wali, Jenna Condie and Spyros Schismenos.","Stevens, G.

We examined COVID-19's impact on recruitment, retention, and individual characteristics, pre- vs. post-pandemic, of YA who enrolled in a randomized trial designed to evaluate a telehealth self-management intervention for T1D. Methods: Participant surveys, A1c, and process data from the ongoing trial were analyzed for differences before and after California's stay-at-home order was issued on 3/18/2020. All surveys except social needs were collected at enrollment, while social needs were assessed post-COVID for all participants. Fisher exact tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results: Time from referral to enrollment more than doubled post-COVID. Participants who enrolled post-COVID (n=19) had higher SES (private health insurance, parental education), but poorer psychosocial well-being (diabetes distress, self-efficacy) and higher social needs (e.g., food insecurity, access to healthcare) than those who enrolled pre-COVID (n=41) (Table 1).

In this paper, we present the first measurement study of COVID-19 themed cryptocurrency scams. We first create a comprehensive taxonomy of COVID-19 scams by manually analyzing the existing scams reported by users from online resources. Then, we propose a hybrid approach to perform the investigation by: 1) collecting reported scams in the wild;and 2) detecting undisclosed ones based on information collected from suspicious entities (e.g., domains, tweets, etc). We have collected 195 confirmed COVID-19 cryptocurrency scams in total, including 91 token scams, 19 giveaway scams, 9 blackmail scams, 14 crypto malware scams, 9 Ponzi scheme scams, and 53 donation scams. We then identified over 200 blockchain addresses associated with these scams, which lead to at least 330K US dollars in losses from 6, 329 victims. For each type of scams, we further investigated the tricks and social engineering techniques they used.

It remains unclear whether patients with COVID-19 and Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) experience worse clinical outcomes compared to similar patients with COVID-19 without RA. Objective The aim of this study is to provide insights on how COVID-19 impacted patients with RA given the nature of the disease and medication used. Methods RA cases were identified via International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and COVID-19 cases by laboratory results in the U.S. based TriNetX network. Patients with COVID-19 and RA were propensity-score matched based on demographics with patients with COVID-19 without RA at a 1:3 ratio. A hospitalized sub-population was defined by procedure codes. Results We identified 1,014 COVID-19 patients with RA and 3,042 non-RA matches selected from 137,757 patients. The odds of hospitalization (non-RA:23%, RA:24.6%, OR:1.08, 95% CI: 0.88 to 1.33) or mortality (non-RA:5.4%, RA:6%, OR:0.93, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.34) were not significantly different. The hospitalized sub-population included 249 patients with COVID-19 and RA and 745 non-RA matches selected from 21,435 patients. The risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (non-RA:18.8%, RA:18.1%, OR:0.94, 95% CI: 0.60 to 1.45), and inpatient mortality (non-RA:14.4%, RA:14.5%, OR:0.86, 95% CI: 0.53 to 1.40) were not significantly different.

Here we present voltammetric, microscopic and microbial community analysis of biofilms formed under fixed applied potential for modified graphite electrodes during early (90 h) and mature (340 h) growth phases. Electrodes modified to introduce hydrophilic groups (−NH2, −COOH and −OH) enhance early-stage biofilm formation compared to unmodified or electrodes modified with hydrophobic groups (−C2H5). In addition, early-stage films formed on hydrophilic electrodes were dominated by the gram-negative sulfur-reducing bacterium Desulfuromonas acetexigens while Geobacter sp. dominated on −C2H5 and unmodified electrodes. As biofilms mature, current generation becomes similar, and D. acetexigens dominates in all biofilms irrespective of surface chemistry. Electrochemistry of pure culture D. acetexigens biofilms reveal that this microbe is capable of forming electroactive biofilms producing considerable current density of > 9 A/m2 in a short period of potential induced growth (~19 h followed by inoculation) using acetate as an electron donor. The inability of D. acetexigens biofilms to use H2 as a sole source electron donor for current generation shows promise for maximizing H2 recovery in single-chambered microbial electrolysis cell systems treating wastewaters.

Recent advances in the targeting of cytokines and leukocyte migration have greatly advanced treatment options, but most patients still relapse and inevitably progress. Although single-cell approaches are transforming our ability to understand the barrier tissue biology of inflammatory disease, comprehensive single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlases of IBD to date have largely sampled pre-treated patients with established disease. This has limited our understanding of which cell types, subsets, and states at diagnosis are predictive of disease severity and response to treatment. Here, through a combined clinical, flow cytometric, and scRNA-seq study, we profile diagnostic human biopsies from the terminal ileum of treatment-naive pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (pediCD; n=14) and from non-inflamed pediatric controls with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID; n=13). To fully resolve and annotate epithelial, stromal, and immune cell states among the 201,883 single-cell transcriptomes, we develop and deploy a principled and unbiased tiered clustering approach, ARBOL, yielding 138 FGID and 305 pediCD end cell clusters. Notably, through both flow cytometry and scRNA-seq, we observe that at the level of broad cell types, treatment-naive pediCD is not readily distinguishable from FGID in cellular composition. However, by integrating high-resolution scRNA-seq analysis, we identify significant differences in cell states that arise during pediCD relative to FGID. Furthermore, by closely linking our scRNA-seq analysis with clinical meta-data, we resolve a vector of lymphoid, myeloid, and epithelial cell states in treatment-naive samples which can distinguish patients with less severe disease (those not on anti-TNF therapies (NOA)), from those with more severe disease at presentation who require anti-TNF therapies. Moreover, this vector was also able to distinguish those patients that achieve a full response (FR) to anti-TNF blockade from those more treatment-resistant patients who only achieve a partial response (PR). Our study jointly leverages a treatment-naive cohort, high-resolution principled scRNA-seq data analysis, and clinical outcomes to understand which baseline cell states may predict inflammatory disease trajectory.","Zheng, H.

The activity of ERKs is often used to report antigen receptor occupancy but the full details of how ERKs control T cell activation is not understood. Accordingly, we have used mass spectrometry to explore how ERK signalling pathways control antigen receptor driven proteome restructuring in CD8 + T cells to gain insights about the biological processes controlled by ERKs in primary lymphocytes. Quantitative analysis of >8000 proteins identified only 900 ERK regulated proteins in activated CD8+ T cells. The data identify both positive and negative regulatory roles for ERKs during T cell activation and reveal that ERK signalling primarily controls the repertoire of transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine receptors expressed by activated T cells. The ERKs thus drive the transcriptional reprogramming of activated T cells and the ability of T cells to communicate with external immune cues.","Damasio, Marcos P.; Marchingo, Julia M.; Spinelli, Laura; Cantrell, Doreen A.; Howden, Andrew J.M.",bioRxiv,310,16

Methods: This prospective cohort study was conducted using a self-administrated questionnaire in Japan. SES, personal characteristics, and occupation of recruited workers were surveyed at baseline (December 22-25, 2020); subsequent unemployment was examined at follow-up (February 18-19, 2021). We determined the odds ratios (ORs) of unemployment for SES and other variables using a multilevel logistic model. Results: Among all 19,941 participants, 2.3% reported experience of unemployment through negative reasons. Multivariate analysis showed the OR and 95% confidence interval for unemployment associated with age to be 0.66 (0.47-0.92) for 30-39 years, 0.36 (0.25-0.51) for 40-49, 0.36 (0.25-0.53) for 50-59, and 0.43 (0.27-0.67) for more than 60 compared with 20-29 years.

It seems that there will be more deaths since the epidemic is not over. All the Chinese provinces have reported the COVID-19 cases. This chapter aims to explore the trend of COVID-19 treatment efficiency in Chinese provinces using the data released daily by China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Since China Center for Disease Control and Prevention began to release data daily from January 24 to March 12, we have more than 40 groups of daily data for 31 provinces in China mainland. In the calculation, we take the daily data of each province as a sample and then we have more than 1,200 samples in this study. We use additive two-stage data envelopment analysis as an efficiency evaluation tool to calculate the COVID-19 treatment efficiency. In our framework, the first stage is to understand the infection rate and the second stage is to evaluate the treatment efficiency. In the first stage for the tth day, we use total population (p) and number of people infected in the previous day (inft21 ) as the inputs and cumulative number of people infected in the current day (inft ) as the output. In the second stage for the tth day, we use cumulative number of people infected in the current day (inft) as the input and cumulative death in the current day (deatht) and cumulative recovery in the current day (recovt ) as the outputs. Some techniques on how to deal with undesirable outputs such as inft and deatht are employed in this study. After we have the infection rate and treatment efficiency for the samples more than 1,200, we analyze the COVID-19 treatment efficiency and its development trend from January 24 to March 12 in 34 regions of China from static and dynamic aspects. The results show that, on the whole, the overall efficiency and phased efficiency of COVID-19 treatment efficiency in all regions of China are relatively high, which reflects the key factor for the Chinese government to quickly control the epidemic in the short term. Relatively speaking, the average efficiency value in the infection stage (first stage) is lower than the average efficiency value in the healing stage (second stage), which shows that the focus of anti-epidemic in China should be early detection and prevention rather than treatment process. In terms of trend, the total efficiency of COVID-19 treatment in each region shows a trend of “increasing first and then decreasing.” Our analysis indicates that in the initial stage, the continuous increase of various resources leads to the rise of the total efficiency, while in the later stage, the rapid decline of the number of infected people leads to the decrease of the total efficiency. Based on the results of the efficiency analysis, this study provides corresponding management implications and policy suggestions, hoping to provide some enlightenment and suggestions for the anti-epidemic work of other countries in the severe environment where the epidemic is spreading rapidly. © 2021 by Emerald Publishing Limited.","Yang, F.; Bi, Z.; Wei, F.; Huang, Z.",Advances in Business and Management Forecasting,310,1

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to develop the EVT-modified Lee-Carter model which is an amalgamation of the classical Lee-Carter model and the Extreme Value Theory (EVT). The hybrid model aims to cater for mortality jumps which usually occur during extreme mortality events. The forecasting accuracy of the EVT-modified Lee-Carter model is investigated against that of the classical Lee-Carter model, the Age-Period-Cohort model and the Cairns-Blake-Dowd model. The mortality datasets from four European countries are considered for two modelling periods, (1) the unstable period (1900-1960) during which extreme mortality events such as World War I, World War II and the Spanish flu pandemic occurred and (2) the stable period (1961-2017) where no significant mortality jump is observed. The EVT-modified Lee-Carter model evidently outperforms the other benchmark models for the unstable period while for the stable period (1960-2017), the classical Lee-Carter model performs best. The findings highlight the adequacy of the novel EVT-modified Lee-Carter model to capture mortality jumps and leptokurtic features which may be caused by extreme mortality events. In the context of the recent Covid-19 pandemic, the novel model may be an interesting tool for life insurance companies in the valuation of insurance products, mortality derivatives and solvency requirements.","Gungah, G.; Narsoo, J.",Journal of Statistics &amp; Management Systems,310,16

On the one hand, the pandemic crisis fosters the social role business schools play by supporting the enhancement of the RME rationale as an idealist foundational pillar of responsible business schools. On the other hand, it invites negative pragmatic responses in the light of financial and competitive disturbances that seem to enlarge the opportunity cost of moving RME forward. Design/methodology/approach The essay puts forward arguments that help dissect the inherent contradictions and synergies between idealistic and pragmatic business school strategies, as they are impacted by the dynamics of COVID-19. The analysis serves to frame a discourse over the extent to which the pandemic crisis is acting as an accelerator of the RME agenda or instead brings the risk of demolishing what has been achieved so far. Findings The authors form an opinion of the emerging factors that promote and inhibit RME in business schools as they grapple with the challenges of the pandemic whilst recognizing the inherent contradictions faced in their strategic choices and resourcing. Originality/value In light of the growing emphasis on RME in the literature, this study challenges the degree to which the agenda has already become firmly rooted as a core organizational and educational theme in business schools. By doing so, it delivers an assessment of RME progress as a relevant strategic lever for business schools, whilst nonetheless being at risk of back-sliding.","Falkenstein, M.; Hommel, U.; Snelson-Powell, A.",Journal of Global Responsibility,310,1

The prevalence of infection in children is similar to that of adults, though the symptoms are mild or even asymptomatic, among them, fever and cough are the most common symptoms. However, there are also reports of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or even death in children. Among them, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common complication, with high mortality rates. Currently there are no specific drugs for the novel coronavirus pneumonia, and a large number of clinical trials are underway to search out the most suitable treatment. Respiratory support is still the basic management for ARDS induced by the novel coronavirus. This review summarizes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and progress of treatment methods in severe pediatric coronavirus disease 19 with ARDS, hoping that when the novel coronavirus continues to spread, clinicians can better understand, diagnose and treat the pediatric patients. © Pediatric Medicine.

Recent research on mammals found that neutrophil concentrations scaled hypermetrically with body mass, a result not predicted by any existing theory. Although this mammalian model might predict how leukocyte concentrations scale with body mass in other vertebrates, vertebrate classes are distinct in many ways that might affect their current and historic interactions with parasites and hence the evolution of their immune systems. Subsequently, here, we asked which existing scaling hypothesis best-predicted relationships between body mass and lymphocyte, eosinophil, and heterophil concentrations—the avian functional equivalent of neutrophils—among >100 species of birds. We then examined the predictive power of body mass relative to life-history variation, as an extensive literature indicates that the scheduling of key life events has influenced immune system variation among species. Finally, we ask whether these scaling patterns differ from the patterns we observed in mammals. We found that an intercept-only model best-explained lymphocyte and eosinophil concentrations among birds; body mass minimally influenced these two cell types. For heterophils, however, body mass explained over 30% of the variation in concentrations among species, much more than life-history variation (~8%). As with mammalian neutrophils, avian heterophils scaled hypermetrically (b=0.19 ± 0.05), but significantly steeper than mammals (~1.5x). As such, we discuss why birds might require more broadly-protective cells compared to mammals of the same body size. Body mass appears to have strong influences on the architecture of immune systems, which could impact host-parasite coevolution and even zoonotic disease risk for humans.","Ruhs, Emily Cornelius; Martin, Lynn B.; Downs, Cynthia J.",bioRxiv,310,16

However, the number of daily COVID-19 deaths in Thailand has been low with most daily records showing zero deaths, thereby making them fit a Zero-Inflated Poisson (ZIP) distribution. Herein, confidence intervals for the Coefficient Of Variation (CV) of a ZIP distribution are derived using four methods: the standard bootstrap (SB), percentile bootstrap (PB), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and the Bayesian-based highest posterior density (HPD), for which using the variance of the CV is unnecessary. We applied the methods to both simulated data and data on the number of daily COVID-19 deaths in Thailand. Both sets of results show that the SB, MCMC, and HPD methods performed better than PB for most cases in terms of coverage probability and average length. Overall, the HPD method is recommended for constructing the confidence interval for the CV of a ZIP distribution. © 2021 by the authors.","Junnumtuam, S.; Niwitpong, S.

Cancer screening is designed to decrease cancer-specific mortality among age- and gender-appropriate populations, but is implemented less frequently among Latino populations. Barriers to screening among Latinos are less well understood. Methods: A crosssectional, online survey was used to assess perspective on cancer information-seeking behavior, demographic, economic, healthcare access and COVID-related factors among Latino adults (&gt;18) living in Indiana able to read and write in Spanish or English. Respondents were recruited using Facebook targeted advertisement and data were collected through Qualtrics. USPSTF recommendations for breast (BC), cervical (CC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening were used to evaluate screening adherence. The influence of explanatory variables on cancer-related outcomes was analyzed using univariate chi-squared tests for categorical variables and t-test for scale variables. Following this, significantly influential factors (p &lt; 0.05) were included in multivariate logistic regression models for each response variable. Model selection was performed using stepwise regression. Results: A total of 1624 respondents participated, with 832 (51.2%) completing the survey in Spanish. Median age was 52 years old (range 18-71) for English and 54 (18-77) for Spanish respondents. 80% of respondents were located in urban areas. Cancer screening adherence rates were 45.2% for BC, 61.8% for CC and 68.0% for CRC. The main factor associated with screening adherence across all malignancies (Table) was white self-identification, other factors included having children (OR: 1.79) and having received a COVID test (OR: 1.91) for CRC, having Spanish as chosen language for the survey for CC and BC respectively. Having higher income was associated with less adherence in CRC (OR: 0.50 when expressed as subjective income adequacy, compared with people finding difficult on present income) and CC (OR: 0.18 when expressed as &gt; 75,000 USD annual income, compared with 0- 35,000 USD annual income). Conclusions: In this interim analysis of the largest Latino survey in Indiana, our findings were counter-intuitive regarding the association of income and language with cancer screening adherence. For income, these findings may have been due to lower out-ofpocket costs among vulnerable populations covered by Medicaid or Medicare insurance. For Spanish differences may be explained by increased language specific outreach for certain screening tests but not for others.

Our results show that parents included during the lockdown period reported significantly, but slightly, higher saturation (a dimension of the parental burnout construct) than parents included 2 years earlier. However, the number of children per age group, maintaining employment, and having to provide schooling at home are not variables that explain differences in the level of parental burnout between our two samples.

Caryll Houselander (1901–1954), an English author, developed a liturgically infused mysticism focused on seeing Christ in each person. Her vision of Christ in others was rooted in creatively portraying the particularities of human life in the great “rhythm” of the Christ-life lived in the Mystical Body and expressed in the liturgy. This article proposes that juxtaposing these two authors reveals a “liturgical mysticism of open eyes,” playing off Metz’s initial phrasing. The work of Metz and Houselander together presents a fruitful liturgical theology for Christian communities during and in response to the pandemic as they engage questions of suffering, justice, and responsibility. By rooting our decisions about liturgical and social lives in a “liturgical mysticism of open eyes,” the church may remain rooted to a liturgical spirituality, while also recognizing and being open to the suffering of individuals and communities while liturgies are altered, moved online, or postponed altogether. © 2021 by the author.

It is the most critical factor that severely affects the tool-life and life of the machine tool. Out of several methods followed for suppressing and avoiding chatter, machining conditions chosen with stability lobe diagram is the most reliable way. Stability lobe diagrams are typically generated by knowing specific cutting force coefficients and tool point frequency response functions (FRFs). Inaccurate use of tool point FRFs significantly affects the stable regions of stability lobe diagrams. As tool-point FRFs are influenced by gyroscopic effect, centrifugal force, thermal change in bearing dynamics, etc. during machining, it is important to consider the effect of these factors on tool point FRFs in order to generate accurate stability lobe diagrams. The present work covers a new approach for estimating tool point FRFs during machining operations, employing cutting tool vibration signals. For measuring the vibration at the tip of end mill at different spindle speeds, a non-contact laser vibrometer is used. In order to remove the tooth pass frequency and its harmonics from the measured signals, a comb filter is employed. The filtered signal is subjected to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) in order to derive tool point FRFs. With the estimated FRFs at different spindle speeds, the stability lobe diagrams are drawn for high-speed milling machine. Comparative study of stability lobe diagrams, drawn with static modal analysis and Operational Modal Analysis, have shown that the cutting conditions chosen from stability lobe diagram derived with OMA, are found to be more realistic for avoiding chatter during high-speed milling applications.","Paliwal, Vineet; Babu, N.

Different studies have pointed out the important role that Student Self-Assessment plays in improving student learning and ensuring the sustainability in instructional and evaluation processes. Method: The aim of this study with 630 university students is to analyze how engagement profiles and study strategies (measured by questionnaire) can predict the accuracy of students’ self-assessment of their achievements. For this purpose, the UWE-9 questionnaire was used to evaluate engagement, the Study Techniques Questionnaire scale to measure study strategies and a content-based test to evaluate performance, along with a self-assessment test in which the student had to estimate the level of achievement obtained in the content-based test, once the test had been completed. Results: The results show that both the academic engagement and the study strategies undertaken by students can be important factors that may influence different aspects of learning in the educational context. Students with higher performance and more engagement tend to show greater skills with student self-assessment (SSA) and students with better study habits tend to have better scores, greater confidence in the SSAs delivered and better skills for self-assessment. Conclusions: Findings suggests that providing opportunities for students to have a greater involvement in the construction of their learning and in its evaluation raises positive attitudes, which results in increased performance in order to achieve greater sustainability in the learning process assessment.","León, Samuel P.; Augusto-Landa, José María García-Martínez Inmaculada",Sustainability,310,26

(Special issue.),13.924922,4.3391075,2021,"Thermographic fever-screening systems have been deployed widely for the non-contact detection of febrile temperatures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The standard for required performance (IEC 80601-2-59:2017) [1] of thermographic screening systems describe a specification-based requirement to assure the system is able to detect real febrile temperatures, but does not describe any clinical testing. Thermographic systems have been shown to be sensitive to febrile temperatures in controlled [2,3] and real-world conditions [4]. However, concerns have been raised about elements of these standards [5,6]. In a related report by the author [20], the size-of-source artifact was presented as a major confound in thermographic systems, causing surface temperatures to be altered by enough to make certain systems miss common fever thresholds, and this confound is not addressed by the standard. More concerningly is the recent observation of unacceptably strong bias-towards-normal algorithms in a selection of widely-deployed thermographic systems [7]. On the other hand, the standard covering non-contact body thermometry (IEC 80601-2-56:2017) [8] describes both laboratory and clinical testing to assure the system can detect febrile temperatures. Many single-pixel and at least one multi-pixel infrared thermometers are widely available with 510(k) marketing approval by the US FDA. In principle, clinical testing can give a greater certainty about real-world device performance. However, as we show in this report, many if not most of these devices also resort to unacceptably strong bias-to-normal algorithms, with parameters such that they would not be able to distinguish body temperatures ranging from 95F to 103F from normal, similar to the observations of [7]. A challenge for the clinical testing of thermometry and screening devices is the impracticality of finding a population of individuals having a sufficient distribution of elevated temperatures, rather than one group of normal and one group of severely febrile.

Specifically, the research explores how person-role conflict magnified due to daily contact with COVID-19 carriers leads doctors and nurses to experience emotional exhaustion. Moreover, psychological capital function as an explanatory mechanism between stressor strain relationships has also been tested. Design/methodology/approach: The study results are based on three months of lagged data conducted from the sample of 347 frontline physicians and nurses who provide treatment and care to infected people. To test direct, indirect and total effect, the author's used PROCESS Macro. Findings: The results suggested that person-role conflict reduces state-like psychological capital and increases emotional exhaustion through reduced psychological capital. Results aligned with the model's expectations in that psychological capital mediated the relationship between person-role conflict and emotional exhaustion, and the mediation was partial. Originality/value: This paper is the first one that tested the link between person-role conflict and emotional exhaustion. Moreover, up till now, no study has examined the mediating role of psychological capital in the relationship between person-role conflict and emotional exhaustion. Finally, in the context of the contagion outbreak, this is the preliminary effort that validated the resource loss cycle principle of conservation of resource theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Shah, S.

School systems appear to have responded rapidly, creating home schooling and online educational environments, where teachers and students would interact with safety. In this paper, we attempt a synthesis of Sen?s capability approach, Bourdieu?s theory of capital and Bernstein?s framework in order to theorize the relationships between home and school conditions and practices, and to analyse the data of the 2nd Survey of Schools: ICT in Education (a survey conducted in 2019 on behalf of the European Commission collecting data regarding digitalization in education and digital technologies in learning in the European Union). The survey is complemented by a second set of indicators provided by Eurostat to further investigate the availability and functionality of household space per family in selected European countries. We find significant differences in important social and environmental conversion factors, likely limiting children?s capability to benefit from digital schooling. The most important differences are found in regard to parents? familiarity with information and communications technology use, while inequalities in environmental factors, such as overcrowded housing, are also existent. Overall, there are large inequalities within and between countries in Europe, which need to be addressed by policymakers.","Dimopoulos, Kostas Koutsampelas Christos Tsatsaroni Anna",European Educational Research Journal,310,16

Saudi Arabia became a forerunner during COVID-19 by taking initial precautions of curfews and total restrictions. However, these restrictions had a disruptive effect on various sectors, specifically the educational sector. The Ministry of Education strived to cope with the consequences of these changes swiftly by shifting to online education. This paper aims to study the impact of COVID-19 on the educational process through a comparative study of the responses collected from different cases, and the challenges that are faced throughout the educational process. The study conducted a cross-sectional, self-administered online questionnaire during the outbreak and distance learning, which was designed based on the Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) framework of students. Most questions used a five-point Likert scale. The responses were randomly collected from 150 undergraduate and postgraduate students who were studying in Saudi Arabian universities, to study the overall performance of education institutions during COVID-19. The collected data were analyzed and compared to the results in the literature. The main factors impacted by this transformation are addressed. These factors are based on research and observations and aim to overcome the encountered limitations and to present their level of impact on distance education. The research framework can be useful for higher educational authorities aiming to overcome the issues highlighted and discussed in this study.","Alshaikh, Khloud Maasher Shaikhah Bayazed Afnan Saleem Farrukh Badri Sahar Fakieh Bahjat",Sustainability,310,13

Provision of home-NIV presents clinical and service challenges. The aim of this study was to assess outcomes of home-NIV in hypercapnic COPD patients managed remotely. Methods Retrospective analysis of a dataset of 46 COPD patients with persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure who commenced home-NIV managed by two-way remote monitoring (Lumis, AirView, ResMed) between February 2017 and January 2018. The primary outcome of this study was time to readmission or death at 12 months in patients receiving home-NIV versus a retrospectively identified control cohort of 27 patients with hypercapnic COPD who had not been referred for home-NIV. Results The median time to readmission or death was significantly prolonged in patients who commenced home-NIV (median 160 days, 95% CI 69.38-250.63) versus the control cohort (66 days, 95% CI 21.9-110.1; p<0.01). Average time to hospital readmission was 221 days (95% CI, 47.77-394.23) and 70 days (95% CI, 55.31-84.69; p<0.05), respectively. Median decrease in bicarbonate level of 4.9mmol/L (p<0.0151) and daytime PCO2 2.2kPa (p<0.032) demonstrate efficacy of home-NIV. A median reduction of 14 occupied bed days per annum versus previous year prior to NIV was observed per patient who continued home-NIV throughout the study period (N=32). Conclusion These findings confirm the benefits of home-NIV in clinical practice and support the use of two-way remote monitoring as a feasible solution to managing the delivery of home-NIV for COPD patients with persistent hypercapnia.","McDowell, G.; Sumowski, M.; Toellner, H.; Karok, S.; O'Dwyer, C.; Hornsby, J.; Lowe, D.; Carlin, C.",,310,1

These changes might impact employees’ physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB). This study aimed to summarize the literature focusing on the COVID-19-caused changes in physical activity and sedentary behavior among the adult working population. Methods: Literature searches were conducted in June 2021 using multiple electronic databases. The following keywords and synonyms were used during the searching process: physical activity, sedentary behavior, COVID-19, employee. After the data cleaning process (duplicates, inclusion criteria), the title and the abstract of all manuscripts from the searches were screened independently by two reviewers. Results: Thirty-nine manuscripts were selected as a result of the searching process. Of these, 5 were SB related, 15 were PA related and 19 addressed both PA and SB. There were longitudinal (10), cross-sectional (28) and a case study (1) in the selected manuscripts. The majority of studies were conducted in the USA (6) and Europe (18), and four studies examined the PA and/or SB in multiple countries. The majority (34 studies) of the studies used subjective, self-reported, but mostly before-validated questionnaires. Objective measures were less common and used only 12.8% of the examined studies. Moreover, 76.4% of the studies described an overall decrease in the amount of PA during the COVID-19 pandemic. In three cases, researchers observed an increase in PA among the workers. Five studies reported no significant changes in the amount of PA during the pandemic. As far as SB is concerned, 18 out of 24 of the studies reported an overall increase in the amount of SB between the two periods. Four manuscripts reported no significant change in the amount of SB, and there was only one manuscript in the examined studies that reported an overall decrease in the SB time before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Discussion: There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic, including lockdown and work from home (WFH) policies, impaired the PA and SB level of the populations. This period has delivered an important message for the adult working population as well. They should be as active as possible and avoid high levels of SB and uninterrupted sitting time. Therefore, organizations, policies and public health bodies should motivate workers, especially office workers, to be more active and interventions must be developed to mitigate the negative effects of the COVID-19 on PA and SB.","Ráthonyi, Gergely Kósa Karolina Bács Zoltán Ráthonyi-Ódor Kinga Füzesi István Lengyel Péter Bácsné Bába Éva",Sustainability,310,7

We present new ALMA CO(1-0) interferometry of cold molecular gas in the nearby (z=0.0755), massive (M_stellar=4x10^11 M_sun), isolated, late-type spiral galaxy 2MASSX J23453269-044925, which is outstanding for having two pairs of powerful, giant radio jets, and a bright X-ray halo. The molecular gas is in a massive (M_gas=2x10^10 M_sun), 24 kpc wide, rapidly rotating ring, which is associated with the inner stellar disk. Broad (FWHM=70-180 km s^-1) lines with complex profiles associated with the radio source are seen over large regions in the ring, indicating gas velocities that are high enough to keep the otherwise marginally Toomre-stable gas from fragmenting into gravitationally bound, star-forming clouds. About 1-2% of the jet kinetic energy are required to power these motions. Resolved star-formation rate surface densities fall factors 50-75 short of expectations from the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of star-forming galaxies, and near gas-rich early-type galaxies with signatures of star formation lowered by jet feedback. We argue that radio AGN feedback is the only plausible mechanism to explain the low star-formation rates in this galaxy. Previous authors have already noted that the X-ray halo of J2345-0449 implies a baryon fraction near the cosmic average, which is very high for a galaxy. We contrast this finding with other, equally massive baryon-rich spiral galaxies without prominent radio sources. Most of the baryons in these galaxies are in stars, not in the halos. We also discuss the implications of our results for our general understanding of AGN feedback in massive galaxies.","Nesvadba, N. P. H.; Wagner, A. Y.; Mukherjee, D.; Mandal, A.; Janssen, R. M.

Studies show that successful treatment with pegloticase, a pegylated uricase, leads to marked reductions in serum uric acid (sUA)2 and a subsequent decrease in overall urate load and tophi burden.3 However, pegloticase use in solid organ transplant recipients has not been systematically studied or well-characterized in the literature.4,5 Objectives: To examine the safety and efficacy of pegloticase in KT recipients with uncontrolled gout. Methods: This ongoing multicenter, open-label, efficacy and safety study of pegloticase in KT recipients (NCT04087720) included patients with uncontrolled gout sUA ≥7 mg/dL, urate lowering therapy [ULT] contraindication/inefficacy, and with either visible tophi, chronic gouty arthritis, or ≥2 flares in past year, who were KT recipients (KT >1 year prior), had a functioning graft (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥15 ml/min/1.73m2), and were on a stable immunosuppressant regimen. Pegloticase (8 mg infusion) was administered biweekly for 24 weeks (12 infusions) followed by a safety visit 30 days after the last infusion and 3-month post-treatment follow up visit. The primary endpoint was proportion of patients who were serum uric acid responders during Month 6 (sUA <6 mg/dL for ≥80% of time). Change from baseline (CFB) at 24 weeks was also evaluated for sUA, renal function, and health assessment questionnaire (HAQ) disability index (DI, maximum = 3) and pain (maximum = 100). Results: Preliminary findings of this study included 15 patients (12 male, 53.5±11.0 years of age) with uncontrolled gout (6.2±6.0 years since diagnosis) who had received a donor kidney 15.1±6.6 years earlier. At the time of analysis, 5 patients had completed the 24-week treatment period and 8 remained on therapy (last visit sUA <0.1 mg/dL in 6 patients, 1 had sUA of 7.4 mg/dL, 1 only received first infusion), and 2 had discontinued treatment (sUA rise [n=1], COVID-19 concerns [n=1]). Of the 5 patients who completed 24 weeks of therapy, all met response criteria and sUA was below detection limits (CFB: -10.2±1.3 mg/dL, baseline [BL]: 10.2±1.3 mg/dL). Patients also had less pain (HAQ-pain CFB: -33.6±22.2, BL: 35.9±22.0;n=5) and disability (HAQ-DI CFB: -0.3±0.6, BL: 0.7±0.8;n=5) at 24 weeks compared to BL. eGFR remained stable during 24 week treatment (eGFR CFB: -0.2±6.3 ml/min/1.73 m2, BL: 40.9±14.4 ml/min/1.73 m2;n=5). Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio showed improvement at 24 weeks (CFB: -223±405 mg/g, BL: 664±870 mg/g;n=5). 80% of patients experienced an AE, and 4 SAEs (duodenal ulcer, cellulitis, dyspnea, skin bacterial infection) deemed unrelated to pegloticase were reported. AEs that occurred in >1 patient included gout flare, pyrexia, arthralgia, and nasal congestion. No anaphylaxis or infusion reactions occurred. Conclusion: Initial findings suggest that pegloticase therapy is effective at reducing sUA in most KT recipients while preserving renal function. Results suggest that in the setting of profound urate lowering with pegloticase in KT patients, eGFR remains stable and patients experience clinically beneficial reductions in pain and disability with an absence of unexpected safety findings.","Abdellatif, A.; Zhao, L.; Peloso, P.

We use an SEIR model to study the effects of vaccination distribution on public health, comparing prioritization policy and speed under mitigation measures that are either eased during the vaccine rollout or sustained through the end of the pandemic period. NASEM's recommended prioritization results in fewer deaths than no prioritization, but does not minimize total deaths. If mitigation measures are eased, abandoning NASEM will result in about 134,000 more deaths at 30 million vaccinations per month. Vaccination speed must be at least 53% higher under no prioritization to avoid increasing deaths. With sustained mitigation, discarding NASEM prioritization will result in 42,000 more deaths, requiring only a 26% increase in speed to hold deaths constant.

Objectives: REUMAVID aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on the wellbeing, mental health, disease activity and function, access to health care and treatment, support services, and hopes and fears of people RMDs. Methods: REUMAVID is an international collaboration led by the Health & Territory Research group at University of Seville, Spain, together with a multidisciplinary team including patient organization and rheumatologists. This cross-sectional study consisting of an online survey gathering data from patients with a diagnosis of 15 RMDs in Cyprus, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom. Participants are recruited by patient organizations. Data is collected in two phases: 1) during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic (Spring 2020), and 2) as a follow-up to the pandemic (Winter 2020). This analysis presents descriptive results of the aggregated data, summarizing continuous and categorical variables. Results: A total of 1,800 RMD patients have participated in the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (from early April to mid-June 2020). The most frequent reported diagnosis were axial spondyloarthritis (37.2%), rheumatoid arthritis (29.2%) and osteoarthritis (17.2%). Mean age was 52.6±13.2, 80.1% were female, 69.6% were in a relationship or married and 48.6% had university studies. In total, 1.1% had tested positive for COVID-19, 10.8 % reported symptoms but were not tested, while 88.1% did not experience any symptoms. 46.6% reported worsening health during the pandemic. 63.9% perceived their health status to be “fair to very bad”. Access to care was limited with 58.4% being unable to keep the rheumatologist appointment, of which, 35.2% were cancelled by the provider and 54.4% was attended by phone or online. 15.8% changed their medication, for which 65.5% were changed by the provider and 24.6% by own decision. Reported wellbeing and psychological health during the pandemic was poor, with 49.0% reporting poor wellbeing according to the WHO-5 scale, 57.3% marking as anxiety and 45.8% as depression in the HADS scale. During the pandemic, 24.6% smoked and 18.2% drank more than before and 54.5% were unable to exercise at home. Conclusion: Results from the first phase of REUMAVID show disturbance of the healthcare quality, substantial changes in harmful health behaviors and an unprecedented impairment of mental health in REUMAVID participants.

This was especially important for hospitals that care for high-risk patients, like the St. Anna Children’s Hospital in Vienna, which is a tertiary care center for pediatric oncology. It was very important to develop solving methods for this complex problem in short time. We relied on constraint solving technology which proved to be very useful in such critical situations. In this paper we present a constraint model that includes the variety of requirements that are needed to ensure day-to-day operations as well as the additional constraints imposed by the pandemic situation. We introduce an innovative set of grouping constraints to partition the staff, with the intention to easily isolate a small group in case of an infection. The produced schedules also keep part of the staff as backup to replace personnel in quarantine. In our case study, we evaluate and compare our proposed model on several state-of-the-art solvers.

Here, we screened a library of compounds and identified the topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) as a promising drug candidate for microglial modulation. CPT and its FDA-approved analog topotecan (TPT) inhibited inflammatory responses in microglia and macrophages, and ameliorated neuroinflammation in mice. Transcriptomic analysis of sorted microglia revealed an altered transcriptional phenotype following TPT treatment, with Ikzf1 identified as a potential target. Importantly, TOP1 expression was found elevated in several neuroinflammatory conditions, including human MS brains. To achieve targeted delivery to myeloid cells we designed a nanosystem using DNA origami and loaded TPT into it (TopoGami). TopoGami also significantly suppressed the inflammatory response in microglia and mitigated disease progression in MS-like mice.

Here, we examined whether data collected from an initial pandemic wave could be informative, for the need to implement non-pharmaceutical measures in any resurgent wave. Drawing from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in 10 states in the USA, we calibrated simple mathematical models of influenza transmission dynamics to data for virologically confirmed hospitalisations during the initial spring wave. We then projected pandemic outcomes (cumulative hospitalisations) during the fall wave, and compared these projections with data. Model results show reasonable agreement for all states that reported a substantial number of cases in the spring wave. Using this model we propose a probabilistic decision framework that can be used to determine the need for pre-emptive measures such as postponing school openings, in advance of a fall wave. This work illustrates how model-based evidence synthesis, in real-time during an early pandemic wave, could be used to inform timely decisions for pandemic response.","Haw, D.

Methods: Time-varying reproduction numbers, Rt, of a 7-day-sliding-window and of non-overlapping-windows between policy changes were estimated utilizing the instantaneous reproduction number method. Linear regression was performed to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case-count varied across counties with different population size. Results: The median 7-day-sliding-window Rt estimates across the studied region varied between 1 and 1.25 during September through November 2020. Between November 13 and 18, Rt was reduced by 14.71% (95% credible interval, CrI, [14.41%, 14.99%]) in North Dakota following a mask mandate; Idaho saw a 1.93% (95% CrI [1.87%, 1.99%]) reduction and Montana saw a 9.63% (95% CrI [9.26%, 9.98%]) reduction following the tightening of restrictions. High-population counties had higher per-capita cumulative case-count in North Dakota at four time points (June 30, August 31, October 31, and December 31, 2020). In Idaho, North Dakota, and South Dakota, there was a positive correlation between population size and per-capita weekly incident case-count, adjusted for calendar time and social vulnerability index variables. Conclusions: Rt decreased after mask mandate during the region's case-count spike suggested reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","Hua, X.; Kehoe, A. R. D.; Tome, J.; Motaghi, M.; Ofori, S.

Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Residents in Azienda USL Umbria 2. Participants Consecutive subjects aged 15 to 75 who from February, 2020, to March 2021 were discharged with the diagnosis of Sars-Cov-2 from the hospitals of the AUSL Umbria 2, or resulted positive to a PCR test for Sars-Cov-2 infection with or without symptoms. Participants were classified according to clinical findings. SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing for antibodies targeting the Nucleocapside and Spike proteins were determined. Results Of 184 eligible subjects, 149 were available for evaluation: 17 were classified as Oligo/asymptomatic, 107 as Symptomatic (with no hospital admission), 25 as Hospital. While fever resulted common to all the groups, headache or musculoskeletal pain was common to symptomatic participants whereas cough and dyspnea was present in all the hospital admitted. Participants with significant signs and symptoms were more likely to use antibiotics, hydroxychloroquine, heparin and steroids. Compared to Oligo/asymptomatic participants, Symptomatic and Hospital admitted participants had higher levels of anti-S titers at every follow-up (median titer at 12 month follow-up: 29 vs 94 vs 116 respectively; P < 0.001). At 12 months follow-up, anti-S titers persisted above the threshold for at least 12 months in all Hospital admitted participants, in 90% of the Symptomatic participants and 83% in the oligo/asymptomatic participants; in 30% of participants the titer raised significantly probably due to reinfection. Anti-N antibody titer tended to decrease over time and in 62% of the entire cohort resulted negative. None of the participants reported clinical reinfection with Sars-Cov-2 virus.

The network was constructed as a 2-dimensional Watts-Strogatz model (500x500 square lattice with additional shortcuts), and the dynamics involved rewiring shortcuts in every time step of the epidemic spread. The model of the epidemic is SIR with latency time of 3 time steps. The behaviour of the epidemic was checked over the range of shortcut probability per underlying bond 0-0.5. The quantity of interest was percolation threshold for the epidemic spread, for which numerical results were checked against an approximate analytical model. We find a significant lowering of percolation thresholds for the dynamic network in the parameter range given. The result shows that the behaviour of the epidemic on dynamic network is that of a static small world with the number of shortcuts increased by 20.7 +/- 1.4%, while the overall qualitative behaviour stays the same. We derive corrections to the analytical model which account for the effect. For both dynamic and static small-world we observe suppression of the average epidemic size dependence on network size in comparison with finite-size scaling known for regular lattice. We also study the effect of dynamics for several rewiring rates relative to latency time of the disease.","Ochab, J. K.; G'ora, P. F.",,310,26

In this article, we explain how the development of the U.S. carceral system is inextricably linked to slavery at its foundation, how the late twentieth century saw the development of laws that discriminately impact Black people, and why policing and the carceral system must be viewed through a lens of environmental justice. Using modern case studies, we argue that the U.S. carceral system is fraught with issues of environmental injustice, both historically and in the face of new challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some countries have had different approaches to abortion at different times. Today, abortion is a major challenge in Iran. Social developments and increasing level of health literacy, awareness and participation of women in social and economic fields have led to incompatibility of theoretical and practical aspects in these areas. Women sometimes have abortions without attention to the national law. In Iran, the reasons for legal abortion are the life-threatening conditions of the mother and the fetus. During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some countries have revised their abortion laws and regulations. In some countries, such as France and Finland, these revisions are permanent;in countries such Portugal and Norway, the changes are temporary;and in other countries such as Germany and Belgium, it is unclear whether the changes are permanent or temporary. In this study, we aim to review the abortion laws and regulations in Europe and Iran.

In retrospect, the classification of injury as a public health issue in the mid-20th century triggered complex societal responses which generated unintended consequences affecting healthful activities. Responses generally aim to reduce or minimize the risk of injury and come in different forms, including formal and informal codes of practice, standards, management systems and regulation. Well-intentioned as these interventions may have been, the new emphasis on harm shifted attention away from what causes health and resulted in increasing control over activities, including those taking place outdoors. This article, which draws on long-term qualitative policy research, describes examples of these on-going tensions in the context of the public enjoyment of the outdoors. In conclusion, the situation presented is considered from a number of theoretical perspectives, and proposals are made for resolving the issues. These include improved communication between sectors and, on the technical side, the introduction of a compensatory decision process which enables policy makers to take account of both the health benefits and risks of exposure to the natural environment.","Ball, David J.; Ball-King, Laurence",Sustainability,310,7

Hence, it can elicit more targeted antiviral or immunomodulatory responses.

A few transcription factors (TFs) have been previously identified as regulators of this pathway but the extent of this control is yet to be fully understood. Here we demonstrate how DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq) allows for genome-wide TF binding site interrogation in a non-model species. We obtained 5,190 and 4,443 binding events assigned to 4,041 and 3,626 genes for MYB14 and MYB15, respectively (around 40% of peaks being located within -10kb of transcription start sites). DAP-Seq of MYB14 and MYB15 was combined with aggregate gene centred co-expression networks built from more than 1,400 transcriptomic datasets from leaves, fruits and flowers to narrow down bound genes to a set of high confidence targets. The analysis of MYB14, MYB15 and MYB13, a third uncharacterised member of Subgroup 2 (S2), showed that in addition to the few previously known stilbene synthase (STS ) targets, these three regulators bind to 30 out of 47 STS family genes. Moreover all three MYBs bind to several PAL, C4H and 4CL genes, in addition to shikimate pathway genes, the WRKY03 stilbenoid co-regulator and novel resveratrol-modifying gene candidates amongst which ROMT2 -3 were validated enzymatically. A high proportion of DAP-Seq bound genes was induced in the activated transcriptomes of transient MYB15 -overexpressing stilbenoid-producing grapevine leaves, validating our methodological approach for identifying gene regulatory networks of specialised metabolism. Overall, MYB genes from Subgroup 2 appear to play a key role in binding and directly regulating several primary and secondary metabolic steps leading to an increased flux towards stilbenoid production.","Orduña, Luis; Li, Miaomiao; Navarro-Payá, David; Zhang, Chen; Santiago, Antonio; Romero, Pablo; Ramšak, Živa; Magon, Gabriele; Höll, Janine; Merz, Patrik; Gruden, Kristina; Vannozzi, Alessandro; Cantu, Dario; Bogs, Jochen; Wong, Darren C.

This work examines the link between information technology (IT) capability with the firm performance by adopting a lean production approach, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices. The study has surveyed the population of the manufacturing company in East Java, Indonesia, using a questionnaire with a five-point Likert scale. A total of 111 manufacturing companies (medium and large) were selected from 5420 manufacturing companies listed in the Industrial Department of East Java. The partial least square (PLS) technique was used to analyze the data, using the SmartPLS software version 3.3. Thirteen hypotheses in this study were developed to investigate. The result revealed that all hypotheses of direct relationship were supported. IT capability directly affects lean production, vendor managed inventory, and supply chain practices. Moreover, lean production, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices improve firm performance. Further analysis also indicated that all hypotheses of indirect hypotheses were supported except hypothesis one hypothesis (H9). IT capability indirectly improves firm performance through lean production, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices. The result provides insight for managers and policymakers on enhancing firm performance by improving its IT capability, adopting lean production, vendor-managed inventory, and supply chain practices. This research contributes to reinforcing the supply chain management theory. © 2021 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.","Siagian, H.; Tarigan, Z. J.

These are enveloped viruses with positive single-stranded RNA, and their genome size varies approximately between 26 and 32 kb, being the largest genome for an RNA virus. In Mexico, the first reported case was that of a person from Italy. Taking this first case as day 1, the cases have been increasing and, at the time of writing this article, there were 133,974 infected people and 15,944 deaths. The conjunctiva has been proposed as a route of entry for SARS-CoV-2. However, in a search for coronavirus genetic material in tear and conjunctiva samples, patients who did not show conjunctivitis were negative for the presence of viral genetic material, and only one person was positive, both in tear and conjunctiva samples. Negative results for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in tears and conjunctival secretions could indicate that the virus does not replicate in conjunctival epithelia, but could be present in undetectable amounts, which does not rule out that it can be transmitted through the conjunctiva.","Pérez-Cano, H.

It has been established that combinations of increased ventilation, improved filtration, and other disinfection techniques can reduce the likelihood of transmission by removing or deactivating the airborne particles that potentially contain infectious material. However, when such guidance is general and qualitative in nature, it is extremely difficult for building managers to make informed decisions, as there is no quantitative information about how much risk reduction is provided. Furthermore, the actions that could be taken almost always require additional energy consumption by the HVAC system, and so in the absence of building-specific analysis, it is possible that chosen strategies might simply be wasting energy without providing meaningful reduction in transmission risk. To address this knowledge gap, we propose simplified steady-state models that can be used to quantify both the expected infection rate and the associated HVAC energy consumption that result from baseline operation and hypothetical changes. The transmission rate is modeled by considering the airborne concentration of infectious particles that would result from the activity-dependent respiration of an infector in the space, the physical dimensions of the space, and operation of the HVAC system. By formulating all disinfection mechanisms in terms of ""equivalent outdoor air"", a common basis is established for comparing and combining different strategies. Energy consumption can then be estimated by considering the change in HVAC variables (e.g., flow rates and temperatures) and applying standard models. To illustrate the insights provided by these models, we present examples of how the proposed analysis can be applied to specific spaces, highlighting the fact that underlying transmission risk (and thus also the energy-optimal disinfection strategies) can vary significantly from building to building and even from space to space within the same building. The overall goal is to empower building managers to fully assess the tradeoff between energy consumption and infection risk so that they can more effectively target their disinfection efforts and take actions that are consistent with current health and sustainability priorities.","Risbeck, M.

So, two methodologies are adopted, Neural Network (NN) and regression model in designing the model;the data was collected from a nursing home hospital for period 11/7/2021-23/7/2021, the sample size is 100 covid positive patients with 12 females & 38 males out of 50, while 26 female & 24 male are non-COVID out of 50. The input variables of the NN model are identified as the ferritin and a gender variable. The higher results precision is attained by the multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks when we applied the explanatory variables as the inputs with one hidden layer, which covers 3 neurons, as the planned many hidden layers are with one output of the fitting NN model which is used in stages of training and validation beside the actual data. We used a portion of the actual data to verify the behavior of the developed models, we find out that only one observation is a false predictive value.

Objectives: We aimed to i) estimate the degree to which causality was implied by both the language linking exposures to outcomes and by action recommendations in the high-profile health literature ii) examine disconnects between language and recommendations, iii) identify which linking phrases were most common, and iv) generate estimates by which these phrases imply causality. Methods: We identified 18 of the most prominent general medical/public health/epidemiology journals, and searched and screened for articles published from 2010 to 2019 that investigated exposure/outcome pairs until we reached 65 non-RCT articles per journal (n=1,170). Two reviewers and an arbitrating reviewer rated the degree to which they believed causality had been implied by the language in abstracts based on written guidance. Reviewers then rated causal implications of linking words in isolation. For comparison, additional review was performed for full texts and for a secondary sample of RCTs. Results: Reviewers rated the causal implication of the sentence and phrase linking the exposure and outcome as None (i.e. makes no causal implication) in 13.8%, Weak in 34.2%, Moderate in 33.2%, and Strong in 18.7% of abstracts. Reviewers identified an action recommendation in 34.2% of abstracts. Of these action recommendations, reviewers rated the causal implications as None in 5.3%, Weak in 19.0%, Moderate in 42.8% and Strong in 33.0% of cases. The implied causality of action recommendations was often higher than the implied causality of linking sentences (44.5%) or commensurate (40.3%), with 15.3% being weaker. The most common linking word root identified in abstracts was ""associate"" (n=535/1,170; 45.7%) (e.g. ""association,"" ""associated,"" etc). There were only 16 (1.4%) abstracts using ""cause"" in the linking or modifying phrases. Reviewer ratings for causal implications of word roots were highly heterogeneous, including those commonly considered non-causal. Discussion: We found substantial disconnects between causal implications used to link an exposure to an outcome vs action implications made. This undercuts common assumptions about what words are often considered non-causal and that policing them eliminates causal implications. We recommend that instead of policing words; editors, researchers, and communicators should increase efforts at making research questions, as well as the potential of studies to answer them, more transparent.","Haber, N.

Objectives: To present the clinical course of COVID-19 infection in patients with rheumatological disease and comorbid conditions of patients and drug use. Methods: 70 COVID-19 patients with autoimmune and autoinflammatory rheumatic diseases over the age of 18 who were followed up in the internal diseases-rheumatology department of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital and Sivas Numune Hospital between April 2020 and January 2021 were included in this study. An application was made to the ethics committee of Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital and approval was obtained. Demographic data, comorbidities, smoking, treatments for their diseases, symptoms and hospitalization status of the patients were evaluated. Results: The median age of the women patients was 48 years (min: 20-max: 73), 41 years in men (min: 21-max: 78). 15 patients (21.4%) were male, 55 patients (78.6%) were female. The most common rheumatic disease was rheumatoid arthritis (RA, 21, 30%) followed by ankylosing spondylitis (19, 27.1%), familial Mediterranean fever (13, 18.6%), Behet's disease (12, 17.1%). 22 (31.4%) patients hydroxychloroquine sulfate, 14 (20%) leflunomide, 7 (10%) patients methotrexate, 6 (8.6%) patients sulfasalazine, 10 (14.3%) patients azathioprine/ mycophenolate mofetil, 22 (31.4%) patients were using colchicine. As a biological medicine;20 (28.6%) patients were using infliximab, 5 (7.1%) patients were using adalimumab, 6 (8.6%) patients were using rituximab, and 4 (5.7%) patients were using tocilizumab. Other are summarized in Table 1. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (25.7%) and diabetes mellitus (DM 17.1%). While 56 patients (80%) had symptoms of COVID-19, 14 patients (20%) were asymptomatic. The most common symptoms was fever (32, 45.7%) followed by cough (29, 41.4%), dyspnea (28, 40%), myalgia (25, 35.7%), loss of taste and smell (18, 25.7%). 21 pneumonia cases were diagnosed. 22 (31.4%) patients were hospitalized. Mortality rate was 2/70, 2.9%. Two RA patients who just treated with rituximab and tocilizumab were died. 10 cases were using >10 mg/day prednisolone, 2 died, 8 cases were hospitalized and had severe disease. They had hypertension and DM. Characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 2. Conclusion: The course of COVID-19 in rheumatic diseases is not clearly. Meta-analysis has shown that the frequency of COVID-19 is increased in autoimmune diseases. However, this increase was mostly associated with the use of> 10mg/day prednisolone. It has been stated that the use of biological drugs and Dmard causes the SARS-CoV 2 process with a milder course and therefore their use is safe (3). Similar results have been obtained in global registry registers (4). In our data, there was no increase in the mortality rate compared to the normal population. However, especially the use of rituximab may increase the rate of severe disease and mortality, so its use should be careful. There is a need for more comprehensive studies.","Şahin, A.; Gedikli, M.

Considering the promotional and actual costs incurred from CSR activities, CSR strategy are not an issue that can be easily determined from the corporate perspective. However, now it is essential for companies to carry out CSR and sustainable development goals (SDGs) activities, and businesses cannot overlook social issues either. Companies cannot pursue only growth through corporate interests without social value.

Moreover, we demonstrated the impact of these three attributes on CSR authenticity for the electronics industries in Korea and China. As a result of empirical testing, most of three attributes above mentioned (i.e., CSR fit, CSR sustainability, and CSR impact) produce meaningful results for CSR authenticity. However, CSR sustainability was rejected for the Korea sample, and CSR fit was rejected for the Chinese sample, showing some differences between the two countries. Meanwhile, the digital transformation of the Fourth Industrial Revolution had strong partial mediating effects between CSR attributes and CSR authenticity.

Thus the outbreak emerged as a pandemic worldwide. World health and socio-economy is getting continually affected by COVID-19 since its outbreak. It will be easier to handle the situation if an automated diagnostic system is developed, capable of separating COVID-19 affected images from bulk images obtained from a mass screening process. Kaggle’s online chest X-Ray image dataset has been considered for this work evaluation. Healthy and COVID-19 affected chest X-Ray images were used for evaluating the performance of content-based image retrieval. Image retrieval has been carried out based on the absolute difference between the encoded features of twin images obtained from the Siamese Convolutional Neural Network (SCNN). The retrieval performance is awe-inspiring as the Siamese network used for retrieval is a relatively shallow network. SCNN does not require resource-hungry training with huge samples as part of its underlying implementation characteristics. The execution time is also very encouraging as the simplicity of the method is concerned. The method achieves 94% average precision and 100% average reciprocal rank while rank = 5 has been considered. Till now, no work has been reported on content-based retrieval of COVID-19 chest X-Ray images.

In our study, (419) participants were divided into two groups.The studied participants included patients which received standard care treatment as a control group (CON), while the (BS) group were patients received black seeds at a 40 mg/kg dose orally, once daily for 14 days plus standard protocol of treatment. The evidence of BS efficacy was obvious in the severity and outcome of infection with covid-19. A significantly higher severity of infection among control group 44 (17.0%) than the black seed group were noticed;the control group also showed 14 deaths (5.4%), while there were no deaths in black seeds group (0.0%). Thus, we can conclude that black seed is very effective in reducing the severity of covid-19 and preventing death in infected patients.","Al-Haidari, K. A.

In the current exploratory study, we introduce an information-selective symmetric reversal bandit task to model such situations and obtained choice data on this task from 24 participants. To arbitrate between different decision-making strategies that participants may use on this task, we developed a set of probabilistic agent-based behavioral models, including exploitative and explorative Bayesian agents, as well as heuristic control agents. Upon validating the model and parameter recovery properties of our model set and summarizing the participants’ choice data in a descriptive way, we used a maximum likelihood approach to evaluate the participants’ choice data from the perspective of our model set. In brief, we provide quantitative evidence that participants employ a belief state-based hybrid explorative-exploitative strategy on the information-selective symmetric reversal bandit task, lending further support to the finding that humans are guided by their subjective uncertainty when solving exploration-exploitation dilemmas.","Horvath, Lilla; Colcombe, Stanley; Milham, Michael; Ray, Shruti; Schwartenbeck, Philipp; Ostwald, Dirk",bioRxiv,310,16

Deaths are preventable if naloxone is administered in time. Take Home Naloxone (THN) kits have been distributed through drug services;however, uptake is low and effectiveness unproven. The TIME trial tests the feasibility of conducting a full randomised controlled trial of providing THN administration and basic life support training to high-risk opioid-users in emergency care settings.MethodsA multi-site feasibility trial commenced in June 2019 with two hospitals and their surrounding ambulance services (Bristol Royal Infirmary (BRI) with South Western Ambulance NHS Foundation Trust (SWASFT) and Hull Royal Infirmary with Yorkshire Ambulance Service) randomly allocated to intervention arms;and sites in Wrexham and Sheffield allocated as ‘usual care’ controls. SWASFT began recruiting in October 2019 with the aim of recruiting and training 50% (n=111) of paramedics working within the BRI’s catchment area, to supply THN to at least 100 eligible patients during a 12-month period.ResultsThe trial was suspended between 17.03.2020-06.08.2020 and extended to 01.03.2021 (COVID-19). Despite this, 121 SWASFT paramedics undertook TIME training. TIME trained paramedics attended 30% (n=57) of the n=190 opioid-related emergency calls requiring naloxone administration during the study period. A total of n=29 potentially eligible patients were identified before and n=28 after the COVID-19 suspension. Two patients were supplied with THN during each period. During the COVID-19 suspension, twenty-two potentially eligible patients were missed. The majority of eligible patients presented with a reduced consciousness level, preventing recruitment (73%;n=42/48). These patients were transported to hospital for further treatment (n=39) or died on scene following advanced life support (n=3).ConclusionsThe lowered consciousness levels of prehospital emergency ambulance patients who present with opioid poisoning, often prevent the delivery of training required to enable the supply of THN.","Johnston, Sasha Snooks Helen Jones Jenna Bell Fiona Benger Jonathan Black Sarah Dixon Simon Edwards Adrian Evans Bridie Fuller Gordon Goodacre Steve Hoskins Rebecca John Ann Lawrence Barbara Moore Chris Parry Emma Hird Kelly Wait Sarah Watkins Alan",Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ,310,1

Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on discussions regarding policy problems of an international, purpose-convened on-line policy network involving over 100 registrations from multiple countries. It analyses emerging institutional policy governance texts and documents shared between network participants, applies policy science literature regarding traditional institutional policy-making routines and rapid decision-making, and references media reportage from 2020. The paper traces how higher education institutions rapidly adjusted to pandemic conditions and largely on-line operations. Findings: The study finds that higher education institutions responded to the COVID-19 crisis by operationalising emergency management plans and introducing rapid, centralised decision-making to transition to remote modes of operation, learning and research under state-imposed emergency conditions. It highlights the need to ensure robust governance models recognising the ascendance of emergency decision-making and small-p policies in such circumstances, notwithstanding longstanding traditions of extended collegial policy-making routines for big-P (institutional) Policy. The pandemic highlighted practice and policy problems subject to rapid reform and forced institutions to clarify the relationship between emergency planning and decision-making, quality and institutional policy. Practical implications: In covering a range of institutional responses, the study advances the possibility of institutions planning better for unexpected, punctuated policy shifts during an emergency through the incorporation of rapid decision-making in traditionally collegial environments. At the same time, the paper cautions against the normalisation of such processes. The study also highlights key practices and policies that require urgent reconsideration in an emergency. The study is designed as a self-contained and freestanding narrative to inform responses to future emergencies by roundly addressing the particularities of the 2020 phase of the COVID-19 pandemic as it affected higher education. Originality/value: There is only limited research on policy-making in higher education institutions. This research offers an original contribution on institutional policy-making during a prolonged emergency that deeply changed higher education institution’s governance, operations and outlook. Particularly significant is the synthesis of experiences from a wide range of sector personnel, documenting punctuated policy shifts in policy governance (meta-policy), institutional policy-making routines and quality assurance actions under great pressure.

It has affected the human social lives and education in underdeveloped countries and severely impeded industries, organizations, agriculture, etc. Three perceptible types of SARS-CoV-2 strains have been discovered. Each of them has specific receptors, and some of them are common in SARS and SARS-CoV-2. Among them, the ACE2 receptor is believed to be the central receptor of human infectious coronaviruses. It supports mainly to get access, enter into the cell, and causes the basic infection. Similarly, TMPRSS2 is also acting as a portal for a virus to get an approach to the cell and does not support metabolic processes like replication virus.

Although pronation is mostly used as a treatment option in intubated patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), COVID-19 health emergency has led to a revaluation of this technique also in patients undergoing non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Objectives. The main study outcome was to assess oxygenation level for patients kept in prone position by comparing partial pressure of oxygen on fractional concentration of oxygen in inspired air (PO2/FiO2 ratio) changes before pronation and one hour after resupination. Method. In this retrospective single centre study, 20 patients over 18 years with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 related pneumonia and receiving helmet-CPAP or NIV were enrolled from Villa Scassi Hospital (Genoa, Italy) between March and May 2020. Data regarding blood gas measurements, respiratory rate and dyspnoea severity were collected immediately before pronation (T0), during pronation (T1) and one hour after resupination (T2). Patients were responding if their PO2/FiO2 ratio had improved by at least 20% comparing T0 and T2. Results. In patients undergoing helmet-CPAP the PO2/FiO2 ratio improved significantly comparing data at T0 and T1 (p-value < 0.0001) and even when the supine position was resumed (p-value < 0.0001). The slopes of PO2/FiO2 ratio from T0 and T1 between the two groups of responders and not-responders also differed significantly (p-value = 0.004). Discussion. Our results show that pronation improves oxygenation in awake patients with COVID-19-related pneumonia receiving helmet-CPAP, and this effect is maintained even one hour after re-supination. The significant difference in the slope of the PO2/FiO2 ratio from T0 and T1 between the two groups shows that a lack of substantial increase in the ratio between supine and prone position could predict a failure of this technique. Conclusions. In a health emergency such a global pandemic where available resources are limited, pronation should always be attempted in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in ARDS undergoing helmet-CPAP.","Costanzo, R.; Brianti, A.; Covesnon, M.

We have studied the early phase of VV assembly, when viral factories and spherical immature viruses (IVs) form in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. After freeze-substitution numerous cellular elements are detected around assembling viruses: membranes, ribosomes, microtubules, filaments, and unidentified structures. A double membrane is clearly resolved in the VV envelope for the first time, and freeze fracture reveals groups of tubules interacting laterally on the surface of the viroplasm foci. These data strongly support the hypothesis of a cellular tubulovesicular compartment, related to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), as the origin of the first VV envelope. Moreover, the cytoskeletal vimentin intermediate filaments are found around viral factories and inside the viroplasm foci, where vimentin and the VV core protein p39 colocalize in the areas where crescents protrude. Confocal microscopy showed that ERGIC elements and vimentin filaments concentrate in the viral factories. We propose that modified cellular ERGIC membranes and vimentin intermediate filaments act coordinately in the construction of viral factories and the first VV form through a unique mechanism of viral morphogenesis from cellular elements.","Risco, Cristina; Rodríguez, Juan R; López-Iglesias, Carmen; Carrascosa, José L; Esteban, Mariano; Rodríguez, Dolores",Journal of virology,310,19

Among 114 samples negative by culture, HRV was detected by RT-PCR in 52 (46%) for an overall picornavirus infection rate of 82% (283 of 346 subjects). Among the remaining 62 negative samples, human coronavirus RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 5 patients, so that 288 (83%) of patients had documented viral infection. The first symptom noticed most often was sore throat (40%) in HRV culture- or PCR-positive patients and stuffy nose in HRV-negative patients (27%). No differences in symptom scores over time or in the presence of individual symptoms were noted between groups. The median duration of the cold episodes was 11 days in HRV culture-positive patients, 9.5 days in HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 11.5 days in HRV-negative patients. On enrollment, abnormal MEPs (< or = -100 or > or = +100 mm of H2O) were found for 21% of HRV culture-positive patients, 14% of HRV RT-PCR-positive patients, and 10% of HRV-negative patients. No important differences in the clinical course of HRV culture-positive, HRV culture-negative and RT-PCR-positive, or HRV-negative colds were found. These results represent the highest frequency of virologically confirmed natural colds to date and document the importance of rhinoviruses as the cause of colds during fall months.","Arruda, E; Pitkäranta, A; Witek, T J; Doyle, C A; Hayden, F G",Journal of clinical microbiology,310,1

Differing adoption rates impacts subsequent COVID-19 control. Hence, positive and sustained behavioural modification is essential for disease control. We describe the adoption rates of behavioural modifications for Singapore's ""circuit-breaker"" (CB), the national public health response to the COVID-19 crisis, among the general population in the community. METHODS We conducted an interrupted-time series study using retrospective secondary data. We compared the proportion of Singaporeans who reported adopting specific behaviour modifications before, during and after CB. Behaviours of interest were working from home, performing hand hygiene, using face mask in public, and avoiding crowded areas. We compared change in incidence rates for community COVID-19 cases among the general population across the same time periods. RESULTS There was an increase in face mask usage (+46.9%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 34.9-58.8, P<0.01) and working from home (+20.4%, 95% CI 11.7-29.2, P<0.01) during CB than before CB in Singapore. Other self-reported behaviours showed no statistically significant difference. Change in daily incidence rates of community COVID-19 cases decreased from additional 0.73 daily case before CB to 0.55 fewer case per day during CB (P<0.01). There was no significant difference among all behaviour adoption rates after CB. Daily incidence of community cases continued to decrease by 0.11 case daily after CB. CONCLUSION Community incidence of COVID-19 in Singapore decreased during CB and remained low after CB. Use of face masks and social-distancing compliance through working from home increased during CB. However, it is unlikely to influence other sources of COVID-19 such as imported cases or within foreign worker dormitories.","Tan, Aidan Lyanzhiang; Ng, Sheryl Hui Xian; Pereira, Michelle Jessica","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",310,1

These lead to large number of illnesses and deaths worldwide each year. Outbreaks of emerging lethal viruses, such as Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus, could lead to epidemics or even pandemics if they are not effectively controlled. Current strategies to prevent viral entry into the human body are focused on cleansing the surface of the skin that covers hands and fingers. Surface protection and disinfection against microorganisms, including viruses, is performed by sanitization of the skin surface through hand washing with soap and water, surface disinfectants, and hand sanitizers, particularly alcohol-based hand sanitizers. However, concerns about the overall ineffectiveness, toxicity of certain ingredients of disinfectants, pollution of the environment, and the short duration of antimicrobial activity of alcohol have not been addressed, and the epidemiology of certain major viral infections are not correlated inversely with the current measures of viral prevention. In addition to a short duration on the skin surface, alcohol is ineffective against certain viruses such as norovirus, rabies virus, and polio virus. There is a need for a novel approach to protect humans and livestock from infections of pathogenic viruses that is broadly effective, long-lasting (persistent), non-toxic, and environment-friendly. A strong candidate is a group of unique compounds found in Camellia sinensis (tea plant): the green tea polyphenols, in particular epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and its lipophilic derivatives. This review discussed the weaknesses of current hand sanitizers, gathered published results from many studies on the antiviral activities of EGCG and its lipophilic derivatives, and the potential use of these compounds as a novel strategy for disease prevention, especially against pathogenic viruses.","Hsu, Stephen",Inflammation & allergy drug targets,310,1

The article describes the structure of the System, and the conditions and background of its establishment. It also looks at the components of system-based support of improvement of quality of life of elderly people. The article argues that it is essential to use the positive and negative experiences of different regions, to implement the practical and scientific expertise in the field of gerontology and geriatrics made so far in Russia, and to establish a meaningful and equal partnership among the state, research organizations, communities of professionals and non-public organizations. The authors suggest to look on Saint-Petersburg as a model region when establishing the System. The article contains a list of the major projects and events in the city from 2012 to 2020 aimed to provide system-based support for integrated health and social care for elderly people, not affiliated with any federal programs. Unbiased evaluation of the experience and expertise of Saint-Petersburg and other regions of Russia will allow to use them when establishing similar systems in other Russia's regions that do not possess sufficient resources. The authors suggest to establish the System in a step-wise manner at the federal district level. For example, a pilot project may be launched in the North-Western Federal District using the experience and expertise of Saint-Petersburg.","Anisimov, V N; Redko, A A; Finagentov, A V; Khavinson, V K; Shabrov, A V",Advances in gerontology = Uspekhi gerontologii,310,1

METHODS Pulmonary function tests were conducted for four times in 37 SARS patients during three-year convalescent period. They were discharged from hospital within one month, three months, one year and three years respectively. At the same time, pulmonary function of 15 healthy persons was examined as controls to be used for comparison. RESULTS Compared with the healthy controls, there were significant decrease in forced vital capacity (FVC), vital capacity (VC), one second forced expiratory volume (FEV1), 25%-75% forced expiratory flow (25%-75%FEF) of SARS patients within three years after their discharge from hospital (all P<0.05). There were no significant differences in FEV1/FVC, total lung capacity (TLC), diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) between the two groups (all P>0.05). Abnormality rate of DLCO in the SARS patients within three years after discharge was significantly decreased (32.4% vs. 5.4%,P<0.05), but no significant differences in FVC, VC, 25%-75%FEF among SARS patients discharged one month and three years from the hospital (all P>0.05). Ten SARS patients showed lower FVC (mild degree in 9 cases, severe degree in 1 case) three years later, 2 patients showed mildly lowered DLCO. CONCLUSION The lung diffusion function of the SARS patients had recovered after they were discharged from hospital within three years, but in 20%-30% patients there is still mild or moderate restrictive ventilation function abnormality and small airway function impairment. The lung functions of most patients have recovered gradually, but in a minority of patients they may be impaired.","Liu, Yu-Xiang; Ye, Yan-Ping; Zhang, Ping; Chen, Jin; Ye, Huan; He, Yao-Hong; Li, Ning",Zhongguo wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue = Chinese critical care medicine = Zhongguo weizhongbing jijiuyixue,310,1

A59, SK, or SD plaques are neutralized by antiserum prepared against homologous as well as heterologous virus. Plaque neutralization also demonstrated weak reactivity between SD or SK and mouse virus JHM but no reactivity with human coronavirus 229E. An antiserum prepared against human virus OC43 neutralized viruses SD and SK but not mouse viruses A59 or JHM. In a competitive enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay (cELISA) the binding of antiserum prepared against MS isolate SK to bound SK antigen was inhibited to a comparable degree using OC43, SD, or A59 viral antigens. Coronavirus 229E or uninfected cell antigens did not block the binding of anti-SK serum to bound antigen. However, a cELISA utilizing OC43 as bound antigen and competing an anti-OC43 serum suggests that virus OC43 may be more closely related to SK than A59. Specific viral polypeptides that share antigenic determinants have been identified by immunoprecipitation of S35 methionine labeled viral infected cell extracts. Polypeptides of similar molecular weight were precipitated from A59, SD, or SK infected cell extracts by SD, SK, OC43, or A59 antisera. Our data suggests that the mouse coronavirus A59, human coronavirus OC43, and MS isolates SD and SK contain antigenically related polypeptides of similar molecular weight.","Gerdes, J C; Jankovsky, L D; DeVald, B L; Klein, I; Burks, J S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,310,28

Fusion is mediated by the viral S protein. Here, the entry pathway of MHV-A59 into murine fibroblast cells was studied by independent approaches. Infection of cells assessed by plaque reduction assay was strongly inhibited by lysosomotropic compounds and substances that interfere with clathrin-dependent endocytosis, suggesting that MHV-A59 is taken up via endocytosis and delivered to acidic endosomal compartments. Infection was only slightly reduced in the presence of substances inhibiting proteases of endosomal compartments, precluding that the endocytic uptake is required to activate the fusion potential of the S protein by its cleavage. Fluorescence confocal microscopy of labeled MHV-A59 confirmed that virus is taken up via endocytosis. Bright labeling of intracellular compartments suggests their fusion with the viral envelope. No fusion with the plasma membrane was observed at neutral pH conditions. However, when virus was bound to cells and the pH was lowered to 5.0, we observed a strong labeling of the plasma membrane. Electron microscopy revealed low pH triggered conformational alterations of the S ectodomain. Very likely, these alterations are irreversible because low-pH treatment of viruses in the absence of target membranes caused an irreversible loss of the fusion activity. The results imply that endocytosis plays a major role in MHV-A59 infection and the acidic pH of the endosomal compartment triggers a conformational change of the S protein mediating fusion.","Eifart, Patricia; Ludwig, Kai; Böttcher, Christoph; de Haan, Cornelis A M; Rottier, Peter J M; Korte, Thomas; Herrmann, Andreas",Journal of virology,310,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: In the research process, the authors employed the monographic and abstract-logical methods. The communication aspect analysis of strengthening social resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic also grounded upon the results of the authors' sociological study ""Motivation of compliance/non-compliance with quarantine restrictions by the population of Ukraine"". Focus-group interviews and surveys. A total of 1,700 respondents represent the adult population of Ukraine aged 18 and older (except those living on the territory temporarily not controlled by the Ukrainian authorities - the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, some areas of Donetsk and Luhansk regions). The error of the study representativeness with a probability of 0.95: does not exceed 4%. RESULTS Results:The analysis results indicate that under pandemic conditions informational space of Ukraine is charging with low-quality and diverse information and is getting out of control, which entails adverse effects on societal resilience. Besides, a survey conducted by the SSU Center for Social Studies endorses the availability of communication gaps. The poll claims 38.6% of Ukrainians to be dissatisfied with their awareness level of Covid-19 because the information is contradictory and unreliable. The opinion poll also proves the low level of Ukrainians' trust in state institutions and official details on the Covid-19 pandemic. Furthermore, violations of quarantine restrictions are socially acceptable, and a significant part of the population tends to ignore such violations by others. That is, among Ukrainians, compliance with quarantine restrictions has not become a social norm. CONCLUSION Conclusions: An essential component for molding social resilience is the development and adoption of communication policies to change human behavior in the long-term in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government should also develop a Public Health Awareness Concept in the pandemic with appropriate implementation plans at the state, regional and territorial community levels.","Kostenko, Andriana M; Svitailo, Nina D; Nazarov, Mykola S; Kurochkina, Viktoriya S; Smiianov, Yevhen V",Wiadomosci lekarskie,310,16

Alternatives such as serological diagnosis and maintenance of HPVs in culture are neither clinically useful nor consistently feasible. Novel HPV isolates have traditionally been described as ""types"". The analysis of specific HPV types is of medical importance, because HPV types typically induce type-specific lesions, i.e. they may be specific for cutaneous or mucosal epithelia, or give rise to benign warts or malignant carcinomas. Recently, it was formally decided that papillomaviruses are a virus family separate from the polyomaviruses. Within the papillomavirus family, closely or remotely related types form species or genera. These formal agreements were important as they brought the taxonomy of papillomaviruses in line with that of other viruses, bacteria and higher organisms, although their impact on medical practice and terminology used in clinical studies is limited. Notably, however, HPV types that are closely related (i.e. form ""species"") are associated with similar lesions. Confusion of the terms ""type"" and ""subtype"" should be avoided, as the latter term refers to some specific but rare taxonomic assemblages. In contrast to many RNA viruses, HPV types evolve very slowly, and diverged since the origin of humans only by about 2%. These divergent isolates are called ""variants"". HPVs evolved together with humankind and Homo sapiens was never without HPVs, and consequently never without warts and cervical cancer. Variants of the same HPV type may have different pathogenicity and may account for part of the worldwide disparities in the occurrence of genital cancers.","Bernard, Hans-Ulrich",Journal of clinical virology : the official publication of the Pan American Society for Clinical Virology,310,1

OBJECTIVE To compare the incidence and determinants of COPD exacerbations occurring between the Christmas holiday period and the remainder of the winter season. METHODS Seventy-one subjects with COPD of mixed severity faxed daily symptom diaries to a computer monitoring system from December 1, 2006, to April 30, 2007. Possible exacerbations prompted a home visit for assessment, spirometry and specimen collection for virological testing. RESULTS Study subjects submitted a total of 95.4% of possible daily symptom diary sheets by fax. Of 114 possible COPD exacerbations detected using the faxed diaries, 110 met the Anthonisen criteria for true exacerbations. A total of 47 exacerbations (mean 6.7/week) occurred during the Christmas holiday period, while 63 exacerbations (mean 4.3/week) occurred during the remainder of winter. Of the Christmas period exacerbations and of those in the balance of winter, 21 (44%) and 20 (32%), respectively, coincided with respiratory viral infections. CONCLUSIONS The incidence of COPD exacerbations during the Christmas period was greater than during the rest of winter in 2006/2007 and peaked immediately before Christmas - in contrast to hospital presentation for COPD, which peaked during the Christmas week. No clear role of respiratory viral infections in the increased rate of exacerbations during the Christmas period was established in the present study. COPD patients were highly compliant with daily symptom reporting using faxed daily diaries, which permitted nearly complete detection of all exacerbations that occurred at incidence.","Johnston, Neil W; McIvor, Andrew; Lambert, Kim; Greene, Justina M; Hussack, Pat; Gerhardsson de Verdier, Maria; Higenbottam, Tim; Lewis, Jonathan; Newbold, Paul; Herath, Athula; Jenkins, Martin",Canadian respiratory journal,310,1

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA Superior outcomes of MIDP compared with open distal pancreatectomy have been reported. In the Netherlands (2005 to 2013) only 10% of distal pancreatectomies were in a minimally invasive fashion and 85% of surgeons welcomed MIDP training. The feasibility and impact of a nationwide training program is unknown. METHODS From 2014 to 2015, 32 pancreatic surgeons from 17 centers participated in a nationwide training program in MIDP, including detailed technique description, video training, and proctoring on-site. Outcomes of MIDP before training (2005-2013) were compared with outcomes after training (2014-2015). RESULTS In total, 201 patients were included; 71 underwent MIDP in 9 years before training versus 130 in 22 months after training (7-fold increase, P < 0.001). The conversion rate (38% [n = 27] vs 8% [n = 11], P < 0.001) and blood loss were lower after training and more pancreatic adenocarcinomas were resected (7 [10%] vs 28 [22%], P = 0.03), with comparable R0-resection rates (4/7 [57%] vs 19/28 [68%], P = 0.67). Clavien-Dindo score ≥III complications (15 [21%] vs 19 [15%], P = 0.24) and pancreatic fistulas (20 [28%] vs 41 [32%], P = 0.62) were not significantly different. Length of hospital stay was shorter after training (9 [7-12] vs 7 [5-8] days, P < 0.001). Thirty-day mortality was 3% vs 0% (P = 0.12). CONCLUSION A nationwide MIDP training program was feasible and followed by a steep increase in the use of MIDP, also in patients with pancreatic cancer, and decreased conversion rates. Future studies should determine whether such a training program is applicable in other settings.","de Rooij, Thijs; van Hilst, Jony; Boerma, Djamila; Bonsing, Bert A; Daams, Freek; van Dam, Ronald M; Dijkgraaf, Marcel G; van Eijck, Casper H; Festen, Sebastiaan; Gerhards, Michael F; Koerkamp, Bas Groot; van der Harst, Erwin; de Hingh, Ignace H; Kazemier, Geert; Klaase, Joost; de Kleine, Ruben H; van Laarhoven, Cornelis J; Lips, Daan J; Luyer, Misha D; Molenaar, I Quintus; Patijn, Gijs A; Roos, Daphne; Scheepers, Joris J; van der Schelling, George P; Steenvoorde, Pascal; Vriens, Menno R; Wijsman, Jan H; Gouma, Dirk J; Busch, Olivier R; Abu Hilal, Mohammed; Besselink, Marc G",Annals of surgery,310,1

Recent advances in immunology have allowed researchers to have a better understanding of the immunological implication of related diseases, which facilitates more rational design of adjuvant systems. Understanding the molecular structure of the adjuvants allows the establishment of their structure-activity relationships which is useful for the development of next-generation adjuvants. This review summarizes the current state of adjuvants development in the field of synthetic peptide-based vaccines. The structural, chemical and biological properties of adjuvants associated with their immunomodulatory effects are discussed.","Azmi, Fazren; Ahmad Fuaad, Abdullah Al Hadi; Skwarczynski, Mariusz; Toth, Istvan",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,310,33

Healthcare workers are a particularly vulnerable group at risk of occupational exposure during infectious disease outbreaks, as seen during SARS and as documented/reported in the recent National Survey of the Work and Health of Nurses (Statistics Canada, 2006). Approximately one third of Canadian nurses identified job strain and poor health, related to their work environment. Three years after SARS, this article presents a critical analysis of the gaps of three hospital pandemic influenza plans in the context of established organizational supports for healthcare workers. METHODS Hospital pandemic influenza plans were obtained from institutional representatives in three Ontario cities. Qualitative gap analysis of these plans was conducted using a checklist of 11 support categories, developed from a review of existing literature and findings from a previous study of focus groups with emergency and critical care nurses. RESULTS Support mechanisms were identified in the plans; however, gaps were evident in preparation for personal protective equipment, education and informational support, and support during quarantine. Hospital emergency planning could be more robust by including additional organizational supports such as emotional/psychological support services, delineating management responsibilities, human resources, vaccine/anti-viral planning, recognition/compensation, media strategies, and professional development. CONCLUSIONS Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, hospitals have invested in pandemic planning, as evidenced by the comprehensive plans examined here. Organizational support mechanisms for healthcare workers were included in these hospital plans; however, the gaps identified here may have serious implications for employee health and safety, and overall response during a large scale infectious disease outbreak. The authors provide a number of recommendations for consideration in infectious disease pandemic plan development to better support the healthcare workers in their roles as first responders.","Amaratunga, Carol A; O'Sullivan, Tracey L; Phillips, Karen P; Lemyre, Louise; O'Connor, Eileen; Dow, Darcie; Corneil, Wayne",American journal of disaster medicine,310,16

However, other specimen collection methods such as an oropharyngeal swab (OPS) or saliva specimen are also used for SARS-CoV-2 testing during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, it remains unclear if rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection differ between sampling methods. This study will compare the rates of SARS-CoV-2 detection by saliva, OPS, and NPS sampling in a public setting. METHODS Individuals referred for outpatient SARS-CoV-2 testing will be invited to participate in a prospective clinical study. They will have saliva, OPS and NPS specimens collected that will be analysed separately for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR. The rate of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva, OPS and NPS will be compared using a logistic regression mixed-effect model analysis. A sample of 19,110 participants is required at an expected 1.5% test-positive rate in order to detect a 25.6% difference. The total sample size will be adjusted as the test-positive rate changes. CONCLUSIONS This study will provide evidence for the optimal site of specimen collection to detect SARS-CoV-2. The results may help guide the health authorities.

However, existing antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antimalarial drugs is the only option against SARS-CoV-2, but it may be harmful to patients without more clinical evidence. As an alternative solution, we proposed a newer hypothesis using the selective 10 potent anti-HIV drugs and flavonoid class of phytochemicals from previous reports to use in combination against SARS-CoV-2. Primarily, 10 anti-HIV protease inhibitor drugs and 10 phyto-flavonoids as ligands in molecular docking study against the putative target, the SARS-CoV-2-main protease (Mpro) ID: 6Y2E), as an essential enzyme in viral genome replication. According to molecular docking and drug-ability scores of each ligand, the anti-HIV drug, the darunavir (with a docking score, -10.25 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.60) and the quercetin-3-rhamnoside (with a docking score, -10.90 kcal/mol and drug-likeness rating, 0.82) were selected for further analysis in combined effect. Perceptibly, the combined 'anti-HIV drug and phyto-flavonoid' docking complex has actively interacted with eight strong H-bonds with stability, briefly elucidated through RMRD-, RMSF- Rg-plots and MM/PBSA-binding energy calculation during 100 ns than the individual against SARS-CoV-2-Mpro.

METHODS: Here we used data from proactive sampling carried out in New York City from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined weekly nasal swab collection with self-reports of respiratory symptoms from 191 participants to investigate the profile of recurring infections with endemic coronaviruses. RESULTS: During the study, 12 individuals tested positive multiple times for the same coronavirus. We found no significant difference between the probability of testing positive at least once and the probability of a recurrence for the betacoronaviruses HKU1 and OC43 at 34 weeks after enrollment/first infection. We also found no significant association between repeat infections and symptom severity, but found strong association between symptom severity and belonging to the same family. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that reinfections with the same endemic coronavirus are not atypical in a time window shorter than 1 year and that the genetic basis of innate immune response may be a greater determinant of infection severity than immune memory acquired after a previous infection.","Galanti, Marta; Shaman, Jeffrey",J. infect. dis,310,16

We sought to elucidate the effect of empagliflozin as an add-on therapy on decongestion and renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. METHODS: The study was terminated early due to COVID-19 pandemic. We enrolled 59 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes admitted for acute decompensated heart failure. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either empagliflozin add-on (n=30) or conventional glucose-lowering therapy (n=29). We performed laboratory tests at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after randomization. Percent change in plasma volume between admission and subsequent time points was calculated using the Strauss formula. RESULTS: There were no significant baseline differences in left ventricular ejection fraction and serum NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide), hematocrit, or serum creatinine levels between the 2 groups. Seven days after randomization, NT-proBNP level was significantly lower in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group (P=0.040), and hemoconcentration (&#8805;3% absolute increase in hematocrit) was more frequently observed in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group (P=0.020). The decrease in percent change in plasma volume between baseline and subsequent time points was significantly larger in the empagliflozin group than in the conventional group 7 days after randomization (P=0.017). The incidence of worsening renal function (an increase in serum creatinine &#8805;0.3 mg/dL) did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory analysis, empagliflozin achieved effective decongestion without an increased risk of worsening renal function as an add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes with acute decompensated heart failure.

Results: Between 19 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, 455 non-critically ill patients with symptoms suspect for COVID-19 were admitted. The initial NFS for SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR yielded 66.9%, the second NFS 25.4% and bronchoscopy with BAL 5.9% of total COVID-19 diagnoses. In the BAL fluid, other respiratory pathogens were detected in 65% (13/20) of the COVID-19 negative patients and only in 1/7 COVID-19 positive patients. Retrospective antibody testing at the time around BAL sampling showed a positive IgA or IgG in 42.9 % of the COVID-19 positive and 10.5% of the COVID-19 negative group. Follow-up serology showed 100% COVID-19 positivity in the COVID-19 positive group and 100% IgG negativity in the COVID-19 negative group. Conclusion: In our experience, bronchoscopy with BAL can have an added value to rule-in or rule-out COVID-19 in patients with clinical and radiographical high-likelihood of COVID-19 and repeated negative NFS testing. Furthermore, culture and respiratory multiplex PCR on BAL fluid can aid to identify alternative microbial etiological agents in this group. Retrospective analysis of antibody development in this selected group of patients suggests that the implementation of serological assays in the routine testing protocol will decrease the need for invasive procedures like bronchoscopy.","De Clercq, J; Malfait, T; Malfait, S; Boelens, J; Coorevits, L; Padalko, E; Vandendriessche, S; Verhasselt, B; Morbée, L; Bauters, F; Hertegonne, K; Stevens, D; Vande Weygaerde, Y; Vermaelen, K; Van Biesen, W; Vanommeslaeghe, F; Verbeke, F; Piers, R; Van Den Noortgate, N; Desmet, T; Vermassen, F; Vandekerckhove, L; Van Braeckel, E",Acta Clin Belg,310,14

However, the field needs to better understand if a change in care delivery from in-person to telehealth as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will yield durable patient engagement and health outcomes for patients with obesity. The objective of this study was to examine the association of mode of healthcare utilization (telehealth versus in-person) and sociodemographic factors among patients with obesity during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from a university outpatient obesity medicine clinic and a community bariatric surgery practice. Patients completed an online survey (1 June 2020-24 September 2020) to assess changes in healthcare utilization modality during subsequent changes in infection rates in the geographic area. Logistic regression analysis examined the association of mode of healthcare utilization and key sociodemographic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 583 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2 years (standard deviation 13.0), mean body mass index 40.2 (standard deviation 6.7), 49.2% non-Hispanic white, 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity, 33.1% completed bariatric surgery) were included. Adjusted logistic regression models showed older age was inversely associated with telehealth use (adjusted odds ratio = 0.58, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.98) and non-Hispanic black were more likely to use telehealth compared to non-Hispanic white (adjusted odds ratio = 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.05-2.81). CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting access to healthcare among patients with obesity. Telehealth is an emerging modality that can maintain healthcare access during the pandemic, but utilization varies by age and ethnicity in this high-risk population.","Almandoz, Jaime P; Xie, Luyu; Schellinger, Jeffrey N; Mathew, M Sunil; Edwards, Khary; Ofori, Ashley; Kukreja, Sachin; Schneider, Benjamin; Messiah, Sarah E",J Telemed Telecare,310,8

The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online, we tested the following hypotheses: 1) People will show greater symptoms of depression and anxiety under lockdown conditions that did not allow contact with outdoor nature spaces; 2) Where access to public outdoor nature spaces was strictly restricted, (2a) those with green/blue nature view or (2b) access to private outdoor spaces such as a garden or balcony will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, and a more positive mood. Based on 5218 responses from 9 countries, we found that lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts, especially for those under strict lockdown. People under strict lockdown in Spain (3403 responses), perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health, using the benefits that ecosystem services are providing us.","Pouso, Sarai; Borja, Ángel; Fleming, Lora E; Gómez-Baggethun, Erik; White, Mathew P; Uyarra, María C",Sci Total Environ,310,1

Objective: To evaluate the risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with not-infected, concomitant pregnant individuals. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study that took place from March to October 2020, involving 43 institutions in 18 countries, 2 unmatched, consecutive, not-infected women were concomitantly enrolled immediately after each infected woman was identified, at any stage of pregnancy or delivery, and at the same level of care to minimize bias. Women and neonates were followed up until hospital discharge. Exposures: COVID-19 in pregnancy determined by laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiological pulmonary findings or 2 or more predefined COVID-19 symptoms. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome measures were indices of (maternal and severe neonatal/perinatal) morbidity and mortality; the individual components of these indices were secondary outcomes. Models for these outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and history of morbidity. Results: A total of 706 pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis and 1424 pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis were enrolled, all with broadly similar demographic characteristics (mean [SD] age, 30.2 [6.1] years). Overweight early in pregnancy occurred in 323 women (48.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis and 554 women (40.2%) without. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at higher risk for preeclampsia/eclampsia (relative risk [RR], 1.76; 95% CI, 1.27-2.43), severe infections (RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), intensive care unit admission (RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10), maternal mortality (RR, 22.3; 95% CI, 2.88-172), preterm birth (RR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94), medically indicated preterm birth (RR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.56-2.51), severe neonatal morbidity index (RR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.69-4.18), and severe perinatal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.66-2.75). Fever and shortness of breath for any duration was associated with increased risk of severe maternal complications (RR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.92-3.40) and neonatal complications (RR, 4.97; 95% CI, 2.11-11.69). Asymptomatic women with COVID-19 diagnosis remained at higher risk only for maternal morbidity (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.00-1.54) and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.01-2.63). Among women who tested positive (98.1% by real-time polymerase chain reaction), 54 (13%) of their neonates tested positive. Cesarean delivery (RR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.18-3.91) but not breastfeeding (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.66-1.85) was associated with increased risk for neonatal test positivity. Conclusions and Relevance: In this multinational cohort study, COVID-19 in pregnancy was associated with consistent and substantial increases in severe maternal morbidity and mortality and neonatal complications when pregnant women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis were compared. The findings should alert pregnant individuals and clinicians to implement strictly all the recommended COVID-19 preventive measures.","Villar, José; Ariff, Shabina; Gunier, Robert B; Thiruvengadam, Ramachandran; Rauch, Stephen; Kholin, Alexey; Roggero, Paola; Prefumo, Federico; do Vale, Marynéa Silva; Cardona-Perez, Jorge Arturo; Maiz, Nerea; Cetin, Irene; Savasi, Valeria; Deruelle, Philippe; Easter, Sarah Rae; Sichitiu, Joanna; Soto Conti, Constanza P; Ernawati, Ernawati; Mhatre, Mohak; Teji, Jagjit Singh; Liu, Becky; Capelli, Carola; Oberto, Manuela; Salazar, Laura; Gravett, Michael G; Cavoretto, Paolo Ivo; Nachinab, Vincent Bizor; Galadanci, Hadiza; Oros, Daniel; Ayede, Adejumoke Idowu; Sentilhes, Loïc; Bako, Babagana; Savorani, Mónica; Cena, Hellas; García-May, Perla K; Etuk, Saturday; Casale, Roberto; Abd-Elsalam, Sherief; Ikenoue, Satoru; Aminu, Muhammad Baffah; Vecciarelli, Carmen; Duro, Eduardo A; Usman, Mustapha Ado; John-Akinola, Yetunde; Nieto, Ricardo; Ferrazi, Enrico; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A; Langer, Ana; Kennedy, Stephen H; Papageorghiou, Aris T",JAMA pediatr.

INTRODUCTION: The recent health emergency which in the first half of 2020 has seen Italy involved in the management of patients with COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 19), has led to further stress for hospitals both in terms of beds and in terms of workload for healthcare workers. METHOD: A multicenter study was conducted. A convenience sample of 208 nurses participated in the study. Between March 20 and July 20, 2020, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS) questionnaire was made available online by using the Google Forms platform in order to detect and measure the severity of Burnout Syndrome (BOS). RESULTS: BOS-related symptoms (medium or high score) for individual MBI-GS domains were identified in at least 68% of nurses. One hundred and sixty-one nurses (77.4%) had a risk of emotional exhaustion, 143 (68.7%) of depersonalization, and 162 (77.9%) of reduced professional accomplishment. High risk was observed among nurses who managed COVID patients at their own operating unit (RR = 1.27, p = 0.016). Severe BOS risk was observed in 146 nurses analyzed (70.2%) with an increased risk among Intensive Care nurses. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the nurses during the coronavirus pandemic, had high levels of work-related suffering and were at risk of physical and emotional exhaustion. Further research should be undertaken to establish causal relationships between BOS and personal and environmental risk factors among healthcare professionals in relation to the COVID-19.","Damico, Vincenzo; Murano, Liana; Demoro, Giuseppe; Russello, Giuseppe; Cataldi, Giusy; D039,; Alessandro, Antonella",Prof Inferm,310,26

STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a multi-method study of survey and interview data. We performed 40 baseline interviews and surveys in spring 2019 and 36 follow-up surveys and ten interviews one year later. We compared pre- and post-Likert scale responses of provider views on the importance of different aspects of standard medication abortion assessment and evaluation (e.g., related to ultrasounds and blood-typing). We performed content analysis of the follow-up interviews using deductive-inductive analysis. RESULTS: Survey results revealed that clinics substantially changed their medication abortion protocols in response to COVID-19, with more than half increasing their gestational age limits and introducing telemedicine for follow-up of a medication abortion. Interview analysis suggested that physicians were more supportive of self-sourced medication abortion in response to changing clinic protocols that decreased in-clinic assessment and evaluation for medication abortion, and as a result of physicians' altered assessments of risk in the context of COVID-19. Having evidence already in place that supported these practice changes made the implementation of new protocols more efficient, while working in a state with restrictive abortion policies thwarted the flexibility of clinics to adapt to changes in standards of care. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study reveals that the COVID-19 pandemic has altered clinical assessment of risk and has shifted practice towards a less medicalized model. Further work to facilitate person-centered abortion information and care can build on initial modifications in response to the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: COVID-19 has shifted clinician perception of risk and has catalyzed a change in clinical protocols for medication abortion. However, state laws and policies that regulate medication abortion limit physician ability to respond to changes in risk assessment.","Karlin, Jennifer; Sarnaik, Shashi; Holt, Kelsey; Dehlendorf, Christine; Joffe, Carole; Steinauer, Jody",Contraception,310,29

Little is known about health and wellbeing in this population and whether they differ from those who cohabit. This paper fills this research gap. Analysis was undertaken of Wave 8 of the Understanding Society Household Panel Survey, including variables such as internet use and volunteering. Differences were found between those who live alone and cohabit. Volunteering was a predictor of better health outcomes for those who lived alone but not for those who cohabit, despite similar rates of volunteering. Internet use predicted some better health outcome for those who cohabit but poorer for those who live alone. This suggests lifestyle factors vary in how they affect the health and wellbeing of older women, depending on cohabitation status.","Forward, Catherine; Khan, Hafiz T A; Fox, Pauline",J Popul Ageing,310,2

However, the domain gap between natural and medical images causes an inevitable performance bottleneck. To alleviate this problem, an US dataset named US-4 is constructed for direct pretraining on the same domain. It contains over 23,000 images from four US video sub-datasets. To learn robust features from US-4, we propose an US semi-supervised contrastive learning method, named USCL, for pretraining. In order to avoid high similarities between negative pairs as well as mine abundant visual features from limited US videos, USCL adopts a sample pair generation method to enrich the feature involved in a single step of contrastive optimization. Extensive experiments on several downstream tasks show the superiority of USCL pretraining against ImageNet pretraining and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) pretraining approaches. In particular, USCL pretrained backbone achieves fine-tuning accuracy of over 94% on POCUS dataset, which is 10% higher than 84% of the ImageNet pretrained model.

This paper explores the longitudinal relationship between resilience and PTG, as well as the role of job burnout in this relationship, among frontline healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, who have been exposed to high-risk work environments over extraordinarily long workdays. In Study 1, 134 Chinese frontline healthcare workers completed a three-wave survey (Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3) in February-May 2020. In Study 2, 401 frontline healthcare workers completed a cross-sectional survey. The cross-lagged analysis suggested that resilience at Time 1 positively predicted PTG at Time 2, which in turn positively predicted resilience at Time 3. PTG at Time 1 also positively predicted resilience at Time 2 (Study 1). However, job burnout was negatively related to both resilience and PTG; in particular, emotional exhaustion moderated the link between PTG and resilience (Study 2). Our findings support a cycle of reinforcement between resilience and PTG over time. The positive effect of PTG on resilience, however, is undermined by emotional exhaustion. Implications for future intervention research and workplace support are discussed.","Lyu, Yizhi; Yu, Yongju; Chen, Shuquan; Lu, Shuang; Ni, Shiguang",Applied psychology.

METHODS: We recorded the recovery status of 67 inpatients with hypertension and COVID-19 induced pneumonia in the Raytheon Mountain Hospital in Wuhan during February 12, 2020 and March 30, 2020. Patients treated with ACEI or ARBs were categorized in group A (n = 22), while patients who were not administered either ACEI or ARBs were categorized into group B (n = 45). We did a comparative analysis of various parameters such as the pneumonia progression, length-of-stay in the hospital, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), serum creatinine (Cr), and creatine kinase (CK) between the day when these patients were admitted to the hospital and the day when the treatment ended. RESULTS: These 67 hypertension cases counted for 33.17% of the total COVID-19 patients. There was no significant difference in the usage of drug treatment of COVID-19 between groups A and B (p > 0.05). During the treatment, 1 case in group A and 3 cases in group B progressed from mild pneumonia into severe pneumonia. Eventually, all patients were cured and discharged after treatment, and no recurrence of COVID-2019 induced pneumonia occurred after the discharge. The length of stays was shorter in group A as compared with group B, but there was no significant difference (p > 0.05). There was also no significant difference in other general parameters between the patients of the groups A and B on the day of admission to the hospital (p > 0.05). The ALT, CK, and Cr levels did not significantly differ between groups A and B on the day of admission and the day of discharge (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: To treat the hypertension patients with COVID-19 caused pneumonia, anti-hypertensive drugs (ACEs and ARBs) may be used according to the relative guidelines. The treatment regimen with these drugs does not need to be altered for the COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Wenjun; Zhao, Xiaohui; Wei, Wei; Fan, Weiwang; Gao, Kai; He, Shengxiu; Zhuang, Xijing",BMC Infect Dis,310,20

RevMan 5.4 was used to provide pooled estimates for standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Twenty-nine clinical studies were included in this meta-analysis. Significantly higher CK-MB (0.64, 95% CI = 0.19-1.09), PCT (0.47, 95% CI = 0.26-0.68), NT-proBNP (1.90, 95% CI = 1.63-2.17), BNP (1.86, 95% CI = 1.63-2.09), and d-dimer (1.30, 95% CI = 0.91-1.69) were found in severe compared with non-severe COVID-19. Significantly higher CK-MB (3.84, 95% CI = 0.62-7.05), PCT (1.49, 95% CI = 0.86-2.13), NT-proBNP (4.66, 95% CI = 2.42-6.91), BNP (1.96, 95% CI = 0.78-3.14), troponin (1.64 (95% CI = 0.83-2.45), and d-dimer (2.72, 95% CI = 2.14-3.29) were found in those who died from compared with survivors of COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: High CK-MB, PCT, NT-proBNP, BNP, and d-dimer could be predictive markers for severity of COVID-19, while high CK-MB, PCT, NT-proBNP, BNP, troponin, and d-dimer could be predictive markers for survival of COVID-19 patients.","Wungu, Citrawati Dyah Kencono; Khaerunnisa, Siti; Putri, Eka Arum Cahyaning; Hidayati, Hanik Badriyah; Qurnianingsih, Ema; Lukitasari, Lina; Humairah, Ira",Int J Infect Dis,310,16

The fusion between trophoblast cells, first into cytotrophoblast and then into syncytiotrophoblast, is facilitated by the fusogenic protein syncytin. Syncytin derives from an envelope glycoprotein (ENV) of retroviral origin. In exogenous retroviruses, the envelope glycoproteins coded by env genes allow fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane and entry of the virus into a host cell. During mammalian evolution, the env genes have been repeatedly, and independently, captured by various mammalian species to facilitate the formation of the placenta. Such a shift in the function of a gene, or a trait, for a different purpose during evolution is called an exaptation (co-option). We discuss the structure and origin of the placenta, the fusogenic and non-fusogenic functions of syncytin, and the mechanism of cell fusion. We also comment on an alleged danger of the COVID-19 vaccine based on the presupposed similarity between syncytin and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","Kloc, Malgorzata; Uosef, Ahmed; Kubiak, Jacek Z; Ghobrial, Rafik M",,310,4

The COVID-19 virus directly targets the lungs, leading to pneumonia-like symptoms and shortness of breath with life-threatening consequences. Despite the fact that self-quarantine and social distancing are indispensable during the pandemic, the procedure for testing COVID-19 contraction is conventionally available through nasal swabs, saliva test kits, and blood work at healthcare settings. Therefore, devising personalized self-testing kits for COVID-19 virus and other similar viruses is heavily admired. Many e-health initiatives have been made possible by the advent of smartphones with embedded software, hardware, high-performance computing, and connectivity capabilities. A careful review of breathing sounds and their implications in identifying breathing complications suggests that the breathing sounds of COVID-19 contracted users may reveal certain acoustic signal patterns, which is worth investigating. To this end, acquiring respiratory data solely from breathing sounds fed to the smartphone's microphone strikes as a very appealing resolution. The acquired breathing sounds can be analyzed using advanced signal processing and analysis in tandem with new deep/machine learning and pattern recognition techniques to separate the breathing phases, estimate the lung volume, oxygenation, and to further classify the breathing data input into healthy or unhealthy cases. The ideas presented have the potential to be deployed as self-test breathing monitoring apps for the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, where users can check their breathing sound pattern frequently through the app.","Faezipour, Miad; Abuzneid, Abdelshakour",Telemed J E Health,310,21

METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1202 patients' medical records after CABG were evaluated by a research-made checklist. Tarone-Ware test was used to determine the predictors of patients' LOS in the ICU. Cox regression model was used to determine the risk factors and risk ratios associated with ICU LOS. RESULTS: The mean ICU LOS after CABG was 55.27±17.33 hours. Cox regression model showed that having more than two chest tubes (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.005-1.287, Relative Risk [RR]=1.138), occurrence of atelectasis (95% CI 1.000-3.007, RR=1.734), and occurrence of atrial fibrillation after CABG (95% CI 1.428-2.424, RR=1.861) were risk factors associated with longer ICU LOS. The discrimination power of this set of predictors was demonstrated with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and it was 0.69. A simple risk scoring system was developed based on three identified predictors that can raise ICU LOS. CONCLUSION: The simple risk scoring system developed based on three identified predictors can help to plan more accurately a patient's LOS in hospital for CABG and can be useful in managing human and financial resources.","Zarrizi, Maryam; Paryad, Ezzat; Khanghah, Atefeh Ghanbari; Leili, Ehsan Kazemnezhad; Faghani, Hamed",Braz J Cardiovasc Surg,310,11

Pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and experience high levels of distress during an infectious disease outbreak. The aim of this study was to determine anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study surveyed a total of 283 pregnant women within the period of May 11 to May 28,2020. During their regular antenatal visit, pregnant women were invited to participate in the study. The self-created personal information form was used to assess the main characteristics of the participants. Anxiety and PTSD symptoms of the pregnant women were measured by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. RESULTS: The mean age of the pregnant women was 29.20±5.55 years. Regarding gestational age, 72 (25.4%), 86 (30.4) and 125 (44.2) were in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. The mean gestational age was 23.82±11.05 weeks. The mean STAI-S and STAI-T scores were 39.52±10.56 within the cut-off value (39-40) of the instrument and 42.74±8.33, respectively. Furthermore, the mean total IES-R score was 36.60±15.65 within the cut-off value (24) of the instrument. Multiple regression analysis revealed that pregnancy complication (p=0.01) and employment status of husband (p=0.04) were the best predictors of state anxiety. Additionally, the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms (p=0.01) and educational level (p=0.01) were found to predict PTSD symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women would be likely to experience high levels of anxiety and PTSD symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic's delay phase. The results should sensitize the medical team to increased anxiety and PTDS symptoms of the pregnant women in order to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","Hocaoglu, Meryem; Ayaz, Reyhan; Gunay, Taner; Akin, Elis; Turgut, Abdulkadir; Karateke, Ates",Psychiatr Danub,310,16

In the face of a new infectious agent causing acute respiratory failure for which there were no known effective therapies, rapid, often pragmatic trials were necessary to evaluate potential treatments, frequently starting with medications that are already marketed for other indications. Early in the pandemic, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were two such candidates. OBJECTIVE: Assess the relative efficacy of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a randomized clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Treatment was 5 days of study medication. The primary endpoint was the COVID Ordinal Outcomes scale at day 14. Secondary endpoints included hospital-, ICU-, and ventilator-free days at day 28. The trial was stopped early after enrollment of 85 patients when a separate clinical trial concluded that a clinically important effect of hydroxychloroquine over placebo was definitively excluded. Comparisons were made a priori using a proportional odds model from a Bayesian perspective. RESULTS: We enrolled 85 patients at 13 hospitals over 11 weeks. Adherence to study medication was high. The estimated odds ratio for less favorable status on the ordinal scale for hydroxychloroquine vs. azithromycin from the primary analysis was 1.07, with a 95% credible interval from 0.63 to 1.83 with a posterior probability of 60% that hydroxychloroquine was worse than azithryomycin. Secondary outcomes displayed a similar, slight preference for azithromycin over hydroxychloroquine. QTc prolongation was rare and did not differ between groups. The twenty safety outcomes were similar between arms with the possible exception of post-randomization onset acute kidney injury, which was more common with hydroxychloroquine (15% vs. 0%). Patients in the hydroxychloroquine arm received remdesivir more often than in the azithromycin arm (19% vs. 2%). There was no apparent association between remdesivir use and acute kidney injury. CONCLUSIONS: While early termination limits the precision of our results, we found no suggestion of substantial efficacy for hydroxychloroquine over azithromycin. Acute kidney injury may be more common with hydroxychloroquine than azithromycin, although this may be due to the play of chance. Differential use of remdesivir may have biased our results in favor of hydroxychloroquine. Our results are consistent with conclusions from other trials that hydroxychloroquine cannot be recommended for inpatients with COVID-19; azithromycin may merit additional investigation.

With 17% of the global population, the African continent has an equivalent of 5% of the global confirmed cases and nearly 3% of fatalities. Although COVID-19 infections are at a minimal level in Africa, the similarities of COVID-19 with several other infections could mask accurate reporting of infections and associated deaths. In this correspondence, we sought to share our views on these and strategies for the improvement of reporting COVID-19 related deaths in the African context. Occasional interruption of the testing activity due to shortage of human and material resources has masked the true reflection of COVID-19 infection rates and associated deaths. Diagnosis and contact tracing of COVID-19 positives have been faced with many challenges on the African continent. In addition, incomplete data capture of COVID-19 deaths could impede the planning and implementation of policies which are needed in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proper coordination and intensified efforts during the COVID-19 outbreak response are required to ensure complete documentation of COVID-19-related deaths.

The aim of this study was to assess environmental and social factors influencing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo, Brazil. Firstly, a spatial analysis was conducted to provide insights into the spread of COVID-19 within the expanded metropolitan area. Moreover, Spearman correlation test and sensitivity analysis were performed to assess social indicators and environmental conditions which possibly influence the incidence of COVID-19. Our results reveal that the spread of COVID-19 from the capital city São Paulo-its epicenter in Brazil-is directly associated with the availability of highways within the expanded metropolitan area of São Paulo. As for social aspects, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be both positively correlated with population density, and negatively correlated with social isolation rate, hence indicating that social distancing has been effective in reducing the COVID-19 transmission. Finally, COVID-19 infection rate was found to be inversely correlated with both temperature and UV radiation. Together with recent literature our study suggests that the UV radiation provided by sunlight might contribute to depletion of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity.","Nakada, Liane Yuri Kondo; Urban, Rodrigo Custodio",,310,2

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the preparedness and capacity of palliative care services in the Middle-East and North Africa region to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was undertaken, with items addressing the WHO International Health Regulations. Non-probabilistic sampling was used, and descriptive analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Responses from 43 services in 12 countries were analysed. Half of respondents were doctors (53%), and services were predominantly hospital-based (84%). All but one services had modified at least one procedure to respond to COVID-19. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) policies were modified by a third (30%) and unavailable for a fifth (23%). While handwashing facilities at points of entry were available (98%), a third had concerns over accessing disinfectant products (37%), soap (35%), or running water (33%). The majority had capacity to use technology to provide remote care (86%) and contact lists of patients and staff (93%), though only two-fifths had relatives' details (37%). Respondents reported high staff anxiety about becoming infected themselves (median score 8 on 1-10 scale), but only half of services had a stress management procedure (53%). Three-fifths had plans to support triaging COVID-19 patients (60%) and protocols to share (58%). CONCLUSION: Participating services have prepared to respond to COVID-19, but their capacity to respond may be limited by lack of staff support and resources.

We examine the role of age structure in deaths thus far in Italy and South Korea and illustrate how the pandemic could unfold in populations with similar population sizes but different age structures, showing a dramatically higher burden of mortality in countries with older versus younger populations. This powerful interaction of demography and current age-specific mortality for COVID-19 suggests that social distancing and other policies to slow transmission should consider the age composition of local and national contexts as well as intergenerational interactions.

Migrants are overrepresented in COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases, hospital admissions, intensive care treatment and death statistics in all countries with available data. A syndemic approach has been suggested to understand the excess burden in vulnerable populations. However, this has not stopped the unequal burden of disease in Norway. Initially, the disease was mainly imported by Norwegians returning from skiing holidays in the Alps, and the prevalence of infection among migrants in Norway, defined as people born abroad to foreign parents, was low. Later, confirmed cases in migrants increased and have remained stable at 35-50% - more than twice the proportion of the migrant population (15%). To change this pattern, we need to understand the complex mechanisms underlying inequities in health and their relative and multiplying impacts on disease inequalities and to test the effect of counterfactual policies in order to reduce inequalities in disease burden. Yet, the current paradigm in the field of migration and health research, that is, the theories, research methods and explanatory models commonly applied, fail to fully understand the differences in health outcomes between international migrants and the host population. Here, we use the Norwegian situation as a case to explain the need for an innovative, system-level, interdisciplinary approach at a global level.","Diaz, Esperanza; Mamelund, Svenn-Eirik; Eid, Jarle; Aasen, Henriette Sinding; Martin Kaarbøe, Oddvar; Brokstad, Rebecca Jane Cox; Gloppen, Siri; Beyer, Anders; Kumar, Bernadette Nirmal",Scand J Public Health,310,18

A comparison of the average PM2.5 of a month before and after the lockdown (Wuhan) and self-reflection (Daegu and Tokyo) clearly shows that the PM2.5 concentration was decreased by 29.9, 20.9, and 3.6% in Wuhan, Daegu and Tokyo, respectively. Wuhan, Daegu and Tokyo also recorded 53.2, 19.0, and 10.4% falls of NO2 concentration, respectively.

It is well known that host genetic factors account for the individual differences in the susceptibility to infectious diseases. The genetic susceptibility factors to COVID-19 and its severity are associated with several unanswered questions. However, the experience gained from an earlier strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-1, which shows 78% genetic similarity to SARS-CoV-2 and uses the same receptor to bind to host cells, could provide some clues. It, therefore, seems possible to assemble new evidence in order to solve a potential genetic predisposition puzzle for COVID-19. In this chapter, the puzzle pieces, including virus entry receptors, immune response, and inflammation-related genes, as well as the probable genetic predisposition models to COVID-19, are discussed.","Darbeheshti, Farzaneh; Abolhassani, Hassan; Bashashati, Mohammad; Ghavami, Saeid; Shahkarami, Sepideh; Zoghi, Samaneh; Gupta, Sudhir; Orange, Jordan S; Ochs, Hans D; Rezaei, Nima",Adv Exp Med Biol,310,20

Common risk factors include older age, chronic illness, obesity, and non-Caucasian race. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with risk for respiratory infections and failure, susceptibility and response to therapy for enveloped virus infection, and immune-mediated inflammatory reaction. Objective: To test the hypothesis that 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] deficiency is a risk factor for severity of COVID-19 respiratory and inflammatory complications. Design: We examined the relationship between prehospitalization 25(OH)D levels (obtained 1-365 days prior to admission) and COVID-19 clinical outcomes in 700 COVID-19 positive hospitalized patients. Primary Outcomes: Discharge status, mortality, length of stay, intubation status, renal replacement. Secondary Outcomes: Inflammatory markers. Results: 25(OH)D levels were available in 93 patients [25(OH)D:25(IQR:17-33)ng/mL]. Compared to those without 25(OH)D levels, those with measurements did not differ in age, BMI or distribution of sex and race, but were more likely to have comorbidities. Those with 25(OH)D < 20 ng/mL (n = 35) did not differ from those with 25(OH)D &#8805; 20 ng/mL in terms of age, sex, race, BMI, or comorbidities. Low 25(OH)D tended to be associated with younger age and lower frequency of preexisting pulmonary disease. There were no significant between-group differences in any outcome. Results were similar in those &#8805;50 years, in male/female-only cohorts, and when differing 25(OH)D thresholds were used (<15 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL). There was no relationship between 25(OH)D as a continuous variable and any outcome, even after controlling for age and pulmonary disease. Conclusions: These preliminary data do not support a relationship between prehospitalization vitamin D status and COVID-19 clinical outcomes.","Szeto, Betsy; Zucker, Jason E; LaSota, Elijah D; Rubin, Mishaela R; Walker, Marcella D; Yin, Michael T; Cohen, Adi",Endocr Res,310,16

Many different models have been proposed so far correlating different factors. Some of them are too localized to indicate a general trend of the pandemic while some others have established transient correlations only. Hence, in this study, taking Bangladesh as a case, a 4P model has been proposed based on four probabilities (4P) which have been found to be true for all affected countries. Efficiency scores have been estimated from survey analysis not only for governing authorities on managing the situation (P(G)) but also for the compliance of the citizens ((P(P)). Since immune responses to a specific pathogen can vary from person to person, the probability of a person getting infected ((P(I)) after being exposed has also been estimated. And the vital one is the probability of test positivity ((P(T)) which is a strong indicator of how effectively the infected people are diagnosed and isolated from the rest of the group that affects the rate of growth. All the four parameters have been fitted in a non-linear exponential model that partly updates itself periodically with everyday facts. Along with the model, all the four probabilistic parameters are engaged to train a recurrent neural network using long short-term memory neural network and the followed trial confirmed a ruling functionality of the 4Ps.","Hasan, Khandaker Tabin; Rahman, M Mostafizur; Ahmmed, Md Mortuza; Chowdhury, Anjir Ahmed; Islam, Mohammad Khairul",Cognit Comput,310,20

Whereas the initial detection of endemic human respiratory coronaviruses was problematic, detection of these and newly discovered human coronaviruses has been greatly facilitated with major advances in the laboratory. Nevertheless, technological factors can affect the accuracy and timeliness of virus detection. Many human coronaviruses can be variably found in stool samples. All human coronaviruses have been variably associated with symptoms of gastroenteritis. Coronaviruses can occasionally be cultured from enteric specimens, but most detection is accomplished with genetic amplification technologies. Excretion of viral RNA in stool can extend for a prolonged period. Culture-positive stool samples have been found to exceed a fourteen day period after onset of infection for some coronaviruses. Virus can also sometimes be cultured from patients' respiratory samples during the late incubation period. Relatively asymptomatic patients may excrete virus. Both viable and nonviable virus can be found in the immediate environment of the patient, the health care worker, and less often the public. These lessons from the past study of animal and human coronaviruses can be extended to presumptions for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Already, the early reports from the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic are confirming some concerns. These data have the cumulative potential to cause us to rethink some current and common public health and infection control strategies.","Cimolai, Nevio",J. med. virol,310,1

In this respect, it is crucial to determine the case-increase, case-fatality, and case-recovery rates to control COVID-19. In this study, the case-increase, case-fatality, and case-recovery rates of COVID-19 in 36 European countries were analyzed with the meta-analysis method using data released by the health organizations and WHO. The data were obtained from the website of health organizations of 36 European countries and the website of WHO until 11 May 2020. The analyses were carried out on 1 744 704 COVID-19-diagnosed cases in 36 European countries. The case-increase, case-fatality and case-recovery rates of COVID-19 were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), single-arm meta-analysis, cross-temporal meta-analysis, and meta-regression random-effects model. The standardized case-increase rate of COVID-19 is 5% (95% CI [0.040, 0.063]) and the average case-increase rate in European countries has started to decline by around 3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) weekly. The countries with the highest rate of case increase are Belgium, Sweden, Russia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although the case-fatality rate of COVID-19 patients was 4.5% as of May 11 (95% CI [0.037-0.055]), this rate is 6.3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) in standardized time (6th week). The case-recovery rates of patients are 46% (95% CI [0.376-0.547]). This study presents important results regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. Although the rate of increase in new COVID-19 cases has dropped, there is not much decline in the case-fatality rates and no increase in case-recovery rates. The case-fatality rate of COVID-19 in Europe was estimated to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% and a minimum of 4 weeks (as of 11 May) is expected to have the figure below 1% in a country with an average case-increase rate.

METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who underwent longitudinal chest CT between January 01 and February 18, 2020 were included. A total of 1316 radiomic features were extracted from the lung parenchyma window for each CT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Relief, Las Vegas Wrapper (LVW), L1-norm-Support Vector Machine (L1-norm-SVM), and recursive feature elimination (RFE) were applied to select the features that associated with rapid progression. Four machine learning classifiers were used for modeling, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), and Decision Tree (DT). Accordingly, 20 radiomic models were developed on the basis of 296 CT scans and validated in 74 CT scans. Model performance was determined by the receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A total of 107 patients (median age, 49.0 years, interquartile range, 35-54) were evaluated. The patients underwent a total of 370 chest CT scans with a median interval of 4 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). The combination methods of L1-norm SVM and SVM with 17 radiomic features yielded the highest performance in predicting the likelihood of rapid progression of pneumonia lesions on next CT scan, with an AUC of 0.857 (95% CI: 0.766-0.947), sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 70.7%. CONCLUSIONS: Our radiomic model based on longitudinal chest CT data could predict the rapid progression of pneumonia lesions, which may facilitate the CT follow-up intervals and reduce the radiation.

To date, biallelic missense variants in ZNF526 gene, encoding a Krüppel-type zinc-finger protein, have been reported in three families with non-syndromic intellectual disability. METHODS: Here, we describe five individuals from four unrelated families with an undiagnosed neurodevelopmental disorder in which we performed exome sequencing, on a combination of trio-based (4 subjects) or single probands (1 subject). RESULTS: We identified five patients from four unrelated families with homozygous ZNF526 variants by whole exome sequencing. Four had variants resulting in truncation of ZNF526; they were affected by severe prenatal and postnatal microcephaly (ranging from -4 SD to -8 SD), profound psychomotor delay, hypertonic-dystonic movements, epilepsy and simplified gyral pattern on MRI. All of them also displayed bilateral progressive cataracts. A fifth patient had a homozygous missense variant and a slightly less severe disorder, with postnatal microcephaly (-2 SD), progressive bilateral cataracts, severe intellectual disability and unremarkable brain MRI.Mutant znf526 zebrafish larvae had notable malformations of the eye and central nervous system, resembling findings seen in the human holoprosencephaly spectrum. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the role of ZNF526 biallelic variants in a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, primarily affecting brain and eyes, resulting in severe microcephaly, simplified gyral pattern, epileptic encephalopathy and bilateral cataracts.","Dentici, Maria Lisa; Alesi, Viola; Quinodoz, Mathieu; Robens, Barbara; Guerin, Andrea; Lebon, Sébastien; Poduri, Annapurna; Travaglini, Lorena; Graziola, Federica; Afenjar, Alexandra; Keren, Boris; Licursi, Valerio; Capuano, Alessandro; Dallapiccola, Bruno; Superti-Furga, Andrea; Novelli, Antonio",J. medical. genet,310,16

The disease, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, is primarily a respiratory condition that can affect numerous other bodily systems including the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. The disease ranges in severity from asymptomatic through to severe acute respiratory distress requiring intensive care treatment and mechanical ventilation, which can lead to respiratory failure and death. It has rapidly become evident that COVID-19 patients can develop features of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, which in many cases persist for as long as we have thus far been able to follow the patients. Many questions remain about how such fibrotic changes occur within the lung of COVID-19 patients, whether the changes will persist long term or are capable of resolving, and whether post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis has the potential to become progressive, as in other fibrotic lung diseases. This review brings together our existing knowledge on both COVID-19 and pulmonary fibrosis, with a particular focus on lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts, in order to discuss common pathways and processes that may be implicated as we try to answer these important questions in the months and years to come.","John, Alison E; Joseph, Chitra; Jenkins, Gisli; Tatler, Amanda L",Immunol. rev,310,1

Furthermore, it can be useful to find if there is a stage that marks the transition to adulthood. Finally, as the Romans are considerate to be great codifiers of laws, it seems important to study the Roman law to understand the legal conception of adolescence at this period. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A literature review has been done about studies published between 1962 and 2015. Those publications were found in some historical databases (as Persée, Cairns, J-Stor, OpenEdition) and in academic libraries. RESULTS: In the Greek cities, the adolescent, at 18 years old, has to do a military service called the ephebia. At the end of this formation, the young man, aged of 20 years old, comes back to his city. However, he has to continue his (intellectual) training until about his 30 years old. Generally, at this age, a man marries a young girl and becomes a respected adult. In the Roman law, there is no conception of legal age for the majority: the young people stay under the authority of the pater familias (father of the family) until the death of the father. If the father is dead: the boy becomes a pupil and has a specific juridical status until his 25 years. Two important stages exist for the young Romans: wearing the toga virilis (toga of manhood) and the wedding. CONCLUSIONS: There is an evolution in the perception of the adolescence during the Antiquity: for the Greeks, the adolescence ends at 20 years old with an important stage, the ephebia. In the Roman law, there is no legal age because everyone lives under the authority of the pater familias.","Jassogne, Gaëtan",Psychiatr Danub,310,16

Participants identified barriers at the individual (e.g., low education level, HIV, and financial stress), interpersonal (e.g., language barriers, low social support), organizational (e.g., lack of smoking cessation resources and targeted interventions), community (e.g., HIV and mental health stigma), and policy (e.g., paperwork for insurance) level. Participants identified facilitators at the individual (e.g., high participation in trials, good medication adherence), interpersonal (e.g., no smoking in social circles), organizational (e.g., bilingual staff, culturally competent care), community (e.g., providing transportation, the coronavirus disease 2019 as an opportunity for smoking cessation), and policy level (e.g., existence of funding, comprehensive insurance programs).

This qualitative study describes behavioral health provider perspectives on the use of telebehavioral health before and during the pandemic and how policy changes impacted access to and utilization of behavioral health services in Michigan. Materials and Methods: A convenience sample of 31 licensed and nonlicensed behavioral health providers operating in Michigan participated in semi-structured interviews between July and August 2020. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by using inductive methods. Results: The thematic analysis resulted in four overarching themes: (1) increased access to care; (2) maintenance of quality of care; (3) minimal privacy concerns; and (4) client and provider satisfaction. Discussion: During and post-pandemic, providers need flexibility to determine whether in-person or telebehavioral health services, including audio-only, best meet client needs. Providers identified several populations for which telebehavioral health was less accessible: clients with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, those with no broadband Internet access, children, and older adults. Additional training in telebehavioral health service provision can positively impact quality of care. Conclusion: Policies that support reimbursement parity and expand provider use of telebehavioral health services should be maintained after the COVID-19 pandemic ends to avoid imposing barriers to accessing behavioral health care barriers post-pandemic.","Schoebel, Victoria; Wayment, Caitlyn; Gaiser, Maria; Page, Cory; Buche, Jessica; Beck, Angela J",Telemed. j. e. health,310,1

Here, we characterize rMVAs expressing the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Modifications of full-length S individually or in combination included two proline substitutions, mutations of the furin recognition site, and deletion of the endoplasmic retrieval signal. Another rMVA in which the receptor binding domain (RBD) is flanked by the signal peptide and transmembrane domains of S was also constructed. Each modified S protein was displayed on the surface of rMVA-infected cells and was recognized by anti-RBD antibody and soluble hACE2 receptor. Intramuscular injection of mice with the rMVAs induced antibodies, which neutralized a pseudovirus in vitro and, upon passive transfer, protected hACE2 transgenic mice from lethal infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as S-specific CD3+CD8+IFNÎ³+ T cells. Antibody boosting occurred following a second rMVA or adjuvanted purified RBD protein. Immunity conferred by a single vaccination of hACE2 mice prevented morbidity and weight loss upon intranasal infection with SARS-CoV-2 3 wk or 7 wk later. One or two rMVA vaccinations also prevented detection of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and subgenomic viral mRNAs in the lungs and greatly reduced induction of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs. A low amount of virus was found in the nasal turbinates of only one of eight rMVA-vaccinated mice on day 2 and none later. Detection of low levels of subgenomic mRNAs in turbinates indicated that replication was aborted in immunized animals.","Liu, Ruikang; Americo, Jeffrey L; Cotter, Catherine A; Earl, Patricia L; Erez, Noam; Peng, Chen; Moss, Bernard",Proc.

Like other health workers, CHWs need support to contribute effectively to health programmes and promote health equity. Yet the evidence base of what kind of support works best is weak. We present evidence from three fragile settings-Sierra Leone, Liberia and Democratic Republic of Congo on managing CHWs, and synthesise recommendations for best approaches to support this critical cadre. METHODS: We used a qualitative study design to explore how CHWs are managed, the challenges they face and potential solutions. We conducted interviews with decision makers and managers (n = 37), life history interviews with CHWs (n = 15) and reviewed policy documents. RESULTS: Fragility disrupts education of community members so that they may not have the literacy levels required for the CHW role. This has implications for the selection, role, training and performance of CHWs. Policy preferences about selection need discussion at the community level, so that they reflect community realities. CHWs' scope of work is varied and may change over time, requiring ongoing training. The modular, local and mix of practical and classroom training approach worked well, helping to address gender and literacy challenges and developing a supportive cohort of CHWs. A package of supervision, community support, regular provision of supplies, performance rewards and regular remuneration is vital to retention and performance of CHWs. But there are challenges with supervision, scarcity of supplies, inadequate community recognition and unfulfilled promises about allowances. Clear communication about incentives with facility staff and communities is required as is their timely delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that has explored the management of CHWs in fragile settings. CHWs' interface role between communities and health systems is critical because of their embedded positionality and the trusting relationships they (often) have. Their challenges are aligned to those generally faced by CHWs but chronic fragility exacerbates them and requires innovative problem solving to ensure that countries and communities are not left behind in reforming the way that CHWs are supported.","Raven, Joanna; Wurie, Haja; Idriss, Ayesha; Bah, Abdulai Jawo; Baba, Amuda; Nallo, Gartee; Kollie, Karsor K; Dean, Laura; Steege, Rosie; Martineau, Tim; Theobald, Sally",Hum Resour Health,310,20

METHODS: Using Poisson regression and regularized linear regression (elastic net), we evaluated the association between neighborhood characteristics and COVID-19 mortality rates in Chicago through July 22 (2514 deaths across 795 populated census tracts). RESULTS: Black residents (31% of the population) accounted for 42% of COVID-19 deaths. Deaths among Hispanic/Latino residents occurred at a younger age (63 years, compared to 71 for white residents). Regarding residential setting, 52% of deaths among white residents occurred inside nursing homes, compared to 35% of deaths among Black residents and 17% among Hispanic/Latino residents. Higher COVID-19 mortality was seen in neighborhoods with heightened barriers to social distancing and low health insurance coverage. Neighborhoods with a higher percentage of white and Asian residents had lower COVID-19 mortality.

The causative agent has been recognized as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), primarily affecting the respiratory tract. To date, no vaccines are available nor any specific treatment. To limit the number of infections, strict directives have been issued by governments that have been translated into equally rigorous guidelines notably for post-mortem examinations by international and national scientific societies. The recommendations for biosafety control required during specimen collection and handling have strongly limited the practice of autopsies of the COVID-19 patients to a few adequate laboratories. A full pathological examination has always been considered an important tool to better understand the pathophysiology of diseases, especially when the knowledge of an emerging disorder is limited and the impact on the healthcare system is significant. The first evidence of diffuse alveolar damage in the context of an acute respiratory distress syndrome has now been joined by the latest findings that report a more complex scenario in COVID-19, including a vascular involvement and a wide spectrum of associated pathologies. Ancillary tools such as electron microscopy and molecular biology used on autoptic tissue samples from autopsy are also significantly contributing to confirm and/or identify new aspects useful for a deeper knowledge of the pathogenetic mechanisms. This article will review and summarize the pathological findings described in COVID-19 until now, chiefly focusing on the respiratory tract, highlighting the importance of autopsy towards a better knowledge of this disease.","Calabrese, Fiorella; Pezzuto, Federica; Fortarezza, Francesco; Hofman, Paul; Kern, Izidor; Panizo, Angel; von der Thüsen, Jan; Timofeev, Sergei; Gorkiewicz, Gregor; Lunardi, Francesca",Virchows Arch,310,20

Concerns of a similar trend during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to the formation of a workgroup* to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 deaths in the AI/AN population. As of December 2, 2020, CDC has reported 2,689 COVID-19-associated deaths among non-Hispanic AI/AN persons in the United States. A recent analysis found that the cumulative incidence of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases among AI/AN persons was 3.5 times that among White persons (3). Among 14 participating states, the age-adjusted AI/AN COVID-19 mortality rate (55.8 deaths per 100,000; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 52.5-59.3) was 1.8 (95% CI = 1.7-2.0) times that among White persons (30.3 deaths per 100,000; 95% CI = 29.9-30.7). Although COVID-19 mortality rates increased with age among both AI/AN and White persons, the disparity was largest among those aged 20-49 years. Among persons aged 20-29 years, 30-39 years, and 40-49 years, the COVID-19 mortality rates among AI/AN were 10.5, 11.6, and 8.2 times, respectively, those among White persons. Evidence that AI/AN communities might be at increased risk for COVID-19 illness and death demonstrates the importance of documenting and understanding the reasons for these disparities while developing collaborative approaches with federal, state, municipal, and tribal agencies to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on AI/AN communities. Together, public health partners can plan for medical countermeasures and prevention activities for AI/AN communities.","Arrazola, Jessica; Masiello, Matthew M; Joshi, Sujata; Dominguez, Adrian E; Poel, Amy; Wilkie, Crisandra M; Bressler, Jonathan M; McLaughlin, Joseph; Kraszewski, Jennifer; Komatsu, Kenneth K; Peterson Pompa, Xandy; Jespersen, Megan; Richardson, Gillian; Lehnertz, Nicholas; LeMaster, Pamela; Rust, Britney; Keyser Metobo, Alison; Doman, Brooke; Casey, David; Kumar, Jessica; Rowell, Alyssa L; Miller, Tracy K; Mannell, Mike; Naqvi, Ozair; Wendelboe, Aaron M; Leman, Richard; Clayton, Joshua L; Barbeau, Bree; Rice, Samantha K; Warren-Mears, Victoria; Echo-Hawk, Abigail; Apostolou, Andria; Landen, Michael",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,310,25

As the outbreak is ongoing, more and more researchers focused interest on the COVID-19. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the publications about COVID-19 to summarize the research hotspots and make a review, to provide reference for researchers in the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a search in PubMed using the keywords ""COVID-19"" from inception to March 1, 2020. Identified and analyzed the data included title, corresponding author, language, publication time, publication type, research focus. RESULTS: 183 publications published from 2020 January 14 to 2020 February 29 were included in the study. The first corresponding authors of the publications were from 20 different countries. Among them, 78 (42.6%) from the hospital, 64 (35%) from the university and 39 (21.3%) from the research institution. All the publications were published in 80 different journals. Journal of Medical Virology published most of them (n=25). 60 (32.8%) were original research, 29 (15.8%) were review, 20 (10.9%) were short communications. 68 (37.2%) epidemiology, 49 (26.8%) virology and 26 (14.2%) clinical features. CONCLUSIONS: According to our review, China has provided a large number of research data for various research fields, during the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the findings play an important role in preventing and controlling the epidemic around the world. With research on the COVID-19 still booming, new vaccine and effective medicine for COVID-19 will be expected to come out in the near future with the joint efforts of researchers worldwide.","Lou, J; Tian, S-J; Niu, S-M; Kang, X-Q; Lian, H-X; Zhang, L-X; Zhang, J-J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,310,5

Objective: To evaluate the association between receipt of unemployment insurance, including a $600/wk federal supplement between April and July, and food insecurity among people who lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used difference-in-differences analysis of longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of US adults residing in low- and middle-income households (ie, <$75â¯000 annual income) who lost work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were from 15 waves of the Understanding Coronavirus in America study (conducted April 1 to November 11, 2020). Exposure: Receipt of unemployment insurance benefits. Main Outcomes and Measures: Food insecurity and eating less due to financial constraints, assessed every 2 weeks by self-report. Results: Of 2319 adults living in households earning less than $75â¯000 annually and employed in February 2020, 1119 (48.3%) experienced unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic and made up our main sample (588 [53.6%] White individuals; mean [SD] age 45 [15] years; 732 [65.4%] women). Of those who lost employment, 415 (37.1%) reported food insecurity and 437 (39.1%) reported eating less due to financial constraints in 1 or more waves of the study. Among people who lost work, receipt of unemployment insurance was associated with a 4.3 (95% CI, 1.8-6.9) percentage point decrease in food insecurity (a 35.0% relative reduction) and a 5.7 (95% CI, 3.0-8.4) percentage point decrease in eating less due to financial constraints (a 47.8% relative reduction). Decreases in food insecurity were larger with the $600/wk supplement and for individuals who were receiving larger amounts of unemployment insurance. Conclusions and Relevance: In this US national cohort study, receiving unemployment insurance was associated with large reductions in food insecurity among people who lost employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The $600/wk federal supplement and larger amounts of unemployment insurance were associated with larger reductions in food insecurity.","Raifman, Julia; Bor, Jacob; Venkataramani, Atheendar",JAMA Netw Open,310,26

Here we present a temporal analysis of key immune mediators, cytokine and chemokines in blood of hospitalised COVID-19 patients from serial sampling and follow up over four weeks.Methods A total of 71 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to Beijing You'an hospital in China with either mild (53 patients) or severe disease (18 patients) were enrolled with 18 healthy volunteers. We measured 34 immune mediators, cytokines and chemokines in peripheral blood every 4-7 days over one month per patient using a bio-plex multiplex immunoassay.Results We found that the chemokine RANTES(CCL5) was significantly elevated, from an early stage of the infection, in patients with mild but not severe disease. We also found that early production of inhibitory mediators including IL-10 and IL-1RA were significantly associated with disease severity, and a combination of CCL5, IL-1Ra and IL-10 at week 1 may predict patient outcomes. The majority of cytokines that are known to be associated with the cytokine storm in virus infections such as IL-6 and IFN-gamma were only significantly elevated in the late stage of severe COVID-19 illness. TNF- alpha and GM-CSF showed no significant differences between severe and mild cases.Conclusion Together our data suggest early intervention to increase expression of CCL5 may prevent patients from developing severe illness. Our data also suggest that measurement of levels of CCL5, as well as IL-1Ra, IL-10 in blood individually and in combination might be useful prognostic bio-markers to guide treatment strategies.","Zhao, Yan; Qin, Ling; Zhang, Ping; Li, Kang; Liang, Lianchun; Sun, Jianping; Xu, Bin; Dai, Yanchao; Li, Xuemei; Zhang, Chi; Peng, Yanchun; Feng, Yingmei; Li, Ang; Hu, Zhongjie; Xiang, Haiping; Ogg, Graham; Ho, Ling-Pei; McMichael, Andrew J; Jin, Ronghua; Knight, Julian C; Dong, Tao; Zhang, Yonghong",JCI insight,310,1

Early prediction of progression to severe cases is needed. We retrospectively collected patients with COVID-19 in two hospital of Chongqing from 1st January to 29th February 2020. At admission, we collected the demographics and laboratory tests to predict whether the patient would progress to severe cases in hospitalization. Severe case was confirmed when one of the following criteria occurred: (a) dyspnea, respiratory rate &#8805;30 breaths/min, (b) blood oxygen saturation &#8804;93%, and (c) PaO2 /FiO2 &#8804; 300 mm Hg. At admission, 348 mild cases were enrolled in this study. Of them, 20 (5.7%) patients progressed to severe cases after median 4.0 days (interquartile range: 2.3-6.0). Pulmonary inflammation index, platelet counts, sodium, C-reactive protein, prealbumin, and PaCO2 showed good distinguishing power to predict progression to severe cases (each area under the curve of receiver operating characteristics [AUC] &#8805; 0.8). Age, heart rate, chlorine, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, procalcitonin, creatine kinase, pH, CD3 counts, and CD4 counts showed moderate distinguishing power (each AUC between 0.7-0.8). And potassium, creatinine, temperature, and D-dimer showed mild distinguishing power (each AUC between 0.6-0.7). In addition, higher C-reactive protein was associated with shorter time to progress to severe cases (r = -0.62). Several easily obtained variables at admission are associated with progression to severe cases during hospitalization. These variables provide a reference for the medical staffs when they manage the patients with COVID-19.","Duan, Jun; Wang, Xiaohui; Chi, Jing; Chen, Hong; Bai, Linfu; Hu, Qianfang; Han, Xiaoli; Hu, Wenhui; Zhu, Linxiao; Wang, Xue; Li, You; Zhou, Chenmei; Mou, Huaming; Yan, Xiaofeng; Guo, Shuliang",J. med. virol,310,16

METHODS: We created guidelines and a triage/management algorithm for patients presenting with facial trauma to decrease the risk of COVID-19 transmission. CONCLUSIONS: In this paper, we present a set of guidelines and a triage algorithm we have successfully implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 while managing facial trauma.

METHODS: We reviewed patients admitted from the community to University College Hospital (UCH) with COVID-19 as their primary diagnosis between 1st-31st December 2020. Re-attendance and readmission data were collected for patients who re-presented within 10 days following discharge. Data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: 196 patients were admitted from the community with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and discharged alive in December 2020. Corticosteroids were prescribed in hospital for a median of 5 days (IQR 3-8). 20 patients (10.2%) were readmitted within 10 days. 11/20 received corticosteroids in the first admission of which 10 had received 1-3 days of corticosteroids. Readmission rate in those receiving 1-3 days of corticosteroids was 25%. CONCLUSIONS: Most international guidelines have recommended providing up to 10 days of corticosteroids for severe COVID-19 but stopping on discharge. Our findings show shorter courses of corticosteroids during admission are associated with an increased risk of being readmitted and support continuing the course of corticosteroids after hospital discharge monitored in the virtual ward setting.","Chaudhry, Zain; Shawe-Taylor, Marianne; Rampling, Tommy; Cutfield, Tim; Bidwell, Gabriella; Chan, Xin Hui S; Last, Anna; Williams, Bryan; Logan, Sarah; Marks, Michael; Esmail, Hanif",J Infect,310,23

PCR London Valves goes virtual!,13.8274,4.4515305,2020,"Being opportunistic intracellular pathogens, viruses are dependent on the host for their replication. They hijack host cellular machinery for their replication and survival by targeting crucial cellular physiological pathways, including transcription, translation, immune pathways, and apoptosis. Immediately after translation, the host and viral proteins undergo a process called post-translational modification (PTM). PTMs of proteins involves the attachment of small proteins, carbohydrates/lipids, or chemical groups to the proteins and are crucial for the proteins' functioning. During viral infection, host proteins utilize PTMs to control the virus replication, using strategies like activating immune response pathways, inhibiting viral protein synthesis, and ultimately eliminating the virus from the host. PTM of viral proteins increases solubility, enhances antigenicity and virulence properties. However, RNA viruses are devoid of enzymes capable of introducing PTMs to their proteins. Hence, they utilize the host PTM machinery to promote their survival. Proteins from viruses belonging to the family: Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Retroviridae, and Coronaviridae such as chikungunya, dengue, zika, HIV, and coronavirus are a few that are well-known to be modified. This review discusses various host and virus-mediated PTMs that play a role in the outcome during the infection.","Kumar, Ramesh; Mehta, Divya; Mishra, Nimisha; Nayak, Debasis; Sunil, Sujatha",Int. j. mol. sci.

A systematic search was performed on July 2, 2020, and updated on December 1, 2020, to identify studies on KLD/MIS-C associated with COVID-19. The databases of Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Scholar were searched. The hospitalized children with a presentation of Kawasaki disease (KD), KLD, MIS-C, or inflammatory shock syndromes were included. A total number of 133 children in 45 studies were reviewed. A total of 74 (55.6%) cases had been admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Also, 49 (36.8%) patients had required respiratory support, of whom 31 (23.3%) cases had required mechanical ventilation/intubation, 18 (13.5%) cases had required other oxygen therapies. In total, 79 (59.4%) cases had been discharged from hospitals, 3 (2.2%) had been readmitted, 9 (6.7%) had been hospitalized at the time of the study, and 9 (6.7%) patients had expired due to the severe heart failure, shock, brain infarction. Similar outcomes had not been reported in other patients. Approximately two-thirds of the children with KLD associated with COVID-19 had been admitted to PICUs, around one-fourth of them had required mechanical ventilation/intubation, and even some of them had been required readmissions. Therefore, physicians are strongly recommended to monitor children that present with the characteristics of KD during the pandemic as they can be the dominant manifestations in children with COVID-19.","Keshavarz, Pedram; Yazdanpanah, Fereshteh; Azhdari, Sara; Kavandi, Hadiseh; Nikeghbal, Parisa; Bazyar, Amir; Rafiee, Faranak; Nejati, Seyed Faraz; Sadabad, Faranak Ebrahimian; Rezaei, Nima",J. med. virol,310,1

Tocilizumab, an inhibitor of IL-6, has been widely repurposed as a treatment of severely ill patients without robust evidence supporting its use. In this study, we aimed to systematically describe the effectiveness of treatment and prevention of the cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients with tocilizumab. In this multicentered retrospective and observational cohort study, 65 patients with COVID-19 receiving tocilizumab and 130 not receiving tocilizumab were propensity score matched at a ratio of 2:1 based on age, sex, and comorbidities from January 20, 2020 to March 18, 2020 in Wuhan, China. After adjusting for confounding, the detected risk for in-hospital death was lower in the tocilizumab group versus nontocilizumab group (hazard ratio = 0.47; 95% confidence interval = 0.25-0.90; p = 0.023). Moreover, use of tocilizumab was associated with a lower risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (odds ratio = 0.23; 95% confidence interval = 0.11-0.45; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, patients had heightened inflammation and more dysregulated immune cells before treatment, which might aggravate disease progression. After tocilizumab administration, abnormally elevated IL-6, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time decreased. Tocilizumab may be of value in prolonging survival in patients with severe COVID-19, which provided a novel strategy for COVID-19-induced cytokine release syndrome. Our findings could inform bedside decisions until data from randomized, controlled clinical trials become available.","Tian, Jianbo; Zhang, Ming; Jin, Meng; Zhang, Fengqin; Chu, Qian; Wang, Xiaoyang; Chen, Can; Yue, Huihui; Zhang, Li; Du, Ronghui; Zhao, Dong; Zeng, Zhaofu; Zhao, Yang; Liu, Kui; Wang, Mengmei; Hu, Ke; Miao, Xiaoping; Zhang, Huilan",,310,1

This includes older subjects, patients with chronic diseases, patients with immunosuppression treatment, and pregnant women. Pregnant women are receiving more attention not only because of their altered physiological and immunological function but also for the potential risk of viral vertical transmission to the fetus or infant. However, very limited data about the impact of maternal infection during pregnancy, such as the possibility of vertical transmission in utero, during birth, or via breastfeeding, is available. Moreover, the impact of infection on the newborn in the short and long term remains poorly understood. Therefore, it is vital to collect and analyze data from pregnant women infected with COVID-19 to understand the viral pathophysiology during pregnancy and its effects on the offspring.

As many grain exporting countries announced a ban on grain exports, food security issues in China have attracted a significant international attention. Based on the Suitability Distribution Model and Soybean-Cereal Constraint Model, we explored the relationship between soybean production potential and food security. We calculated that the soybean potential planting area in China is 164.3 million ha. If the outbreak prevents China from importing soybeans, soybean planting area will need to be increased by 6.9 times to satisfy the demands. In the meantime, cereal self-sufficiency rate will drop to 63.4%, which will greatly affect food security. Each additional unit of soybean production will reduce 3.9 units of cereal production, and 1% increase in the self-sufficiency rate of soybean will result in a 0.63% drop in the self-sufficiency rate of cereal. Without sacrificing the self-sufficiency rate of cereal, the self-sufficiency rate of soybean is limited to 42%. Consequently, China will still need to import more than 68% of the current import volume of soybean. Although in the short term, the outbreak will not affect food security in China, as soybean imports decrease, insufficient supply of soybeans will affect people's quality of life. To prevent the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, China should increase soybean stocks and strengthen international cooperation. In the long term, increasing the self-sufficiency rate is a fundamental solution to solving soybean import dependency.

For its safe application, the risks of camostat mesylate to induce pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with co-administered drugs should be known. We therefore tested in vitro the potential inhibition of important efflux (P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2)), and uptake transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1) by camostat mesylate and its active metabolite 4-(4-guanidinobenzoyloxy)phenylacetic acid (GBPA). Transporter inhibition was evaluated using fluorescent probe substrates in transporter over-expressing cell lines and compared to the respective parental cell lines. Moreover, possible mRNA induction of pharmacokinetically relevant genes regulated by the nuclear pregnane X receptor (PXR) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) was analysed in LS180 cells by quantitative real-time PCR. The results of our study for the first time demonstrated that camostat mesylate and GBPA do not relevantly inhibit P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Only OATP2B1 was profoundly inhibited by GBPA with an IC50 of 11 µM. Induction experiments in LS180 cells excluded induction of PXR-regulated genes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and ABCB1 and AhR-regulated genes such as CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 by camostat mesylate and GBPA. Together with the summary of product characteristics of camostat mesylate indicating no inhibition of CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 in vitro, our data suggest a low potential of camostat mesylate to act as a perpetrator in pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Only inhibition of OATP2B1 by GBPA warrants further investigation.","Weiss, Johanna; Bajraktari-Sylejmani, Gzona; Haefeli, Walter Emil",Chem Biol Interact,310,1

Higher stress and burnout in health professionals is linked with the delivery of poorer quality, less safe patient care across healthcare settings. In order to understand how we can better support healthcare professionals in the workplace, this study evaluated a tailored resilience coaching intervention comprising a workshop and one-to-one coaching session addressing the intrinsic challenges of healthcare work in health professionals and students. METHODS: The evaluation used an uncontrolled before-and-after design with four data-collection time points: baseline (T1); after the workshop (T2); after the coaching session (T3) and four-to-six weeks post-baseline (T4). Quantitative outcome measures were Confidence in Coping with Adverse Events ('Confidence'), a Knowledge assessment ('Knowledge') and Resilience. At T4, qualitative interviews were also conducted with a subset of participants exploring participant experiences and perceptions of the intervention. RESULTS: We recruited 66 participants, retaining 62 (93.9%) at T2, 47 (71.2%) at T3, and 33 (50%) at T4. Compared with baseline, Confidence was significantly higher post-intervention: T2 (unadj. ß = 2.43, 95% CI 2.08-2.79, d = 1.55, p < .001), T3 (unadj. ß = 2.81, 95% CI 2.42-3.21, d = 1.71, p < .001) and T4 (unadj. ß = 2.75, 95% CI 2.31-3.19, d = 1.52, p < .001). Knowledge increased significantly post-intervention (T2 unadj. ß = 1.14, 95% CI 0.82-1.46, d = 0.86, p < .001). Compared with baseline, resilience was also higher post-intervention (T3 unadj. ß = 2.77, 95% CI 1.82-3.73, d = 0.90, p < .001 and T4 unadj. ß = 2.54, 95% CI 1.45-3.62, d = 0.65, p < .001). The qualitative findings identified four themes. The first addressed the 'tension between mandatory and voluntary delivery', suggesting that resilience is a mandatory skillset but it may not be effective to make the training a mandatory requirement. The second, the 'importance of experience and reference points for learning', suggested the intervention was more appropriate for qualified staff than students. The third suggested participants valued the 'peer learning and engagement' they gained in the interactive group workshop. The fourth, 'opportunities to tailor learning', suggested the coaching session was an opportunity to personalise the workshop material. CONCLUSIONS: We found preliminary evidence that the intervention was well received and effective, but further research using a randomised controlled design will be necessary to confirm this.","Johnson, Judith; Simms-Ellis, Ruth; Janes, Gillian; Mills, Thomas; Budworth, Luke; Atkinson, Lauren; Harrison, Reema",BMC Health Serv Res,310,16

However, because uncertainty is an aversive state, uncertainty reduction theory (URT) holds that employees try to manage it by obtaining information. To date, most evidence for the effectiveness of obtaining information to reduce uncertainty stems from research conducted in relatively stable contexts wherein employees can acquire consistent information. Yet, research on crises and news consumption provides reasons to believe that the potential for information to mitigate uncertainty as specified by URT may break down during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating URT with research on crises and news consumption, we predict that consuming news information during crises-which tends to be distressing, constantly evolving, and inconsistent-will be positively related to uncertainty. This in turn may have negative implications for employee goal progress and creativity; two work outcomes that take on substantial significance in times of uncertainty and the pandemic. We further predict that death anxiety will moderate this relationship, such that the link between employees' news consumption and uncertainty is stronger for those with lower levels of death anxiety, compared to those with higher levels. We test our theorizing via an experience-sampling study with 180 full-time employees, with results providing support for our conceptual model. Our study reveals important theoretical and practical implications regarding information consumption during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aim: Whilst universities in the developing world such as South Africa were expected to face challenges during the pandemic, this article showed that the leadership executives and general staff in two of its large universities, instead, crafted equitable and flexible improvisations to overcome the social challenges that could have posed a threat to their academic project. Setting: The selection of these two specific universities provided a unique opportunity to engage with comprehensive, massified and post-merger former Technikon-university institutions that mainly cater for working-class students. Methods: The social justice theory was utilised to frame the study, whilst critical narrative analysis was the methodology. Results: This research reveals that South African comprehensive universities possess capacity to adapt and innovate in the middle of an institutional crisis using their flexible systems and agile personnel to drive the academy under such circumstances. The study also reveals that the process of social justice is full of contradictions. As the universities created equitable measures to assist underprivileged students, these measures also generated injustices for others.

From a pathophysiological perspective, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by an overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha) that leads to systemic inflammation and consequent increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) caused by atheromatous plaque rupture and significant myocardial oxygen supply-demand imbalance. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system through the ACE2 receptor induces myocarditis that may rapidly progress to left ventricular dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. Myocardial inflammation with pericardial involvement, i.e. , myopericarditis, can progress to cardiac tamponade and obstructive shock. These cardiovascular complications, which are associated with a worse prognosis and higher mortality, can be associated with clinical manifestations, electrocardiographic changes, and troponin values similar to AMI. Thus, the diagnosis and treatment of patients with acute chest pain and dyspnea admitted to the emergency department is a significant challenge during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we provide a review of the literature focusing on a practical approach to acute coronary syndrome patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.","Azevedo, Rafael Bellotti; Botelho, Bruna Gopp; Hollanda, João Victor Gonçalves de; Ferreira, Leonardo Villa Leão; Andrade, Letícia Zarur Junqueira de; Oei, Stephanie Si Min Lilienwald; Mello, Tomás de Souza; Muxfeldt, Elizabeth Silaid",Int. j. cardiovasc. sci.

Aged population with cardiovascular diseases are more likely be to infected with SARS-CoV-2 and result in more severe outcomes and elevated case-fatality rate. Meanwhile, cardiovascular diseases have a high prevalence in the middle-aged and elderly population. However, despite of several researches in COVID-19, cardiovascular implications related to it still remains largely unclear. Therefore, a specific analysis in regard to cardiovascular implications of COVID-19 patients is in great need. METHODS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, 116 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled, who admitted to the General Hospital of Central Theater Command (Wuhan, China) from January 20 to March 8, 2020. The demographic data, underlying comorbidities, clinical symptoms and signs, laboratory findings, chest computed tomography, treatment measures, and outcome data were collected from electronic medical records. Data were compared between non-severe and severe cases. RESULTS: Of 116 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the median age was 58.5 years (IQR, 47.0-69.0), and 36 (31.0%) were female. Hypertension (45 [38.8%]), diabetes (19 [16.4%]), and coronary heart disease (17 [14.7%]) were the most common coexisting conditions. Common symptoms included fever [99 (85.3%)], dry cough (61 [52.6%]), fatigue (60 [51.7%]), dyspnea (52 [44.8%]), anorexia (50 [43.1%]), and chest discomfort (50 [43.1%]). Local and/or bilateral patchy shadowing were the typical radiological findings on chest computed tomography. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count, 1.0 × 109/L [IQR, 0.7-1.3]) was observed in 66 patients (56.9%), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (245.5 U/L [IQR, 194.3-319.8]) in 69 patients (59.5%). Hypokalemia occurred in 24 (20.7%) patients. Compared with non-severe cases, severe cases were older (64.0 years [IQR, 53.0-76.0] vs 56.0 years [IQR, 37.0-64.0]), more likely to have comorbidities (35 [63.6%] vs 24 [39.3%]), and more likely to develop acute cardiac injury (19 [34.5%] vs 4 [6.6%]), acute heart failure (18 [32.7%] vs 3 [4.9%]), and ARDS (20 [36.4%] vs 0 [0%]). During hospitalization, the prevalence of new onset hypertension was significantly higher in severe patients (55.2% vs 19.0%) than in non-severe ones. CONCLUSIONS: In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we found that the infection of SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to occur in middle and aged population with cardiovascular comorbidities.

METHODS: Quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of a simple mental well-being and emotional regulation training, the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), using a convenience sample of FLW. Baseline scores of mental well-being and stress measures were compared with follow-up scores at 3 time points. Outcomes were psychological wellness (World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index); resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-10); traumatic stress (Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale); physical symptoms (Somatic Symptom Scale-8). RESULTS: Of the 104 participants who enrolled and attended the CRM training, 73 (70.2%) completed at least 1 posttest. Well-being scores increased at 1 year with a small-moderate effect size (Cohen d=0.32). Resilience scores increased with a small-moderate effect size by 1 year (Cohen d=0.36).

We investigated the distribution of each type of variant using the cumulative distribution function and tested for associations between variant types and phenotypes. The distribution of missense variants in patients was clearly different from that of healthy individuals and was uniform throughout the extracellular cadherin (EC) domain, which consisted of six highly conserved domains. Truncating variants showed two types of distributions: (1) located from EC domain 1 to EC domain 4, and (2) located from EC domain 5 to the cytoplasmic domain. Furthermore, we also found that later onset seizures and milder intellectual disability occurred in patients with truncating variants located from EC domain 5 to the cytoplasmic domain compared with those of patients with other variants.

Existing methods adopt a two-stage approach: synthesize the input text using a generic text-to-speech (TTS) engine and then transform the voice to the desired voice using voice conversion (VC). A major problem of this framework is that VC is a challenging problem which usually needs a moderate amount of parallel training data to work satisfactorily. In this paper, we propose a one-stage context-aware framework to generate natural and coherent target speech without any training data of the target speaker. In particular, we manage to perform accurate zero-shot duration prediction for the inserted text. The predicted duration is used to regulate both text embedding and speech embedding. Then, based on the aligned cross-modality input, we directly generate the mel-spectrogram of the edited speech with a transformer-based decoder. Subjective listening tests show that despite the lack of training data for the speaker, our method has achieved satisfactory results. It outperforms a recent zero-shot TTS engine by a large margin.","Tang, Chuanxin; Luo, Chong; Zhao, Zhiyuan; Yin, Dacheng; Zhao, Yucheng; Zeng, Wenjun",,310,16

METHODS: Four hundred and eleven consecutive patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: 214 cases in 2014-2016 with disinfection using povidone-iodine antiseptic solution alone (group A) and 197 cases in 2017-2019 with additional intrauterine douche using HClO (group B). HClO was used at a concentration of 200 ppm of residual chlorine. One gram of Ceftriaxone Sodium Hydrate was administered by drip infusion during MEA in both groups. Oral antibiotics were administered after MEA only in group A but not in group B. RESULTS: Mean patient age (mean ± SD; years old) was 44.5 ± 4.6 in group A and 44.8 ± 5.4 in group B, and mean operation time (min) was 30.4 ± 19.1 in group A and 34.4 ± 22.6 in group B, respectively. Neither were significantly different between groups. The combined ablation techniques i.e. transcervical microwave myolysis and transcervical microwave adenomyolysis did not increase frequency of infection. Postoperative intrauterine infection cases in group B (8 cases) were significantly lower than those in group A (28 cases) (Chi-square test, P = 0.001). Hysterectomy was performed in three severe intrauterine infection cases in group A, but no cases of severe intrauterine infection was found in group B. No adverse effect of HClO was seen. CONCLUSION: Intrauterine douche using HClO decreases postoperative intrauterine infection after MEA.","Tsuda, Akira; Kanaoka, Yasushi",J. obstet. gynaecol. res,310,16

In an EIT system, the measured signal has a large dynamic range from µV to mV, which requires high-RES (analog to digital conversion) cards. The logarithmic amplifier reduces the dynamic range by expanding lower values and compressing higher values, thereby improving the sensitivity and at the same time preventing the signal from saturation. In addition, a low-RES analog to digital conversion (ADC) cards can be used, making the system cost effective. This work evaluates the performance of a logarithmic amplifier and a linear amplifier used for signal conditioning in a low-cost EIT system. APPROACH: Two EIT systems based on a linear amplifier and logarithmic amplifier were designed. Phantom experiments were carried out with very small amounts of current injection. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), image quality, minimum detectable size and minimum detectable conductivity change were obtained. MAIN RESULTS: The logarithmic amplifier-based EIT system increased the average SNR by 4 dB. It also showed improvement in the RES and contrast-to-noise ratio of the images. The minimum size detectable by the logarithmic amplifier-based system was of radius 0.25 cm in a tank of radius 11 cm and the minimum change in conductivity detectable was 11%. SIGNIFICANCE: Logarithmic amplifier-based signal conditioning is a promising technique for improving the spatial RES of a low-cost EIT system that has a low-RES ADC.","Saxena, M; Gharpure, D C; Wagh, V G",Physiol Meas,310,0

Patients who went through the acute phase of disease noticed the need for rehabilitation follow-up, at that time was impossible to perform presently. The objective of this study was to verify whether a pulmonary rehabilitation program through videoconference could improve patients' exercise capacity after the acute phase of COVID-19. METHOD: We prospectively evaluated 196 subjects during the post-acute phase of COVID-19, without requiring ICU admission and they were divided into two groups. The Control Group (CG) with 92 subjects receiving no non-drug intervention for six weeks, and the Intervention Group (IG) with 104 subjects that performed a low-intensity Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program (PRP) during 6 weeks, held at home, with a weekly session by videoconference. As all the protocol was performed trough videoconference, the exercise capacity was assessed through 30 seconds sit-to-stand test (STS), the fatigue sensation after the exercise using 10-points Borg Scale, and the Physical Activity in Daily Life (PADL) assessed using a cell phone application that measures moves you in steps/day. RESULTS: The IG after the six weeks of PRP, achieved a significant increase in the STS and PADL, and an important decrease in the sensation of fatigue after exercise (p &lt;0.05). The control group does not present a significant improvement in AFVD and STS and does not show improvement in the fatigue sensation. CONCLUSION: Our findings reinforce the importance of evaluating and offering a low-intensity program for patients after the acute phase of COVID-19, that in this population presented improvement in exercise capacity, AFVD, and feeling of fatigue after 6 weeks, compared to subjects who did not perform a PRP and they did not achieve this improvement after that time.","De Souza, Y.; MacEdo, J.; Nascimento, R.; Alves, M.

Using a unique panel dataset of property-level water usage in Henderson, Nevada, we analyze changes in water usage from the SAH order, finding an initial and continuous decline in average daily usage for commercial and school users. In contrast, we find an initial increase in consumption by residential users with this effect increasing over time.

METHODS: From 14 February to 29 March 2020, an online survey was performed in both 605 health care workers and 1151 non-health care workers. Based on the somatization dimension score of the Symptom Checklist-90, participants were divided into non-SOM group and SOM group. RESULTS: Health care workers had higher prevalence rate of SOM (p < 0.001) than non-health care workers, with an OR of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.22-2.36, p = 0.002). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in non-health care workers, the risk factors of SOM included other ethnicities, insomnia, and suicide, while in health care workers, the risk factors included working 6-8 h per day, and working &#8805;10 h per day during COVID-19 outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: Our research suggests that both non-health care workers and health care workers have a relatively high prevalence of somatization. However, the related factors for somatization in both groups are significantly different, showing that medical service-related factors are associated with somatization in health care workers, while demographic and clinical factors are associated with somatization in non-health care workers.","Song, Xiuli; Zhou, Yongjie; Rao, Wenwang; Zhang, Xiangyang",BMC Psychiatry,310,29

Methods and results The patient was 87 years old male and presented coma symptoms on Feb. 3, 2020. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple small flake fuzzy shadows in both lungs. The nucleic acid test of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was positive on Feb.5 and the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed. After symptomatic and supportive treatment, the patient's condition became stable gradually, and the tracheal intubation was removed on Feb. 22. However, the patient was intubated again on Feb. 24 because of loss of coughing and sputum expelling abilities, and the patient's condition was judged to be critical. On Feb. 29, the patient received HBOT for the first time, and medical staff entered the hyperbaric oxygen cabin through the special channel. After HBOT for four times, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2) and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) of the patient tended to be stable, carbon dioxide retention was alleviated, liver and kidney function improved, and coagulation function recovered. On Mar. 6, SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) test showed that SARS-CoV-2 IgM was negative and SARS-CoV-2 IgG was positive. The patient was then transferred to general wards. Conclusion HBOT can alleviate CO2 retention in critical COVID-19 patients, and has a positive effect on reducing hypoxia and protecting important organs. The HBOT infection control procedure is feasible, and the safety of medical staff can be guaranteed by reasonable design.","Xiao-Ling, Zhong; Rui-Yong, Chen; Xiang-Qun, Niu; Xiao-Lan, Tao; Yi, Liang; Yan-Chao, Tang",Acad.

The purpose of this study was to examine the trajectories of frailty, physical function and physical activity levels due to interruption and resumption of outpatient cardiac rehabilitation by COVID-19 in elderly heart failure patients. Fifteen patients who did not attend outpatient cardiac rehabilitation during the state of emergency but resumed it after the state of emergency were included. Frailty, physical function and physical activity levels were assessed with the Kihon checklist (KCL), various tests including short physical performance battery (SPPB), and life space assessment (LSA), respectively. Objective parameters were measured at three points; before and after the nationwide state of emergency in Japan and 3 months after resuming outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The post-state of emergency KCL score was significantly higher than the pre-state of emergency score (P = 0.03), whereas there was no significant difference in KCL between post-state of emergency and 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation resumption. SPPB and LSA scores did not change significantly between pre- and post-state of emergency. The changes in LSA from post-state of emergency to 3 months after cardiac rehabilitation resumption tended to correlate with changes in KCL (r = -0.71, P = 0.11).

To examine the effect of age on death, we established a SARS-CoV-2 infection model in Chinese rhesus macaques ( Macaca mulatta) of varied ages. Results indicated that infected young macaques manifested impaired respiratory function, active viral replication, severe lung damage, and infiltration of CD11b + and CD8 + cells in lungs at one-week post infection (wpi), but also recovered rapidly at 2 wpi. In contrast, aged macaques demonstrated delayed immune responses with a more severe cytokine storm, increased infiltration of CD11b + cells, and persistent infiltration of CD8 + cells in the lungs at 2 wpi. In addition, peripheral blood T cells from aged macaques showed greater inflammation and chemotaxis, but weaker antiviral functions than that in cells from young macaques. Thus, the delayed but more severe cytokine storm and higher immune cell infiltration may explain the poorer prognosis of older aged patients suffering SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Song, Tian-Zhang; Zheng, Hong-Yi; Han, Jian-Bao; Jin, Lin; Yang, Xiang; Liu, Feng-Liang; Luo, Rong-Hua; Tian, Ren-Rong; Cai, Hou-Rong; Feng, Xiao-Li; Liu, Chao; Li, Ming-Hua; Zheng, Yong-Tang",Zool Res,310,15

Medical staffs (n = 317) from three designated hospitals in Guangdong Province and one designated hospital in Guangxi Province were surveyed on their demographic information, sleep quality and time change of leisure activity, risk perception of pandemic and PTSD symptoms (by using PTSD checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5)). Hierarchical regression and structural equation model (SEM) were used to examine the correlated factors of PTSD. The prevalence of high level of PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 > =33, a probable diagnosis of PTSD) was 10.7%. Regression analysis found that risk perception (dread: ß = 0.142, p < 0.01; familiarity: ß = 0.203, p < 0.01), sleep quality (ß = 0.250, p < 0.001), time change of leisure activity (ß = -0.179, p < 0.01), were independently correlated with PTSD severity, which was further confirmed by SEM. Locations of COVID-19-related hazards were significant different in cognitive map of risk perception between groups with high and low levels of PTSD symptoms. Risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic influenced PTSD symptoms in HCWs. Adequate time for leisure activity and good sleep quality protected some HCWs against PTSD symptoms under the influence of pandemic. More researches were warranted to understand the path from pre-factors of risk perception to its psychological consequences among HCWs.","Geng, Shiyu; Zhou, Yaoguang; Zhang, Wenyong; Lou, Anni; Cai, Yuhan; Xie, Jieying; Sun, Jing; Zhou, Wangmei; Liu, Weizhi; Li, Xu",,310,30

problems facing visual effects within the film and television industry today This discussion is organized around four sub-Topics: 1) labor solutions and what unionization would mean, 2) perceptions of VFX artists and their contributions within the industry by filmmakers and artists themselves, as well as the audience, 3) issues of inclusivity along gender and racial lines, and their effects on work/life balances, and 4) VFX as equal creative partners rather than isolated, temporary, highly-skilled specialists This panel is a continuation of work begun by the faculty and practitioner organizers, Heath Hanlin (Syracuse University, VPA) and Shaina Holmes (Syracuse University, Newhouse) on studying structural challenges and obstacles to entry for students hoping to enter the VFX industry, in particular women, and artists of color An earlier iteration of this discussion was held at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival The hope is that the technical focus and high attendance by industry practitioners at Siggraph, adds practitioner perspectives and educator feedback to the sub-Topics listed above Simply put, today's film and television industry rely heavily on visual effects, both to advance the story or as a means to hide imperfections to keep the audience engaged without technical distractions Traditional conceptions of VFX artistry as a production step that comes after primary cinematography is simply outdated Unfortunately, the economic and work-flow structure of the industry accepts this new reality while at the same time attempting to compensate, credit, and organize VFX artists within the outdated framework Often this aspect of the conversation is moored in debates surrounding the potentiality of AI to either positively impact the industry (no more underpaid routinized tasks for artists) or negatively (crafts persons and artists can be replaced by algorithms) Rather, a more fruitful discussion around this point should be centered on labor issues and globalization (sub-Topic #1) of VFX within the industry to reflect the VFX Artist's increased importance in most contemporary productions This new economic bargaining power cannot be established if we first don't engage with, educate, and change the discourse surrounding how other creatives in the industry view VFX artists (sub-Topic #2) and their critical roles This panel discusses the stereotype of today's VFX workers as ""easily trainable, easily replaceable, ĝ€button-pushers', who can be substituted with intuitive AI""and how we can shift the narrative artisans and craft persons working on the level of a writer, director, or editor, using their talents to equally construct the narrative vision of the piece The film and television industry relies so heavily on VFX artists for their visions, that similar to the video game industry, long hours are required from those artists who toil away behind a monitor and keyboard At the same time, similar to the film and television industry as a whole, it is overly represented by majority white male workers who also disproportionately are not responsible for childcare and its accompanying social and emotional labor As such, VFX professionals, who are women, find themselves working within an unregulated part of the industry working over 100 hours per week on a project to project basis, not knowing what city, let alone country, their next job will be in, and if they will have time to dedicate to supporting, or even starting, a family (see sub-Topic #3) This panel discussion hopes to expand these voices and their perception on solutions to inclusivity within the industry Issues of equality are revealed in a broader sense when we realize VFX artists need to be recognized more as equal creative partners (see sub-Topic #2) due to their increased reliance upon and importance in the contemporary digital workflow of content creation and visual storytelling More than merely surveying other creators' perceptions of VFX artists' contributions, there eeds to be new contractual precedents and workflow procedures established in order to accomplish structural changes For example, VFX artists need to be at the beginning of production choices, not merely as pre-visualization workers, but as co-creators and organized division heads who can ready their departments for the production troubleshooting invariably ahead VFX need not be an afterthought-not secondary ""fixers""who through a combination of creativity and technical know-how, solve problems quickly with little to no additional compensation Rather, they need to be co-leaders beginning right from pre-production until post as co-creatives This discussion amongst the panelists is expected to explore the topics above, but also expand and evolve into new conversations and connections to the artist, technology, industry, globalization, COVID-19 impact, and education spaces Towards the end of the dialogue, we will invite the

It is produced in substantial amounts as co-product from poultry processing plants and pig slaughterhouses. Keratin is packed by disulfide bonds and hydrogen bonds. Based on the secondary structure, keratin can be classified into &#945;-keratin and ß-keratin. Keratinases (EC 3.4.-.- peptide hydrolases) have major potential to degrade keratin for sustainable recycling of the protein and amino acids. Currently, the known keratinolytic enzymes belong to at least 14 different protease families: S1, S8, S9, S10, S16, M3, M4, M14, M16, M28, M32, M36, M38, M55 (MEROPS database). The various keratinolytic enzymes act via endo-attack (proteases in families S1, S8, S16, M4, M16, M36), exo-attack (proteases in families S9, S10, M14, M28, M38, M55) or by action only on oligopeptides (proteases in families M3, M32), respectively. Other enzymes, particularly disulfide reductases, also play a key role in keratin degradation as they catalyze the breakage of disulfide bonds for better keratinase catalysis. This review aims to contribute an overview of keratin biomass as an enzyme substrate and a systematic analysis of currently sequenced keratinolytic enzymes and their classification and reaction mechanisms.

The synthetic analogue poly I:C is frequently used to mimic anti-viral innate immune responses in models of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including schizophrenia, autism, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Many studies perform limited analysis of innate immunity despite these responses potentially differing as a function of dsRNA molecular weight and age. Therefore fundamental questions relevant to impacts of systemic viral infection on brain function and integrity remain. Here, we studied innate immune-inducing properties of poly I:C preparations of different lengths and responses in adult and aged mice. High molecular weight (HMW) poly I:C (1-6 kb, 12 mg/kg) produced more robust sickness behavior and more robust IL-6, IFN-I and TNF-&#945; responses than poly I:C of < 500 bases (low MW) preparations. This was partly overcome with higher doses of LMW (up to 80 mg/kg), but neither circulating IFNß nor brain transcription of Irf7 were significantly induced by LMW poly I:C, despite brain Ifnb transcription, suggesting that brain IFN-dependent gene expression is predominantly triggered by circulating IFNß binding of IFNAR1. In aged animals, poly I:C induced exaggerated IL-6, IL-1ß and IFN-I in the plasma and similar exaggerated brain cytokine responses. This was associated with acute working memory deficits selectively in aged mice. Thus, we demonstrate dsRNA length-, IFNAR1- and age-dependent effects on anti-viral inflammation and cognitive function. The data have implications for CNS symptoms of acute systemic viral infection such as those with SARS-CoV-2 and for models of maternal immune activation.","McGarry, Niamh; Murray, Carol L; Garvey, Sean; Wilkinson, Abigail; Tortorelli, Lucas; Ryan, Lucy; Hayden, Lorna; Healy, Daire; Griffin, Eadaoin W; Hennessy, Edel; Arumugam, Malathy; Skelly, Donal T; Mitchell, Kevin J; Cunningham, Colm",Brain Behav Immun,310,16

Public health interventions such as vaccination programs typically focus on individual viral species. However, observational data suggest that the spread of one species may impact the dynamics of another. This finding would have important implications for the predicted impact of seasonal vaccines but currently lacks statistical support. The aim of this paper is to develop a statistical framework to identify non-independent viral dynamics. As Bayesian multivariate disease mapping models naturally encompass a between-disease covariance matrix, we extended this framework to model multivariate time series data accounting for within- and between-year dependencies. By inferring non-zero off-diagonal entries of the between-disease covariance matrix, we present a novel technique that successfully identifies significant viral interactions. We illustrate this framework using incidence data from five co-circulating respiratory viruses (adenovirus [AdV], coronavirus [Cov], human metapneumovirus [MPV], influenza B virus [IBV] and respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]) detected by routine diagnostics at the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Center (WoSSVC) between 2005 and 2013. We found a significant positive covariance between RSV \&MPV and a negative covariance between IBV \&AdV paving the way for future examination of biological or behavioural factors that may generate interactions between certain virus pairs.","Mair, Colette; Nickbakhsh, Sema; Reeve, Richard; McMenamin, Jim; Reynolds, Arlene; Gunson, Rory; Murcia, Pablo R; Matthews, Louise",,310,16

In this study, we describe the impact of COVID-19 on neurosurgical training in Southeast Asia. METHODS: We conducted an online survey among neurosurgery residents in Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand from May 22 to 31, 2020 using Google Forms. The 33-item questionnaire collected data on elective and emergency neurosurgical operations, ongoing learning activities, and health worker safety. RESULTS: A total of 298 of 470 neurosurgery residents completed the survey, equivalent to a 63% response rate. The decrease in elective neurosurgical operations in Indonesia and in the Philippines (median, 100% for both) was significantly greater compared with other countries (P < 0.001). For emergency operations, trainees in Indonesia and Malaysia had a significantly greater reduction in their caseload (median, 80% and 70%, respectively) compared with trainees in Singapore and Thailand (median, 20% and 50%, respectively; P < 0.001). Neurosurgery residents were most concerned about the decrease in their hands-on surgical experience, uncertainty in their career advancement, and occupational safety in the workplace. Most of the residents (n = 221, 74%) believed that the COVID-19 crisis will have a negative impact on their neurosurgical training overall. CONCLUSIONS: An effective national strategy to control COVID-19 is crucial to sustain neurosurgical training and to provide essential neurosurgical services. Training programs in Southeast Asia should consider developing online learning modules and setting up simulation laboratories to allow trainees to systematically acquire knowledge and develop practical skills during these challenging times.","Wittayanakorn, Nunthasiri; Nga, Vincent Diong Weng; Sobana, Mirna; Bahuri, Nor Faizal Ahmad; Baticulon, Ronnie E",World neurosurgery (Online),310,21

Besides T-lymphocytes and macrophages, mast cells also contribute to the development of cytokine storm and thus stimulate the activity of fibroblasts. Additionally, by the exocytotic release of fibroblast-activating factors, mast cells directly facilitate the progression of pulmonary fibrosis. In our previous basic studies, anti-allergic drugs (olopatadine, ketotifen), antibiotics (clarithromycin) and corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, dexamethasone) inhibited the process of exocytosis and showed their potency as highly effective mast cell stabilizers. Given such pharmacological properties of these commonly used drugs, they may be useful in the treatment of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis and in relieving the symptoms of post-COVID syndrome.","Kazama, Itsuro",Drug Discov Ther,310,31

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Using billing data from 8 acute care hospitals, we identified 9 principal medical diagnoses from International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes across 4 medical specialties (cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, and urology). In addition, we defined a combined obstetrical falsification end point. We compared daily admission rates during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-4/30/2020) with the same dates in 2019 (3/1/2019-4/30/2019). As a reference, we also compared a prepandemic period in the same years (1/1/2019-2/28/2019 and 1/1/2020-2/29/2020). We compared admission rates between years using t tests. RESULTS: There were 3219 admissions for the conditions of interest during the study period in 2019 and 2661 in 2020. There was no difference in prepandemic daily admission rates in 2020 compared with 2019 (29.04 vs 27.63 admissions per day; -4.9%; P = .50). During the pandemic period, there was a 33.7% decrease in admission rates for all conditions combined in 2020 compared with 2019 (24.68 vs 16.37; -33.7%; P = .03). By specialty, the combined gastroenterology (10.22 vs 7.20; -29.6%; P = .02) and cardiovascular (2.34 vs 1.29; -44.7%; P = .05) end points demonstrated reduction in daily admission rates.

Early data suggest elevated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, but relationships to disease phenotype and downstream regulators of inflammation in the Renin-Angiotensin system (RAS) are unknown. We aimed to determine the relationship between RAS gene expression relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the lung with disease characteristics in COPD, and the regulation of newly identified SARS-CoV-2 receptors and spike-cleaving proteases, important for SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We quantified gene expression using RNA sequencing of epithelial brushings and bronchial biopsies from 31 COPD and 37 control subjects. RESULTS: ACE2 gene expression (log2-fold change (FC)) was increased in COPD compared to ex-smoking (HV-ES) controls in epithelial brushings (0.25, p = 0.042) and bronchial biopsies (0.23, p = 0.050), and correlated with worse lung function (r = - 0.28, p = 0.0090). ACE2 was further increased in frequent exacerbators compared to infrequent exacerbators (0.51, p = 0.00045) and associated with use of ACE inhibitors (ACEi) (0.50, p = 0.0034), having cardiovascular disease (0.23, p = 0.048) or hypertension (0.34, p = 0.0089), and inhaled corticosteroid use in COPD subjects in bronchial biopsies (0.33, p = 0.049). Angiotensin II receptor type (AGTR)1 and 2 expression was decreased in COPD bronchial biopsies compared to HV-ES controls with log2FC of -0.26 (p = 0.033) and - 0.40, (p = 0.0010), respectively. However, the AGTR1:2 ratio was increased in COPD subjects compared with HV-ES controls, log2FC of 0.57 (p = 0.0051). Basigin, a newly identified potential SARS-CoV-2 receptor was also upregulated in both brushes, log2FC of 0.17 (p = 0.0040), and bronchial biopsies, (log2FC of 0.18 (p = 0.017), in COPD vs HV-ES. Transmembrane protease, serine (TMPRSS)2 was not differentially regulated between control and COPD. However, various other spike-cleaving proteases were, including TMPRSS4 and Cathepsin B, in both epithelial brushes (log2FC of 0.25 (p = 0.0012) and log2FC of 0.56 (p = 5.49E-06), respectively) and bronchial biopsies (log2FC of 0.49 (p = 0.00021) and log2FC of 0.246 (p = 0.028), respectively).

METHODS: We explore current literature and recommendations for tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and look back at previous data from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1), the virus responsible for the SARS outbreak of 2003. RESULTS: Given the severity and clinical uncertainty of patients with COVID-19 and the increased risk of transmission to clinicians, careful consideration should be taken prior to performing tracheostomy. If tracheostomy is performed, we recommend a bedside approach to limit exposure time and number of exposed personnel. Bronchoscopy use with a percutaneous approach should be limited in order to decrease viral exposure.

We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples (nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for 3 days from hospital admission, and once every 2 or 3 days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done. FINDINGS: The patients were three men (aged 31 years, 48 years, and 80 years) and two women (aged 30 years and 46 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, 2020. Three different clinical evolutions are described: (1) two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms, with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV-2 within the first 24 h of the illness onset (5·2 and 7·4 log10 copies per 1000 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; (2) a two-step disease progression in two young men, with a secondary worsening around 10 days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal samples; and (3) an 80-year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The 80-year-old patient died on day 14 of illness (Feb 14, 2020); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by Feb 19, 2020. INTERPRETATION: We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation of more efficient infection control strategies.

Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT) images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation, labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image super-resolution, and enhancement.","Deng, Yang; Wang, Ce; Hui, Yuan; Li, Qian; Li, Jun; Luo, Shiwei; Sun, Mengke; Quan, Quan; Yang, Shuxin; Hao, You; Liu, Pengbo; Xiao, Honghu; Zhao, Chunpeng; Wu, Xinbao; Zhou, S.

Furthermore, it has been considered as a major challenge, which threatens human beings and affects all aspects of their life. Understanding the cellular and molecular pathophysiology of the disease is currently under the focus of investigations. Accordingly, this turns the human scientific community attention to find a solution for addressing the challenge. The development of vaccines and efficient therapeutic modality is critical. So, both primary and clinical scientists are not only trying to decipher the structure of SARS-CoV-2, but also attempting to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that cause tissues and cell injuries. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 are highly homologous and share a highly similar function and behavior patterns. Therefore, this might guide us toward decoding the molecular mechanisms that are behind the SARS-CoV2 pathologic effects. It is noteworthy to mention that, the undesired host immune reactions play important roles in the pathophysiology of the disease, and it also seems that, renin-angiotensin signaling (RAS) is a key contributor in this regard. In this review, we provided a vision, highlight as well as discussing on potential therapeutic targets that might be considered to address the COVID-19 challenge.","Abbasi Pashaki, P; Habibi Roudkenar, M; Rahim, F; Ebrahimi, A",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,310,16

At present, there is still no standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment regimen for PMIS, while the etiology and pathogenesis still remain unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic review on PubMed and Embase from the time of inception to June 24th 2020 in order to find relevant cases. RESULTS: There are seven studies included, and 80% of patients suffered persistent fever and 90% appeared gastrointestinal symptoms. IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 was positive on 81% of patients, while 37% of the patients were nucleic acid positive. C-reactive protein, IL-6 and PCT were elevated and intravenous immunoglobulin was a routine treatment for PMIS. There were more than half of patients required inotropic supports and mechanical ventilation were applied to 33% of patients. The median length of hospital stay was 10.66 days and 74% had admitted to accept intensive care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study documented three common types of PMIS clinical presentation: persistent fever and gastrointestinal symptoms, shocked with heart dysfunction and Kawasaki disease-like syndrome. PMIS patients proved with a marked inflammatory state were possibly associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zou, Hua; Lu, Juan; Liu, Jingjing; Wong, Josiah Hiu-Yuen; Cheng, Si; Li, Qiuhong; Shen, Yan; Li, Chunli; Jia, Xiaojiong",Int J Infect Dis,310,26

Epitope mapping, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-electron microscopy revealed two distinct antigenic sites and showed two neutralizing nanobodies from different epitope classes bound simultaneously to the spike trimer. Nanobody-Fc fusions of the four most potent nanobodies blocked ACE2 engagement with RBD variants present in human populations and potently neutralized both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the N501Y D614G variant at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM. Prophylactic administration of either single nanobody-Fc or as mixtures reduced viral loads by up to 104-fold in mice infected with the N501Y D614G SARS-CoV-2 virus.

The impact of the pandemic on the English education system has been significant, especially for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND). While it was encouraging that the educational rights of children and young people with SEND were highlighted during the COVID-19 pandemic, Government decision-making appeared to be centered around the needs of pupils in mainstream schools. In this article, co-authored by an academic researcher and senior leaders from the Pan London Autism Schools Network (PLASN;a collective of special schools in London and the South East of England, catering for pupils on the autistic spectrum), we reflect on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on special schools in England. We document and discuss a range of challenges experienced by PLASN schools, including the educational inequalities that were exposed and perpetuated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the manner in which the needs and realities of special schools were overlooked by the Government. We also detail the creative and innovative solutions implemented by PLASN schools to overcome barriers that they encountered. These solutions centered on facilitating holistic approaches to support, ensuring clear and regular communication with families, providing effective support for home learning, and promoting collaborative ways of working;all of which align with good practice principles in autism education more generally, and are essential elements of practice to maintain post-pandemic. We additionally reflect on how the COVID-19 pandemic could be a catalyst for much-needed change to the SEND system: leading to better educational provision, and therefore better outcomes, for pupils with SEND. © Copyright © 2021 Crane, Adu, Arocas, Carli, Eccles, Harris, Jardine, Phillips, Piper, Santi, Sartin, Shepherd, Sternstein, Taylor and Wright.","Crane, L.; Adu, F.; Arocas, F.; Carli, R.; Eccles, S.; Harris, S.; Jardine, J.; Phillips, C.; Piper, S.; Santi, L.; Sartin, M.; Shepherd, C.; Sternstein, K.; Taylor, G.; Wright, A.",Frontiers in Education,310,16

However, due to the disruption of established delivery chains, standard assays for in vitro diagnostics of those cancers were temporarily not available, forcing us to implement alternative testing methods that enabled at least basic therapy decision making. For this reason, we evaluated rapid testing on the Biocartis Idylla&#8482; platform (Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium) for four important genes commonly mutated in lung and colorectal cancers, namely EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, and BRAF. Clinical specimens from which the mutation status has previously been determined using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), were retested to determine whether Idylla&#8482; can offer accurate results. To compare the results, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) are calculated for each of the mutation types and then combined to determine the values of the Idylla&#8482; system in total, while setting NGS as the gold-standard basis the assays were compared with. Idylla testing thereby displayed acceptable sensitivity and specificity and delivered reliable results for initial therapy decisions.","Haiduk, Tiffany; Brockmann, Michael; Tillmann, Ramona-Liza; Pieper, Monika; Lüsebrink, Jessica; Schildgen, Verena; Schildgen, Oliver",Exp Mol Pathol,310,21

COVID-19 is diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction testing which looks at cycle threshold (CT) values of two genes, N2 and E. This study examined CT values of COVID-positive patients at the VA hospital in Reno as well as other lab values and comorbidities to determine if any could aid clinicians in predicting the need for hospitalization and higher levels of care. Multiple variables, including N2 CT value, absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and ferritin were evaluated for potential associations with N2 CT value as well as required level of care (based on World Health Organization [WHO] ordinal score). The results suggest that patients with a N2 CT value less than 34 are four times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .0021) while controlling for age and comorbidities (DM, cardiac, kidney, and lung disease). Patients of age 55 or greater were 15.18 times more likely to have WHO ordinal scores of 4-8 (p = .012) controlling for N2 CT value and comorbidities. Furthermore, patients with ALC less than 1 were 5.88 times more likely to have WHO ordinal score of 4-8 (p = .00024). N2 CT values also appear to be associated with many commonly obtained markers such as ALC, white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer. Patients with N2 CT values less than 34 were 3.49 times more likely to have ALC values less than 1, controlling for age and comorbidities (p = .0072) while patients 55 or older were 6.66 times more likely to have ALC less than 1 (p = .027). Finally, this study confirms previous conclusions that patients with advanced age had more severe infections and thus will likely require higher levels of care.","Seeni, Ramamahesh; Firzli, Tarek; Riddle, Mark S; Krasner, Charles; Ashraf, Sara; Siddiqui, Faisal",J. med. virol,310,1

In addition, new products such as cell-free exosomes and human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived MSCs are exciting developments to further prevalent use. Increasing numbers of trials have now published results in which safety of MSCT has been largely demonstrated. While reports of therapeutic endpoints are still emerging, efficacy can be seen for specific indications-including graft-vs-host-disease, strongly Th17-mediated autoimmune diseases, and osteoarthritis-which are more robustly supported by mechanistic preclinical evidence.

Within this spectrum, an involvement of the fetal-maternal unit could be expected, but, so far, the histopathological evaluation of placentas delivered by women with SARS-CoV-2 infection did not show distinct hallmarks. A consecutive series of 11 placentas, delivered by 10 women with COVID-19 admitted to our Obstetrics and Gynecology clinic have been investigated and compared to a control cohort of 58 pre-COVID-19 placentas and 28 placentas delivered by women who had a previous cesarean section. Four out of eleven placentas showed changes consistent with chronic villitis/villitis of unknown etiology (VUE), while in one case, chronic histiocytic intervillositis was diagnosed. Thrombo-hemorrhagic alterations were observed in a subset of cases. Compared to the control cohort, chronic villitis/VUE (p < 0.001), chronic deciduitis (p = 0.023), microvascular thrombosis (p = 0.003), presence of infarction areas (p = 0.047) and of accelerated villous maturation (p = 0.005) showed higher frequencies in placentas delivered by women with COVID-19. Chronic villitis/VUE (p = 0.003) and accelerated villous maturation (p = 0.019) remained statistically significant by restricting the analysis to placentas delivered after a previous cesarean section.

COVID-19 marks the emergence of the third large-scale epidemic related to the coronavirus, after SARS-CoV in 2002 and Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV) in 2012. The pandemic has had a harmful effect on the public mental health, especially on depression. Increasing systematic reviews (SRs) of coronavirus were focusing on depression. However, the methodological quality of these SRs is unclear. Therefore, to evaluate and compare the normativity of report of SR, we conducted a comprehensive overview of depression during the SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 pandemics. METHODS: Two independent reviewers will conduct comprehensively searches in PubMed, EMBASE.com, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Chinese biomedical literature database (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan fang Database, Chongqing VIP (CQVIP). Reference lists of articles, gray literature, and conference proceedings will also be searched. We will extract the data and assess the methodological quality using the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) measurement tool and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. General characteristics of the eligible SRs will be summarized and described. We will provide AMSTAR-2 and PRISMA assessments in tabular form for each review, the total percentage of each item will be calculated. Endnote X8 and EXCEL will be used. RESULTS: Using the draft search strategy of databases, 8 SRs met the a priori criteria and were included. The overview of SRs will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. CONCLUSION: Our overview will be a comprehensive synthesis of the existing systemic review on depression with SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Therefore, combination therapies may have the potential of alleviating the patient's outcome. This study aimed at comparing the efficacy of two different combination regimens in improving outcomes of patients infected by novel coronavirus (COVID-19). METHODS: This is a single centered, retrospective, observational study of 60 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) at two wards of the Baqiyatallah Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Patient's data including clinical and laboratory parameters were recorded. According to the drug regimen, the patients were divided into two groups; group I who received regimen I consisting azithromycin, prednisolone, naproxen, and lopinavir/ritonavir and group II who received regimen II including meropenem, levofloxacin, vancomycin, hydroxychloroquine, and oseltamivir. RESULTS: The oxygen saturation (SpO2) and temperature were positively changed in patients receiving regimen I compared to regimen II (P = 0.013 and P = 0.012, respectively). The serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) changed positively in group I (P < 0.001). Although there was a significant difference in platelets between both groups (75.44 vs 51.62, P < 0.001), their change did not clinically differ between two groups. The findings indicated a significant difference of the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) between two groups, where the patients under regimen I showed a shorter ALOS (6.97 vs 9.93, P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed the beneficial effect of the short-term use of low-dose prednisolone in combination with azithromycin, naproxen and lopinavir/ritonavir (regimen I), in decreasing ALOS compared to regimen II. Since there is still lack of evidence for safety of this regimen, further investigation in our ongoing follow-up to deal with COVID-19 pneumonia is underway.

In Korea, non-hospital facilities called ""living and treatment centers (LTCs)"" have been established since 5 March 2020. The LTCs provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the safety of selection criteria for low-risk groups. METHODS: Between 5 March and 9 April 2020, patients with COVID-19 who met the following criteria were admitted to the LTC; alert, age below 65 years old, no underlying disease or well-controlled underlying disease, body temperature below 38.0°C, whether taking antipyretics or not, and no dyspnea. Patients were closely observed by doctors or nurses' interviews twice a day and transferred to hospitals when symptoms worsened. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were admitted to the LTC; 52.2% were female, with a median age of 25 years (interquartile range, 21.5 to 39.5). Of 113 patients, 54 (47.8%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis, and 15 (13.3%) had no symptoms until they were released from isolation. During the follow-up period, two (1.8%) patients were transferred to a hospital but did not progress to severe status during hospitalization. CONCLUSION: The risk of progression was negligible in COVID-19 patients who met the admission criteria for LTC at the time of diagnosis. LTCs could be a safe alternative considering shortage of hospital beds.","Choe, Pyoeng Gyun; Kang, Eun Kyo; Lee, Sun Young; Oh, Boram; Im, Dahae; Lee, Hyo Yeon; Jung, Hyemin; Kang, Chang Kyung; Kim, Min Sun; Park, Wan Beom; Choi, Eun Hwa; Cho, BeLong; Oh, Myoung-Don; Kim, Nam Joong",Korean J Intern Med,310,1

This paper is aimed at providing a first insight on moped sharing demand by exploring the usage and opinions towards this new mobility alternative. To that end, the research exploits the data from a web-based survey conducted in Spain, one of the countries with the largest implementation around the world in terms of the shared e-mopeds fleet. Kruskal–Wallis tests were conducted to identify the segment of the urban population that is more likely adopted moped sharing, and additional statistical mean differences in specific variables concerning moped sharing were carried out. The paper also provides a better understanding of the shared mopeds market and some implications for urban mobility, such as the potential role of shared mopeds in reducing vehicle ownership and its effect on urban modal shift. Furthermore, two discrete choice models were developed to (i) analyze the key drivers determining the willingness to use moped sharing, and (ii) explore individuals’ opinions on whether owning a private vehicle will not be a need in the future. The results indicate that age, occupation, income, and environmental awareness seem to be among the main reasons behind the potential use of these services in the future. The results may be useful for both operators and transport planners when designing actions and policy efforts addressing this mobility option and urban mobility in general.","Aguilera-García, Álvaro Gomez Juan Sobrino Natalia Vinagre Díaz Juan José",Sustainability,310,3

The positivity resonance theory of co-experienced positive affect (Fredrickson, 2016) holds that shared pleasant states that include the key features of mutual care and a sense of oneness through behavioral synchrony function to build prosocial tendencies (e.g., self-transcendent and other-oriented dispositions of felt unity, empathy, altruism, and general positivity toward humanity). We tested the theory-driven hypothesis that prosocial tendencies are associated with high-quality social connections characterized by the affective state of positivity resonance and, in turn, account for behaviors to slow the spread of COVID-19. We measured perceived positivity resonance at the level of social episodes either during the COVID-19 pandemic (study 1, N = 1059, April-May 2020) or before it (study 2, N = 227, March-November 2019). In both studies, cross-sectionally and prospectively, results suggest that perceived positivity resonance had a positive indirect effect on self-reported hygienic behaviors (e.g., handwashing and mask wearing), which was mediated by a latent measure of prosocial tendencies. Sensitivity analyses confirmed these mediation effects to be independent of competing predictors of prosocial tendencies (e.g., overall positive and negative affect, frequency of social interaction) and competing predictors of health behaviors (e.g., political orientation, high-risk status, illness symptoms). Effects for social distancing were mixed. Overall, findings are consistent with the view that positivity resonance builds self-transcendent prosocial tendencies that motivate behaviors to protect community health.

The aim of the present investigation was to determine the impact of policies and several sociodemographic factors on the COVID-19 doubling time in Mexico. Methods. A retrospective longitudinal study was carried out across March-August, 2020. Policies issued by each of the 32 Mexican states during each week of this period were classified according to the University of Oxford Coronavirus Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), and the doubling time of COVID-19 cases was calculated. Additionally, variables such as population size and density, poverty and mobility were included. A panel data model was applied to measure the effect of these variables on doubling time. Results. States with larger population sizes issued a larger number of policies. Delay in the issuance of policies was associated with accelerated propagation. The policy index (coefficient 0.60, p < 0.01) and the income per capita (coefficient 3.36, p < 0.01) had a positive effect on doubling time; by contrast, the population density (coefficient -0.012, p < 0.05), the mobility in parks (coefficient -1.10, p < 0.01) and the residential mobility (coefficient -4.14, p < 0.01) had a negative effect. Conclusions. Health policies had an effect on slowing the pandemic's propagation, but population density and mobility played a fundamental role. Therefore, it is necessary to implement policies that consider these variables.","Díaz-Castro, Lina; Cabello-Rangel, Héctor; Hoffman, Kurt",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),310,25

In this study, we have developed novel, to our knowledge, flexible ELISA-based assays for specific detection of human SARS-CoV-2 Abs against the receptor-binding domain, including an Ag sandwich ELISA relevant for large population screening and three isotype-specific assays for in-depth diagnostics. Their performance was evaluated in a cohort of 350 convalescent participants with previous COVID-19 infection, ranging from asymptomatic to critical cases. We mapped the Ab responses to different areas on protein N and S and showed that the IgM, A, and G Ab responses against receptor-binding domain are significantly correlated to the disease severity. These assays and the data generated from them are highly relevant for diagnostics and prognostics and contribute to the understanding of long-term COVID-19 immunity.","Hansen, Cecilie Bo; Jarlhelt, Ida; Pérez-Alós, Laura; Hummelshøj Landsy, Lone; Loftager, Mette; Rosbjerg, Anne; Helgstrand, Charlotte; Bjelke, Jais Rose; Egebjerg, Thomas; Jardine, Joseph G; Sværke Jørgensen, Charlotte; Iversen, Kasper; Bayarri-Olmos, Rafael; Garred, Peter; Skjoedt, Mikkel-Ole",J. immunol,310,1

Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is adopted as biopsy tool for confirmation of virus infection. However, its accuracy is as low as 60-70%, which is inefficient to uncover the infected. In comparison, the chest CT has been considered as the prior choice in diagnosis and monitoring progress of COVID-19 infection. Although the COVID-19 diagnostic systems based on artificial intelligence have been developed for assisting doctors in diagnosis, the small sample size and the excessive time consumption limit their applications. To this end, this paper proposed a diagnosis prototype system for COVID-19 infection testing. The proposed deep learning model is trained and is tested on 2267 CT sequences from 1357 patients clinically confirmed with COVID-19 and 1235 CT sequences from non-infected people. The main highlights of the prototype system are: (1) no data augmentation is needed to accurately discriminate the COVID-19 from normal controls with the specificity of 0.92 and sensitivity of 0.93; (2) the raw DICOM image is not necessary in testing. Highly compressed image like Jpeg can be used to allow a quick diagnosis; and (3) it discriminates the virus infection within 6 seconds and thus allows an online test with light cost. We also applied our model on 48 asymptomatic patients diagnosed with COVID-19. We found that: (1) the positive rate of RT-PCR assay is 63.5% (687/1082). (2) 45.8% (22/48) of the RT-PCR assay is negative for asymptomatic patients, yet the accuracy of CT scans is 95.8%.

Unfortunately, to date, there is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells implicated in the pathogenesis of viral infections, where they mediate inflammation. Microbes, including virus, activate MCs through TLR releasing chemical pro-inflammatory compounds and cytokines. Although, in biomedical literature there are only few reports on MCs activation by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by MC viral activation leads to increase pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. Sodium Chromo-Glycate (SCG) described as a MC stabilizer, prevents the release of inflammatory chemical compounds, improve mouse survival and respiratory pathological changes in lung viral infection and suppresses inflammation. Furthermore, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) a nuclear factor agonist, an endogenous fatty acid amide, which exerts a variety of biological effects, related to chronic inflammation and pain, is involved also in MCs homeostasis with an inhibitory and protective effect on the respiratory tract during viral infections. Here, we hypothesize for the first time, that SCG and/or PEA suppress MC activation and pro-inflammatory mediators release, playing an anti-inflammatory therapeutic role in the inflamed lung of patients with COVID-19.","Gigante, Antonio; Aquili, Alberto; Farinelli, Luca; Caraffa, Alessandro; Ronconi, Gianpaolo; Enrica Gallenga, Carla; Tetè, Giulia; Kritas, Spyros K; Conti, Pio",Med Hypotheses,310,20

In May 2020, the European Academy of Neurology (EAN) held a VC, free of charge. In the absence of systematic studies on this topic, the aim of this study is to evaluate the attendance and perceived quality of the 2020 EAN VC compared to the 2019 EAN face-to-face congress (FFC). METHODS: An analysis of the demographic data of participants obtained from the online registration was done. A comparison of the two congresses based on a survey with questions on the perception of speakers' performance, quality of networking and other aspects was made. RESULTS: Of 43,596 registered participants, 20,694 active participants attended the VC. Compared to 2019, the number of participants tripled (6916 in 2019) and the cumulated number of participants attending the sessions was five times higher (169,334 in 2020 vs. 33,024 in 2019). Out of active participants 55% were from outside Europe, 42% were board-certified neurologists (FFC 80%) and 21% were students (FFC 0.6%). The content of the congress was evaluated as 'above expectation' by 56% of the attendees (FFC 41%). Of the respondents who had been exposed to earlier EAN congresses 73% preferred the FFC compared to the VC (17%). CONCLUSION: The VC fulfilled the main mission of organizing high quality EAN congresses despite the restrictions of the impersonal format. The geographical distribution of the participants proves the expected higher inclusivity of a VC. The large participation of students and neurologists in training opens new educational potentials for the EAN.","Stamelou, Maria; Struhal, Walter; Ten Cate, Olle; Matczak, Magdalena; Çaliskan, Süleyman Ayhan; Soffietti, Riccardo; Marson, Anthony; Zis, Panagiotis; di Lorenzo, Francesco; Sander, Anja; Deuschl, Günther; de Visser, Marianne; Bassetti, Claudio L A",Eur J Neurol,310,16

Since ICD 11 is planned to come into effect and be officially used as from January 1st, 2022, this early sneak peek allows health care professionals enough time to prepare for the new classification and all the changes it brings along. ICD 11 moves away from stigmatizing practices of psychiatrization of transgender persons and finally excludes issues of gender identity from the chapter on mental and behavioral disorders. This reconceptualization consequently sets the stage for different roles of psychiatrists in meeting transgender patients' health care needs. This article addresses the most important changes to the ICD related to Gender incongruence, a new nosological entity formerly known as Gender Identity Disorder or Gender Dysphoria. The paper offers an overview of the current and future positions of transgender health issues through contemporary medical conceptualization and classification. It aims to eliminate barriers to quality care for transgender patients, by attending to the recognized knowledge gaps and by providing recommendations for psychiatrists and other health care professionals who commonly receive low levels of exposure to transgender content in their education.","Dakic, Tea",Psychiatr Danub,310,16

Cases of infection due to the measles virus are rapidly increasing, yet current diagnostic tools used to monitor for the virus rely on slow (>1 h) technologies. Here, we demonstrate the first biosensor capable of detecting the measles virus in minutes with no preprocessing steps. The key sensing element is an electrode coated with a self-assembled monolayer containing the measles antibody, immobilized through an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC). The intact virus is detected by changes in resistance, giving a linear response to 10-100 µg/mL of the intact measles virus without the need to label or process the sample. The limit of detection is 6 µg/mL, which is at the lower limit of concentrations that can cause infections in primates. The NHC-based biosensors are shown to be superior to thiol-based systems, producing an approximately 10× larger response and significantly greater stability toward repeated measurements and long-term storage. This NHC-based biosensor thus represents an important development for both the rapid detection of the measles virus and as a platform technology for the detection of other biological targets of interest.","Mayall, Robert M; Smith, Christene A; Hyla, Alexander S; Lee, Dianne S; Crudden, Cathleen M; Birss, Viola I",ACS Sens,310,22

The incidence of new cases of COVID-19 has reduced dramatically since a peak in mid-March. Social distancing measures, public health action and the reduction in international travel have likely been effective in slowing the spread of the disease, in the Australian community. Testing rates over the past week have increased markedly, with a continued very low proportion of people testing positive. These low rates of detection are indicative of low levels of COVID-19 transmission. It is important that testing rates and community adherence to public health measures remain high to support the continued suppression of the virus, particularly in vulnerable high-risk groups and settings. New cases of COVID-19 are currently being reported by by only some jurisdictions, albeit at relatively low rates. Although case numbers are low, new cases tend to still be a mix of overseas-acquired and locally-acquired infections. Most locally-acquired cases can be linked back to a known case or cluster. Although the proportion of locally-acquired cases has increased, the overall rate of new cases, regardless of place of acquisition, continues to decrease. The crude case fatality rate in Australia remains low (1.4%), compared with the WHO reported global rate (6.9%). The low case fatality rate is likely reflective of high case detection and high quality of health care services in Australia. Deaths from COVID-19 in Australia have occurred predominantly among the elderly and those with comorbidities, with no deaths occurring in those under 40 years. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 60-79 years. One third of all cases in this age group have been associated with several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in young children, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, while the number of new cases each day remains relatively stable at the global level, some areas such as Brazil and India are showing a dramatic rise in reported cases. Although some low-income countries have so far reported few cases, it is possible that this is due to limited diagnostic and public health capacity, and may not be reflective of true disease incidence.",,,310,26

The 3'-terminal one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins, namely spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, interspersed with genes for accessory proteins that are largely nonstructural and called 'open reading frame' (ORF) proteins with alphanumerical designations, but not in a consistent or sequential order. Here, I report a comparative study of these ORF proteins, mainly encoded in two gene clusters, i.e. between the Spike and the Envelope genes, and between the Membrane and the Nucleocapsid genes. For brevity and focus, a greater emphasis was placed on the first cluster, collectively designated as the 'orf3 region' for ease of referral. Overall, an apparently diverse set of ORFs, such as ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF3c, ORF3d, ORF4 and ORF5, but not necessarily numbered in that order on all CoV genomes, were analyzed along with other ORFs. Unexpectedly, the gene order or naming of the ORFs were never fully conserved even within the members of one Genus. These studies also unraveled hitherto unrecognized orf genes in alternative translational frames, encoding potentially novel polypeptides as well as some that are highly similar to known ORFs. Finally, several options of an inclusive and systematic numbering are proposed not only for the orf3 region but also for the other orf genes in the viral genome in an effort to regularize the apparently confusing names and orders. Regardless of the ultimate acceptability of one system over the others, this treatise is hoped to initiate an informed discourse in this area.","Barik, Sailen",Infect Genet Evol,310,16

This report describes the demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of 544 U.S. persons under investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 with complete SARS-CoV-2 testing in the beginning stages of the pandemic from January 17 through February 29, 2020. METHODS: In this surveillance cohort, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided consultation to public health and healthcare professionals to identify PUI for SARS-CoV-2 testing by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR. Demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics of PUI were reported by public health and healthcare professionals during consultation with on-call CDC clinicians and subsequent submission of a CDC PUI Report Form. Characteristics of laboratory-negative and laboratory-positive persons were summarized as proportions for the period of January 17-February 29, and characteristics of all PUI were compared before and after February 12 using prevalence ratios. RESULTS: A total of 36 PUI tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and were classified as confirmed cases. Confirmed cases and PUI testing negative for SARS-CoV-2 had similar demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics. Consistent with changes in PUI evaluation criteria, 88% (13/15) of confirmed cases detected before February 12, 2020, reported travel from China. After February 12, 57% (12/21) of confirmed cases reported no known travel- or contact-related exposures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings can inform preparedness for future pandemics, including capacity for rapid expansion of novel diagnostic tests to accommodate broad surveillance strategies to assess community transmission, including potential contributions from asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections.","McGovern, Olivia L; Stenger, Mark; Oliver, Sara E; Anderson, Tara C; Isenhour, Cheryl; Mauldin, Matthew R; Williams, Nia; Griggs, Eric; Bogere, Tonny; Edens, Chris; Curns, Aaron T; Lively, Joana Y; Zhou, Yingtao; Xu, Songli; Diaz, Maureen H; Waller, Jessica L; Clarke, Kevin R; Evans, Mary E; Hesse, Elisabeth M; Morris, Sapna Bamrah; McClung, Robert P; Cooley, Laura A; Logan, Naeemah; Boyd, Andrew T; Taylor, Allan W; Bajema, Kristina L; Lindstrom, Stephen; Elkins, Christopher A; Jones, Christopher; Hall, Aron J; Graitcer, Samuel; Oster, Alexandra M; Fry, Alicia M; Fischer, Marc; Conklin, Laura; Gokhale, Runa H",PLoS One,310,24

Insight into the phylodynamics and mutation variants of this virus is vital to understanding the nature of its spread in different climate conditions. The incidence rate of COVID-19 is increasing at an alarming pace within subtropical South-East Asian nations with high temperatures and humidity. To understand this spread, we analysed 444 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 available on the GISAID platform from six South-East Asian countries. Multiple sequence alignments and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analyses were performed to analyse and characterize the non-synonymous (NS) mutant variants circulating in this region. Global mutation distribution analysis showed that the majority of the mutations found in this region are also prevalent in Europe and North America, and the concurrent presence of these mutations at a high frequency in other countries indicates possible transmission routes. Unique spike protein and non-structural protein mutations were observed circulating within confined area of a given country. We divided the circulating viral strains into four major groups and three subgroups on the basis of the most frequent NS mutations. Strains with a unique set of four co-evolving mutations were found to be circulating at a high frequency within India, specifically. Group 2 strains characterized by two co-evolving NS mutants which alter in RdRp (P323L) and spike (S) protein (D614G) were found to be common in Europe and North America. These European and North American variants have rapidly emerged as dominant strains within South-East Asia, increasing from a 0% prevalence in January to an 81% by May 2020. These variants may have an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral types and could present a large threat to South-East Asia for the coming winter.","Islam, Ovinu Kibria; Al-Emran, Hassan M; Hasan, Md Shazid; Anwar, Azraf; Jahid, Md Iqbal Kabir; Hossain, Md Anwar",,310,1

Children and young people are frequently being exposed to messages about the threat to health, including from the media and authorities. Whilst for most, their anxiety will be proportionate to the threat, for some, existing pre-occupation with physical symptoms and illness will become more problematic. There is a growing body of evidence that health anxiety may occur in childhood, however much of the literature is taken from research using adult samples. This practitioner review aims to give an overview of the assessment and treatment of health-related worries in children and young people in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This review is based on the limited existing evidence in this population and the more substantial evidence base for treating health anxiety in adults.

However, in general, PPIs display exposed binding pockets at the interface, and as such, have been largely unexploited for therapeutic interventions with low-molecular weight compounds. Here, we used docking and various rescoring strategies in an attempt to recover PPI inhibitors from a set of active and inactive molecules for 11 targets collected in ChEMBL and PubChem. Our focus is on the screening power of the various developed protocols and on using fast approaches so as to be able to apply such a strategy to the screening of ultralarge libraries in the future. First, we docked compounds into each target using the fast ""pscreen"" mode of the structure-based virtual screening (VS) package Surflex. Subsequently, the docking poses were postprocessed to derive a set of 3D topological descriptors: (i) shape similarity and (ii) interaction fingerprint similarity with a co-crystallized inhibitor, (iii) solvent-accessible surface area, and (iv) extent of deviation from the geometric center of a reference inhibitor. The derivatized descriptors, together with descriptor-scaled scoring functions, were utilized to investigate possible impacts on VS performance metrics. Moreover, four standalone scoring functions, RF-Score-VS (machine-learning), DLIGAND2 (knowledge-based), Vinardo (empirical), and X-SCORE (empirical), were employed to rescore the PPI compounds. Collectively, the results indicate that the topological scoring algorithms could be valuable both at a global level, with up to 79% increase in areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for some targets, and in early stages, with up to a 4-fold increase in enrichment factors at 1% of the screened collections. Outstandingly, DLIGAND2 emerged as the best scoring function on this data set, outperforming all rescoring techniques in terms of VS metrics. The described methodology could help in the rational design of small-molecule PPI inhibitors and has direct applications in many therapeutic areas, including cancer, CNS, and infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Singh, Natesh; Chaput, Ludovic; Villoutreix, Bruno O",J Chem Inf Model,310,11

This study assessed if circulating EPCs can predict long-term improvement of global left ventricular systolic function in patients with coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs) underwent successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: In this single-center, prospective, observational study, 115 consecutive patients with CTOs were evaluated by standard transthoracic echocardiography (ECHO) before and 9-12 months after PCI. Numbers of circulating putative EPCs were determined by flow cytometry analysis of mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood samples drawn before and 72 h after PCI. RESULTS: At mean 11.3 ± 2.5 months post vs. before PCI (all P < .05): by SAQ-7 summary scores, angina frequency, physical limitation and quality of life scores were greater; by ECHO, LVEDd decreased and LVEF increased, which were more significant in patients with Rentrop grades 2/3 vs. 0/1.

We prospectively recruited HCWs from a university hospital in Turkey. Serum samples from 1072 HCWs were obtained following 28 days of the first, and 21 days of the second dose. Detection and quantitation of SARS-CoV-2 antispike antibodies were performed by the chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (SARS-CoV-2 IgG II Quant; Abbott). Results greater than or equal to the cutoff value 50.0 AU/ml were reported as positive. After the first dose, antispike antibodies were detected in 834 of 1072 (77.8%) HCWs. Seropositivity was higher among females (84.6%) than males (70.6%) (p < 0.001) and was found to be highest in both women and men between the ages of 18-34. After the second dose, antibodies were detected in 1008 of 1012 (99.6%) HCWs. Antibody titers were significantly higher in those who had coronavirus disease-2019 before vaccination than those who did not (p < 0.001). Antibody positivity and median antibody titers were significantly less in HCWs with chronic diseases compared to those without (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicated that a relatively high frequency (99.6%) of humoral immunity was produced in HCWs aged 18-59 after two doses of CoronaVac. Quantitation of antibodies may help facilitate longitudinal monitoring of the antibody response, which will be especially useful in deciding the dose of the vaccine in vulnerable groups such as those over 60 years of age and those with chronic diseases.","Bayram, Aysen; Demirbakan, Hadiye; Günel Karadeniz, Pinar; Erdogan, Merve; Koçer, Ipek",J Med Virol,310,23

Cytokine storm refers to a set of clinical conditions caused by excessive immune reactions and has been recognized as a leading cause of severe COVID-19. While comparisons have been made between COVID-19 cytokine storm and other kinds of cytokine storm such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome, the pathogenesis of cytokine storm has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that impaired response of type-1 IFNs in early stage of COVID-19 infection played a major role in the development of cytokine storm, and various cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 were involved in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, many clinical evidences have indicated the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19. Several approaches are currently being used to treat the observed cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and expectations are especially high for new cytokine-targeted therapies, such as tocilizumab, anakinra, and baricitinib.

We aim to systematically explore the association of vitamin D serum levels with COVID-19 severity and prognosis. METHODS: The standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) were applied to estimate pooled results from six studies. The prognostic performance of vitamin D serum levels for predicting adverse outcomes with detection of the best cutoff threshold was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Decision tree analysis by combining vitamin D levels and clinical features was applied to predict severity in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Mean vitamin D serum level of 376 patients, was 21.9 nmol/L (95% CI = 15.36-28.45). Significant heterogeneity was found (I2 = 99.1%, p < .001). Patients with poor prognosis (N = 150) had significantly lower serum levels of vitamin D compared with those with good prognosis (N = 161), representing an adjusted standardized mean difference of -0.58 (95% Cl = -0.83 to -0.34, p < .001). CONCLUSION: Serum vitamin D levels could be implicated in the COVID-19 prognosis. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency could be a helpful adjunct in assessing patients' potential of developing severe COVID-19.

This study aimed to develop a model to estimate the mediating effects of risk perception and confidence on the association between perceived social support and active coping with the COVID-19 pandemic among people in Taiwan. The data of 1970 participants recruited from a Facebook advertisement were analyzed. Perceived social support, active coping with COVID-19, risk perception and confidence were evaluated using self-administered questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was used to verify the direct and indirect effects between variables. The mediation model demonstrated that lower perceived social support was significantly associated with a higher level of active coping with COVID-19, and this was mediated by a higher level of risk perception. The present study identified the importance of risk perception on the public's coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Li, Dian-Jeng; Ko, Nai-Ying; Chang, Yu-Ping; Yen, Cheng-Fang; Chen, Yi-Lung",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),310,16

DESIGN: Single-center, consecutive case series with historical controls. PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive patients seeking treatment for primary RRD in a 50-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 9-April 27, 2020) and the corresponding 50-day period during the previous year (March 4-April 22, 2019) in the United States. METHODS: The cohorts were compared to assess demographic variables and clinical presentations. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of presenting macular attachment status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with macula-on RRD at presentation. Secondary outcomes included visual acuity (VA), duration of symptoms before presentation, proportion seeking treatment within 1 day of symptom onset, and presence of primary proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were included in the 2020 cohort compared with 111 patients in the 2019 primary control cohort. Demographic factors were similar between the groups. Significantly fewer patients demonstrated macula-on RRD in the 2020 cohort (20/82 patients [24.4%]) than in the 2019 cohort (55/111 patients [49.5%]; P = 0.001). Patients in the 2020 cohort showed worse median VA at presentation (1.00 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/200] in 2020 vs. 0.48 logMAR [Snellen equivalent, 20/60] in 2019; P = 0.008), fewer patients sought treatment within 1 day of symptoms (16/80 patients [19.5%] in 2020 vs. 41/106 patients [36.9%] in 2019; P = 0.005), and a greater proportion demonstrated primary PVR (11/82 patients [13.4%] in 2020 vs. 5/111 patients [4.5%] in 2019; P = 0.03). In multivariate analysis, younger age (P = 0.03) and established patient status (P = 0.02) were independent predictors of macula-on status in the 2020 cohort.

Similar decline in pollutant concentration was observed in other megacities as well. Further, the study conducted an expert survey to identify the possible challenges India might face after lockdown is over.

Main protease (Mpro) of this virus is a highly attractive drug target among various other enzymes due to its ability to process poly-protein that is the translated product of the SARS-CoV2 RNA. The aim of the present study demonstrates molecular docking study of Glycyrrhiza glabra (Gg) active compounds such as Glycyrrhizic acid (GA), Liquiritigenin (L) and Glabridin (G) against the Mpro. Docking studies shows that these active compounds bind strongly with some of the amino acid residues in the active site of Mpro and inhibits the enzyme strongly. GA, L, and G are proposed to be strong inhibitors of the enzyme and the amino acids: His41, Gly143, Gln189, Glu 166, Cys 145, Thr25, Asn142, Met49, Cys44, Thr45 and pro168 present in the active site of Mpro were shown to make non-covalent interaction with these compounds. In silico ADMET properties prediction also shows that Gg active compounds had good solubility, absorption, permeation, non-toxic, and non- carcinogenic characteristics. Our finding concludes that all of the three active compounds of Gg could have the potential to be strong inhibitors for Mpro of SARS-CoV2 but glycyrrhizic acid have a high binding affinity of -8.0 Kcal/mol and glycyrrhizic acid have good ADMET properties than the other two.","Srivastava, Vivek; Yadav, Ankush; Sarkar, Paratpar",,310,1

An Amazon Mechanical Turk sample of 829 individuals was evaluated with a series of instruments assessing the severity of the OCRDs before and during the pandemic. Additional questionnaires about sociodemographic factors, personal and family histories of OCRD, COVID-19 related events, compulsivity and impulsivity traits, schizotypal symptoms, and the severity of depression, anxiety and stress levels, were also used. Participants reported that OCD, hoarding disorder (HD) and skin picking disorder (SPD) symptoms significantly worsened during the pandemic along with increased disability, more affective symptoms and reduced quality of life. Female gender, a higher number of COVID-19 related stressful events, and higher pre-COVID-19 fear of harm and symmetry symptoms predicted more severe OCD symptoms during the pandemic, whereas lack of a HD diagnosis by a mental health professional and more severe schizotypal symptoms predicted worsened hoarding symptoms. Greater compulsivity traits were associated with more severe COVID-19 pandemic obsessive-compulsive and hoarding symptoms. These data indicate that the immense distress resulting from the COVID-19 included significant deterioration of OCRDs' symptoms, particularly of OCD, HD and SPD. It was also possible to identify a pre-pandemic profile of people most at risk of pandemic-related deterioration in OCRDs' symptoms, which may prove valuable for preventative initiatives in relation to the likely future waves of COVID-19 or of other communicable diseases. Future studies should follow up these findings longitudinally.","Fontenelle, Leonardo F; Albertella, Lucy; Brierley, Mary-Ellen; Thompson, Emma M; Destrée, Louise; Chamberlain, Sam R; Yücel, Murat",J. psychiatr. res,310,24

Identification of individual-level susceptibility factors may help people in identifying and managing their emotional, psychological, and social well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study is focused on learning a ranked list of factors that could indicate a predisposition to a mental disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this study, we have used a survey of 17,764 adults in the United States from different age groups, genders, and socioeconomic statuses. Through initial statistical analysis and Bayesian network inference, we have identified key factors affecting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Integrating Bayesian networks with classical machine learning approaches led to effective modeling of the level of mental health prevalence. RESULTS: Overall, females were more stressed than males, and people in the age group 18-29 years were more vulnerable to anxiety than other age groups. Using the Bayesian network model, we found that people with a chronic mental illness were more prone to mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The new realities of working from home; homeschooling; and lack of communication with family, friends, and neighbors induces mental pressure. Financial assistance from social security helps in reducing mental stress during the COVID-19-generated economic crises. Finally, using supervised machine learning models, we predicted the most mentally vulnerable people with ~80% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors such as social isolation, digital communication, and working and schooling from home were identified as factors of mental illness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regular in-person communication with friends and family, a healthy social life, and social security were key factors, and taking care of people with a history of mental disease appears to be even more important during this time.","Jha, Indra Prakash; Awasthi, Raghav; Kumar, Ajit; Kumar, Vibhor; Sethi, Tavpritesh",JMIR Ment Health,310,32

The reviewed articles suggested the impact of the pandemic and lockdown measures on young persons for several mental symptoms as well as anxiety, stress, depression, event-specific distress, decrease in psychological wellbeing, and changes in sleep habits. Psychological symptoms were related to the experience of several stressors, such as risk for reduction of academic perspectives, massive e-learning adoption, economic issues, social restrictions, and implications for daily life related to the COVID-19 outbreak. This narrative review points out the negative psychological impact of the pandemic outbreak and the high vulnerability of the young in the development of psychological distress, highlighting the relevant focus on the mental health of young people during the pandemic and the need for structured and tailored psychological support and interventions focused to the improvement of Quality of Life of university students after the pandemic experience.","Cielo, Federica; Ulberg, Randi; Di Giacomo, Dina",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),310,16

We compared the RT-qPCR amplification profile of four different commercial transport medium kits, including DNA/RNA Shield, NAT, VTM, and Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) transport medium, for NPSs samples from Central Metropolitan Health Service, Santiago, Chile. The RT-qPCR showed a slight lower RNase P Cq value of the samples preserved and transported in DNA/RNA Shield compared to NAT medium. By contrast, a marked increase in the RNase P Cq value was registered in the samples transported with VTM compared to DNA/RNA Shield medium. For PBS-preserved NPS, the performance of two strategies were assessed due to the potential presence of any remaining active virus in the sample: (1) thermal inactivation; and (2) thermal inactivation treatment followed by RNA extraction. The heat inactivation showed a significantly lower Cq value for RNase P and viral ORF1ab Cq compared to the followed by RNA extraction.

METHODS: National online longitudinal survey. As part of a June 2020 survey, participants (n = 1370) were asked 'In your life, have you experienced any positive effects from the COVID-19 pandemic' (yes/no) and also completed the World Health Organisation-Five well-being index. Differences were explored by demographic variables. Free-text responses were thematically coded. RESULTS: Nine hundred sixty participants (70%) reported experiencing at least one positive effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. Living with others (P = .045) and employment situation (P < .001) at baseline (April) were associated with experiencing positive effects. Individuals working for pay from home were more likely to experience positive effects compared to those who were not working for pay (aOR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.63, P < .001) or who were working for pay outside the home (aOR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.58, P < .001). 54.2% of participants reported a sufficient level of well-being, 23.2% low well-being and a further 22.6% very low well-being. Of those experiencing positive effects, 945/960 (98%) provided an explanation. The three most common themes were 'Family time' (33%), 'Work flexibility' (29%) and 'Calmer life' (19%). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of participants reported positive effects resulting from changes to daily life due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of university students in Spain and to explore their attitudes toward the use of mobile mental care apps. METHOD: Respondents answered a survey, which comprised two sections. The first included the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) that was employed to assess the students' mental health. The second section included six questions developed by the authors to explore the students' attitudes toward mental care apps. RESULTS: The results showed that the students suffered from anxiety and depression as well as social dysfunction. Further, 91.3 % of the students had never used a mobile app for mental health, 36.3 % were unaware of such apps, and 79.2 % were willing to use them in the future.

Preparing for a phased reopening, a knowledge exchange coalition (representing government, academia, hospitals, oral health professions, and regulators) developed return-to-work (RTW) guidelines detailing the augmentation of standard practices to ensure safety for patients, oral health care providers (OHPs), and the community. Using online surveys, this study explored the influence of the RTW guidelines and related education on registered NS OHPs during a phased return to work. METHODS: Dissemination of R2W guidelines included website or email communiques and interdisciplinary education webinars that coincided with 2 RTW phases approved by the government. Aligned with each phase, all registered dentists, dental hygienists, and dental assistants were invited to complete an online survey to gauge the influence of the coalition-sponsored education and RTW guidelines, confidence, preparedness, and personal protective equipment use before and after the pandemic. RESULTS: Three coalition-sponsored multidisciplinary webinars hosted 3541 attendees prior to RTW. The response to survey 1 was 41% (881/2156) and to survey 2 was 26% (571/2177) of registrants. Survey 1 (82%) and survey 2 (89%) respondents ""agreed/strongly agreed"" that R2W guidelines were a primary source for guiding return to practice, and most were confident with education received and had the skills needed to effectively treat patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Confidence and preparedness improved in survey 2. Gowns/lab coat use for aerosol-generating procedures increased from 26% to 93%, and the use of full face shields rose from 6% to 93% during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: A multistakeholder coalition was effective in establishing and communicating comprehensive guidelines and web-based education to ensure unified reintegration of oral health services in NS during a pandemic. This multiorganizational cooperation lay the foundation for responses to subsequent waves of COVID-19 and may serve as an example for collaboratively responding to future public health threats in other settings. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The return-to-work strategy that was developed, disseminated, and assessed through this COVID-19 knowledge exchange coalition will benefit oral health practitioners, professional regulators, government policy makers, and researchers in future pandemic planning.","McNally, M; Rock, L; Gillis, M; Bryan, S; Boyd, C; Kraglund, F; Cleghorn, B",JDR Clin Trans Res,310,23

METHODS: The sample included counties in the United States with at least one SARS-CoV-2 case between April 1 and May 15, 2020. Outcomes were growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases, SARS-CoV-2-related deaths, and mobility reduction across three settings: retail/recreation, grocery/pharmacy, and workplace. The main explanatory variable was the social deprivation index (SDI), a composite socioeconomic disadvantage measure. RESULTS: Adjusted differences in outcomes between low-, medium-, and high-SDI counties (defined by tertile) were calculated using linear regression with state-fixed effects. Workplace mobility reduction was 1.75 (95% CI, -2.36 to -1.14; P<.001) and 3.48 percentage points (95% CI, -4.21 to -2.75; P<.001) lower for medium- and high-SDI counties relative to low-SDI counties, respectively. Mobility reductions in the other settings were also significantly lower for higher-SDI counties. In analyses adjusted for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence on April 1, medium- and high-SDI counties had 1.39 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.93; P<.001) and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.77 to 3.34; P<.001) more SARS-CoV-2 cases/1000 population on May 15 compared with low-SDI counties, respectively. Deaths per capita were also significantly higher for higher-SDI counties. CONCLUSION: Counties with higher social deprivation scores experienced greater growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths, but reduced mobility at lower rates. These findings are consistent with evidence demonstrating that economically disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Efforts to socially distance may be more burdensome for these communities, potentially exacerbating disparities in SARS-CoV-2-related outcomes.","Ossimetha, Ashley; Ossimetha, Angelina; Kosar, Cyrus M; Rahman, Momotazur",Mayo Clin Proc,310,0

While hygiene and wearing masks make up a large portion of the currently suggested precautions by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO), social distancing is another and arguably the most important precaution that would protect people since the airborne virus is easily transmitted through the air. Social distancing while walking outside, can be more effective, if pedestrians know locations of each other and even better if they know locations of people who are possible carriers. With this information, they can change their routes depending on the people walking nearby or they can stay away from areas that contain or have recently contained crowds. This paper presents a mobile device application that would be a very beneficial tool for social distancing during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The application works, synced close to real-time, in a networking fashion with all users obtaining their locations and drawing a virtual safety bubble around them. These safety bubbles are used with the constant velocity pedestrian model to predict possible future social distancing violations and warn the user with sound and vibration. Moreover, it takes into account the virus staying airborne for a certain time, hence, creating time-decaying non-safe areas in the past trajectories of the users. The mobile app generates collision free paths for navigating around the undesired locations for the pedestrian mode of transportation when used as part of a multi-modal trip planning app. Results are applicable to other modes of transportation also. Features and the methods used for implementation are discussed in the paper. The application is tested using previously collected real pedestrian walking data in a realistic environment.","Gelbal, Sukru Yaren; Cantas, Mustafa Ridvan; Aksun-Guvenc, Bilin; Guvenc, Levent",,310,16

By varying film thickness and blend composition, we show that ordered morphologies also result for contrary situations, resulting in the formation of a rich variety of hierarchically-ordered microstructures. This hierarchy suggests that non-equilibrium structures generated by incomplete phase separation of blend components are locked in by rapid solvent quenching during casting.","Andrew, Piers; Huck, Wilhelm T S",Soft Matter,310,21

Based on the development of the infection numbers, this period was divided into two phases of similar size: March to May and June to September. A total of 4898 infection cases were reported. Upon comparison of the phases, there were particularly marked differences in hospitalization and mortality, age, and countries of infection site. In the first phase, elderly persons were particularly affected by high rates of hospitalization and mortality. In the second phase, the average age and hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly lower, and a particularly large proportion were associated with international travel activity. The evaluation of the outbreak documentation revealed a particular focus in private household settings.

Health service and education in orthopedics are also affected although not at the frontline in dealing COVID-19. METHODS: The data from this study collected from several official databases, including the Indonesian Ministry of Health, Central Java provincial government, general hospital, and orthopedic surgery cases. RESULTS: Pandemic COVID-19 started in March 2020 in Indonesia. Surakarta has become one of the epicenters. Health services in the orthopedic department also experienced a decrease cases on all divisions (outpatient clinics, emergency rooms, and inpatients). Mann–Whitney non-parametric comparative test showed significance result in p value operation of orthopedic cases and inpatients (p = 0.016 and p = 0.016;p &lt; 0.05), meanwhile, outpatient visits did not show significance result with p = 0.0509 (p &gt; 0.05). The decrease in the number of cases being treated in the orthopedic service also has an impact on education and training programs. The digital era is one of the choices in the field of education. However, digital resources cannot substitute for direct patient exposure. CONCLUSION: The average number of orthopedic patients during the pandemic period from January to December 2020 decreased compared to visits in the same period in 2019 so that orthopedic services at tertiary and academic referral hospitals experienced a significant decrease in cases. The education and services department must adapt to the policy on educational activities for residents and medical students. The education department and hospital institutions restructured and reorganized resident doctors to continue providing services. The digital era is an option that supports the education process during a pandemic.","Nugroho, B. J.; Soetjahjo, B.; Nefihancoro, U. H.; Ermawan, R.; Saputra, R. D.; Putra, G.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been leveraged amid the COVID-19 pandemic, however, little is known about its use for supporting public health efforts. OBJECTIVE: The scoping review aimed to explore how AI technology is being used during the COVID-19 pandemic, as reported in the literature. Thus, it is first review that describes and summarizes features of the identified AI techniques and datasets used for their development and validation. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). We searched the most commonly used electronic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo) between April 10 and 12, 2020. These terms were selected based on the target intervention (i.e., AI) and the target disease (i.e., COVID-19). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction. A narrative approach was used to synthesize the extracted data. RESULTS: We considered 82 studies out of the 435 retrieved studies. The most common use of AI was diagnosing COVID-19 cases based on various indicators. AI was also employed in drug and vaccine discovery or repurposing, and assessing their safety. Further, the included studies used AI for forecasting the epidemic development of COVID-19 and predicting its potential hosts/reservoirs. Researchers utilized AI for patient outcome-related tasks such as assessing the severity of COVID-19, predicting mortality risk, its associated factors, and length of hospital stay. AI was used for Infodemiology to raise awareness to use water, sanitation, and hygiene. The most prominent AI techniques used were Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) followed by Support Vector Machine (SVM). CONCLUSIONS: The included studies showed that AI has the potential to fight against COVID-19. However, many of the proposed methods are not yet clinically accepted. Thus, the most rewarding research will be on methods promising value beyond COVID-19. More efforts are needed for developing standardized reporting protocols or guidelines for studies on AI.","Abd-Alrazaq, Alaa; Alajlani, Mohannad; Alhuwail, Dari; Schneider, Jens; Al-Kuwari, Saif; Shah, Zubair; Hamdi, Mounir; Househ, Mowafa",J. med. internet res,310,12

Since then the local public health offices have been responsible to monitor and react to the dynamics of the pandemic. One of their major tasks is to contain the spread of the virus after potential spreading events, for example when one or multiple participants have a positive test result after a group meeting (e.g. at school, at a sports event or at work). In this case, contacts of the infected person have to be traced and potentially are quarantined (at home) for a period of time. When all relevant contact persons obtain a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result, the quarantine may be stopped. However, tracing and testing of all contacts is time-consuming, costly and (thus) not always feasible. This motivates our work, in which we present a statistical model for the probability that no transmission of Sars-CoV-2 occurred given an arbitrary number of test results at potentially different timepoints. Hereby, the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity of the conducted PCR test are taken in account. We employ a parametric Bayesian model which can be adopted to different situations when specific prior knowledge is available. This is illustrated for group events in German school classes and applied to exemplary real-world data from this context. Our approach has the potential to support important quarantine decisions with the goal to achieve a better balance between necessary containment of the pandemic and preservation of social and economic life. The focus of future work should be on further refinement and evaluation of quarantine decisions based on our statistical model.","Jackle, Sonja; Roger, Elias; Dicken, Volker; Geisler, Benjamin; Schumacher, Jakob; Westphal, Max",,310,3

We use the recently developed susceptible-unidentified infected-confirmed (SUC) epidemic model. The unidentified infected population is defined as the infected people who are not yet identified and isolated and can spread the disease to susceptible individuals. It is important to quickly identify and isolate infected people among the unidentified infected population to prevent the infectious disease from spreading. Considering financial incentives as a strategy to control the spread of disease, we predict the effect of the strategy through a mathematical model. Although incentive costs are required, the duration of the disease can be shortened. First, we estimate the unidentified infected cases of COVID-19 in South Korea using the SUC model, and compute two parameters such as the disease transmission rate and the inverse of the average time for confirming infected individuals. We assume that when financial incentives are provided, there are changes in the proportion of confirmed patients out of unidentified infected people in the SUC model. We evaluate the numbers of confirmed and unidentified infected cases with respect to one parameter while fixing the other estimated parameters. We investigate the effect of the incentives on the termination time of the spread of the disease. The larger the incentive budget is, the faster the epidemic will end. Therefore, financial incentives can have the advantage of reducing the total cost required to prevent the spread of the disease, treat confirmed patients, and recover overall economic losses.","Lee, Chaeyoung; Kwak, Soobin; Kim, Junseok",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),310,23

A general understanding of what prevention represents in true form has lagged well behind the science and, in fact, few outside of the field recognize that there is actually a significant body of research that undergirds preventative practices, programs and policies. The current pandemic and the uneven impacts on underserved and marginalized populations has highlighted the need for proactive approaches to prevent underlying conditions that increase risk for infection, worsen the wide ranging harms from the virus, and significantly exacerbate disparities that characterize many nations. To ensure uptake of the science by end-users (e.g., community stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers), who operate the levers that determine whether resources and services are distributed equitably across societies' sectors, prevention scientists have a unique and powerful role to play. This commentary on the special issue, focused on the ""culture of prevention,"" considers the broader issues covered in the set of original articles in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Toward that end, I also outline two interrelated ""calls to action"" for prevention scientists. The first call is to concertedly apply a race equity lens to all aspects of our research, a need that is particularly critical given that our field is inherently actionable and, as such, evidence amassed has potential to equalize the playing field for disadvantaged and marginalized groups. The second acknowledges the need for prevention scientists to learn how to effectively communicate scientific knowledge to the public and policymakers to compellingly advocate for reforms guided by the science. A powerful, research-backed collective advocacy can effectively sway action of governing bodies in addressing disparities and inequities for constituents who have no voice.","Fishbein, Diana",Prev. sci,310,20

National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortage of healthcare resources that have to be reallocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers and save as many lives as possible. Beyond that, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale, is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored: it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients' need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Colorectal cancer demands a considerable amount of medical resources. Therefore, the redefinition of its diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms with a rigorous method is crucial in order to ensure the highest quality of continuum of care in the broader context of the pandemic and the challenged healthcare systems.","Vecchione, Loredana; Stintzing, Sebastian; Pentheroudakis, George; Douillard, Jean-Yves; Lordick, Florian",,310,20

This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of acute pulmonary hypertension (aPH) as per established trans-thoracic echocardiography (TTE) criteria in Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care and to explore whether short-term outcomes are affected by the presence of aPH. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed for patients treated in the intensive care units at a tertiary university hospital over a month. The presence of aPH on the TTE was noted, and plasma NTproBNP and troponin were measured as markers of cardiac failure and myocardial injury, respectively. Follow-up data were collected 21 d after the performance of TTE. RESULTS: In total, 26 of 67 patients (39%) had an assessed systolic pulmonary artery pressure of > 35 mmHg (group aPH), meeting the TTE definition of aPH. NTproBNP levels (median [range]: 1430 [102-30 300] vs. 470 [45-29 600] ng L-1 ; P = .0007), troponin T levels (63 [22-352] vs. 15 [5-407] ng L-1 ; P = .0002), and the 21-d mortality rate (46% vs. 7%; P < .001) were substantially higher in patients with aPH compared to patients not meeting aPH criteria. CONCLUSION: TTE-defined acute pulmonary hypertension was frequently observed in severely ill Covid-19 patients. Furthermore, aPH was linked to biomarker-defined myocardial injury and cardiac failure, as well as an almost sevenfold increase in 21-d mortality.","Norderfeldt, Joakim; Liliequist, Andreas; Frostell, Claes; Adding, Christofer; Agvald, Per; Eriksson, Maria; Lönnqvist, Per-Arne",Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,310,27

The key challenge in paracetamol therapy is associated with the frequency of the dosing. Depending on the gastric filling within 10-20 min paracetamol is released and rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it must be taken three or four times a day. To address the dose challenge it is desirable that the paracetamol release profile follows the zero-order kinetic model (constant rate of drug release per unit time). This goal can be achieved by using a suitable porous carrier system. Herein, non-toxic wrinkled mesoporous carbons with unique morphology were synthesized via the hard template method as new carriers for paracetamol. These particles can precisely modulate the release of paracetamol over 24 h in a simulated gastric fluid according to the zero-order kinetic model completely eliminating the initial burst release. Overall, these systems could significantly enhance the bioavailability of paracetamol and prolong its therapeutic effect in numerous diseases such as cold, flu, COVID-19, and severe pain.","Goscianska, Joanna; Olejnik, Anna; Ejsmont, Aleksander; Galarda, Aleksandra; Wuttke, Stefan",J Colloid Interface Sci,310,16

OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, for coronavirus disease 2019. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled phase II trial involving patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019. RESULTS: Forty-three patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care treatment (22 patients) or placebo based on standard-of-care treatment (21 patients). After exclusion of 2 patients (1 ineligible, 1 consent withdrawn) from the ruxolitinib group, 20 patients in the intervention group and 21 patients in the control group were included in the study. Treatment with ruxolitinib plus standard-of-care was not associated with significantly accelerated clinical improvement in severe patients with coronavirus disease 2019, although ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement. Eighteen (90%) patients from the ruxolitinib group showed computed tomography improvement at day 14 compared with 13 (61.9%) patients from the control group (P = .0495). Three patients in the control group died of respiratory failure, with 14.3% overall mortality at day 28; no patients died in the ruxolitinib group. Ruxolitinib was well tolerated with low toxicities and no new safety signals. Levels of 7 cytokines were significantly decreased in the ruxolitinib group in comparison to the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Although no statistical difference was observed, ruxolitinib recipients had a numerically faster clinical improvement. Significant chest computed tomography improvement, a faster recovery from lymphopenia, and favorable side-effect profile in the ruxolitinib group were encouraging and informative to future trials to test efficacy of ruxolitinib in a larger population.","Cao, Yang; Wei, Jia; Zou, Liang; Jiang, Tiebin; Wang, Gaoxiang; Chen, Liting; Huang, Liang; Meng, Fankai; Huang, Lifang; Wang, Na; Zhou, Xiaoxi; Luo, Hui; Mao, Zekai; Chen, Xing; Xie, Jungang; Liu, Jing; Cheng, Hui; Zhao, Jianping; Huang, Gang; Wang, Wei; Zhou, Jianfeng",J Allergy Clin Immunol,310,6

OBJECTIVES: We estimate the effect of the pandemic on utilization of outpatient services. RESEARCH DESIGN: Using 2010-2020 data from a national dataset, the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, we estimate the difference in outpatient care utilization during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic versus the same weeks in prior years. RESULTS: Our findings indicate that the pandemic started to reduce visits during the week of March 15-21. The effect on visits grew until reaching a peak during the week of April 5-11, 2020, when the pandemic reduced the total number of outpatient visits per provider by 70% relative to the same week in prior years. We find negative effects of the pandemic on visits for non-flu symptoms as well as on visits for flu symptoms, but the magnitudes of these latter effects tended to be larger in magnitude. The pandemic's impact declined over time, and by the week of June 28 to July 4, 2020, there was no longer any difference in total visits per provider relative to the same week in prior years. Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 in June and July, we still find no effects on total visits when our data end in July 26 to August 1, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that one by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is a large decline in the use of outpatient care which peaked around the week of April 5-11.

OBJECTIVE: With a descriptive epidemiological framing, we assessed whether recent historical patterns of regional influenza burden are reflected in the observed heterogeneity in COVID-19 cases across regions of the world. METHODS: Weekly surveillance data reported by the World Health Organization from January 2017 to December 2019 for influenza and from January 1, 2020 through October 31, 2020, for COVID-19 were used to assess seasonal and temporal trends for influenza and COVID-19 cases across the seven World Bank regions. RESULTS: In regions with more pronounced influenza seasonality, COVID-19 epidemics have largely followed trends similar to those seen for influenza from 2017 to 2019. COVID-19 epidemics in countries across Europe, Central Asia, and North America have been marked by a first peak during the spring, followed by significant reductions in COVID-19 cases in the summer months and a second wave in the fall. In Latin America and the Caribbean, COVID-19 epidemics in several countries peaked in the summer, corresponding to months with the highest influenza activity in the region. Countries from regions with less pronounced influenza activity, including South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, showed more heterogeneity in COVID-19 epidemics seen to date. However, similarities in COVID-19 and influenza trends were evident within select countries irrespective of region. CONCLUSIONS: Ecological consistency in COVID-19 trends seen to date with influenza trends suggests the potential for shared individual, structural, and environmental determinants of transmission. Using a descriptive epidemiological framework to assess shared regional trends for rapidly emerging respiratory pathogens with better studied respiratory infections may provide further insights into the differential impacts of nonpharmacologic interventions and intersections with environmental conditions. Ultimately, forecasting trends and informing interventions for novel respiratory pathogens like COVID-19 should leverage epidemiologic patterns in the relative burden of past respiratory pathogens as prior information.","Baral, Stefan David; Rucinski, Katherine Blair; Twahirwa Rwema, Jean Olivier; Rao, Amrita; Prata Menezes, Neia; Diouf, Daouda; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Phaswana-Mafuya, Nancy; Mishra, Sharmistha",JMIR Public Health Surveill,310,29

In this study, we present an empirical work for assessing ecological responses with botanical legacy data in the Qilian Mountains of China. Plot-scale and transect-wide survey was conducted for alpine shrub communities along an elevational gradient 20 years ago. Recently, we resampled the permanent plots to investigate how the community changes may be linked to climatic variability. We found no significant temporal shifts in species richness; but the community structure underwent substantial changes, as indicated by visible shifts in the relative density of dominant shrub species and the frequency of occurrence of understory herbaceous species. This reshuffling of plant community composition reflected a series of complex responses to climate change. Specifically, wet-demanding species have become more frequent due to the recently enhanced precipitation, while the replacement of some low-statured plants with different requirements for light was indirectly regulated by climate warming via reshaping the altitudinal patterns of dominant shrubs. Climate-mediated shifts in shrub species distribution altered the expected evolutional trajectory of alpine community, which increased the complexity and nonlinearity of the responses of the communities at different altitudes to climatic variability. Our results suggested that in-depth knowledge of indirect effects can facilitate to lessen the uncertainty in predicting future community dynamics in a changing climate.","Du, Jun; He, Zhibin; Chen, Longfei; Lin, Pengfei; Zhu, Xi; Tian, Quanyan",Int. j. biometeorol,310,3

Based on an abundance of engineered materials identifiable by their useful physicochemical properties through versatile chemical functionalization, nanotechnology offers a number of approaches to cope with this emergency. Here, through a multidisciplinary Perspective encompassing diverse fields such as virology, biology, medicine, engineering, chemistry, materials science, and computational science, we outline how nanotechnology-based strategies can support the fight against COVID-19, as well as infectious diseases in general, including future pandemics. Considering what we know so far about the life cycle of the virus, we envision key steps where nanotechnology could counter the disease. First, nanoparticles (NPs) can offer alternative methods to classical disinfection protocols used in healthcare settings, thanks to their intrinsic antipathogenic properties and/or their ability to inactivate viruses, bacteria, fungi, or yeasts either photothermally or via photocatalysis-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Nanotechnology tools to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 in patients could also be explored. In this case, nanomaterials could be used to deliver drugs to the pulmonary system to inhibit interaction between angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors and viral S protein. Moreover, the concept of ""nanoimmunity by design"" can help us to design materials for immune modulation, either stimulating or suppressing the immune response, which would find applications in the context of vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 or in counteracting the cytokine storm, respectively. In addition to disease prevention and therapeutic potential, nanotechnology has important roles in diagnostics, with potential to support the development of simple, fast, and cost-effective nanotechnology-based assays to monitor the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and related biomarkers.

Believing that one is or has been infected with COVID-19 may act as a nocebo. However, not much is known about potential nocebo effects associated with the reporting of COVID-19 symptoms. AIM: An online survey investigated whether certainty of being infected with COVID-19, age, sex, cognitive, emotional and personality factors were associated with perceived severity of COVID-19 symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=375) filled out an online survey containing 57 questions asking about symptoms resembling COVID-19, certainty of being infected with COVID-19, anxiety, stress and personality dimensions. RESULTS: Certainty of being infected with COVID-19 and anxiety predicted 27% of the variance in reporting of COVID-like symptoms. The mediation analysis showed that both higher certainty of being infected and anxiety independently predicted increased reports of COVID-like symptom. Females had higher anxiety and stress levels, and reported more COVID-like symptoms than males did. Older age was not associated with reporting COVID-like symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Believing to be infected with COVID-19, along with anxiety, can enhance the severity of COVID-like symptoms. Thus, the nocebo effect was due to both cognitive and emotional factors and was higher in females.","Daniali, Hojjat; Flaten, Magne Arve",Scand J Public Health,310,16

METHODS: A task force, including 10 rheumatologists and 4 infectious disease specialists from North America, was convened. Clinical questions were collated, and an evidence report was rapidly generated and disseminated. Questions and drafted statements were reviewed and assessed using a modified Delphi process. This included 2 rounds of asynchronous anonymous voting by e-mail and 3 webinars with the entire panel. Task force members voted on agreement with draft statements using a 1-9-point numerical scoring system, and consensus was determined to be low, moderate, or high based on the dispersion of votes. For approval, median votes were required to meet predefined levels of agreement (median values of 7-9, 4-6, and 1-3 defined as agreement, uncertainty, or disagreement, respectively) with either moderate or high levels of consensus. RESULTS: The task force approved 77 initial guidance statements: 36 with moderate and 41 with high consensus. These were combined, resulting in 25 final guidance statements.

As a public health measure, efficient screening methods are needed to determine the functional effects of new sequence variants. Here we show that structural modeling of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor, the first step in host-cell entry, predicts many novel variant combinations with enhanced binding affinities. By focusing on natural variants at the Spike-hACE2 interface and assessing over 700 mutant complexes, our analysis reveals that high-affinity Spike mutations (including N440K, S443A, G476S, E484R, G502P) tend to cluster near known human ACE2 recognition sites (K31 and K353). These Spike regions are structurally flexible, allowing certain mutations to optimize interface interaction energies. Although most human ACE2 variants tend to weaken binding affinity, they can interact with Spike mutations to generate high-affinity double mutant complexes, suggesting variation in individual susceptibility to infection. Applying structural analysis to highly transmissible variants, we find that circulating point mutations S477N, E484K and N501Y form high-affinity complexes (~40% more than wild-type). By combining predicted affinities and available antibody escape data, we show that fast-spreading viral variants exploit combinatorial mutations possessing both enhanced affinity and antibody resistance, including S477N/E484K, E484K/N501Y and K417T/E484K/N501Y. Thus, three-dimensional modeling of the Spike/hACE2 complex predicts changes in structure and binding affinity that correlate with transmissibility and therefore can help inform future intervention strategies.","Gan, Hin Hark; Twaddle, Alan; Marchand, Benoit; Gunsalus, Kristin C",J Mol Biol,310,32

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a patient portal-based COVID-19 self-triage and self-scheduling tool and made it available to all primary care patients at the University of California, San Francisco Health, a large academic health system. Asymptomatic patients were asked about exposure history and were then provided relevant information. Symptomatic patients were triaged into 1 of 4 categories-emergent, urgent, nonurgent, or self-care-and then connected with the appropriate level of care via direct scheduling or telephone hotline. RESULTS: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool was designed and implemented in under 2 weeks. During the first 16 days of use, it was completed 1129 times by 950 unique patients. Of completed sessions, 315 (28%) were by asymptomatic patients, and 814 (72%) were by symptomatic patients. Symptomatic patient triage dispositions were as follows: 193 emergent (24%), 193 urgent (24%), 99 nonurgent (12%), 329 self-care (40%). Sensitivity for detecting emergency-level care was 87.5% (95% CI 61.7-98.5%). DISCUSSION: This self-triage and self-scheduling tool has been widely used by patients and is being rapidly expanded to other populations and health systems. The tool has recommended emergency-level care with high sensitivity, and decreased triage time for patients with less severe illness. The data suggests it also prevents unnecessary triage messages, phone calls, and in-person visits. CONCLUSION: Patient self-triage tools integrated into electronic health record systems have the potential to greatly improve triage efficiency and prevent unnecessary visits during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Judson, Timothy J; Odisho, Anobel Y; Neinstein, Aaron B; Chao, Jessica; Williams, Aimee; Miller, Christopher; Moriarty, Tim; Gleason, Nathaniel; Intinarelli, Gina; Gonzales, Ralph",J Am Med Inform Assoc,310,1

Based on a systematic evaluation of pharmacotherapy, adverse drug reactions, drug interactions, and dose adjustments of drugs in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency are assessed. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of the provision of clinical pharmaceutical care for patients hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases in University Hospital Hradec Králové during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Czech Republic within period 16. 3. 2020–31. 5. 2020. In the studied period, 93 patients were hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases, of which 20 inpatients (21.5 %) were COVID positive. Clinical pharmaceutical care was provided to these patients via distance approach and the outcomes were recorded. Furthermore, the acceptance of pharmacotherapeutic recommendations and physicians´ feedback on the contribution of the clinical pharmacist were collected using a web-based questionnaire form. Results: In the observed period, 45 out of 93 hospitalized patients were classified by a clinical pharmacist at medium risk of a drug related problem and 18 patients at high risk. In a total of 48.4 % of cases (45 patients), a pharmaceutical care plan was written (35 times at admission, 10 times during hospitalization), the effectiveness of which was subsequently verified 24 times. All eight physicians caring for patients with COVID-19 provided feedback using web-based form. All considered collaboration with a clinical pharmacist beneficial, with two-thirds paying attention to pharmaceutical care plans on a regular basis. However, before the multicisciplinary collaboration started, only three physicians were aware of clinical pharmaceutical care. Conclusion: With the hospitalization of the first COVID-19 positive patient at FN HK, the provision of clinical pharmaceutical care was extended to the Department of Infectious Diseases. According to the number of recommended interventions and the opinions of physicians, this multidisciplinary involvement appears to be beneficial even in the context of distance cooperation. However, further studies are needed to assess the practical impact of the provision of clinical pharmaceutical care, to demonstrate their usefulness and to anchor clinical pharmacy more in standard healthcare. © 2021, SOLEN s.r.o..

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous survey composed of 34 questions was delivered to students of the Master Degree Program in Dentistry and Dental Prosthodontics of the Universities of Emilia-Romagna, the fifth Italian region most affected by the pandemic. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was assessed by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale (GAD-7). Numerically recoded data were analysed using the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), whilst to investigate the association between quantitative variables, the Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was computed. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed by 399 students (75%) out of 532. Most students experienced difficulties in working at the thesis during the COVID-19 emergency. For over half of them online teaching could only partially replace traditional face-to-face lessons. The negative impact on the study career was judged as particularly high by sixth-year students. Clinical training activities were considered as exposing to the risk of contracting COVID-19 infection by the majority of the students. The level of concern of contracting COVID-19 infections during future university activities was positively correlated to risk perception related to clinical training. CONCLUSION: The results of this survey could be used to train students to a correct risk assessment. Students reported experiencing concern while thinking of COVID-19 and 6.5% of them showed symptoms related to high levels of anxiety. These data may guide Universities in trying to reduce students' anxiety by means of correct communication strategies.","Generali, Luigi; Iani, Cristina; Macaluso, Guido Maria; Montebugnoli, Lucio; Siciliani, Giuseppe; Consolo, Ugo",Eur. j. dent. educ,310,29

In the present study, 662 serum samples collected from February 2020 to January 2021 from acute and convalescent COVID-19 patients were tested to determine neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers using a microneutralization test (MNT) for live SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, and IgM directed against different viral antigens were measured by high-throughput automated platforms. We observed higher levels of NAbs in elderly (&gt;60 years old) individuals and in patients presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 NAbs develop as soon as five days from symptom onset and, despite a decline after the second month, persist for over 11 months, showing variable dynamics. Through correlation and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, we set up a testing algorithm, suitable for the laboratory workload, by establishing an optimal cutoff value of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG for convalescent plasma donors to exclude from MNT samples foreseen to have low/negative NAb titers and ineligible for plasma donation. Overall, MNT, although cumbersome and not suitable for routine testing of large sample sizes, remains the reference tool for the assessment of antibody-mediated immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Smart testing algorithms may optimize the laboratory workflow to monitor antibody-mediated protection in COVID-19 patients, plasma donors, and vaccinated individuals.","Matusali, G.; Colavita, F.; Lapa, D.; Meschi, S.; Bordi, L.; Piselli, P.; Gagliardini, R.; Corpolongo, A.; Nicastri, E.; Antinori, A.; Ippolito, G.; Capobianchi, M.

The pathogen severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel Betacoronavirus, was subsequently isolated as the causative agent. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by respiratory droplets and fomites and presents clinically with fever, fatigue, myalgias, conjunctivitis, anosmia, dysgeusia, sore throat, nasal congestion, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. In most critical cases, symptoms can escalate into acute respiratory distress syndrome accompanied by a runaway inflammatory cytokine response and multiorgan failure. As of this article's publication date, COVID-19 has spread to approximately 200 countries and territories, with over 4.3 million infections and more than 290,000 deaths as it has escalated into a global pandemic. Public health concerns mount as the situation evolves with an increasing number of infection hotspots around the globe. New information about the virus is emerging just as rapidly. This has led to the prompt development of clinical patient risk stratification tools to aid in determining the need for testing, isolation, monitoring, ventilator support, and disposition. COVID-19 spread is rapid, including imported cases in travelers, cases among close contacts of known infected individuals, and community-acquired cases without a readily identifiable source of infection. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators are compounding the stress on overburdened healthcare systems. The continued challenges of social distancing, containment, isolation, and surge capacity in already stressed hospitals, clinics, and emergency departments have led to a swell in technologically-assisted care delivery strategies, such as telemedicine and web-based triage. As the race to develop an effective vaccine intensifies, several clinical trials of antivirals and immune modulators are underway, though no reliable COVID-19-specific therapeutics (inclusive of some potentially effective single and multi-drug regimens) have been identified as of yet. With many nations and regions declaring a state of emergency, unprecedented quarantine, social distancing, and border closing efforts are underway. Implementation of social and physical isolation measures has caused sudden and profound economic hardship, with marked decreases in global trade and local small business activity alike, and full ramifications likely yet to be felt. Current state-of-science, mitigation strategies, possible therapies, ethical considerations for healthcare workers and policymakers, as well as lessons learned for this evolving global threat and the eventual return to a 'new normal' are discussed in this article.","Stawicki, Stanislaw; Jeanmonod, Rebecca; Miller, Andrew; Paladino, Lorenzo; Gaieski, David; Yaffee, Anna; De Wulf, Annelies; Grover, Joydeep; Papadimos, Thomas; Bloem, Christina; Galwankar, Sagar; Chauhan, Vivek; Firstenberg, Michael; DI Somma, Salvatore; Jeanmonod, Donald; Garg, Sona; Tucci, Veronica; Anderson, Harry; Fatimah, Lateef; Worlton, Tamara; Dubhashi, Siddharth; Glaze, Krystal; Sinha, Sagar; Opara, Ijeoma; Yellapu, Vikas; Kelkar, Dhanashree; El-Menyar, Ayman; Krishnan, Vimal; Venkataramanaiah, S.; Leyfman, Yan; Saoud Al Thani, Hassan; Nanayakkara, Prabath B; Nanda, Sudip; Cioè-Peña, Eric; Sardesai, Indrani; Chandra, Shruti; Munasinghe, Aruna; Dutta, Vibha; Dal Ponte, Silvana; Izurieta, Ricardo; Asensio, Juan; Garg, Manish",J.

Today, there are two clustering mechanisms which prevent of uncontrolled disease propagation in a connected network: an ""internal"" clustering, which mimics self-isolation (SI) in local naturally arranged communities, and an ""external"" clustering, which looks like a sharp frontiers closing (FC) between cities and countries, and which does not care about the natural connections of network agents. SI networks are ""evolutionarily grown"" under the condition of maximization of small cliques in the entire network, while FC networks are instantly created. Running the standard SIR model on clustered SI and FC networks, we demonstrate that the evolutionary grown clustered network prevents the spread of an epidemic better than the instantly clustered network with similar parameters. We find that SI networks have the scale-free property for the degree distribution P(k)â¼k^{Î·}, with a small critical exponent -2<Î·<-1. We argue that the scale-free behavior emerges as a result of the randomness in the initial degree distributions.","Valba, O; Avetisov, V; Gorsky, A; Nechaev, S",Phys Rev E,310,1

Some, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and reduced glutathione (GSH), have indicated significant differences between patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants (101) were divided into a control group of healthy individuals and, following diagnosis, patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis, and aggressive periodontitis. Compounds reflecting tissue destruction, inflammatory processes or antioxidant responses, such as sirtuins (SIRT-1, SIRT-2), metalloproteinases (MMP), SOD, GPx, GSH, and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured in saliva. RESULTS: SIRT-2 levels were significantly increased in all patients. In patients with gingivitis, MMP (p<0.05) and GPx (p<0.01) were significantly increased. In patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis, SOD activities were increased (p<0.001) while GPx and GR were decreased (p<0.001). Relative activities of MMP were higher in patients with aggressive periodontitis. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of SIRT-2 and SOD clearly showed increased levels of oxidative stress in cases of periodontitis with a subsequent inhibition of other antioxidant enzymes. Levels of GSH suggest reversibility of the conditions with appropriate intervention. With the assessment of the trends of these selected antioxidant markers, it is possible to determine the prognosis of the disease.","Kluknavská, J; Krajcíková, K; Bolerázska, B; Maslanková, J; Ohlasová, J; Timková, S; Drotárová, Z; Vasková, J",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,310,2

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles, which are one of the most polymorphic genes, play a pivotal role in both resistance and vulnerability of the body against viruses and other infections as well as chronic diseases. The association between HLA alleles and preexisting medical conditions such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus is reported in various studies. In this review, we focused on the bioinformatic HLA studies to summarize the HLA alleles which responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides and have been used to design vaccines. We also reviewed HLA alleles that are associated with comorbidities and might be related to the high mortality rate among COVID-19 patients. Since both genes and patients' medical conditions play a key role in both severity of the disease and the mortality rate in COVID-19 patients, a better understanding of the connection between HLA alleles and SARS-CoV-2 can provide a wider perspective on the behavior of the virus. Such understanding can help scientists, especially in terms of protecting healthcare workers and designing effective vaccines.","Mobini Kesheh, Mina; Shavandi, Sara; Hosseini, Parastoo; Kakavand-Ghalehnoei, Rezvan; Keyvani, Hossein",Biomed Res Int,310,33

In infectious diseases, corticosteroids have been regarded as a thread due to their immunosuppressive effects and therefore their anti-inflammatory properties. MAIN: In recent years, there have been several studies published that aimed to determine the role of corticosteroids in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), because, despite significant advances in new antibiotics and supportive care, deaths of patients with CAP remain unacceptably high. While the 2007 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) CAP guidelines did not mention the use of corticosteroids in the management of CAP, the recently published 2019 IDSA/ATS guidelines recommended their use in patients with septic shock refractory to vasopressors and fluid resuscitation. Regarding viral infection, the use of corticosteroids in patients with influenza has shown to be associated with significantly higher mortality and higher incidence of nosocomial infection, while in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) there is a good body of evidence of the benefit of corticosteroids in terms of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The use of corticosteroids has been considered as a potential alternative co-adjuvant treatment in patients with pneumonia. In patients with COVID-19, the evidence is quite strong and there is a clear benefit of the use of corticosteroids in those patients presenting severe forms of disease.","Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Torres, Antoni",,310,16

Similar models are also proposed to describe the spread of riots and, more generally, of collective behaviors in various social contexts. The use of epidemiology models to describe such social phenomena is based on the analogy between the mechanisms of contagion and social imitation. In turn, this analogy also points to the social nature of epidemics. This paper is concerned with a family of Reaction-Diffusion systems introduced in [17] that aims at unifying, generalizing, and enlarging the fields of application for epidemiology and collective behavior models. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach on these apparently various phenomena through the example of the dynamics of social unrest. The model involves two quantities, the level of social unrest, or, more general, activity u, and a field of social tension v, which play asymmetric roles: u is thought of as the actual observed or explicit quantity while v is an ambiant, sometimes implicit field of susceptibility that modulates the growth of u. In this article, we explore this class of model and prove several theoretical results based on the framework developed in [17], of which the present work is a companion paper. Here we place the emphasis on two subclasses of systems defined in [17]: tension inhibiting and tension enhancing. These are characterized by the fact that the unrest has respectively a negative or positive feedback on the social tension (though no monotonicity condition is assumed). In [17] we derive a threshold phenomenon in terms of the initial level of social tension: below a critical value, a small triggering event is quickly followed by a resumption of calm, while, above this value, it generates an eruption of social unrest spreading through space with an asymptotically constant speed. The new results we derive in the present paper concern the behavior of the solution far from the propagating edge, that is, we give a description of the new regime of the system following the initial surge of activity. We show in particular that the model can give rise to many diverse qualitative dynamics: ephemeral or limited-duration social movements-referred to as""riots""-in the tension inhibiting case, and persisting social movements-lasting upheavals-in the tension enhancing case, as well as other more complex behaviors in some mixed cases. We also investigate this model by numerical simulations that highlight the richness of this framework. We finally propose and study extensions of the model, such as spatially heterogeneous systems.","Berestycki, Henri; Nordmann, Samuel; Rossi, Luca",,310,24

METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of patients with COVID-19 enrolled from February 22 to March 26, 2020. Forty cases of COVID-19 were confirmed using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction among patients who underwent screening tests and were consecutively hospitalized at Ulsan University Hospital, Ulsan, Korea. The final follow-up date was May 19, 2020. All COVID-19 cases in Ulsan were included. Demographic and epidemiological information, comorbidities, clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory and radiologic findings, medications, treatments, outcomes, and main durations of patients with COVID-19 were compared according to supplemental oxygen requirement. RESULTS: Forty patients were included (median age, 30 years; interquartile range [IQR], 25-57 years; 58% female). Six (15%) patients required supplemental oxygen. The prevalence of asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was 5% and that of presymptomatic infection was 13%. Cough, fever, myalgia, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, and diarrhea were the screening criteria for diagnosing symptomatic and presymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections. Sputum production, chest discomfort, a large number of symptoms, abnormal procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels, and abnormal chest X-ray or chest computed tomography findings were more common in patients requiring supplemental oxygen than in those not requiring supplemental oxygen. Overall mortality rate was 3% (1/40). Four patients (10%) were readmitted after testing positive by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction again. Incubation period was 5 days (IQR, 4-6 days), and the duration of viral shedding was 21 days (IQR, 14-28 days; maximum, 51 days). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection was 5%, which is much lower than that previously reported. This finding suggests that careful interviews and follow-ups should be performed to identify SARS-CoV-2 infections. Cough, fever, myalgia, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, and diarrhea are adequate screening criteria for covering all symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further evaluation is required to create representative screening criteria for COVID-19.","Jeong, Tae Heum; Pak, Chuiyong; Ock, Minsu; Lee, Seock Hwan; Son, Joung Sik; Jeon, Young Jee",J Korean Med Sci,310,16

Published articles and pre-prints were identified via MEDLINE and medRxiv. SETTING: Community or hospital, no restrictions on location. PARTICIPANTS: Adults who received a SARS-CoV-2 test or a COVID-19 diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection, hospitalization, disease severity and mortality stratified by smoking status. Study quality was assessed (i.e. 'good', 'fair' and 'poor').

Fifty-seven studies (24.5%) reported current, former and never smoking status. Recorded smoking prevalence among people with COVID-19 was generally lower than national prevalence. Current compared with never smokers were at reduced risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [relative risk (RR) = 0.74, 95% credible interval (CrI) = 0.58-0.93, &#964; = 0.41].

This research investigated whether non-invasive imaging correlated with animal behavior and morphological indicators of disease in response to serum levels of [Met5]-enkephalin. Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, adult female C57BL/6 J mice were randomized to receive daily injections of 0.1 mg/kg naltrexone (NTX) (= low dose naltrexone, LDN), 10 mg/kg Opioid Growth Factor (OGF) (chemically termed [Met5]-enkephalin) or saline beginning at the time of disease induction. Daily composite behavior scores were recorded over a 30-day period based on tail tone, gait, righting reflex, and limb strength. Prior to disease onset (day 7), and at peak disease (day 18), mice were imaged and tissues (blood and spinal cord) collected at day 30 for serum analyses of OGF and morphology. Serum OGF levels of EAE mice treated with saline were significantly reduced from baseline and from normal mice. Longitudinal cohort data demonstrated an increase in fractional anisotropy in all cohorts by day 18. There was a significant decrease in radial diffusivity in the saline group seen at day 18 whereas the axial diffusivity was not altered amongst treatment groups. Treatment with OGF or LDN resulted in mean diffusivity rates that were comparable to baseline (normal) levels at days 7 and 18. Luxol fast blue staining of the lumbar spinal cords demonstrated a 16 % reduction in myelin staining in saline treated EAE animals when compared to OGF and LDN treated EAE mice. Immunohistochemistry with Olig2 (pan-oligodendrocyte marker) and myelin basic protein (MBP) revealed that OGF and LDN treatment restored the area (%) of MBP and number of oligodendrocytes to that of normal spinal cord (â¼75 %). Saline treated EAE mice had more demyelination and fewer oligodendrocytes than normal mice. Collectively, these data suggest that a panel of biomarkers including imaging, serum biomarker levels, and behavior correlate with progression of disease, and may begin to validate use of specific non-invasive markers for MS.","Patel, Chirag; Meadowcroft, Mark D; Zagon, Ian S; McLaughlin, Patricia J",Brain Res Bull,310,16

However, this needs a lot of clarification if applied in the current situation where education is fully executed online. The problem now lies in the country's poor internet connectivity which greatly affects the online setup. This study then proposes that a house-to-house massive information campaign by local health care personnel which is led by a medical doctor to ensure a credible explanation of the entire procedure.

This study aimed to investigate the assumption that patients with urgent problems currently avoid the ER. METHODS: Electronic health records from the ER of a large Swiss university hospital were extracted for three periods: first, the awareness phase (ap) from the publication of the national government&rsquo;s initiative &ldquo;How to protect ourselves&rdquo; on 1 March 2020 to the lockdown of the country on 16 March; second, the mitigation phase (mp) from 16&ndash;30 March; finally, patients presenting in March 2019 were used as a control group. We compared parameters including a critical illness as the discharge diagnosis (e.g., myocardial infarction, stroke, sepsis and ER death) using logistic and linear regression, as well as 15-day bootstrapped means and 95% confidence intervals for the control group. RESULTS: In the three periods, a total of 7143 patients were treated. We found a 24.9% (42.5%) significant decline in the number of patients presenting during the ap (mp). Patients presenting during the mp were more likely to be critically ill. There was an increase of 233% and 367% (ap and mp, respectively) of ER deaths (none related to COVID-19) compared with the control period. Apart from polytrauma (increase of 5% in the mp), all other critical illnesses as discharge diagnosis showed a lower incidence in descriptive analysis. Significantly more patients died in the ER in both the ap and mp. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers to seeking emergency care during COVID-19 pandemic may lead to higher morbidity and mortality. Healthcare authorities and hospitals must ensure low barriers to treatment and business as usual for all patients.","Hautz, Wolf E; Sauter, Thomas C; Exadakytlos, Aristomenis K; Krummrey, Gert; Schauber, Stefan; Müller, Martin",Swiss Med Wkly,310,16

However, how the burden (number) of vascular risk factors influences the risk of severe COVID-19 disease remains unresolved. Our aim was to investigate the association of severe COVID-19 illness with vascular risk factor burden. METHODS: We included 164 (61.8 ± 13.6 years) patients with COVID-19 in this retrospective study. We compared the difference in clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest computed tomography (CT) findings between patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 illness. We evaluated the association between the number of vascular risk factors and the development of severe COVID-19 disease, using a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Sixteen (9.8%) patients had no vascular risk factors; 38 (23.2%) had 1; 58 (35.4%) had 2; 34 (20.7%) had 3; and 18 (10.9%) had &#8805;4 risk factors. Twenty-nine patients (17.7%) experienced severe COVID-19 disease with a median (14 [7-27] days) duration between onset to developing severe COVID-19 disease, an event rate of 4.47 per 1000-patient days (95%CI 3.10-6.43). Kaplan-Meier curves showed a gradual increase in the risk of severe COVID-19 illness (log-rank P < 0.001) stratified by the number of vascular risk factors. After adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities as potential confounders, vascular risk factor burden remained associated with an increasing risk of severe COVID-19 illness. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with increasing vascular risk factor burden have an increasing risk of severe COVID-19 disease, and this population might benefit from specific COVID-19 prevention (e.g., self-isolation) and early hospital treatment measures.","Du, Houwei; Pan, Xiaobin; Liu, Nan; Chen, Junnian; Chen, Xiaoling; Werring, David J; Ambler, Gareth; Li, Xiaoqing; Chen, Ronghua; Zhang, Yixian; Huang, Huayao; Lin, Feifei; Xia, Pincang; Chen, Chao; Zheng, Zhenyang; Wu, Sangru; Lei, Hanhan; Gao, Lei; Huang, Mingxu; Lin, Kexu; Xu, Xiaoping; Luo, Yukun; Zhao, Ziwen; Li, Chen; Lin, Hailong; Lin, Yu; Huang, Zhenghui; Cao, Rongxiang; Chen, Limin",Respir Res,310,30

The SARS-CoV-2 is causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A set of 58 molecules belongs to the naphthyridine and quinoline derivatives have been recently synthesized and considered for structure-based virtual screening against Nsp16-Nsp10. Molecular docking was virtually performed to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against Nsp16-Nsp10. Fourteen out of fifty-eight compounds were exhibited binding affinity higher than co-crystal bound ligand s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) toward Nsp16-Nsp10. Further, the in silico pharmacokinetics assessment was carried out and it was found that two molecules possess the acceptable pharmacokinetic profile, hence considered promising Nsp16-Nsp10 inhibitors. The binding interaction analysis was revealed some crucial binding interactions between the final selected two molecules and ligand-binding amino acid residues of Nsp16-Nsp10 protein. In order to explore the characteristics of the protein-ligand complex and how selected small molecules retained inside the receptor cavity in dynamic states, all-atoms conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed. Several factors were obtained from the MD simulation trajectory evidently suggested the potentiality of the molecules and stability of the protein-ligand complex. Finally, the binding affinity of both molecules and SAM was explored through the MM-GBSA approach which explained that both molecules possess strong affection towards the Nsp16-Nsp10. Hence, from the pharmacoinformatics assessment, it can be concluded that both heterocyclic compounds might be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, subjected to experimental validation.

Reports on the isolation of K. pneumoniae from other sources are increasing, many of which express multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes. Three phylogroups were identified based on nucleotide differences. Niche environments, including plants, animals, and humans appear to be colonized by different phylogroups, among which KpI (K. pneumoniae) is commonly associated with human infection. Infections with K. pneumoniae can be transmitted through contaminated food or water and can be associated with community-acquired infections or between persons and animals involved in hospital-acquired infections. Increasing reports are describing detections along the food chain, suggesting the possibility exists that this could be a hitherto unexplored reservoir for this opportunistic bacterial pathogen. Expression of MDR phenotypes elaborated by these bacteria is due to the nature of various plasmids carrying antimicrobial resistance (AMR)-encoding genes, and is a challenge to animal, environmental, and human health alike. Raman spectroscopy has the potential to provide for the rapid identification and screening of antimicrobial susceptibility of Klebsiella isolates. Moreover, hypervirulent isolates linked with extraintestinal infections express phenotypes that may support their niche adaptation.

However, in contrast to the common classes of nitride complexes (M&#8801;N) and organic nitrenes (R-N), structurally and spectroscopically well defined 'authentic' metallonitrenes with a monovalent atomic nitrogen ligand remain elusive. Here we report that the photolysis of a platinum(II) pincer azide complex enabled the crystallographic, spectroscopic, magnetic and computational characterization of a metallonitrene that is best described as a singly bonded atomic nitrogen diradical ligand bound to platinum(II). The photoproduct exhibits selective C-H, B-H and B-C nitrogen atom insertion reactivity. Despite the subvalent metallonitrene character, mechanistic analysis for aldehyde C-H amidation shows nucleophilic reactivity of the N-diradical ligand.

METHODS: We performed systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase to identify articles reporting baseline imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia. The quality of the articles was assessed using NIH quality assessment tool for case series studies. The pooled prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of imaging findings were calculated. RESULTS: Fifty-six studies (6007 patients, age, 2.1-70 years, 2887 females, 5762 CT, 396 radiographs,) were included. The mean interval between onset of symptoms and CT acquisition was 1-8 days. On CT, the pooled prevalence of ground glass opacities (GGO), GGO plus consolidation, and consolidation only was 66.9% (95% CI 60.8-72.4%), 44.9% (38.7-51.3%), and 32.1 (23.6-41.9%) respectively. Pooled sensitivity and specificity of GGO on CT was 73% (71%-80%) and 61% (41%-78%), respectively. For GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only, the pooled sensitivities/ specificities were 58% (48%-68%)/ 58% (41%-73%) and 49% (20%-78%)/ 56% (30%-78%), respectively. The pooled prevalence of GGO and consolidation on chest radiograph was 38.7% (22.2%-58.3%) and 46.9% (29.7%-64.9%), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of radiographic findings could not be assessed due to small number of studies. CONCLUSION: GGO on CT has the highest diagnostic performance for COVID-19 pneumonia, followed by GGO plus consolidation and consolidation only. However, the moderate to low sensitivity and specificity suggest that CT should not be used as the primary tool for diagnosis. Chest radiographic abnormalities are seen in half of the patients.","Garg, Mandeep; Gupta, Pankaj; Maralakunte, Muniraju; Kumar-M, Praveen; Sinha, Anindita; Kang, Mandeep; Agarwal, Ritesh; Sandhu, Manavjit Singh",Clin Imaging,310,2

How should we decide when these policies are permissible? Many writers propose we should address this question using cost-benefit analysis (CBA), a broadly consequentialist approach. We argue for an alternative non-consequentialist approach, grounded in contractualist moral theorising. The first section sets up key issues in the ethics of lockdown, and sketches the apparent appeal of addressing these problems in a CBA frame. The second section argues that CBA fundamentally distorts the normative landscape in two ways: first, in principle, it allows very many morally trivial preferences-say, for a coffee-might outweigh morally weighty life-and-death concerns; second, it is insensitive to the core moral distinction between victims and vectors of disease. The third section sketches our non-consequentialist alternative, grounded in Thomas Scanlon's contractualist moral theory. On this account, the ethics of self-defence implies a strong default presumption in favour of a highly restrictive, universal lockdown policy: we then ask whether there are alternatives to such a policy which are justifiable to all affected parties, paying particular attention to the complaints of those most burdened by policy. In the fourth section, we defend our contractualist approach against the charge that it is impractical or counterintuitive, noting that actual CBAs face similar, or worse, challenges.","John, Stephen David; Curran, Emma J",J. med. ethics,310,33

Materials and Methods: We collected datasets of daily reported hospitalization and cumulative morality of COVID 19 in Houston, Texas, from May 1, 2020 until June 29, 2020. These datasets are from multiple sources (USA FACTS, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council COVID 19 report, TMC daily news, and New York Times county level mortality reporting). Our model, risk stratified SIR HCD uses separate variables to model the dynamics of local contact (e.g., work from home) and high contact (e.g., work on site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their respective $R_0(t)$ over time. Results: We evaluated our models forecasting performance in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater Houston area) during the Phase I and Phase II reopening. Not only did our model outperform other competing models, it also supports counterfactual analysis to simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique among existing approaches. Discussion: Local mortality and hospitalization are significantly impacted by quarantine and reopening policies. No existing model has directly accounted for the effect of these policies on local trends in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in an explicit and explainable manner. Our work is an attempt to close this important technical gap to support decision making. Conclusion: Despite several limitations, we think it is a timely effort to rethink about how to best model the dynamics of pandemics under the influence of reopening policies.","Huang, Tongtong; Chu, Yan; Shams, Shayan; Kim, Yejin; Allen, Genevera; Annapragada, Ananth V; Subramanian, Devika; Kakadiaris, Ioannis; Gottlieb, Assaf; Jiang, Xiaoqian",,310,3

However, the pathogenicity and morphological impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the nasopharynx cells from symptomatic patients with different viral loads remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the ultrastructure of nasal cells obtained from individuals at distinct disease days and with high and low SARS-CoV-2 loads. Squamous and ciliated cells were the main cells observed in SARS-CoV-2 negative samples. We identified virus-like particles (VLPs) and replication organelles (RO)-like structures in the squamous cells from high viral load samples after 3- and 4-days of symptoms. Ultrastructural changes were found in those cells, such as the loss of microvilli and primary cilium, the increase of multivesicular bodies and autophagosomes, and signs of cell death. No ciliated cells were found in those samples. Squamous cells from low viral load sample after 5 days of symptoms showed few microvilli and no primary cilium. VLPs and RO-like structures were found in the ciliated cells only. No ultrastructural alterations were seen in the cells from low viral load individuals after 10- and 14-days of symptoms.

In this study, we aimed to visualize time-associated alterations of COVID-19 in the context of continents and countries. METHODS: Using COVID-19 case and death data from February to December 2020 offered by Johns Hopkins University, we generated time-associated balloon charts with multiple epidemiological indicators including crude case fatality rate (CFR), morbidity, mortality and the total number of cases, to compare the progression of the pandemic within a specific period across regions and countries, integrating seven related dimensions together. The area chart is used to supplement the display of the balloon chart in daily new COVID-19 case changes in UN geographic regions over time. Javascript and Vega-Lite were chosen for programming and mapping COVID-19 data in browsers for visualization. RESULTS: From February 1st to December 20th 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic spread across UN subregions in the chronological order. It was first reported in East Asia, and then became noticeable in Europe (South, West and North), North America, East Europe and West Asia, Central and South America, Southern Africa, Caribbean, South Asia, North Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania, causing several waves of epidemics in different regions. Since October, the balloons of Europe, North America and West Asia have been rising rapidly, reaching a dramatically high morbidity level ranging from 200 to 500/10 000 by December, suggesting an emerging winter wave of COVID-19 which was much bigger than the previous ones. By late December 2020, some European and American countries displayed a leading mortality as high as or over 100/100 000, represented by Belgium, Czechia, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Hungary, Bulgaria, Peru, USA, Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico. The mortality of Iran was the highest in Asia (over 60/100 000), and that of South Africa topped in Africa (40/100 000). In the last 15 days, the CFRs of most countries were at low levels of less than 5%, while Mexico had exceptional high CFR close to 10%.

CASE REPORT We report the case of a young man with no known co-morbidities, who came with fever and cough and was diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. He was found to have hemoglobin D thalassemia and G6PD deficiency during further evaluation. Hydroxychloroquine therapy started initially, was discontinued after 3 doses once the G6PD deficiency was diagnosed. His hospital course showed a mild drop in hemoglobin with evidence of hemolysis on peripheral smear. However, the hemoglobin improved without any need for transfusion. CONCLUSIONS Hydroxychloroquine therapy can induce hemolytic crises in patients with underlying G6PD deficiency or hemoglobinopathies and should be avoided or closely monitored. Immediate intervention to stop hydroxychloroquine after 3 doses saved our patient from a major hemolytic crisis.

Highly sensitive laboratory techniques played a critical role in clinical COVID-19 diagnosis and management. In this study the feasibility of using a new digital PCR-based detection assay for clinical COVID-19 diagnosis was investigated by comparing its performance with that of RT-PCR. Clinical patient samples and samples obtained from potentially contaminated environments were analyzed. The study included 10 patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnoses, 32 validated samples of various types derived from different clinical timepoints and sites, and 148 environmentally derived samples. SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids were more readily detected in respiratory tract samples (35.0%). In analyses of environmentally derived samples, the positivity rate of air samples was higher than that of surface samples, probably due to differences in virus concentrations. Digital PCR detected SARS-CoV-2 in several samples that had previously been deemed negative, including 3 patient-derived samples and 5 environmentally derived samples. In this study digital PCR exhibited higher sensitivity than conventional RT-PCR, suggesting that it may be a useful new method for clinical SARS-CoV-2 detection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical features, laboratory findings and radiological characteristics of 1563 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Ankara were collected, reviewed and analysed in this study. The risk factors associated with disease severity were investigated. RESULTS: Non-severe (1214; 77.7%) and severe cases (349; 22.3%) were enrolled in the study. Compared with the non-severe group, the severe group were significantly older and had more comorbidities (ie, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease). Smoking was more common in the severe group. Severe patients had higher respiratory rates and higher incidences of cough and dyspnoea compared with non-severe patients. Compared with the non-severe patients, the severe patients had increased C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and CRP/albumin ratio and decreased albumin.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether pre-diagnosed cancer was an independent risk factor for fatal outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. METHOD: A comprehensive search was conducted in major databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE to identify all published full-text studies as of January 20, 2021. Inter-study heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q-statistic and I² test. A meta-analysis of random- or fixed-effects model was used to estimate the effect size. Publication bias, sensitivity analysis and subgroup analysis were also carried out. RESULTS: The confounders-adjusted pooled effects (pooled odds ratio [OR]â¯=â¯1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.31-1.65; pooled hazard ratio [HR]â¯=â¯1.37, 95% CI: 1.21-1.54) indicated that COVID-19 patients with pre-diagnosed cancer were more likely to progress to fatal outcomes based on 96 articles with 6,518,992 COVID-19 patients. Further subgroup analyses by age, sample size, the proportion of males, region, study design and quality rating exhibited consistent findings with the overall effect size. CONCLUSION: Our analysis provides the objective findings based on the adjusted effect estimates that pre-diagnosed cancer is an independent risk factor for fatal outcome of COVID-19 patients. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, health workers should pay particular attention to cancer care for cancer patients and should prioritize cancer patients for vaccination.","Xu, Jie; Xiao, Wenwei; Shi, Li; Wang, Yadong; Yang, Haiyan",Arch Med Res,310,1

This antimalarial drug is also chronically used to treat patients with autoimmune diseases. By analyzing the Portuguese anonymized data on private and public based medical prescriptions we have identified all cases chronically receiving HCQ for the management of diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases. Additionally, we have detected all laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and all laboratory confirmed negative cases in the Portuguese population (mandatorily registered in a centrally managed database). Cross linking the two sets of data has allowed us to compare the proportion of HCQ chronic treatment (at least 2 grams per month) in laboratory confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection with laboratory confirmed negative cases. Out of 26 815 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients, 77 (0.29%) were chronically treated with HCQ, while 1215 (0.36%) out of 333 489 negative patients were receiving it chronically (P = .04). After adjustment for age, sex, and chronic treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, the odds ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for chronic treatment with HCQ has been 0.51 (0.37-0.70).

Suboptimal infection control practices have been identified as important risk factors. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a questionnaire to holistically assess the preventive practices of health care workers related to COVID-19 and identify the reasons for shortcomings therein. METHODS: The development of the questionnaire involved item generation through literature review, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers and experts, followed by validation through expert opinion, pilot testing and survey. A cross-sectional survey on 147 healthcare workers was done using an online platform and/or interviews in August 2020 in New Delhi, India. Exploratory factor analysis using principal component extraction with varimax rotation was performed to establish construct validity. Internal consistency of the tool was tested using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. RESULTS: The developed questionnaire consists of two sections: Section A contains 29 items rated on a five-point Likert scale to assess preventive practices and Section B contains 27 semi-structured items to assess reasons for suboptimal practices. The first section has good validity (CVRâ¯=â¯0.87, S-CVI/Avâ¯=â¯0.978) and internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficientâ¯=â¯0.85) CONCLUSIONS: This questionnaire is a valid and reliable tool for holistic assessment of preventive practices and barriers to it among health care workers. It will be useful to identify vulnerable practices and sections in health care settings which would assist policymakers in designing appropriate interventions for infection prevention and control. This will also be useful in future pandemics of similar nature.","Agarwal, Ayush; Ranjan, Piyush; Saikaustubh, Yellamraju; Rohilla, Priyanka; Kumari, Archana; Prasad, Indrashekhar; Baitha, Upendra; Dwivedi, Sada Nand",Indian J Med Microbiol,310,1

Discrimination of MDSC from their non-suppressive counterparts is a prerequisite for the development of successful therapies. Understanding the switch mechanisms that direct granulocytic and monocytic development into a pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory direction will be crucial for therapeutic strategies. Manipulation of these myeloid checkpoints are exploited by tumors and pathogens, such as M. tuberculosis (Mtb), HIV or SARS-CoV-2, that induce MDSC for immune evasion. Thus, specific markers for MDSC identification may reveal also novel molecular candidates for therapeutic intervention at the level of MDSC.","Lutz, Manfred B; Eckert, Ina N",Cell Immunol,310,25

Considering their critical role in reducing disease burden, the increasing demand outpacing production, and that most currently approved vaccines follow a two-dose regimen, the cost-effectiveness of delaying the second dose to increment the coverage of the population receiving the first dose is often debated. Finding the best solution is complex due to the trade-off between vaccinating more people with lower level of protection and guaranteeing higher protection to a fewer number of individuals. Here we present a novel extended age-structured SEIR mathematical model that includes a two-dose vaccination schedule with a between-doses delay modelled through delay differential equations and linear optimization of vaccination rates. Simulations for each time window and for different types of vaccines and production rates were run to find the optimal time window between doses, that is, the one that minimizes the number of deaths. We found that the best strategy depends on an interplay between the vaccine production rate and the relative efficacy of the first dose. In the scenario of low first-dose efficacy, it is always better to apply the second dose as soon as possible, while for high first-dose efficacy, the optimal window depends on the production rate and also on second-dose efficacy provided by each type of vaccine. We also found that the rate of spread of the infection does not affect significantly the thresholds of the optimal window, but is an important factor in the absolute number of total deaths. These conclusions point to the need to carefully take into account both vaccine characteristics and roll-out speed to optimize the outcome of vaccination strategies.","Ferreira, Leonardo Souto; Canton, Otavio; Silva, Rafael Lopes Paixão da; Poloni, Silas; Sudbrack, Vítor; Borges, Marcelo Eduardo; Franco, Caroline; Marquitti, Flávia Maria Darcie; Moraes, José Cássio de; Veras, Maria Amélia de Sousa Mascena; Kraenkel, Roberto André; Coutinho, Renato Mendes",,310,1

Internet-based psychological measurement can play an important role in collecting imperative data, assisting to guide evidence-based decision making in practice and policy, and subsequently facilitating immediate reporting of measurement results to participants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. METHODS: This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P<.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81. Participants who demonstrated problematic scores for at least one of the mental health outcomes increased from 58% (n=197/340) before COVID-19 to 79% (n=532/673) during COVID-19, leading to only 21% (n=141) of measured participants displaying good mental health during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrate deterioration in mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Although further research is needed, our findings support the serious mental health implications of the pandemic and highlight the utility of internet-based data collection tools in providing evidence to innovate and strengthen practice and policy during and after the pandemic.","van Agteren, Joep; Bartholomaeus, Jonathan; Fassnacht, Daniel B; Iasiello, Matthew; Ali, Kathina; Lo, Laura; Kyrios, Michael",JMIR Ment Health,310,1

The discovery of giant viruses has changed these standard paradigms. Their genetic, proteomic and structural complexities resemble those of cells, prompting a redefinition and reclassification of viruses. In a previous genome-wide analysis of the evolution of structural domains in proteomes, with domains defined at the fold superfamily level, we found the origins of viruses intertwined with those of ancient cells. Here, we extend these data-driven analyses to the study of fold families confirming the co-evolution of viruses and ancient cells and the genetic ability of viruses to foster molecular innovation. The results support our suggestion that viruses arose by genomic reduction from ancient cells and validate a co-evolutionary 'symbiogenic' model of viral origins.","Mughal, Fizza; Nasir, Arshan; Caetano-Anollés, Gustavo",Arch. virol,310,24

These achievements have been obtained in traditional PR (t-PR) hospital-based, out-patient, in-person training programs. Recent evidence supports utilizing telehealth options to deliver standardized, rehabilitation programs to rural and remote communities without other access to PR. In March of 2020, an international pandemic was declared with regards to COVID-19. This forced t-PR programs to pause in-person patient contact, and consider dramatic changes to program delivery. Approach: We transformed our t-PR program into a completely full-fledged virtual PR (v-PR) programme that offered, via telephone and videoconferencing, education and exercise sessions. When it was deemed safe to resume inperson patient contact, specifically for PR exercise prescription determination, patients were brought in for exercise assessment only. This represented a complete transformation of our programme, and to our knowledge, was the first such offering in Ontario. Twice weekly regular video-based group exercise sessions, with a third being performed independently, was established while providing remote patients vital sign monitoring equipment throughout their enrollment to ensure safety. Education sessions were at first delivered by telephone, with the transitioning to video-lecturing by the end of 2020 occurring. Results: Enrollment data reveals the mean age for t-PR was 69.3 ± 9.2 years (n=164) compared to 69.9 ± 9.7 years for our v-PR (n=34). To date, completion data for six-minute walk distance (6MWD) improved in the t-PR (n=128) by 55.3 m (p &lt; 0.001) and in the v-PR (n=8) 72.1 m (p &lt; 0.001). General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire improved by 2 points in t-PR (n=129, p &lt; 0.001) and by 3 points in the v-PR (n=8, p = 0.013). There was no change in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score for the v-PR, whereas the t-PR had an improvement of 2 points (n=129, p &lt; 0.001). COPD Assessment Test (CAT) scores in t-PR (n=130) improved by 4 points (p&lt;0.001) and by 3 points (n=8, p= 0.013) in v-PR group. Discussion: Our current PR programme has demonstrated an important pivot during the current pandemic to provide a virtual curriculum. Preliminary data show that participants in v-PR improved significantly in their 6MWD, quality of life, and anxiety scores. This shift to the virtual option has allowed for continued care, despite the pandemic restrictions;and can be provided to other patients who otherwise would be unable to participate due to geographical restrictions.","Nicholson, J.

Artificial intelligence tools including smartphones and smart watches have changed the landscape of day-to-day lives. Digitisation, decentralisation of healthcare and empowerment of allied healthcare providers and patients themselves have made shared clinical decision-making a reality. The year 2020 quickly turned into an unprecedented time in our lives with the entry of COVID-19. Amidst a pandemic, healthcare systems rapidly adapted and transformed, and changes that otherwise would have taken a decade, took a mere few weeks (Webster, Lancet 395:1180-1, 2020).

To control infection spread with the least disruption to economic and societal activities, it is crucial to implement the various interventions effectively. In this study, we developed an agent-based SEIR model, using real demographic and geographic data from Hong Kong, to analyse the efficiency of various intervention strategies in preventing infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Close contact route including short-range airborne is considered as the main transmission routes for COVID-19 spread. Contact tracing is not that useful if all other interventions have been fully deployed. The number of infected individuals could be halved if people reduced their close contact rate by 25%. For reducing transmission, students should be prioritized for vaccination rather than retired older people and preschool aged children. Home isolation, and taking the nucleic acid test (NAT) as soon as possible after symptom onset, are much more effective interventions than wearing masks in public places. Temperature screening in public places only disrupted the infection spread by a small amount when other interventions have been fully implemented. Our results may be useful for other highly populated cities, when choosing their intervention strategies to prevent outbreaks of COVID-19 and similar diseases.","Zhang, Nan; Jack Chan, Pak-To; Jia, Wei; Dung, Chung-Hin; Zhao, Pengcheng; Lei, Hao; Su, Boni; Xue, Peng; Zhang, Weirong; Xie, Jingchao; Li, Yuguo",Environ Int,310,24

Therefore, prevention to be infected through social distancing and isolation is the most effective way. However, all the other physical and mental illnesses continue to exist, if possible even more burdened by the emergency situation and social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic, especially in many low- and middle-income countries, has caused a deeper gap in seeking psychiatric help. In this scenario, telepsychiatry could play a decisive role in implementing clinical care for frail patients and ensuring continuous mental care. Therefore, we felt the urge to write this article to express our hope that the old health care system at this time of crisis, as we know it, can offer the chance to implement pervasive care technologies that perfectly fit current psychiatric needs.","Diwan, Mufaddal Najmuddin; Ali Awan, Hashir; Aamir, Alifiya; de Filippis, Renato; Ullah, Irfan",J Nerv Ment Dis,310,16

Generally, patients with underlying medical conditions are at a higher risk of complications and fatality of pneumonias. Whether patients with systemic autoimmune diseases or vasculitides, are at increased risk for serious complications associated with COVID-19, is not established yet. Computed tomography (CT) has been employed as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with clinical suspicion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection with a reported sensitivity of higher than reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Multifocal bilateral ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with peripheral and posterior distribution and subsequent superimposition of consolidations are considered the main imaging features of the disease in chest CT. However, chest CT images of underlying rheumatologic or autoimmune diseases or vasculitides, such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Behçet disease, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, especially those with extensive lung involvement can overshadow or obliterate features of COVID-19. In addition, CT findings of such diseases may resemble manifestations of COVID-19 (such as ground glass opacities with or without superimposed consolidation), making the diagnosis of viral infections, more challenging on imaging. Comparing the imaging findings with prior studies (if available) for any interval change is the most helpful approach. Otherwise, the diagnosis of COVID-19 in such patients must be cautiously made according to the clinical context and laboratory results, considering a very high clinical index of suspicion on imaging.","Eslambolchi, Azadeh; Aghaghazvini, Leila; Gholamrezanezhad, Ali; Kavosi, Hoda; Radmard, Amir Reza",J. thromb. thrombolysis,310,20

METHODS: Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to collect the active components and corresponding targets of Qixuekang. Disease targets, related to COVID-19 during the recovery period, were collected from the GeneCards database. Protein-Protein interaction (PPI) network was built by using the String database, and analyzing and using Cytoscape 3.7.0 software to screen out hub genes. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were analyzed by R 3.6.1 software. RESULTS: 34 active components of Qixuekang were screened out, and 161 common targets of drug and disease were identified. GO enrichment suggested 141 biologic processes, mainly involving nuclear receptor activity, transcription factor activity, and direct ligand regulated sequence-specific DNA binding. KEGG pathway enrichment suggests 96 signaling pathways, mainly including TNF signaling pathway, IL-17 signal pathway, and C-type lectin receptor signal pathway. The hub genes, screened in the PPI network, were mainly inclusive of CXCL8, CXCL2, CXCL10, ADRA2A, and ADRA2C.

Our study identified risk factors for in-hospital mortality among patients with COVID-19 infection at a tertiary care center, in Detroit, Michigan. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective cohort study at a 776-bed tertiary care urban academic medical center. Adult inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 (nasopharyngeal swab testing positive by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay) from March 8, 2020, to June 14, 2020, were included. Clinical information including the presence of comorbid conditions (according to the Charlson Weighted Index of Comorbidity (CWIC)), initial vital signs, admission laboratory markers and management data were collected. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Among 565 hospitalized patients, 172 patients died for a case fatality rate of 30.4%. The mean (SD) age of the cohort was 64.4 (16.2) years, and 294 (52.0%) were male. The patients who died were significantly older (mean [SD] age, 70.4 [14.1] years vs 61.7 [16.1] years; P < 0.0001), more likely to have congestive heart failure (35 [20.3%] vs 47 [12.0%]; P = 0.009), dementia (47 [27.3%] vs 48 [12.2%]; P < 0.0001), hemiplegia (18 [10.5%] vs 18 [4.8%]; P = 0.01) and a diagnosis of malignancy (16 [9.3%] vs 18 [4.6%]; P = 0.03).From multivariable analysis, factors associated with an increased odds of death were age greater than 60 years (OR = 2.2, P = 0.003), CWIC score (OR = 1.1, P = 0.023), qSOFA (OR = 1.7, P < 0.0001), WBC counts (OR = 1.1, P = 0.002), lymphocytopenia (OR = 2.0, P = 0.003), thrombocytopenia (OR = 1.9, P = 0.019), albumin (OR = 0.6, P = 0.014), and AST levels (OR = 2.0, P = 0.004) on admission. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified risk factor for in-hospital mortality among patients admitted with COVID-19 in a tertiary care hospital at the onset of U.S. Covid-19 pandemic. After adjusting for age, CWIC score, and laboratory data, qSOFA remained an independent predictor of mortality. Knowing these risk factors may help identify patients who would benefit from close observations and early interventions.","Bhargava, Ashish; Szpunar, Susanna M; Sharma, Mamta; Fukushima, Elisa Akagi; Hoshi, Sami; Levine, Miriam; Gandhi, Nikhil; Zhao, Wei; Michael, Somero; Tanveer, Farah; Youssef, Dima; Coyle, Meredith; Leonard, Johnson; Saravolatz, Louis",J Intensive Care Med,310,26

However, it is often measured visually with considerable bias and inaccuracy. OBJECTIVES: Firstly, to compare distribution and accuracy of electronically measured RR (EMRR) and visually measured RR (VMRR). Secondly, to determine whether, and how far in advance, continuous electronic RR monitoring can predict oncoming hypoxic and pyrexic episodes in infectious respiratory disease. APPROACH: A retrospective cohort study analysing the difference between EMRR and VMRR was conducted using patient data from a large tertiary hospital. Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine whether continuous, EMRR measurements could predict oncoming hypoxic (SpO2 <92%) and pyrexic (temperature >38 °C) episodes. MAIN RESULTS: Data were gathered from 34 COVID-19 patients, from which a total of 3445 observations of VMRR (independent of Hawthorne effect), peripheral oxygen saturation and temperature and 729117 observations of EMRR were collected. VMRR had peaks in distribution at 18 and 20 breaths per minute. 70.9% of patients would have had a change of treatment during their admission based on the UK's National Early Warning System if EMRR was used in place of VMRR. An elevated EMRR was predictive of hypoxic (hazard ratio: 1.8 (1.05 to 3.07)) and pyrexic (hazard ratio: 9.7 (3.8 to 25)) episodes over the following 12 hours. SIGNIFICANCE: Continuous EMRR values are systematically different VMRR values, and results suggest it is a better indicator of true RR as it has lower kurtosis, has higher variance, a lack of peaks at expected values (18 and 20) and it measures a physiological component of breathing directly (abdominal movement). Results suggest EMRR is a strong marker of oncoming hypoxia and is highly predictive of oncoming pyrexic events in the following 12 hours. In many diseases, this could provide an early window to escalate care prior to deterioration, potentially preventing morbidity and mortality.","McCartan, Thomas A; Worrall, Amy P; Ó Conluain, Ruán; Alaya, Fátimah; Mulvey, Christopher; MacHale, Elaine; Brennan, Vincent; Lombard, Lorna; Walsh, Joanne; Murray, Myles; Costello, Richard W; Greene, Garrett",Physiol. meas,310,16

A unique population (student teachers) faced challenges from two perspectives: as students and as teachers forced to teach and learn from a distance. Student Teachers, or preservice teachers (PST), are university students finishing a degree and/or teacher certification program by serving as an intern in a school setting. As schools were closed, these PSTs may not have been given access to the online learning platforms of their cooperating teachers (CT) and were no longer included in classroom instruction. The purpose of this study was to examine how the sudden shift away from traditional face-to-face instruction, co-teaching, and mentorship affected the involvement of music PSTs and their CT mentors in one region of the United States. Specifically, the research questions were: (1) How and in what ways were PSTs involved in planning, instruction, and/or assessment synchronously and asynchronously after school closures? (2) In what subdomains (performance, music theory/ear-training, etc.) were PSTs engaged in instruction and learning activities? (3) What challenges and solutions did PSTs report related to Covid-19 closures? A survey was sent, via email, to PSTs attending teacher preparation programs at universities in the state of Georgia at the end of the spring semester. Thirty-seven participants responded to the survey questions representing about 32% of all PSTs in Georgia in Spring 2020. Twenty-one were not given access to the online teaching platform of their placement school. A thematic analysis of the open-ended questions identified common themes including whether experiences were perceived as negative or positive. Of the PSTs given access, the majority of their responsibilities and experiences were creating assignments, additional help videos, participating in Zoom meetings, and assessing student assignment submissions. Of these experiences, interestingly, most were classified as positive by the PSTs. However, the importance of face-to-face interactions for both PST and the P-12 students was mentioned throughout survey responses. Approximately 10 PSTs mentioned their CT relationship/interaction and four of the respondents noted that their CT never reached out for help;however, six noted collaborative meetings or teaching with their CT. Importantly, some PSTs reported a lack of knowledge related to the planning and implementation of music instruction in the online modality. Therefore, teacher preparation programs should consider incorporating technology including online solutions into the music curriculum so that future music educators may more flexibly incorporate both in-person and distance learning.","Thomas, M.

Natural ventilation is an effective strategy against indoor air biocontamination. However, the relationship between natural ventilation and indoor air contamination requires an in-depth investigation of the behavior of airborne infectious diseases, particularly concerning the contaminant's viral and aerodynamic characteristics. This research investigates the effectiveness of natural ventilation in preventing infection risks for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) through indoor air contamination of a free-running, naturally-ventilated room (where no space conditioning is used) that contains a person having COVID-19 through building-related parameters. Design/methodology/approach This research adopts a case study strategy involving a simulation-based approach. A simulation pipeline is implemented through a number of design scenarios for an open office. The simulation pipeline performs integrated contamination analysis, coupling a parametric 3D design environment, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and energy simulations. The results of the implemented pipeline for COVID-19 are evaluated for building and environment-related parameters. Study metrics are identified as indoor air contamination levels, discharge period and the time of infection. Findings According to the simulation results, higher indoor air temperatures help to reduce the infection risk. Free-running spring and fall seasons can pose higher infection risk as compared to summer. Higher opening-to-wall ratios have higher potential to reduce infection risk. Adjacent window configuration has an advantage over opposite window configuration. As a design strategy, increasing opening-to-wall ratio has a higher impact on reducing the infection risk as compared to changing the opening configuration from opposite to adjacent. However, each building setup is a unique case that requires a systematic investigation to reliably understand the complex airflow and contaminant dispersion behavior. Metrics, strategies and actions to minimize indoor contamination risks should be addressed in future building standards. The simulation pipeline developed in this study has the potential to support decision-making during the adaptation of existing buildings to pandemic conditions and the design of new buildings. Originality/value The addressed need of investigation is especially crucial for the COVID-19 that is contagious and hazardous in shared indoors due to its aerodynamic behavior, faster transmission rates and high viral replicability. This research contributes to the current literature by presenting the simulation-based results for COVID-19 as investigated through building-related and environment-related parameters against contaminant concentration levels, the discharge period and the time of infection. Accordingly, this research presents results to provide a basis for a broader understanding of the correlation between the built environment and the aerodynamic behavior of COVID-19.","Abbas, G.

Since most wastewater virus concentration methods were developed and validated for nonenveloped viruses, it is imperative to determine the efficiency of the most commonly used methods for the enveloped severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Municipal wastewater seeded with a human coronavirus (CoV) surrogate, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), was used to test the efficiency of seven wastewater virus concentration methods: (A-C) adsorption-extraction with three different pre-treatment options, (D-E) centrifugal filter device methods with two different devices, (F) polyethylene glycol (PEG 8000) precipitation, and (G) ultracentrifugation. MHV was quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the recovery efficiency was calculated for each method. The mean MHV recoveries ranged from 26.7 to 65.7%. The most efficient methods were adsorption-extraction methods with MgCl2 pre-treatment (Method C), and without pre-treatment (Method B). The third most efficient method used the Amicon® Ultra-15 centrifugal filter device (Method D) and its recovery efficiency was not statistically different from the most efficient methods. The methods with the worst recovery efficiency included the adsorption-extraction method with acidification (A), followed by PEG precipitation (F). Our results suggest that absorption-extraction methods with minimal or without pre-treatment can provide suitably rapid, cost-effective and relatively straightforward recovery of enveloped viruses in wastewater. The MHV is a promising process control for SARS-CoV-2 surveillance and can be used as a quality control measure to support community-level epidemic mitigation and risk assessment.","Ahmed, Warish; Bertsch, Paul M; Bivins, Aaron; Bibby, Kyle; Farkas, Kata; Gathercole, Amy; Haramoto, Eiji; Gyawali, Pradip; Korajkic, Asja; McMinn, Brian R; Mueller, Jochen F; Simpson, Stuart L; Smith, Wendy J M; Symonds, Erin M; Thomas, Kevin V; Verhagen, Rory; Kitajima, Masaaki",Sci Total Environ,310,23

The current study examined how living alone was associated with daily social contact and emotional well-being among older adults during the pandemic. METHOD: Adults (N = 226) aged 69+ completed a brief survey assessing their living situation, social contact with different social partners (in person, by phone, electronically), and emotions during the morning, afternoon and evening the prior day. RESULTS: Older adults who live alone were less likely to see others in person or to receive or provide help. Living alone was associated with more positive emotions concurrent with in-person contact. In contrast, phone contact was associated with higher levels of negative affect among those living alone, but not among those who live with others. Older adults who live alone were more likely to have contact with friends (rather than family). DISCUSSION: Findings suggest older adults who live alone may be more reactive to social contact during the COVID-19 outbreak than older adults who reside with others. In-person contact may confer distinct benefits not available via telephone contact, suggesting that possible interventions during the pandemic may work best with safe forms of in-person contact, possibly with non-family members.","Fingerman, Karen L; Ng, Yee To; Zhang, Shiyang; Britt, Katherine; Colera, Gianna; Birditt, Kira S; Charles, Susan T",,310,16

However, many diseases are not preventable through currently available vaccines, and the potential of modulating the immune response during vaccination has not been fully exploited. The first golden age of vaccines was based on the germ theory and the use of live, attenuated, inactivated pathogens or toxins. New strategies and formulations (e.g., adjuvants) with an immunomodulatory capacity to enhance the protective qualities and duration of vaccines have been incompletely exploited. These strategies can prevent disease and improve protection against infectious diseases, modulate the course of some noncommunicable diseases, and increase the immune responses of patients at a high risk of infection, such as the elderly or immunocompromised patients. In this minireview, we focus on how metabolic and epigenetic modulators can amplify and enhance the function of immunity in a given vaccine. We propose the term ""amplifier"" for such additives, and we pose that future vaccines will have three components: antigen, adjuvant, and amplifier.","Domínguez-Andrés, Jorge; van Crevel, Reinout; Divangahi, Maziar; Netea, Mihai G",mBio (Online),310,17

The knowledge spillover substantially decreases carbon emissions, while high energy demand increases carbon emissions. Poverty incidence increases fertility rate in the short-run; however, in the long-run, the result only supported with vulnerable employment and food prices that lead to increase fertility rates worldwide.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language therapists and their patients experienced restrictions regarding the usual face-to-face therapy. Teletherapy has become a highly discussed medium for providing therapy services. This study aimed at assessing Austrian therapists' attitudes towards teletherapy, including perceived barriers, during and before the COVID-19 lockdown. Further interest referred to therapists' technical affinity and experiences with the application of teletherapy. METHODS: Therapists (n = 325) completed an online survey amid the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020. Retrospective indications referred to the time prior to the lockdown. Ratings were opposed across the three therapeutic professions. Subgroup analyses investigated the role of gender and age regarding technical affinity. Measures included custom-made attitudinal statements towards teletherapy and the standardized TA-EG survey. RESULTS: The COVID-19 lockdown caused attitude changes towards teletherapy - for example, in terms of interest (r = 0.57, p > 0.01), perceived skills for performance of teletherapy (r = 0.33, p > 0.01) and perceived need for physical contact with patients (r = 0.35, p > 0.01). Regarding technical affinity, women reported significantly higher values than men did (r = 0.32, p > 0.01). Nearly half of the participants already applied teletherapy, with mainly positive ratings regarding perceived skills and feasibility. Barriers identified were missing or unstable reimbursement policies by insurance companies and therapeutic software with guaranteed data security. DISCUSSION: Austrian therapists indicate a relatively high level of telehealth positivity, with an improvement in the course of the COVID-19 lockdown. However, therapists outline the need for stable reimbursement policies and secure software solutions.","Rettinger, Lena; Klupper, Carissa; Werner, Franz; Putz, Peter",J Telemed Telecare,310,20

In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity. Objective:The aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected. Methods:RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1-December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20-May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling i the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution Xi = X ( sigmai , x i ) was used to represent the trend of daily variations of xi j = R S V si j . When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Welch's t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when t &lt; 1.5 . A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase DELTA was used to quantify the difference between two values. Results:Google Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both periods 1 and 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets ( M a x Delta = + 625 % for Italian regions, and M a x = + 175 % for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities' RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference. Conclusion:In the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries' data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method.","Rovetta, A.",Frontiers in Research Metrics &amp; Analytics,310,30

Results: A cross-sectional multicenter study involving 220 patients; 68 (30.9%) females and 152 (69.1%) males, their age range was 10-92 years (average 49.198 years). Non-contrast MSCT chest was done to patients with clinically suspected COVID-19. Data assessment and analysis for lesions probability, pattern, localization, and severity were done. Bilateral affection was seen in 168/220 cases (76.36%). Multilobar affection was noted in 186/220 cases (84.54%). Lower lobes affection was noted in 179/220 cases (81.36%). Peripheral/subpleural affection was noted in 203/220 cases (92.27%).

Examining baseline SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive immunological responses, induced by circulating human coronaviruses (hCoVs), is needed to understand such divergent clinical outcomes. Here we show analysis of coronavirus antibody responses of pre-pandemic healthy children (n = 89), adults (n = 98), elderly (n = 57), and COVID-19 patients (n = 50) by systems serology. Moderate levels of cross-reactive, but non-neutralizing, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detected in pre-pandemic healthy individuals. SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific FcÎ³ receptor binding accurately distinguishes COVID-19 patients from healthy individuals, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces qualitative changes to antibody Fc, enhancing FcÎ³ receptor engagement. Higher cross-reactive SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG are observed in healthy elderly, while healthy children display elevated SARS-CoV-2 IgM, suggesting that children have fewer hCoV exposures, resulting in less-experienced but more polyreactive humoral immunity. Age-dependent analysis of COVID-19 patients, confirms elevated class-switched antibodies in elderly, while children have stronger Fc responses which we demonstrate are functionally different.

So far postmortem CT (PMCT) has not been used as a screening instrument for the evaluation of deaths with and without autopsy. In this respect, its validity has to be proved in comparison to clinical-radiological experiences. STANDARD RADIOLOGICAL METHODS: Postmortem CT METHODICAL INNOVATIONS: So far, PMCT can be regarded as a methodological innovation that has not yet been sufficiently evaluated for pneumonia. PERFORMANCE: CT in clinical routine has a high sensitivity for pneumonia. However, to what extent postmortem artifacts are relevant to PMCT still has to be determined. ACHIEVEMENTS: There is still no standard procedure for the postmortem radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 disease. Despite postmortem artifacts, PMCT can provide valuable information about the presence of pneumonia with interstitial character, especially without autopsy. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: PMCT is particularly useful in the assessment of suspected cases of COVID-19 pneumonia for morphological assessment in the context of monitoring deaths in the current pandemic situation.","Kniep, I; Lutter, M; Ron, A; Edler, C; Püschel, K; Ittrich, H; Heller, M; Heinemann, A",Radiologe,310,25

Despite extreme isolation, we show that the movement of people amongst a large number of small but isolated communities has the effect of causing transmission to spread quickly. Significant movement between remote communities, and regional and urban centres allows for infection to quickly spread to and then among these remote communities. Our conclusions are based on two characteristic features of remote communities in Western Australia: (1) high mobility of people amongst these communities, and (2) relatively high proportion of travellers from very small communities to major population centres. In models of infection initiated in the state capital, Perth, these remote communities are collectively and uniquely vulnerable.

It is caused by a new positive-sense RNA virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acid secondary structures involved in the control of a variety of biological processes including viral replication. Using several G4 prediction tools, we identified highly putative G4 sequences (PQSs) within the positive-sense (+gRNA) and negative-sense (-gRNA) RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 conserved in related betacoronaviruses. By using multiple biophysical techniques, we confirmed the formation of two G4s in the +gRNA and provide the first evidence of G4 formation by two PQSs in the -gRNA of SARS-CoV-2. Finally, biophysical and molecular approaches were used to demonstrate for the first time that CNBP, the main human cellular protein bound to SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, binds and promotes the unfolding of G4s formed by both strands of SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. Our results suggest that G4s found in SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome and its negative-sense replicative intermediates, as well as the cellular proteins that interact with them, are relevant factors for viral genes expression and replication cycle, and may constitute interesting targets for antiviral drugs development.","Bezzi, Georgina; Piga, Ernesto J; Binolfi, Andrés; Armas, Pablo",Int. j. mol. sci.

Altered renal function and lower magnesium levels have been reported to play important roles in the pathophysiology of T2D. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between renal function, serum magnesium levels and mortality in T2D patients with COVID-19. In this retrospective study, we characterized 118 T2D and non-diabetic subjects hospitalized with COVID-19. Patients were clinically characterized and electrolyte, renal function and inflammatory markers were evaluated. Patients were grouped according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2). T2D patients had lower eGFR and serum magnesium levels when compared to non-diabetics (59.7 ± 32.8 vs. 78.4 ± 33.8 mL/min per 1.73 m2, P = 0.008 and 1.9 ± 0.3 vs. 2.1 ± 0.3 mEq/L, P = 0.012). Survival was worse in T2D patients with eGFR levels less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 as estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses (log-rank test <0.0001). The Cox model for T2D patients showed that eGFR (HR 0.970, 95% CI 0.949 to 0.991, P = 0.005) and magnesium (HR 8.025, 95% CI 1.226 to 52.512, P = 0.030) were associated with significantly increased risk of death. Reduced eGFR and magnesium levels were associated with increased mortality in our population. These results suggest that early assessment of kidney function, including magnesium levels, may assist in developing effective treatment strategies to reduce morbidity and mortality among Latin American COVID-19 patients with T2D.","Pulido-Perez, Patricia; Pondigo-de Los Angeles, Jorge Alberto; Hernandez-Hernandez, Maria Elena; Torres-Rasgado, Enrique; Romero, Jose R",Magnes Res,310,16

Triterpenoids, a group of bioactive phytochemicals, have been tested for antibiofilm activity against model biofilm forming bacteria in recent times. In this context, glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA), representing three categorically distinct groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, are targeted for profiling their impact on Vibrio cholerae C6709 biofilms. The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. Albeit total extracellular proteolytic activity remained unaffected by the triterpenoids, GRA treatment resulted in considerable reduction of extracellular gelatinase activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated potential interaction with cyclic di-GMP sensor VpsT, autoinducer-2 sensor kinase LuxP-LuxQ and transcriptional activator HapR, components of complex quorum sensing networks modulating biofilm formation. Comprehensive analysis of antibiotic action revealed accentuation of cephalosporin antibiotics with GRA and UA while BA potentiated action of fluoroquinolones against biofilmed bacteria, widening the scope of combinatorial therapeutic strategy.","Bhattacharya, Sudipta Paul; Bhattacharya, Arijit; Sen, Aparna",Microb Pathog,310,16

With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is an important cause of death. Therefore, treatment of the cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome. If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients. Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) blocker that can effectively block the IL-6 signal transduction pathway and thus is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe COVID-19.","Zhang, Chi; Wu, Zhao; Li, Jia-Wen; Zhao, Hong; Wang, Gui-Qiang",Int J Antimicrob Agents,310,24

Through an online questionnaire, this survey explores teachers' experience of online teaching, the level of risk factors (e.g., stress) and protective factors (e.g., locus of control) and their impact on satisfaction levels during the social distancing. One hundred seven high school teachers from Lombardy, an Italian region very affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, participated. Results show that depression and stress are the main predictors of satisfaction levels for online teaching. In addition, coping, locus of control and self-efficacy emerge as important protective factors. Finally, although there is great satisfaction with the online teaching experience, critical elements emerged. This study is relevant because it describes the critical elements of the online teaching experience, and identifies some protective factors and the main risk factors in teachers operating in an area strongly marked by social restrictions imposed by the pandemic. High school teachers emerge as a sub-group of the general population with specific psychological reactions.

After a prolonged period of little to no transmission, there was an outbreak of unknown source in July, 2020, in the Da Nang region, but the outbreak was quickly suppressed. We aimed to use epidemiological, behavioural, demographic, and policy data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang to calibrate an agent-based model of COVID-19 transmission for Vietnam, and to estimate the risk of future outbreaks associated with reopening of international borders in the country. METHODS: For this modelling study, we used comprehensive data from June 15 to Oct 15, 2020, on testing, COVID-19 cases, and quarantine breaches within an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to model a COVID-19 outbreak in Da Nang in July, 2020. We applied this model to quantify the risk of future outbreaks in Vietnam in the 3 months after the reopening of international borders, under different behavioural scenarios, policy responses (ie, closure of workplaces and schools), and ongoing testing. FINDINGS: We estimated that the outbreak in Da Nang between July and August, 2020, resulted in substantial community transmission, and that higher levels of symptomatic testing could have mitigated this transmission. We estimated that the outbreak peaked on Aug 2, 2020, with an estimated 1060 active infections (95% projection interval 890-1280). If the population of Vietnam remains highly compliant with mask-wearing policies, our projections indicate that the epidemic would remain under control even if a small but steady flow of imported infections escaped quarantine into the community. However, if complacency increases and testing rates are relatively low (10% of symptomatic individuals are tested), the epidemic could rebound again, resulting in an estimated 2100 infections (95% projected interval 1050-3610) in 3 months. These outcomes could be mitigated if the behaviour of the general population responds dynamically to increases in locally acquired cases that exceed specific thresholds, but only if testing of symptomatic individuals is also increased. INTERPRETATION: The successful response to COVID-19 in Vietnam could be improved even further with higher levels of symptomatic testing. If the previous approaches are used in response to new COVID-19 outbreaks, epidemic control is possible even in the presence of low levels of imported cases.

This has affected the epidemiological behaviour of various pathologies. We analyze the impact of the pandemic on the number of admissions due to stroke, its severity and mortality in Santiago, Chile. Methods: a multicenter observational study based on the records of the 3 hospitals of the South East health service in Santiago, Chile. We recorded the number of patients admitted for ischemic stroke between 01 January 2020 and 30 June 2020. We grouped the cases into two periods, pre-pandemic and pandemic, according to the setting of the state of emergency in Chile. Results: 431 patients were admitted with ischemic stroke during the study period. There was a non-significant decrease in weekly admissions (17 vs 15 patients per week). No differences were observed in the proportion of patients with medical treatment (p = 0.810), IVT (p = 0.638), EVT (p = 0.503) or IVT + EVT (p = 0.501).

These results illustrate the considerable potential of SGDs as inhibitors in viral binding/entry of both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 pathogens, leading the way for further development of this class of molecules as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","Wells, Lauren; Vierra, Cory; Hardman, Janee039; Han, Yanxiao; Dimas, Dustin; Gwarada-Phillips, Lucia N; Blackeye, Rachel; Eggers, Daryl K; LaBranche, Celia C; Král, Petr; McReynolds, Katherine D",Adv Ther (Weinh),310,6

Here we applied innovative metrics to a physical neurosurgery trainer to explore whether these metrics differentiate between different levels of experience across different tasks. METHODS: Twenty-four participants (9 experts, 15 novices) performed 4 tasks (dissection, spatial adaptation, depth adaptation, and the A-B-A task) using the PsT1 training system. Four performance metrics (collision, precision, dissected area, and time) and 6 kinematic metrics (dispersion, path length, depth perception, velocity, acceleration, and motion smoothness) were collected. RESULTS: For all tasks, the execution time (t) of the experts was significantly lower than that of novices (P < 0.05). The experts performed significantly better in all but 2 of the other metrics, dispersion and sectional area, corresponding to the A-B-A task and dissection task, respectively, for which they showed a nonsignificant trend towards better performance (P = 0.052 and P = 0.076, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to differentiate between the skill levels of novices and experts according to parameters derived from the PsT1 platform, paving the way for the quantitative assessment of training progress using this system. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, neurosurgical simulators that gather surgical performance metrics offer a solution to the educational needs of residents.","Lorias-Espinoza, Daniel; González Carranza, Vicente; Pérez-Escamirosa, Fernando; Chico-Ponce de León, Fernando; Minor Martinez, Arturo; Gutiérrez-Gnecchi, Jose Antonio",World Neurosurg,310,26

Adjusting for other covariates, the human lifespan is positively associated with household wealth. However, the extent to which mortality in a geographical region is a function of socioeconomic factors in both that region and its neighbors is unclear. There is also little information on the temporal components of this relationship. Using the districts of Hong Kong over multiple census years as a case study, we demonstrate that there are differences in how wealth indicator variables are associated with longevity in (a) areas that are affluent but neighbored by socially deprived districts versus (b) wealthy areas surrounded by similarly wealthy districts. We also show that the inclusion of spatially-distributed variables reduces uncertainty in mortality rate predictions in each census year when compared with a baseline model. Our results suggest that geographic mortality models should incorporate nonlocal information (e.g., spatial neighbors) to lower the variance of their mortality estimates, and point to a more in-depth analysis of sociospatial spillover effects on mortality rates.","Alshaabi, Thayer; Dewhurst, David Rushing; Bagrow, James P.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan; Danforth, Christopher M.",,310,21

University Hospital Institute-Méditerranée Infection performs real-time surveillance of all diagnoses of infections and associated deaths in public hospitals in Marseille, Southeastern France. This study compared mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. In 2019-2020, 50 patients (0.10% of 49,043 patients hospitalized) died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus; seven and seven deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and RSV, respectively. Additionally, 55 patients died after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was thus significantly lower for common respiratory viruses in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.003), primarily as a consequence of a decrease in influenza A virus (-83%) and RSV (-46%)-associated deaths. Overall, the proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was higher, but not significantly, in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (214 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p = 0.08, Yates-corrected Chi-square test).

The present study aimed to investigate this changing pattern and the potential causes behind it at an academic neurology and neurosurgery center in Iran. METHODS: Patients admitted to our center with the diagnosis of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, between March 1, 2019, Jun 1, 2019, and the similar 3-month period in 2020 (COVID-19 pandemic period), were compared in terms of clinical characteristics and outcome. Poisson regression was also conducted to assess the correlation between daily admissions and the COVID-19 pandemic period. RESULTS: A total of 210 patients with stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) in 2019 were compared with 106 patients in 2020. COVID-19 pandemic period was significantly associated with the decline in the number of daily admissions in ischemic stroke (IRR, 0.51 [95% CI, 0.4-0.64]). A significant reduction (P = 0.003) in time from onset to arrival at hospital from median 12 h [IQR, 5-32] in 2019 to median 6 h [IQR, 4-16] in 2020 was found in ischemic stroke cases. National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was significantly increased (P < 0.001) from median 4 [IQR, 2-7] in 2019 to median 9 [IQR, 4-14] in 2020. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) was significantly decreased from 13.9 (SD, 2) in 2019 to 12.8 (SD, 2.9) in 2020 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided new pieces of evidence regarding the changed pattern of hospital admission in stroke especially the possible reasons for its decline.","Tavanaei, Roozbeh; Yazdani, Kaveh Oraii; Akhlaghpasand, Mohammadhosein; Zali, Alireza; Oraee-Yazdani, Saeed",Neurol Sci,310,14

Although the infection is mild in most of the affected individuals, it may cause severe clinical manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome or cytokine storm leading to death. Children are affected less, and most experience a milder disease. As rheumatologists, we deal with the uncontrolled response of the immune system, and most of the drugs we use are either immune modulators or immunosuppressants. Thus, the rheumatologists participate in the multidisciplinary management of COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, our patients with rheumatic diseases constitute a vulnerable group in this pandemic. In this review, a systematic literature search was conducted utilizing MEDLINE/PubMed and Scopus databases, and 231 COVID-19 patients with rheumatic diseases have been identified. Only one of these patients was a child. Among these, 9 (3.9%) died due to COVID-19. In light of the current data, the aspects of COVID-19 resembling rheumatic diseases, the possible reasons for why children are affected less severely, the hypothetic role of available vaccines in preventing COVID-19, the unique position of patients with rheumatic diseases in this pandemic, and the use of anti-rheumatic drugs in COVID-19 treatment are discussed.","Batu, Ezgi Deniz; Özen, Seza",Rheumatol Int,310,24

In this longitudinal study, self-selected UK adults (n=1,733) completed three online surveys (May-June, August-September and November-December 2020, with a retrospective pre-pandemic component in the baseline survey), self-reporting sociodemographics, lifestyle and behaviours, including high fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) snacks, HFSS meals and fruit and vegetable (FV) intake. Data were analysed using generalised estimating equations. Monthly HFSS snacks portion intake increased from pre-pandemic levels (48.3) in May-June (57.6, p<0.001), decreased in August-September (43.7, p<0.001), before increasing back to pre-pandemic levels in November-December (49.2, p<0.001). 48.5% self-reported increased (25.9 [95% confidence interval: 24.1, 27.8]) and 47.7% self-reported decreased (24.1 [22.4,26.0]) monthly HFSS snacks portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels. Monthly HFSS meals portion intake decreased from pre-pandemic levels (7.1) in May-June (5.9, p<0.001), being maintained in August-September (5.9, p=0.897), and then increasing again in November-December (6.6, p<0.001), to intakes that remained lower than pre-pandemic levels (p=0.007). 35.2% self-reported increased (4.8 [4.3, 5.3]) and 44.5% self-reported decreased (5.1 [4.6,5.6]) monthly HFSS meals portion intakes in November-December compared with pre-pandemic levels. The proportion meeting FV intake recommendations was stable from pre-pandemic through to August-September (70%), but decreased in November-December 2020 (67%, p=0.034). Increased monthly HFSS snacks intake was associated with female gender, lower quality of life, and - in a time-varying manner - older age and higher HFSS meals intake. Increased monthly HFSS meals intake was associated with female gender, living with adults only and higher HFSS snacks intake. Reduced FV intake was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) and lower physical activity. These results suggest large interindividual variability in dietary change during the first year of the pandemic, with important public health implications in individuals experiencing persistent increases in unhealthy diet choices, associated with BMI, gender, quality of life, living conditions, physical activity and other dietary behaviours.

COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has quickly spread around the globe. This pandemic demands rapid development of drugs and vaccines. Plant-based vaccines are a technology with proven viability, which have led to promising results for candidates evaluated at the clinical level, meaning this technology could contribute towards the fight against COVID-19. Herein, a perspective in how plant-based vaccines can be developed against COVID-19 is presented. Injectable vaccines could be generated by using transient expression systems, which offer the highest protein yields and are already adopted at the industrial level to produce VLPs-vaccines and other biopharmaceuticals under GMPC-processes. Stably-transformed plants are another option, but this approach requires more time for the development of antigen-producing lines. Nonetheless, this approach offers the possibility of developing oral vaccines in which the plant cell could act as the antigen delivery agent. Therefore, this is the most attractive approach in terms of cost, easy delivery, and mucosal immunity induction. The development of multiepitope, rationally-designed vaccines is also discussed regarding the experience gained in expression of chimeric immunogenic proteins in plant systems.","Rosales-Mendoza, Sergio; Márquez-Escobar, Verónica A.; González-Ortega, Omar; Nieto-Gómez, Ricardo; Arévalo-Villalobos, Jaime I.",Vaccines,310,28

METHODS: A retrospective study to review and compare clinical data including electronic medical records and laboratory tests from pregnant and nonpregnant patients admitted the Central Hospital of Wuhan, China from December 8, 2019 to April 1, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 72 women (30 pregnant and 42 nonpregnant) with COVID-19 were included. No patients developed severe pneumonia during the study. Compared with the nonpregnant group, pregnant patients were admitted to hospital earlier (0.25 vs 11.00 days; P<0.001), presented milder symptoms, had a higher rate of asymptomatic infection (26.7% vs 0%), and shorter length of hospital stay (14.5 vs 17.0 days; P<0.01). Laboratory test results showed that levels of inflammation markers such as white blood cell count, neutrophil count and percentage, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and D-dimer were significantly higher in pregnant women, whereas mean lymphocyte percentage was significantly lower compared with nonpregnant women. CONCLUSION: In some respects, the clinical characteristics and laboratory test results of COVID-19 in pregnant patients seems to be distinctive from their nonpregnant counterparts. Appropriate advice and positive treatment might be critical to the prognosis when dealing with these pregnant patients. Pregnant patients with COVID-19 had their own positive clinical characteristics and special laboratory test results.

The agent responsible was subsequently identified as a coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2. The WHO declared this disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern at the end of January 2020. This event evoked a sense of déjà vu, as it has many similarities to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of 2002-2003. Both illnesses were caused by a zoonotic novel coronavirus, both originated during winter in China and both spread rapidly all over the world. However, the case-fatality rate of SARS (9.6%) is higher than that of COVID-19 (<4%). Another zoonotic novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV, was responsible for the Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had a case-fatality rate of 34%. Our experiences in coping with the previous coronavirus outbreaks have better equipped us to face the challenges posed by COVID-19, especially in the health care setting. Among the insights gained from the past outbreaks were: outbreaks caused by viruses are hazardous to healthcare workers; the impact of the disease extends beyond the infection; general principles of prevention and control are effective in containing the disease; the disease poses both a public health as well as an occupational health threat; and emerging infectious diseases pose a continuing threat to the world. Given the perspectives gained and lessons learnt from these past events, we should be better prepared to face the current COVID-19 outbreak.","Koh, David; Goh, Hui Poh",J Occup Health,310,16

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are essential weapons that a patient with COVID-19 has to combat the disease. When now repurposing a drug, namely an aptamer that interacts with SARS-CoV-2 proteins for COVID-19 treatment (BC 007), which is, however, a neutralizer of pathogenic autoantibodies in its original indication, the possibility of also binding and neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies must be considered. Here, the highly specific virus-neutralizing antibodies have to be distinguished from the ones that also show cross-reactivity to tissues. The last-mentioned could be the origin of the widely reported SARS-CoV-2-induced autoimmunity, which should also become a target of therapy. We, therefore, used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technology to assess the binding of well-characterized publicly accessible anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (CV07-209 and CV07-270) with BC 007. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, isothermal calorimetric titration, and circular dichroism spectroscopy were additionally used to test the binding of BC 007 to DNA-binding sequence segments of these antibodies. BC 007 did not bind to the highly specific neutralizing anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody but did bind to the less specific one. This, however, was a lot less compared to an autoantibody of its original indication (14.2%, range 11.0-21.5%). It was also interesting to see that the less-specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody also showed a high background signal in the ELISA (binding on NeutrAvidin-coated or activated but noncoated plastic plate). These initial experiments suggest that the risk of binding and neutralizing highly specific anti-SARS CoV-2 antibodies by BC 007 should be low.","Haberland, Annekathrin; Krylova, Oxana; Nikolenko, Heike; Göttel, Peter; Dallmann, Andre; Müller, Johannes; Weisshoff, Hardy",Viruses,310,1

We made homotypic nanoparticles displaying the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 or co-displaying SARS-CoV-2 RBD along with RBDs from animal betacoronaviruses that represent threats to humans (mosaic nanoparticles; 4-8 distinct RBDs). Mice immunized with RBD-nanoparticles, but not soluble antigen, elicited cross-reactive binding and neutralization responses. Mosaic-RBD-nanoparticles elicited antibodies with superior cross-reactive recognition of heterologous RBDs compared to sera from immunizations with homotypic SARS-CoV-2-RBD-nanoparticles or COVID-19 convalescent human plasmas. Moreover, sera from mosaic-RBD-immunized mice neutralized heterologous pseudotyped coronaviruses equivalently or better after priming than sera from homotypic SARS-CoV-2-RBD-nanoparticle immunizations, demonstrating no immunogenicity loss against particular RBDs resulting from co-display.

Rapid global spread led to the Covid-19 pandemic. Rapid and accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 has become a vitally important tool in controlling the spread of the virus. Lateral flow devices (LFDs) offer the potential advantage of speed and on-site testing. The sensitivity of these devices compared to the gold standard RT-PCR has been questioned. We compared the performance of the Innova lateral flow kit, recommended by the UK government, with our rapid in-house RT-PCR protocol using stored positive patient samples. The LFD device was found to be 6,000-10,000 times less sensitive than RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, the LFD detected 46.2% of the positives detected by RT-PCR. 50% of the LFD results were observed to be weak positives, only visible after careful examination by experienced laboratory staff. At lower viral loads, such as 10,000-100,000 RNA copies/ml, the LFD detected 22.2% of positives. In addition, two strong positives (3 and 1.5 million RNA copies/ml) were not detected by the LFD. The argument for use of LFD kits, despite their lack of sensitivity, is that they detect infectious virus and hence contagious individuals. At present, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting this claim. The LFD used in the UK fails to identify individuals with considerable viral loads and has been subject to a class I recall by the US FDA but is still approved and recommended for use by the UK government. We believe that using LFD testing for assessing SARS-CoV-2 infection risk is a strategy which has risks that outweigh any benefits.","Taylor, Andrew; Calvez, Ronan MM; Atkins, Mark; Fink, Colin G",,310,20

The wellbeing and good preservation of monuments is a key factor to encourage again tourism. Historical monuments exposed to outdoor pollution are subjected to well known degradation phenomenon including the formation on their surface of black crusts (BCs) causing blackening and deterioration of the monuments and, as a consequence, a worst fruition by the visitors. The aim of this research is the development and validation of a novel method to characterize and quantify the various components present in the black crusts. SO2 together with the carbonaceous fraction (i.e. OC, organic carbon, and EC, elemental carbon) represent the main atmospheric pollutants involved in the process of BCs formation which consists in the partial transformation of the carbonate substrate into gypsum where black particles are embedded. A new methodology based on the use of TGA/DSC (Thermogravimetric Analysis/Differential scanning calorimetry) and CHN (Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen) analysis was set up allowing to determine organic carbon and elemental carbon together with other components such as gypsum. Four standard mixtures simulating BCs composition were prepared and analysed by the set-up methodology. The new procedure was subsequently applied to study real BCs samples taken from monuments and historical buildings placed in cities heavily affected by atmospheric pollution and by PCA (principal component analysis) their main features, from the point of view of carbonaceous fraction, were highlighted.","Comite, Valeria; Miani, Alessandro; Ricca, Michela; La Russa, Mauro; Pulimeno, Manuela; Fermo, Paola",Environ Res,310,16

The identification of infected individuals is vital to prevent the spread of illness to staff and other patients as well as to identify those who may be at risk for disease-related complications. This is particularly relevant with the resumption of elective orthopaedic surgery around the world. We report the results of a universal testing protocol for COVID-19 in patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery during the coronavirus pandemic and to describe the postoperative course of asymptomatic patients who were positive for COVID-19. METHODS: A retrospective review of adult operative cases between March 25, 2020, and April 24, 2020, at an orthopaedic specialty hospital in New York City was performed. Initially, a screening questionnaire consisting of relevant signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, shortness of breath) or exposure dictated the need for nasopharyngeal swab real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for all admitted patients. An institutional policy change occurred on April 5, 2020, that indicated nasopharyngeal swab RT-PCR testing for all orthopaedic admissions. Screening and testing data for COVID-19 as well as relevant imaging, laboratory values, and postoperative complications were reviewed for all patients. RESULTS: From April 5, 2020, to April 24, 2020, 99 patients underwent routine nasopharyngeal swab testing for COVID-19 prior to their planned orthopaedic surgical procedure. Of the 12.1% of patients who tested positive for COVID-19, 58.3% were asymptomatic. Three asymptomatic patients developed postoperative hypoxia, with 2 requiring intubation. The negative predictive value of using the signs and symptoms of disease to predict a negative test result was 91.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81.0% to 97.1%). Including a positive chest radiographic finding as a screening criterion did not improve the negative predictive value of screening (92.5% [95% CI, 81.8% to 97.9%]). CONCLUSIONS: A protocol for universal testing of all orthopaedic surgery admissions at 1 hospital in New York City during a 3-week period revealed a high rate of COVID-19 infections. Importantly, the majority of these patients were asymptomatic. Using chest radiography did not significantly improve the negative predictive value of screening. These results have important implications as hospitals anticipate the resumption of elective surgical procedures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic Level IV.

Here, we evaluated the ability of PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes. RESULTS: We first assembled an epitope dataset consisting of 844 unique virus-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes and their source proteins. We then analyzed cleavage predictions by PCPS immunoproteasome cleavage model on this dataset and compared them with those provided by a related method implemented by NetChop web server. PCPS was clearly superior to NetChop in term of sensitivity (0.89 vs. 0.79) but somewhat inferior with regard to specificity (0.55 vs. 0.60). Judging by the Mathew's Correlation Coefficient, PCPS predictions were overall superior to those provided by NetChop (0.46 vs. 0.39). We next analyzed the power of C-terminal cleavage predictions provided by the same PCPS model to discriminate CD8+ T cell epitopes, finding that they could be discriminated from random peptides with an accuracy of 0.74. Following these results, we tuned the PCPS web server to predict CD8+ T cell epitopes and predicted the entire SARS-CoV-2 epitope space. CONCLUSIONS: We report an improved version of PCPS named iPCPS for predicting proteasome cleavage sites and peptides with CD8+ T cell epitope features. iPCPS is available for free public use at https://imed.med.ucm.es/Tools/pcps/ .","Gomez-Perosanz, Marta; Ras-Carmona, Alvaro; Lafuente, Esther M; Reche, Pedro A",BMC Bioinformatics,310,0

The presence of a polybasic cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 spike at the S1/S2 boundary has been suggested to be a factor in the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 by facilitating maturation of the spike precursor by furin-like proteases in the producer cells rather than endosomal cathepsins in the target. We investigate the relevance of the polybasic cleavage site in the route of entry of SARS-CoV-2 and the consequences this has for sensitivity to interferons (IFNs) and, more specifically, the IFN-induced transmembrane (IFITM) protein family that inhibit entry of diverse enveloped viruses. We found that SARS-CoV-2 is restricted predominantly by IFITM2, rather than IFITM3, and the degree of this restriction is governed by route of viral entry. Importantly, removal of the cleavage site in the spike protein renders SARS-CoV-2 entry highly pH and cathepsin dependent in late endosomes, where, like SARS-CoV-1 spike, it is more sensitive to IFITM2 restriction. Furthermore, we found that potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication by type I but not type II IFNs is alleviated by targeted depletion of IFITM2 expression. We propose that the polybasic cleavage site allows SARS-CoV-2 to mediate viral entry in a pH-independent manner, in part to mitigate against IFITM-mediated restriction and promote replication and transmission. This suggests that therapeutic strategies that target furin-mediated cleavage of SARS-CoV-2 spike may reduce viral replication through the activity of type I IFNs.IMPORTANCE The furin cleavage site in the spike protein is a distinguishing feature of SARS-CoV-2 and has been proposed to be a determinant for the higher transmissibility between individuals, compared to SARS-CoV-1. One explanation for this is that it permits more efficient activation of fusion at or near the cell surface rather than requiring processing in the endosome of the target cell. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by antiviral membrane protein IFITM2 and that the sensitivity is exacerbated by deletion of the furin cleavage site, which restricts viral entry to low pH compartments. Furthermore, we find that IFITM2 is a significant effector of the antiviral activity of type I interferons against SARS-CoV-2 replication. We suggest that one role of the furin cleavage site is to reduce SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity to innate immune restriction, and thus, it may represent a potential therapeutic target for COVID-19 treatment development.","Winstone, Helena; Lista, Maria Jose; Reid, Alisha C; Bouton, Clement; Pickering, Suzanne; Galao, Rui Pedro; Kerridge, Claire; Doores, Katie J; Swanson, Chad M; Neil, Stuart J D",J. virol,310,20

Methods: A total of 108 COVID-19-positive medical staff patients were included in the study from March 23, 2020 to June 15, 2020. Patients were analyzed for demographic data, clinical presentations, and in-hospital outcomes and compared against 661 COVID-19-infected patients of non-medical personel. Results: Mean age of medical staff patients was 44.05±13.9 years, most of whom were women (63.9%). The infected medical staff members consisted of 63 nurses (58.3%), 37 physicians (34.3%), 5 technicians (4.6%), and 3 pharmacists (2.8%). Smoking (60.2%) was the most frequent, followed by diabetes mellitus (37%). Of 108 COVID-19 infected medical staff, 18 (16.6%) were isolated in the intensive care unit (ICU), of which 14 (77.8%) were male, 16 (88.9%) were smokers, and 16 (88.9%) presented with pneumonia.

The purpose of this follow-up, cross-sectional study was to investigate attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare among dental and nursing students and to compare them both between baseline and the completion of the education programme and between dental and nursing students to identify problems with oral healthcare programmes in dental education. METHOD: The subjects included 88 dental and 119 nursing students. The dental students participated in geriatric and preventive dentistry courses for oral healthcare education. The nursing students participated in independent oral healthcare courses comprising 45 h of training with case-based learning and were taught and instructed by multiple health professionals, including dentists. Questionnaires were distributed to the participants to compare attitudes, awareness, and perceptions regarding oral healthcare between baseline and the completion of the education programme and between dental and nursing students. A chi-square test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the data. RESULT AND CONCLUSION: The data of 48 (28 male and 20 female) dental students and 103 (9 male and 94 female) nursing students who completed the questionnaires both at baseline and after the education programme were used for the comparisons. After the education programme, more than 90% of the students were interested in oral healthcare practice; hoped to practise oral healthcare post-qualification; and perceived oral healthcare to be effective for preventing dental caries, periodontal diseases, and aspiration pneumonia. These attitudes and perceptions were statistically significantly improved after the education. However, the level of awareness of oral healthcare and the level of perception of the importance of collaboration with healthcare workers in oral healthcare practice after education were lower in the dental students than in the nursing students. Multi-professional oral healthcare education with case-based learning has the potential to improve awareness of oral healthcare and perceptions of the importance of collaborative oral healthcare practice.","Haresaku, Satoru; Umezaki, Yojiro; Egashira, Rui; Naito, Toru; Kubota, Keiko; Iino, Hidechika; Aoki, Hisae; Nakashima, Fuyuko",BMC Oral Health,310,20

It is unclear whether better access to coronavirus testing and more consistent use of testing could substantially reduce transmission. Objective: To describe coronavirus testing in persons with new onset of febrile illness and analyze whether there are changes over time and differences by race and ethnicity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study used data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, launched in March 2020, which recruited participants via press release, word-of-mouth, and partner organizations. Participants completed daily surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and weekly surveys about coronavirus testing. All adults (aged at least 18 years) with a smartphone were eligible to join. For this analysis, US participants with new onset of febrile illness from April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Data analysis was performed from November 2020 to March 2021. Main Outcomes and Measures: Receipt of a coronavirus test result within 7 days of febrile illness onset. Results: Of the 2679 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (13.4) years, 1983 were female (74%), 2017 were college educated (75%), and a total of 3865 distinct new febrile illness episodes were reported (300 episodes [7.8%] from Hispanic participants, 71 episodes [1.8%] from Black participants, and 3494 episodes [90.4%] from not Black, not Hispanic participants) between April 2 and October 23, 2020. In weekly surveys delivered during the 14 days after fever onset, 12% overall (753 participants) indicated receipt of a test result. Using serial survey responses and parametric time-to-event modeling, it was estimated that by 7 days after onset of febrile illness, a total of 20.5% (95% CI, 19.1%-22.0%) had received a test result. This proportion increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.0%) early in the epidemic to 24.1% (95% CI, 21.5%-26.7%) at the end of July, but testing rates did not substantially improve since then, increasing to 25.9% (95% CI; 21.6%-30.3%) in late October at the start of the winter surge.

It has long been known that atoms on a metallic surface have biased diffusion if electric fields are applied and that microscopic tips may be sharpened using fields, but the exact mechanisms have not been well understood. Our Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation model uses a recently developed theory for how the migration barriers are affected by the presence of an electric field. All parameters of the model are physically motivated and no fitting parameters are used. The model has been validated by reproducing characteristic faceting patterns of tungsten surfaces that have in previous experiments been observed to only appear in the presence of strong electric fields. The growth effect is found to be enhanced by increasing fields and temperatures.","Jansson, Ville; Baibuz, Ekaterina; Kyritsakis, Andreas; Vigonski, Simon; Zadin, Vahur; Parviainen, Stefan; Aabloo, Alvo; Djurabekova, Flyura",,310,16

Since its origin in China in December 2019, there is compelling evidence that novel SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible virus, and it is associated to a broad clinical spectrum going from subclinical presentation to severe respiratory distress and multiorgan failure. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 recognizes human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 as a cellular receptor that allows it to infect different host cells and likely disrupts renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system homeostasis. Particularly, a considerable incidence of many renal abnormalities associated to COVID-19 has been reported, including proteinuria, hematuria, and acute kidney injury. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 can infect podocytes and tubular epithelial cells, which could contribute to the development of the aforementioned renal abnormalities. In this review, we discuss the biological aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, how understanding current knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 infection may partly explain the involvement of the kidneys in the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and what questions have arisen and remain to be explored.","Martinez-Rojas, Miguel Angel; Vega-Vega, Olynka; Bobadilla, Norma A",Am J Physiol Renal Physiol,310,26

Because an early ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery is avoided due to low body weight and fragility of the patients, the neurosurgical treatment focuses on temporary solutions for CSF diversion as a minimally invasive approach. Neuroendoscopic lavage (NEL) was additionally introduced for early elimination of intraventricular blood components to reduce possible subsequent complications such as shunt dependency, infection, and multiloculated hydrocephalus. The authors report their first experience regarding neurodevelopmental outcome after NEL in this patient cohort. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective cohort study with 45 patients undergoing NEL, the authors measured neurocognitive development at 2 years with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 2nd Edition, Mental Developmental Index (BSID II MDI) and graded the ability to walk with the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS). They further recorded medication with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and quantified ventricular and brain volumes by using 3D MRI data sets. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were alive at 2 years of age. Eight of 27 patients (30%) assessed revealed a fairly normal neurocognitive development (BSID II MDI &#8805; 70), 28 of 36 patients (78%) were able to walk independently or with minimal aid (GMFCS 0-2), and 73% did not require AED treatment. Based on MR volume measurements, greater brain volume was positively correlated with BSID II MDI (rs = 0.52, 95% CI 0.08-0.79) and negatively with GMFCS (rs = -0.69, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.42). Based on Bayesian logistic regression, AED treatment, the presence of comorbidities, and also cerebellar pathology could be identified as relevant risk factors for both neurodevelopmental outcomes, increasing the odds more than 2-fold-but with limited precision in estimation. CONCLUSIONS: Neuromotor outcome assessment after NEL is comparable to previously published drainage, irrigation, and fibrinolytic therapy (DRIFT) study results. A majority of NEL-treated patients showed independent mobility. Further validation of outcome measurements is warranted in an extended setup, as intended by the prospective international multicenter registry for treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (TROPHY).","Behrens, Philine; Tietze, Anna; Walch, Elisabeth; Bittigau, Petra; Bührer, Christoph; Schulz, Matthias; Aigner, Annette; Thomale, Ulrich-Wilhelm",J Neurosurg Pediatr,310,16

The suitability of land in Lapseki for agriculture was evaluated by using an analytic hierarchy process. In the study, the basic parameters were determined by using the soil map and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. Land use capability classes, soil depth, erosion risk and other soil properties (limiting factors) were obtained from the soil map, while slope, elevation and aspect were obtained from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data. To determine the weight of the parameters in the analytic hierarchy process, the opinions of the public institutions and experts were obtained. The obtained data were analyzed with the analytic hierarchy process and mapped with geographic information systems techniques, and a land suitability map was generated. The agricultural land suitability map demonstrated that 2.95% (2557 ha) of the lands in the study area were highly suitable; 10.37% (8989 ha) were moderately suitable; 53.47% (46,336 ha) were marginally suitable; and 33.21% (28,775 ha) were not suitable for agricultural use. The data from the agricultural land suitability map were compared with the Coordination of Information on the Environment 2012 data. As a result of comparison, 14.12% (361 ha) of highly suitable lands for agriculture and 2.25% (202 ha) of moderate suitable lands for agriculture are urbanized. It was seen that 45.71% (24,837 ha) of the lands that are marginally suitable for agriculture and 18.76% (5397 ha) of the not suitable lands had current land use for agriculture.","Everest, T; Sungur, A; Özcan, H",Int J Environ Sci Technol (Tehran),310,24

METHODS: This was a retrospective study at 2 affiliated New York City hospitals located in the Upper East Side and Lower Manhattan neighborhoods. We performed case reviews using the Hospital Medicine Reengineering Network framework to determine potentially preventable readmissions among patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 3, 2020 (date of first case) and April 27, 2020, and readmitted to either of the 2 hospitals within 30 days of discharge. RESULTS: Among 53 readmissions after hospitalization for COVID-19, 44 (83%) were deemed not preventable and 9 (17%) were potentially preventable. Nonpreventable readmissions were mostly due to disease progression or complications of COVID-19 (37/44, 84%). Main factors contributing to potentially preventable readmissions were issues with initial disposition (5/9, 56%), premature discharge (3/9, 33%), and inappropriate readmission (1/9, 11%) for someone who likely did not require rehospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Most readmissions after a COVID-19 hospitalization were not preventable and a consequence of the natural progression of the disease, specifically worsening dyspnea or hypoxemia. Some readmissions were potentially preventable, mostly because of issues with disposition that were directly related to challenges posed by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

To contain spread of the virus, many nations introduced a public lockdown. How the pandemic itself and measures of social restriction affect hospital admissions due to acute cardiac events has rarely been evaluated yet. METHODS AND RESULTS: German public authorities announced measures of social restriction between March 21st and April 20th, 2020. During this period, all patients suffering from an acute cardiac event admitted to our hospital (N = 94) were assessed and incidence rate ratios (IRR) of admissions for acute cardiac events estimated, and compared with those during the same period in the previous three years (2017-2019, N = 361). Admissions due to cardiac events were reduced by 22% as compared to the previous years (n = 94 vs. an average of n = 120 per year for 2017-2019). Whereas IRR for STEMI 1.20 (95% CI 0.67-2.14) and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest IRR 0.82 (95% CI 0.33-2.02) remained similar, overall admissions with an IRR of 0.78 (95% CI 0.62-0.98) and IRR for NSTEMI with 0.46 (95% CI 0.27-0.78) were significantly lower. In STEMI patients, plasma concentrations of high-sensitivity troponin T at admission were significantly higher (644 ng/l, IQR 372-2388) compared to 2017-2019 (195 ng/l, IQR 84-1134; p = 0.02).

With developments within lamellar corneal graft surgery, the use of split corneal donor tissue to increase donor tissue supply seems a pragmatic solution to reduce the supply and demand mismatch. This is especially important with tissue supply expected to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature review of techniques was performed, enabling multiple transplants to be derived from a single donor and simulation of a model to quantify the number of corneas potentially saved. RESULTS: Studies on splitting corneal donor tissue have demonstrated that up to 5 recipients may benefit from 1 donor scleral button. The impact of splitting donor tissue may provide a saving of up to 25.3% of donor graft tissue.

An open-label, randomised controlled trial was conducted on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. A total of 55 patients in the control group receiving hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) were compared with 56 patients in the case group who in addition to the same regimen also received AZM. Patients with prior cardiac disease were excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients from the case group were assessed for cardiac arrythmia risk based on the American College of Cardiology (ACC) risk assessment for use of AZM and HCQ. The main outcome measures were vital signs, SpO2 levels, duration of hospitalisation, need for and length of intensive care unit admission, mortality rate and results of 30-day follow-up after discharge. Initially, there was no significant difference between the general conditions and vital signs of the two groups. The SpO2 levels at discharge were significantly higher, the respiratory rate was lower and the duration of admission was shorter in the case group. There was no significant difference in the mortality rate between the two groups. Patients who received AZM in addition to HCQ and LPV/r had a better general condition. HCQ+AZM combination may be beneficial for individuals who are known to have a very low underlying risk for cardiac arrhythmia based on the ACC criteria.","Sekhavati, Ehsan; Jafari, Fatemeh; SeyedAlinaghi, SeyedAhmad; Jamalimoghadamsiahkali, Saeidreza; Sadr, Sara; Tabarestani, Mohammad; Pirhayati, Mohammad; Zendehdel, Abolfazl; Manafi, Navid; Hajiabdolbaghi, Mahboubeh; Ahmadinejad, Zahra; Kouchak, Hamid Emadi; Jafari, Sirous; Khalili, Hosein; Salehi, Mohamadreza; Seifi, Arash; Golestan, Fereshteh Shahmari; Ghiasvand, Fereshteh",Int J Antimicrob Agents,310,20

This study evaluated the clinical features, surgical and antibiotics treatment strategies, and treatment outcomes in patients with endophthalmitis caused by liver abscess. METHODS: Between April 2014 and April 2019, the clinical data of 16 patients (19 eyes) with endophthalmitis associated with liver abscess who underwent surgery at Shengjing Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Furthermore, we evaluated the final visual outcomes in the patients to determine the efficacy of surgery. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (18 eyes) underwent intravitreal injection followed by vitrectomy after admission. One patient (1 eye) only underwent intravitreal injection. Of the 16 patients, 3 patients (3 eyes) had recurrent intraocular inflammation and eventually underwent evisceration. Systemic antibiotics were administered for all patients based on the results of vitreous humor culture, blood culture, and antibiotic susceptibility tests. Outpatient follow-ups were performed until the patients were stable (6 months). Of the 19 eyes, 1 eye (5%) had visual acuity restored to 20/200, 6 eyes (31%) had visual acuity restored to counting fingers (CF), 2 eyes (11%) had visual acuity restored to hand motion (HM), 4 eyes (22%) showed only light perception (LP), and the remaining 6 eyes (31%) showed no light perception (NLP). Drug susceptibility tests suggested that the carbapenems exhibited significant effects in the inflammatory reaction. CONCLUSION: Endogenous endophthalmitis caused by liver abscess is a very serious condition, and the final visual outcome is poor. Timely surgical intervention combined with antibiotic treatment is essential, and the primary disease must be treated to control disease progression at the earliest.","Wang, Yue; Wang, Xue; Di, Yu",BMC Infect Dis,310,30

The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of dietary advice (DA) on the food intake of wheelchair basketball athletes (WBA) and the environmental impact longitudinally. Methods: DA were provided to WBA of the Italian national team (DAM-T1). Nutritional assessment and evaluation of the environmental impact of diet were performed two months (DAM-T2) and one year later (DAM-T3), when a post-COVID-19 survey was performed also in WBA who did not receive counselling (men: NDAM-T3, women: NDAW-T3). Results: After DA, WBA showed a reduced percentage of energy derived from sugars and fats. Athletes adjusted their protein intake according to the personalized recommendations. The intake of some micronutrients improved after DA and was higher compared to NDAM-T3 and NDAW-T3. Despite the lower impact of diet in NDAW-T3, they presented more nutritional deficiency than men. The mean intake of vegetables was in the range of the EAT-Lancet Commission suggestion only two months after DA. After DA, fiber intake increased and adapted to the tolerated level.

473351,473351,473351,Virtual Mega-Meetings: Here to Stay?,13.706937,4.588445,2021,"Background Cardiac troponin is one of the most important biomarkers in cardiology. Traditionally, it has represented a biochemical sign of necrosis, a characteristic of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, with the arrival of high-sensitivity detection assays, cardiac troponin is now detected in healthy people and in a number of uncommon scenarios unrelated to AMI (such as strenuous exercise, rapid atrial pacing and COVID-19). This suggest that troponin could be released as a consequence of alternative processes other than the well-stablished necrotic cell death. To try to explain this phenomenon, multiple mechanisms of troponin release have been postulated, although there is still no consensus on this matter. Furthermore, the term myocardial injury was included in the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction. This entity is understood as a troponin determination above the upper reference limit, not necessarily associated with a specific diagnosis. Nonetheless, the histological or pathobiological process responsible of myocardial injury has not been determined. Here, we studied the possibility of troponin release through non-classical secretion, a pathway specially triggered by cellular stress and inflammation. Methods The protein sequences of the eight different isoforms of troponin (I, T and C of fast-twitch skeletal, slow-twitch skeletal and cardiac muscle) were retrieved from the UniProtKB database. SecretomeP 2.0, a neural networks-based program, was used to predict if any of these proteins undergoes non-classical release. SignalP 5.0 and TMHMM 2.0 were also applied to rule out the possibility of classical (endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi dependent) and Type IV (transmembrane) non-classical secretion. Results and Discussion After analyzing the sequences, the cardiac T isoform was predicted to be non-classically secreted, as well as the I, T and C subunits of the fast-twitch skeletal muscle and the I subunit of the slow-twitch skeletal muscle. Additionally, none of the troponin isoforms was found to be subject to classical or Type IV secretion. The present study provides in silico evidence of cardiac troponin T release by means of non-classical secretion. We believe that this potential new mechanism could contribute to the debate around cardiac troponin high-sensitivity assays. Thus, it might establish a theoretical frame capable of explaining troponin elevations by causes other than myocyte necrosis. Conclusions Troponin T secretion may help in the pathobiological definition of myocardial injury. There are already some experimental studies showing the release of troponin through extracellular microvesicles (a type of non-classical secretion) in various cell lines. Nonetheless, more work is needed to fully understand this intriguing phenomenon in cardiomyocytes.","Gonzalez-Rayas, Jose Hernandez-Hernandez Jose Lopez-Sanchez Rosa Rayas-Gomez Ana Gonzalez-Yanez Jose Jerjes-Sanchez Carlos",The FASEB Journal,310,0

The aim of this study is to determine the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases in Turkey. And also to determine the risk factors associated with intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the characteristics of the confirmed COVID-19 cases who applied to a University Hospital in Turkey between March 19th and June 11th, 2020, were analyzed. Variables such as epidemic trend, case fatality rate, need for hospitalization, ICU admission rate, and ICU mortality were calculated. In addition, risk factors affecting ICU admission and death were determined by logistic regression analysis. Results: 19.8% of 654 cases participating in the study were asymptomatic at admission. ICU admission rate was 7.6% and case fatality rate found to be 7.8%. Age, male gender, and cancer were associated with ICU admission. Each 1-unit increase in age increased ICU admissions by 8% (OR: 1.08;CI: 1.06-1.10). Men had a 2.71 times higher risk of ICU admission (OR: 2.71;CI: 1.37-5.39);and cancer patients showed 3.72 (OR: 3.72;CI: 1.35-10.20) times more ICU admissions (p&lt;0.05). Age, cancer, and ICU admission were associated with death. Each 1-unit increase in age increased the risk of death by 10% (OR: 1.10;CI: 1.06-1.15). The risk of death was found to be 5.22 times higher in cancer patients (OR: 5.22;GA: 1.09-24.89) and 87.42 times higher in those admitted to ICU (OR: 87.42;GA: 30.15-153.46) (p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: It was revealed that the course of the disease worsens, and deaths increase with age. Male gender has been associated with the increased need for intensive care.

India reported its first case on 30th January 2020 and has completed 100 days in this pandemic period. The government of India has issued stringent guidelines and imposed a lockdown for long periods to ensure the practising of social distancing. This paper reviews and discusses the current trends in the confirmed cases of India in comparison with the other prominent countries around the globe. A novel approach using a sigmoid function to predict and forecast the trends for cases in India are also presented in this work. By placing the current time on the sigmoid curve, forecasting the total number of confirmed cases by the end of the pandemic is made. If proper measures and stringent guidelines are not followed, India may have to endure a total confirmed case of up to 4.4 lakh. The prediction also suggests that 99.9% of the pandemic may end in India by 27th July 2020. The best possible approach is to undertake preventive measures by strictly adhering to the guidelines and policies set by the government. Performing hand hygiene, practicing social distancing, surveillance and isolation is the only means to break the chain of transmission and control the pandemic.","Gouda, Sheetal; Naveen, G.; Kukanur, F.

STUDY DESIGN: In a 2-year cohort study of 1700 publicly insured women who delivered at 8 hospitals in Texas, we identified those who had an unmet demand for tubal ligation prior to discharge from the hospital. We classified unmet demand as explicit or prompted based on survey questions that included a prompt regarding whether the respondent would like to have had a tubal ligation at the time of delivery. We assessed persistence of demand for permanent contraception, contraceptive use, and repeat pregnancies among all study participants who wanted but did not get a postpartum procedure. RESULTS: Some 426 women desired a postpartum tubal ligation; 219 (51%) obtained one prior to discharge. Among the 207 participants with unmet demand, 62 (30%) expressed an explicit preference for the procedure, while 145 (70%) were identified from the prompt. Most with unmet demand still wanted permanent contraception 3 months after delivery (156/184), but only 23 had obtained interval procedures. By 18 months, the probability of a woman with unmet demand conceiving a pregnancy that she would likely carry to term was 12.5% (95% CI: 8.3%-18.5%). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation among publicly insured women in Texas was uncovered via a prompt and would not have been evident in clinical records or from consent forms. Women unable to obtain a desired procedure had a substantial chance of pregnancy within 18 months after delivery. IMPLICATIONS: Estimates of unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation based on clinical records and consent forms likely underestimate desire for permanent contraception. Among low-income women in Texas, those with unmet demand for postpartum tubal ligation require improved access to effective contraception.","Potter, Joseph E; Burke, Kristen L; Broussard, Kathleen; Hopkins, Kristine; Grossman, Daniel; White, Kari",Contraception,310,16

In addition to its valuable protection, wearing facial mask can affect verbal communication in an adverse fashion and makes mutual understanding difficult. This happens because the mask eliminates the positive effect of the lip-reading phenomenon in direct communications. The mirror neuron system is responsible for automatic imitation, associative sequence learning, and motor mimicry. This system is a strong candidate justifying an unexpected action described in this article. PURPOSE: Taking the facial mask off, to help the listener understanding better is a normal reaction. However, unexpectedly, one does the same as the listener when he/she is unable to comprehend the speaker. Herein, we suggest a hypothesis proposing the basic role of Mirror neuron system in this action. Most of the research on these cells have been conducted on monkeys, where the researchers observed that, these neuron discharge pulses both when a monkey performs an action and when it observes another monkey or a person committing the similar action. CONCLUSION: The driving mechanism of an unanticipated action of taking off mask while listening to a speaker is emphasized in this paper. Herein, we try to clarify how we came up with the idea that mirror neuron system drives a surprising action observed in COVID-19 pandemics days.

Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum aqueous extracts were prepared based on ayurvedic principles, tested for phytochemicals, and examined for biofilm inhibiting potential on methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains alone or in fixed-dose combination. Both Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum extracts were detected with alkaloids, flavonoids, glycosides, sugars and protein. The crude extracts maximally inhibited biofilm formation of MRSA1 at 60-70%. The concentrated extract of Azadirachta indica dose-dependently inhibited the biofilm formation of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and –resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA1 and MRSA2) with maximum inhibition of 67, 50 and 45% respectively. Likewise, Ocimum sanctum extract also exhibited maximum biofilm inhibition of 48, 35 and 45% respectively. Further, combination of the concentrated extracts of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum exhibited a very significant biofilm inhibition of &gt; 80% in both sensitive and resistant strains. The combination of Azadirachta indica and Ocimum sanctum extracts prepared as per ayurvedic principles is effective in inhibiting biofilm formation of MSSA and MRSA. This finding may also be experimented further with pathogens like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acetanobacter baumanii for anti-biofilm activity. Also, this combination can be used as an organic disinfectant in place of synthetic sanitizers since the former can eradicate the pathogens colonized in the environmental surfaces to avoid co-infection in situations like COVID-19 pandemic.","Sood, Sanchit; Davis, Joseph",Int.

Lopinavir is the main responsible for viral load suppression, whereas ritonavir is a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Both of them have recently gained relevance as candidate drugs against severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19). However, significant beneficial effects were not observed in randomized clinical trials. This review summarizes the main physical-chemical, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacokinetic properties of ritonavir and lopinavir, along with the analytical methodologies applied for biological matrices, pharmaceutical formulations, and stability studies. The work also aimed to provide a comprehensive impurity profile for the combined formulation. Several analytical methods in four different pharmacopeias and 37 articles in literature were evaluated and summarized. Chromatographic methods for these drugs frequently use C8 or C18 stationary phases with acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (with ultraviolet detection) or acetate buffer (with tandem mass spectrometry detection) as the mobile phase. Official compendia methods show disadvantages as extended total run time and complex mobile phases. HPLC tandem-mass spectrometry provided high sensitivity in methodologies applied for human plasma and serum samples, supporting the therapeutic drug monitoring in HIV patients. Ritonavir and lopinavir major degradation products arise in alkaline and acidic environments, respectively. Other non-chromatographic methods were also summarized. Establishing the impurity profile for the combined formulation is challenging due to a large number of impurities reported. Easier and faster analytical methods for impurity assessment are still needed.","Velozo, Carolina Trajano; Cabral, Lucio Mendes; Pinto, Eduardo Costa; de Sousa, Valéria Pereira",Crit Rev Anal Chem,310,16

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of the widely used antiparasitic drug ivermectin on outcomes in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial, patients with COVID-19 admitted to 2 referral tertiary hospitals in Mazandaran, Iran, were randomly divided into 2 groups: intervention and control. In addition to standard treatment for COVID-19, the intervention group received a single weight-based dose (0.2 mg/kg) of ivermectin; the control group received the standard of care. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data from participants were recorded at baseline. Patients were assessed daily for symptoms and disease progression. The primary clinical outcome measures were the durations of hospital stay, fever, dyspnea, and cough; and overall clinical improvement. FINDINGS: Sixty-nine patients were enrolled (mean [SD] ages: ivermectin, 47.63 [22.20] years; control, 45.18 [23.11] years; P = 0.65). Eighteen patients (51.4%) in the ivermectin group and 18 (52.9%) in control group were male (P = 0.90). The mean durations of dyspnea were 2.6 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group and 3.8 (0.4) days in the control group (P = 0.048). Also, persistent cough lasted for 3.1 (0.4) days in the ivermectin group compared to 4.8 (0.4) days in control group (PP = 0.019). The mean durations of hospital stay were 7.1 (0.5) days versus 8.4 (0.6) days in the ivermectin and control groups, respectively (P = 0.016). Also, the frequency of lymphopenia decreased to 14.3% in the ivermectin group and did not change in the control group (P = 0.007). IMPLICATIONS: A single dose of ivermectin was well-tolerated in symptomatic patients with COVID-19, and important clinical features of COVID-19 were improved with ivermectin use, including dyspnea, cough, and lymphopenia. Further studies with larger sample sizes, different drug dosages, dosing intervals and durations, especially in different stages of the disease, may be useful in understanding the potential clinical benefits ivermectin.

Clinical factors and laboratory assays to streamline plasma donor selection, and the durability of nAb responses, are incompletely understood.METHODSPotential convalescent plasma donors with virologically documented SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for serum IgG against SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 domain and against nucleoprotein (NP), and for nAb.RESULTSAmong 250 consecutive persons, including 27 (11%) requiring hospitalization, who were studied a median of 67 days since symptom onset, 97% were seropositive on 1 or more assays. Sixty percent of donors had nAb titers &#8805;1:80. Correlates of higher nAb titers included older age (adjusted OR [AOR] 1.03 per year of age, 95% CI 1.00-1.06), male sex (AOR 2.08, 95% CI 1.13-3.82), fever during illness (AOR 2.73, 95% CI 1.25-5.97), and disease severity represented by hospitalization (AOR 6.59, 95% CI 1.32-32.96). Receiver operating characteristic analyses of anti-S1 and anti-NP antibody results yielded cutoffs that corresponded well with nAb titers, with the anti-S1 assay being slightly more predictive. nAb titers declined in 37 of 41 paired specimens collected a median of 98 days (range 77-120) apart (P < 0.001). Seven individuals (2.8%) were persistently seronegative and lacked T cell responses.CONCLUSIONnAb titers correlated with COVID-19 severity, age, and sex. SARS-CoV-2 IgG results can serve as useful surrogates for nAb testing. Functional nAb levels declined, and a small proportion of convalescent individuals lacked adaptive immune responses.FUNDINGThe project was supported by the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research with support from the NIAID under contract number 75N91019D00024, and was supported by the Fred Hutchinson Joel Meyers Endowment, Fast-Grants, a New Investigator award from the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, and NIH contracts 75N93019C0063, 75N91019D00024, and HHSN272201800013C, and NIH grants T32-AI118690, T32-AI007044, K08-AI119142, and K23-AI140918.","Boonyaratanakornkit, Jim; Morishima, Chihiro; Selke, Stacy; Zamora, Danniel; McGuffin, Sarah; Shapiro, Adrienne E; Campbell, Victoria L; McClurkan, Christopher L; Jing, Lichen; Gross, Robin; Liang, Janie; Postnikova, Elena; Mazur, Steven; Lukin, Vladimir V; Chaudhary, Anu; Das, Marie K; Fink, Susan L; Bryan, Andrew; Greninger, Alex L; Jerome, Keith R; Holbrook, Michael R; Gernsheimer, Terry B; Wener, Mark H; Wald, Anna; Koelle, David M",J. clin. invest,310,1

METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study was performed on children diagnosed with leukodystrophies in Peking University First Hospital from January 2004 to June 2019, and the patients were followed for 5.5 years (0.4-14.2 years) after the first visit. RESULTS: A total of 333 patients were included. The overall incidence of epilepsy was 30.6% (102/333). Alexander disease had the highest incidence (77.3%, 51/66), followed by vanishing white matter disease (41.2%, 21/51), Canavan disease (33.3%, 1/3), megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (32.1%, 9/28), X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (23.1%, 3/13), Krabbe disease (18.8%, 3/16), metachromatic leukodystrophy (14.3%, 6/42), and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (7.0%, 8/114). The incidence of epilepsy in leukodystrophies classified as astrocytopathies was higher than that in myelin disorders (55.9% vs. 11.2%, P < 0.001). Of the 102 patients with epilepsy, seizures were the chief complaint in 61.8% (63/102) and the initial symptom in 22.5% (23/102). The median age at seizure onset was 20.5 months (1 day-176 months). A total of 63.7% (65/102) of children were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), and the responder rate was 90.8% (59/65) at the last follow-up, including 71.2% (42/59) of children who were seizure free. CONCLUSIONS: Epilepsy was not uncommon in children with leukodystrophies. Children with Alexander disease had the highest incidence; whereas, children with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease had the lowest incidence. Children with leukodystrophies classified as astrocytopathies were more prone to have epilepsy than those classified as myelin disorders. Most children with leukodystrophies who presented with epilepsy showed a good response to antiepileptic drugs.","Zhang, Jie; Ban, Tingting; Zhou, Ling; Ji, Haoran; Yan, Huifang; Shi, Zhen; Cao, Binbin; Jiang, Yuwu; Wang, Jingmin; Wu, Ye",J. neurol,310,29

Growth rates of new cases form the empirical basis for estimates of a variety of reproduction numbers, dimensionless numbers whose value, when larger than unity, describes surging infections and generally worsening epidemiological conditions. Typically, these determinations rely on noisy or incomplete data gained over limited periods of time, and on many parameters to estimate. This paper examines how estimates from data and models of time-evolving reproduction numbers of national COVID-19 infection spread change by using different techniques and assumptions. Given the importance acquired by reproduction numbers as diagnostic tools, assessing their range of possible variations obtainable from the same epidemiological data is relevant. We compute control reproduction numbers from Swiss and Italian COVID-19 time series adopting both data convolution (renewal equation) and a SEIR-type model. Within these two paradigms we run a comparative analysis of the possible inferences obtained through approximations of the distributions typically used to describe serial intervals, generation, latency and incubation times, and the delays between onset of symptoms and notification. Our results suggest that estimates of reproduction numbers under these different assumptions may show significant temporal differences, while the actual variability range of computed values is rather small.","Pasetto, Damiano; Lemaitre, Joseph C; Bertuzzo, Enrico; Gatto, Marino; Rinaldo, Andrea",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,310,24

In this paper, we present Merlin, a workflow framework to enable large ML-friendly ensembles of scientific HPC simulations. By augmenting traditional HPC with distributed compute technologies, Merlin aims to lower the barrier for scientific subject matter experts to incorporate ML into their analysis. In addition to its design, we describe some example applications that Merlin has enabled on leadership-class HPC resources, such as the ML-augmented optimization of nuclear fusion experiments and the calibration of infectious disease models to study the progression of and possible mitigation strategies for COVID-19.","Peterson, J.

Descriptive, &#967; 2, and multiple regression tests were used to analyze survey data using SPSS, whereas NVivo v12 was used for thematic analysis of qualitative data. States with complete lockdown had 72.4% of respondents complying fully with the policy compared with 44.2% of respondents in zones with the partial lockdown. Market places, classified as high-risk zones, were the most visited (n = 505; 71.0%). Though compliance was influenced by the nature of lockdown enforced (&#967; 2 = 70.385, df = 2; p < 0.05), being a female, a widow, and unemployed were associated with increased compliance. Exposure to COVID-19 was associated with being married, unemployed, and having no income. Fear, anxiety, and misperception play major roles in compliance. The authors conclude that compliance is not uniform and a more nuanced and targeted approach is required as the government continues to respond to the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Akeju, David O; Adejoh, Samuel O; Fakunmoju, Ayoola J; Allsop, Matthew J; Ebenso, Bassey; Tade, Titilayo; Okusanya, Babasola O",,310,25

Angiotensin (Ang)-(1-7), an end-product of RAS, is recognized by its cardiovascular protective properties through stimulation of the Mas receptor, including vasodilation, anti-inflammatory, and antihypertensive actions, and consequently, counter-regulating the well-known Ang II-elicited actions. The overall hypothesis of this study is that Ang-(1-7) inhibits Ang II-induced ERK1/2 activation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), via regulation of mitogen-activated protein phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) activity. Aortas from male Wistar rats were incubated with Ang-(1-7) or vehicle. Concentration-response curves to Ang II were performed in endothelium-denuded aortas, in the presence or absence of ERK1/2 (PD98059) inhibitor or Mas receptor (A-779) antagonist. Expression of proteins was assessed by western blot, and immunohistochemistry was conducted in VSMCs. Ang-(1-7) incubation decreased Ang II-induced contractile response in aortas, and this effect was not observed in the presence of PD98059 or A-779. Stimulation of VSMCs with Ang-(1-7) prevented Ang II-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not C-Raf-activation. Furthermore, Ang II decreased MKP-1 phosphorylation in VSMCs. Interestingly, simultaneous incubation of Ang-(1-7) with Ang II favored MKP-1 phosphorylation, negatively modulating ERK1/2 activation in VSMCs. The results suggest that Ang-(1-7) counter-regulates actions evoked by Ang II overproduction, as observed in cardiovascular diseases, mainly by modulating MKP-1 activity. This evidence suggests that the role of Ang-(1-7) in MKP-1-regulation represents a target for new therapeutic development.","Sousa-Lopes, Alejandra; de Freitas, Raiany Alves; Carneiro, Fernando Silva; Nunes, Kenia Pedrosa; Allahdadi, Kyan James; Webb, Robert Clinton; Tostes, Rita de Cassia; Giachini, Fernanda Regina; Lima, Victor Vitorino",Int J Mol Cell Med,310,16

We then established coarse-grained models using the shape-based coarse-graining approach based on the protein crystal structures and extracted the force field parameters from the all-atom simulation trajectories. To further analyze the coarse-grained models, we carried out normal mode analysis of the coarse-grained models to refine the force field parameters by matching the fluctuations of the internal coordinates with the original all-atom simulations. Finally, we demonstrated the capability of these coarse-grained models by simulating the endocytosis of a whole coronavirus through the host cell membrane. We embedded the coarse-grained models of spikes on the surface of the virus envelope and anchored ACE2 receptors on the host cell membrane, which is modeled using a one-particle-thick lipid bilayer model. The coarse-grained simulations show the spike proteins adopt bent configurations due to their unique flexibility during their interaction with the ACE2 receptors, which makes it easier for them to attach to the host cell membrane than rigid spikes. © Copyright © 2021 Leong, Voleti and Peng.","Leong, T.; Voleti, C.; Peng, Z.",Frontiers in Physics,310,24

Currently, observations within US contexts are lacking; therefore, we report on the rapid implementation of telepsychiatry and workflow experiences in a psychiatric practice based within a large health care system in southeast Texas with a national catchment area. We discuss the logistics of the implementation, including modes of communication, scheduling, coordination, and capacity; the psychological effects of web-based services, including both the loss of the physical therapeutic environment and the unique interpersonal dynamics experienced in the virtual environment; and postadoption patterns of engagement with our services and with other clinical functions affected by the rapid adaptation to telemedicine. Our art therapy group programming serves as an applied case study, demonstrating the value of a well-managed web-based program (eg, patients were receptive and well-engaged, and they appreciated the continuity of accessible service) as well as the challenges (eg, the need for backup plans and technological fallbacks, managing interruptions and telecommunication learning curves, and working around the difference in resources for art and music therapy between a well-stocked clinical setting versus clients' home spaces). We conclude from our experience that the overall strengths of telepsychiatry include receptive and well-engaged responses from patients as well as the expansion of boundaries, which provides a directly contextualized view into patients' home lives. Challenges and corresponding recommendations include the need for more careful safety planning for high-risk patients; maintaining professional boundaries in the newly informal virtual setting; designing the physical space to both frame the patient encounter and maintain work-life balance for the therapist; allowing for delays and interruptions (including an initial acclimation session); and preserving interprofessional care team collaboration when the physical locations that normally facilitate such encounters are not accessible. We believe that careful observations of the strengths and challenges of telepsychiatry during this pandemic will better inform practices that are considering telepsychiatry adoption both within pandemic contexts and more broadly thereafter.","Sasangohar, Farzan; Bradshaw, Major R; Carlson, Marianne Millen; Flack, James N; Fowler, James C; Freeland, Diana; Head, John; Marder, Kate; Orme, William; Weinstein, Benjamin; Kolman, Jacob M; Kash, Bita; Madan, Alok",J Med Internet Res,310,1

Most COVID-19 patients suffer from lung infection, so one important diagnostic method is to screen chest radiography images, e.g., X-Ray or CT images. However, such examinations are time-consuming and labor-intensive, leading to limited diagnostic efficiency. To solve this issue, AI-based technologies, such as deep learning, have been used recently as effective computer-aided means to improve diagnostic efficiency. However, one practical and critical difficulty is the limited availability of annotated COVID-19 data, due to the prohibitive annotation costs and urgent work of doctors to fight against the pandemic. This makes the learning of deep diagnosis models very challenging. To address this, motivated by that typical pneumonia has similar characteristics with COVID-19 and many pneumonia datasets are publicly available, we propose to conduct domain knowledge adaptation from typical pneumonia to COVID-19. There are two main challenges: 1) the discrepancy of data distributions between domains; 2) the task difference between the diagnosis of typical pneumonia and COVID-19. To address them, we propose a new deep domain adaptation method for COVID-19 diagnosis, namely COVID-DA. Specifically, we alleviate the domain discrepancy via feature adversarial adaptation and handle the task difference issue via a novel classifier separation scheme. In this way, COVID-DA is able to diagnose COVID-19 effectively with only a small number of COVID-19 annotations. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of COVID-DA and its great potential for real-world applications.","Zhang, Yifan; Niu, Shuaicheng; Qiu, Zhen; Wei, Ying; Zhao, Peilin; Yao, Jianhua; Huang, Junzhou; Wu, Qingyao; Tan, Mingkui",,310,21

DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study (March 16, 2020 to May 8, 2020). SETTING: Academic long-term chronic care facility (Boston, MA). PARTICIPANTS: Long-term care residents. METHODS: Patient characteristics and clinical symptoms were obtained via electronic medical records and Minimum Data Set. Staff residence was inferred by zip codes. COVID-19 infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing using nasopharyngeal swabs. Residents were followed until discharge from facility, death, or up to 21 days. Risks of COVID-19 infection were modeled by generalized estimating equation to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of patient characteristics and staff community of residence. RESULTS: Overall 146 of 389 (37.5%) long-stay residents tested positive for COVID-19. At the time of positive test, 66 of 146 (45.5%) residents were asymptomatic. In the subsequent illness course, the most common symptom was anorexia (70.8%), followed by delirium (57.6%). During follow-up, 44 (30.1%) of residents with COVID-19 died. Mortality increased with frailty (16.7% in pre-frail, 22.2% in moderately frail, and 50.0% in frail; P < .001). The proportion of residents infected with COVID-19 varied across the long-term care units (range: 0%â90.5%). In adjusted models, male sex (RR 1.80, 95% CI 1.07, 3.05), bowel incontinence (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.10, 3.52), and staff residence remained significant predictors of COVID-19. For every 10% increase in the proportion of staff living in a high prevalence community, the risk of testing positive increased by 6% (95% CI 1.04, 1.08). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Among long-term care residents diagnosed with COVID-19, nearly one-half were asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Predictors of COVID-19 infection included male sex, bowel incontinence, and staff residence in a community with a high burden of COVID-19. Universal testing of patients and staff in communities with high COVID-19 rates is essential to mitigate outbreaks.","Shi, Sandra M; Bakaev, Innokentiy; Chen, Helen; Travison, Thomas G; Berry, Sarah D",J Am Med Dir Assoc,310,15

Thus, RNA cap methylation is an attractive target for antiviral discovery and development of new live attenuated vaccines. For coronaviruses, RNA cap structure is first methylated at the guanine-N-7 (G-N-7) position by nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14), which facilitates and precedes the subsequent ribose 2'-O methylation by the nsp16-nsp10 complex. Using porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus, as a model, we showed that G-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) of PEDV nsp14 methylated RNA substrates in a sequence-unspecific manner. PEDV nsp14 can efficiently methylate RNA substrates with various lengths in both neutral and alkaline pH environments and can methylate cap analogs (GpppA and GpppG) and single-nucleotide GTP but not ATP, CTP, or UTP. Mutations to the S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) binding motif in the nsp14 abolished the G-N-7 MTase activity and were lethal to PEDV. However, recombinant rPEDV-D350A with a single mutation (D350A) in nsp14, which retained 29.0% of G-N-7 MTase activity, was viable. Recombinant rPEDV-D350A formed a significantly smaller plaque and had significant defects in viral protein synthesis and viral replication in Vero CCL-81 cells and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-DQ). Notably, rPEDV-D350A induced significantly higher expression of both type I and III interferons in IPEC-DQ cells than the parental rPEDV. Collectively, our results demonstrate that G-N-7 MTase activity of PEDV modulates viral replication, gene expression, and innate immune responses.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses (CoVs) include a wide range of important human and animal pathogens. Examples of human CoVs include severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the most recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Examples of pig CoVs include porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), and swine enteric alphacoronavirus (SeACoV). There are no vaccines or antiviral drugs for most of these viruses. All known CoVs encode a bifunctional nsp14 protein which possesses ExoN and guanine-N-7 methyltransferase (G-N-7 MTase) activities, responsible for replication fidelity and RNA cap G-N-7 methylation, respectively. Here, we biochemically characterized G-N-7 MTase of PEDV nsp14 and found that G-N-7 MTase-deficient PEDV was defective in replication and induced greater responses of type I and III interferons. These findings highlight that CoV G-N-7 MTase may be a novel target for rational design of live attenuated vaccines and antiviral drugs.","Lu, Yunjian; Cai, Hui; Lu, Mijia; Ma, Yuanmei; Li, Anzhong; Gao, Youling; Zhou, Jiyong; Gu, Howard; Li, Jianrong; Gu, Jinyan",J. virol,310,16

Youth with preexisting psychopathologies (including anxiety and depression) and neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder) could be especially vulnerable to disturbed sleep during this period of change and uncertainty.

However, the clinical symptoms of most SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are not significantly different from those of common respiratory viral infections. Therefore, knowing the epidemiological patterns of common respiratory viruses may be valuable to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of patients with suspected COVID-19, especially in Southwest China (a mild epidemic area). METHODS: A total of 2188 patients with clinically suspected of COVID-19 in Southwest China were recruited from January 21 to February 29, 2020. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs and sputum specimens were collected to detect SARS-CoV-2 by using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other 12 viruses via PCR fragment analysis combined with capillary electrophoresis. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test findings were acquired from electronic medical records. All data were analyzed to unravel the epidemiological patterns. RESULTS: Only 1.1% (24/2188) patients with suspected COVID-19 were eventually confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the most frequently observed symptoms were fever (75.0%, 18/24) and cough (20.8%, 5/24). The overall detection rate of other respiratory pathogens was 10.3% (226/2188). Among them, human rhinovirus (3.2%, 71/2188), human parainfluenza viruses (1.6%, 35/2188), influenza B virus (1.2%, 26/2188) and mycoplasma pneumonia (1.2%, 26/2188) were the predominantly detected pathogens in this study. Moreover, the co-infection was observed in 22 specimens. Notably, one COVID-19 case had a coexisting infection with human parainfluenza virus (4.2%, 1/24) and bocavirus was the most common virus tending to occur in co-infection with other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the epidemiological features of common respiratory viruses and their clinical impact during the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in a mild epidemic area. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the transmission patterns of the common respiratory virus in COVID-19 regions, which can provide information support for the development of appropriate treatment plans and health policies, while eliminating unnecessary fear and tension.","Si, Yanjun; Zhao, Zhenzhen; Chen, Rong; Zhong, Huiyu; Liu, Tangyuheng; Wang, Minjin; Song, Xingbo; Li, Weimin; Ying, Binwu",BMC Infect Dis,310,16

Purpose To evaluate cardiac involvement in participants who had recovered from COVID-19 without clinical evidence of cardiac involvement by using cardiac MRI. Materials and Methods This prospective observational cohort study included 40 participants who had recovered from COVID-19 with moderate (n = 24) or severe (n = 16) pneumonia and who had no cardiovascular medical history, were without cardiac symptoms, had normal electrocardiograms, had normal serologic cardiac enzyme levels, and had been discharged for more than 90 days between May and September 2020. Demographic characteristics were recorded, serum cardiac enzyme levels were measured, and cardiac MRI was performed. Cardiac function, native T1, extracellular volume fraction (ECV), and two-dimensional (2D) strain were quantitatively evaluated and compared with values in control subjects (n = 25). Comparisons among the three groups were performed by using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni-corrected post hoc comparisons (for normal distribution) or Kruskal-Wallis tests with post hoc pairwise comparisons (for nonnormal distribution). Results Forty participants (mean age, 54 years ± 12 [standard deviation]; 24 men) were enrolled; participants had a mean time between admission and cardiac MRI of 158 days ± 18 and between discharge and cardiac MRI examination of 124 days ± 17. There were no left or right ventricular size or functional differences between participants who had recovered from COVID-19 and healthy control subjects. Only one (3%) participant had positive late gadolinium enhancement located at the mid inferior wall. Global ECV values were elevated in participants who had recovered from COVID-19 with moderate or severe pneumonia compared with those in healthy control subjects (median ECV, 29.7% vs 31.4% vs 25.0%, respectively; interquartile range, 28.0%-32.9% vs 29.3%-34.0% vs 23.7%-26.0%, respectively; P < .001 for both). The 2D global left ventricular longitudinal strain was reduced in both groups of participants (moderate COVID-19 group, -12.5% [interquartile range, -15.5% to -10.7%]; severe COVID-19 group, -12.5% [interquartile range, -15.4% to -8.7%]) compared with the healthy control group (-15.4% [interquartile range, -17.6% to -14.6%]) (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively).

Patients may have an increased risk of cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Our objective was to analyze clinical and neuroimaging characteristics of patients with ischemic CVA during the pandemic peak in our region, in order to identify atypical presentations. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of patients admitted under code-stroke protocol to our center with a final diagnosis of ischemic brain infarction. We analyzed the main imaging and demographic characteristics and reviewed neuroimaging for atypical presentations. RESULTS: One-hundred patients with confirmed ischemic CVA were included. Nineteen had positive polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 on admission. These patients had a lower prevalence of proximal arterial occlusion on imaging, higher in-hospital mortality, and worse baseline disability. No differences were identified in affected vascular territory, volume of infarction, initial CT stroke score, prevalence of hemorrhagic transformation, gender, age, cardiovascular risk factors, time to admission, symptom severity on entry, or decision to treat with thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Prevalence of COVID-19 in our code-stroke sample was higher than that for our province during this time period. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 group had more in-hospital mortality, less proximal arterial occlusion on CT or MR angiography, and lower baseline modified Rankin Scale score. We suggest a possibly higher proportion of microangiopathic involvement or undetected distal large-vessel occlusion in the COVID-19 stroke group. Excess mortality was explained by severe respiratory failure. Otherwise, stroke patients with COVID-19 did not differ demographically or clinically from those without the illness.","Naval-Baudin, Pablo; Rodriguez Caamaño, Isabel; Rubio-Maicas, Cecilia; Pons-Escoda, Albert; Fernández Viñas, Maria Montserrat; Nuñez, Ana; Cardona, Pere; Majos, Carles; Cos, Monica; Calvo, Nahum",j. neuroimaging,310,16

METHODS: A web-based COVID-19 survey was emailed to 26,045 patients followed in the Division of Rheumatology at a single center in New York City. Women aged 18 to 50 were asked about pregnancy. We compared the COVID-19 experience between pregnant and non-pregnant women, and also explored the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and perinatal outcomes. RESULTS: Of 7,094/26,045 respondents, 1,547 were women aged 18 to 50, with 61 (4%) reporting being pregnant during the pandemic. The prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was similar in pregnant and non-pregnant women (8% vs.9% respectively, p=0.76). Among women with COVID-19, pregnant women had shorter duration of symptoms (p <0.01) and were more likely to experience loss of smell or taste (p=0.02) than non-pregnant women. Approximately three-fourths of women had a systemic rheumatic disease, with no differences when stratified by pregnancy or COVID-19 status. 67% of pregnant women noted changes to prenatal care during the pandemic, and 23% of postpartum women stated the pandemic affected delivery. CONCLUSION: Among women followed in the Division of Rheumatology at a major center in New York City, pregnancy was not associated with increased self-reported COVID-19. Pregnancy was associated with a shorter duration of COVID-19 symptoms and a higher prevalence of loss of smell or taste.

From November 2019 till February 2021, this virus infected nearly 104 million, with more than two million deaths and about 25 million active cases. This has prompted scientists to discover effective drugs to combat this pandemic. Area covered: Drug repurposing is the magic bullet for treating severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Therefore, several drugs have been investigated in silico, in vitro, as well as through human trials such as anti-SARS-CoV2 agents, or to prevent the complications resulting from the virus. In this review, the mechanisms of action of different therapeutic strategies are summarized. According to the WHO, different classes of drugs can be used, including anti-malarial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and anti-coagulant drugs, as well as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, antibiotics, vitamins, zinc, neutralizing antibodies, and convalescent plasma therapy. Recently, there are some vaccines which are approved against SARS-CoV2. Expert opinion: A complete understanding of the structure and function of all viral proteins that play a fundamental role in viral infection, which contribute to the therapeutic intervention and the development of vaccine in order to reduce the mortality rate.

Here, we explored 61,485 sequences of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a potent diagnostic and prophylactic target, for identifying the mutations to review their roles in real-time polymerase chain reaction based diagnosis and observe consequent impacts. Compared to the Wuhan reference strain, a total of 1034 unique nucleotide mutations were identified in the mutant strains (49.15%, n = 30,221) globally. Of these mutations, 367 occupy primer binding sites including the 3'-end mismatch to the primer-pair of 11 well-characterized primer sets. Noteworthily, CDC (USA) recommended the N2 primer set contained a lower mismatch than the other primer sets. Moreover, 684 amino acid (aa) substitutions were located across 317 (75.66% of total aa) unique positions including 82, 21, and 83 of those in the RNA binding N-terminal domain (NTD), SR-rich region, and C-terminal dimerization domain, respectively. Moreover, 11 in-frame deletions, mostly (n = 10) within the highly flexible linker region, were revealed, and the rest was within the NTD region. Furthermore, we predicted the possible consequence of high-frequency mutations (&#8805;20) and deletions on the tertiary structure of the N protein. Remarkably, we observed that a high frequency (67.94% of mutated sequences) co-occuring mutations (R203K and G204R) destabilized and decreased overall structural flexibility. The N protein of SARS-CoV-2 comprises an average of 1.2 mutations per strain compared to 4.4 and 0.4 in Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and SARS-CoV, respectively. Despite being proposed as the alternative target to spike protein for vaccine and therapeutics, the ongoing evolution of the N protein may challenge these endeavors, thus needing further immunoinformatics analyses. Therefore, continuous monitoring is required for tracing the ongoing evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 N protein in prophylactic and diagnostic interventions.","Rahman, M Shaminur; Islam, M Rafiul; Alam, A S M Rubayet Ul; Islam, Israt; Hoque, M Nazmul; Akter, Salma; Rahaman, Md Mizanur; Sultana, Munawar; Hossain, M Anwar",J. med. virol,310,1

Much of our understanding of SARS-CoV pathogenesis comes from in vitro experiments. Unfortunately, in vitro experiments cannot replicate all the complexity of the in vivo infection. For example, proteases in the respiratory tract cleave the SARS-CoV surface protein to facilitate viral entry, but these proteases are not present in vitro. Unfortunately, proteases might also have an effect on other parts of the replication cycle. Here, we use mathematical modeling to estimate parameters characterizing viral replication for SARS-CoV in the presence of trypsin or elastase, and in the absence of either. In addition to increasing the infection rate, the addition of trypsin and elastase causes lengthening of the eclipse phase duration and the infectious cell lifespan.","Rodriguez, Thalia; Dobrovolny, Hana M",Virus Res,310,16

This study aimed to identify whether evaluation by cardiologists could reduce mortality in MINS patients. METHODS: From a single-centre retrospective cohort, we enrolled a total of 5633 adult patients diagnosed with MINS between January 2010 and June 2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on evaluation by cardiologist, which was defined as a cardiology consultation or transfer to the cardiology department. For the outcome, 30-day mortality was compared in crude and propensity-score matched populations. RESULTS: Of a total of 5633 patients, 2120 (37.6%) were evaluated by cardiologists and 3513 (62.4%) were not. Mortality during the first 30 days after surgery was significantly lower in MINS patients who were evaluated by cardiologists compared with those who were not (5.8% vs 8.3%; HR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.51 to 0.80; p<0.001 for all-cause mortality and 1.6% vs 2.0; HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.40 to 0.96; p=0.03 for cardiovascular mortality). The propensity score matched analysis showed similar results (5.6% vs 8.6%; HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.81; p<0.001 for all-cause mortality and 1.3% vs 2.2%; HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.95; p=0.03 for cardiovascular mortality).

TCMSP and TCMIP V2.0 server were used to predict all chemical components and action targets of Qingwen Baidu Yin. Diseases that could be treated by Qingwen Baidu Yin were predicted through Enrichr database. A compound target interaction(PPI) network diagram was constructed using STRING 11.0. OmicShare was used to analyzed the gene ontology(GO) enrichment and enrichment of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes(KEGG) pathway of core targets. Component-target-path network diagram was constructed with Cytoscape 3.6.0 software. After analysis of the database, 267 compounds were screened for Qingwen Baidu Yin, involving 1 450 targets, and a protein interaction network was constructed. Total 219 core target proteins were predicted, such as NFKB1, STAT1, RAF1, IL2, JAK1, IL6, TNF, BCL2 and other important targets, and 221 core target pathways were enriched, including cancer pathway, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus infection, chemokine signal pathway, PI3 K-AKT signal pathway, EB virus infection, virus carcinogenesis and T cell receptor signaling pathways, a collection of which were highly related to cytokine storms. GO annotation analysis suggested that Qingwen Baidu Yin Decoction may exert therapeutic effects by regulating protein phosphorylation, cell response to cytokine stimulation, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways. This study revealed potential active components of Qingwen Baidu Yin in defending against cytokine storm and its possible mechanism of action, and provided theoretical basis and technical support for further clinical application of this prescription.","Zhang, Feng-Rong; Zhu, Na; Li, Zhi-Yong; Tang, Shi-Huan",Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,310,28

With quarantine and social distancing restrictions, school closures, and recreational venues suspended or providing reduced access, the social safety net for violence prevention has been disrupted significantly. Impacts include the concerns of underreporting and increased risk of child abuse and neglect, as well as challenges in operating CPSs and keeping their workforce safe. OBJECTIVE: The current discussion paper explored the impact of COVID-19 on child maltreatment reports and CPS responses by comparing countries using available population data. METHOD: Information was gathered from researchers in eight countries, including contextual information about the country's demographics and economic situation, key elements of the CPS, and the CPS response to COVID-19. Where available, information about other factors affecting children was also collected. These data informed a discussion about between-country similarities and differences. RESULTS: COVID-19 had significant impact on the operation of every CPS, whether in high- income or low-income countries. Most systems encountered some degree of service disruption or change. Risk factors for children appeared to increase while there were often substantial deficits in CPS responses, and in most countries there was at a temporary decrease in CM reports despite the increased risks to children. CONCLUSIONS: The initial data presented and discussed among the international teams pointed to the way COVID-19 has hampered CPS responses and the protection of children more generally in most jurisdictions, highlighting that children appear to have been at greater risk for maltreatment during COVID-19.","Katz, Ilan; Katz, Carmit; Andresen, Sabine; Bérubé, Annie; Collin-Vezina, Delphine; Fallon, Barbara; Fouché, Ansie; Haffejee, Sadiyya; Masrawa, Nadia; Muñoz, Pablo; Priolo Filho, Sidnei R; Tarabulsy, George; Truter, Elmien; Varela, Natalia; Wekerle, Christine",Child Abuse Negl,310,1

The requirement to wear a facemask whenever in public places is one of such laws. As such, the demand for such masks has escalated across the world and this predisposition has presented a manufacturing challenge to the developing countries, which have limited capacity to meet the demand for their large populations. In developing countries such as Kenya, the citizens are now required to wear facemasks when in public places such as markets, streets, shopping malls, etc. With limited supply of the proper facemasks in the developing countries, the public is left to improvise them from the available resources. Alternatively, they purchase substandard facemasks from uncertified suppliers and sellers. The purchased masks do not meet the required health standards in most cases. In Kenya, for example, the government has been discouraging citizens from using N95 respirators and instead preserve them for medical practitioners due to their rarity and incapacity to manufacture them. The government has certified several textile industries to produce facemasks for the public from non-woven fabric materials. The challenge with such a move is that there has been an influx of an assortment of facemasks in the Kenyan market and it is not possible for the citizens to identify the safe ones. In this short communication, a brief description of the challenges facing the citizens in terms of access to and quality of face masks in developing countries, with a case study of Kenya is provided. Furthermore, a proposed design solution and a proof of concept of a low-cost and reusable 3D printed facemask for developing economies is herein presented.

Specialists in psychological first aid, in charge to develop and manage these hotlines, had to face an unknown situation, very different from the disasters for which they prepare themselves. Since the pandemic and the associated physical distancing was a potential threat to social cohesion, one could make the hypothesis that, by setting up hotlines, these professionals sought to reintroduce a form of proximity and to care for and cultivate the social connections among people. The pressure, feelings of emergency, anxious anticipation and expectation of the political authorities and the population, may all have favored the development of these structures. Other factors certainly also played a role, such as the need to be useful and to exist as professional, or the need to act in order to reduce anxiety related to the pandemic.

AIM: In this study we aimed at the dynamic change of peripheral lymphocyte and subsets during COVID-19 covery. METHODS: The peripheral lymphocyte and subsets of 95 confirmed cases with COVID-19 from baseline to four weeks were compared between critical illness and non-critical illness cases with or without DM. RESULTS: The dynamic characteristics of lymphocyte and subsets in COVID-19 patients was that it reduced significantly at one week, rapidly elevated to the peak at two weeks after onset, then gradually declined during recovery. The COVID-19 critical illness patients with DM had the lowest decline at one week and the slow lowest rise at two weeks after onset, while COVID-19 non-critical illness patients with DM had the rapid highest rise at two weeks after onset, both of them had similar lymphocyte and subsets at five weeks after onset and lower than those patients without DM. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a reference for clinicians that for COVID-19 patients with DM and the lowest decline of lymphocyte and subsets, immunomodulatory therapy as soon as possible might avoid or slow down disease progression; moreover for COVID-19 critical illness patients with or without DM and non-critical illness patients with DM, continuous immunomodulatory therapy in later stages of disease might speed up virus clearance, shorten hospital stay, improve disease prognosis in COVID-19 critical illness patients with DM.","Liu, Dafeng; Lan, Lijuan; Luo, Dongxia; Zhao, Bennan; Wei, Guo; He, Yinsheng; Zhang, Renqing; Liu, Yaling",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,310,16

Its intense politicization constantly made headlines, especially regarding the use of face masks as a safety precaution. However, the extent to which public opinion is polarized on wearing masks has remained anecdotal and the verbal representation of this polarization has not been explored. This study examined the types, themes, temporal trends, and exchange patterns of hashtags about mask wearing posted from March 1 to August 1, 2020 by Twitter users based in the United States. On the one hand, we found a stark rhetorical polarization in terms of semantic antagonism between pro- and anti-mask hashtags, exponential frequency increases of both types of hashtags during the period under study, in parallel to growing COVID-19 case counts, state mask mandates, and media coverage. On the other hand, the results showed an asymmetric participatory polarization in terms of a predominance of pro-mask hashtags along with an ""echo chamber"" effect in the dominant pro-mask group, which ignored the subversive rhetoric of the anti-mask minority. Notwithstanding the limitations of the research, this study provides a nuanced account of the digital polarization of public opinion on mask wearing. It draws attention to political polarization both as a rhetorical phenomenon and as a participatory process.","Lang, Jun; Erickson, Wesley W; Jing-Schmidt, Zhuo",PLoS One,310,24

In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm to rank pre-trained DNNs by applying a straightforward distance-based complexity measure named Separation Index (SI) to the target dataset. For this purpose, at first, a background about the SI is given and then the automated ranking algorithm is explained. In this algorithm, the SI is computed for the target dataset which passes from the feature extracting parts of pre-trained DNNs. Then, by descending sort of the computed SIs, the pre-trained DNNs are ranked, easily. In this ranking method, the best DNN makes maximum SI on the target dataset and a few pre-trained DNNs may be rejected in the case of their sufficiently low computed SIs. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by using three challenging datasets including Linnaeus 5, Breast Cancer Images, and COVID-CT. For the two first case studies, the results of the proposed algorithm exactly match with the ranking of the trained DNNs by the accuracy on the target dataset. For the third case study, despite using different preprocessing on the target data, the ranking of the algorithm has a high correlation with the ranking resulted from classification accuracy.","Kalhor, Mostafa; Kalhor, Ahmad; Rahmani, Mehdi",,310,16

Using three well-established models of cervical cancer natural history adapted to simulate screening across four countries, we compared the impact of a range of standardised screening disruption scenarios in four countries that vary in their cervical cancer prevention programs. All scenarios assumed a 6- or 12-month disruption followed by a rapid catch-up of missed screens. Cervical screening disruptions could increase cervical cancer cases by up to 5-6%. In all settings, more than 60% of the excess cancer burden due to disruptions are likely to have occurred in women aged less than 50 years in 2020, including settings where women in their 30s have previously been offered HPV vaccination. Approximately 15-30% of cancers predicted to result from disruptions could be prevented by maintaining colposcopy and precancer treatment services during any disruption period. Disruptions to primary screening had greater adverse effects in situations where women due to attend for screening in 2020 had cytology (vs. HPV) as their previous primary test. Rapid catch-up would dramatically increase demand for HPV tests in 2021, which it may not be feasible to meet because of competing demands on the testing machines and reagents due to COVID tests. These findings can inform future prioritisation strategies for catch-up that balance potential constraints on resourcing with clinical need.","Smith, Megan A; Burger, Emily A; Castanon, Alejandra; de Kok, Inge M C M; Hanley, Sharon J B; Rebolj, Matejka; Hall, Michaela T; Jansen, Erik E L; Killen, James; O039,; Farrell, Xavier; Kim, Jane J; Canfell, Karen",Prev Med,310,14

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a total of 43 COVID-19-confirmed patients (24 men and 19 women, 49.90 ± 18.70 years) and 41 influenza-confirmed patients (17 men and 24 women, 61.53 ± 19.50 years). Afterwards, the chest CT findings were recorded and 3 radiologists recorded their diagnoses of COVID-19 or of H1N1 influenza based on the CT findings. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical symptom in patients with COVID-19 and H1N1 pneumonia were dyspnea (96.6%) and cough (62.5%), respectively. The CT findings showed that the COVID-19 group was characterized by GGO (88.1%), while the influenza group had features such as GGO (68.4%) and consolidation (66.7%). Compared to the influenza group, the COVID-19 group was more likely to have GGO (88.1% vs. 68.4%, pâ¯=â¯0.032), subpleural sparing (69.0% vs. 7.7%, p <0.001) and subpleural band (50.0% vs. 20.5%, pâ¯=â¯0.006), but less likely to have pleural effusion (4.8% vs. 33.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.001).

Although machine learning techniques have shown promise in solving such problems, existing approaches substantially lack sample efficiency. We introduce an improved method for efficient black-box optimization, which performs the optimization in the low-dimensional, continuous latent manifold learned by a deep generative model. In contrast to previous approaches, we actively steer the generative model to maintain a latent manifold that is highly useful for efficiently optimizing the objective. We achieve this by periodically retraining the generative model on the data points queried along the optimization trajectory, as well as weighting those data points according to their objective function value. This weighted retraining can be easily implemented on top of existing methods, and is empirically shown to significantly improve their efficiency and performance on synthetic and real-world optimization problems.","Tripp, Austin; Daxberger, Erik; Hern'andez-Lobato, Jos'e Miguel",,310,30

The traditional framework of capacity assessment depends on the patient's ability to weigh risks and benefits, but this framework is of limited utility in context of the COVID-19 pandemic;the personal benefits of testing for the patient are unclear and in fact may not outweigh the risk of being declined psychiatric care. Moreover, classic capacity assessment does not well account for physicians' obligations to other patients and the public health.

The aim of this study was to explore whether hypertension is an independent risk factor for critical COVID-19 and mortality. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched until November 2020. Combined odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence interval (CIs) were calculated by using random-effect models, and the effect of covariates was analyzed using the subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis. A total of 24 observational studies with 99,918 COVID-19 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The proportions of hypertension in critical COVID-19 were 37% (95% CI: 0.27 -0.47) when compared with 18% (95% CI: 0.14 -0.23) of noncritical COVID-19 patients, in those who died were 46% (95%CI: 0.37 -0.55) when compared with 22% (95% CI: 0.16 -0.28) of survivors. Pooled results based on the adjusted OR showed that patients with hypertension had a 1.82-fold higher risk for critical COVID-19 (aOR: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.19 - 2.77; P = 0.005) and a 2.17-fold higher risk for COVID-19 mortality (aOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.67 - 2.82; P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis results showed that male patients had a higher risk of developing to the critical condition than female patients (OR: 3.04; 95%CI: 2.06 - 4.49; P < 0.001) and age >60 years was associated with a significantly increased risk of COVID-19 mortality (OR: 3.12; 95% CI: 1.93 - 5.05; P < 0.001). Meta-regression analysis results also showed that age (Coef. = 2.3×10-2, P = 0.048) had a significant influence on the association between hypertension and COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this meta-analysis suggested that hypertension was independently associated with a significantly increased risk of critical COVID-19 and inhospital mortality of COVID-19.","Du, Yanbin; Zhou, Nan; Zha, Wenting; Lv, Yuan",Nutr Metab Cardiovasc Dis,310,1

OBJECTIVE: To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiologic, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based antigen testing. DESIGN: A simple compartmental epidemic model that estimated viral transmission, portrayed disease progression, and forecast resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES: Parameter values and ranges as informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. population. TIME HORIZON: 60 days. PERSPECTIVE: Societal; costs included testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION: Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative infections and deaths, number of persons isolated and hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 11.6 million infections, 119 000 deaths, and $10.1 billion in costs ($6.5 billion in inpatient care and $3.5 billion in lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing would avert 2.8 million infections and 15 700 deaths, increasing costs by $22.3 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.5 billion) and workdays lost ($14.0 billion), yielding incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of $7890 per infection averted and $1 430 000 per death averted. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios, with large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations. Costs per death averted are roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5 to $17 million). LIMITATIONS: Analysis was restricted to at-home testing. There are uncertainties concerning test performance. CONCLUSION: High-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 with an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.

Patients infected with COVID-19 may present with a series of conditions. A considerable number of patients express taste and smell disturbances as a prodromal, coexistent, or as the only manifestation of COVID-19 infection. The objective of the present review is to review the hypothetical mechanisms of action and etiopathogenesis of dysgeusia in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple scientific databases were explored, including PubMed, Medline, Scopus, Cochrane-library, LILACS, Livivo and OpenGrey. All types of articles that discussed the pathogenesis of dysgeusia were included, while articles that described dysgeusia without detail about its mode of action were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 47 articles, with different designs, were included in this review. These articles suggested direct viral neural invasion to olfactory and gustatory nerves, viral cytotoxicity to taste buds, angiotensin II imbalance, augmented pro-inflammatory cytokines, and disturbances in salivary glands and sialic acid. COVID-19 induced-dysgeusia was also associated with systemic diseases, medications, zinc, chemicals, and disinfectants. CONCLUSIONS: The most likely cause of transient dysgeusia in COVID-19 is peripheral neurotropism and direct toxicity to taste buds or olfactory epithelium. Other factors may also play a contributory role in dysgeusia, such as a defect in the quality and quantity of saliva, pro-inflammatory cytokines, angiotensin II accumulation, systemic diseases, hypozincemia, and excessive use of chemicals.","Mahmoud, M M; Abuohashish, H M; Khairy, D A; Bugshan, A S; Khan, A M; Moothedath, M M",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,310,10

Genomic epidemiology has emerged as a valuable tool to understand introductions and spread of the virus in a specific geographic location. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the sequences of 59 SARS-CoV-2 samples from inhabitants of the Colombian Amazonas department. The viral genomes were distributed in two robust clusters within the distinct GISAID clades GH and G. Spatial-temporal analyses revealed two independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 in the region, one around April 1, 2020 associated with a local transmission, and one around April 2, 2020 associated with other South American genomes (Uruguay and Brazil). We also identified ten lineages circulating in the Amazonas department including the P.1 variant of concern (VOC). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study represents the first genomic epidemiology investigation of SARS-CoV-2 in one of the territories with the highest report of indigenous communities of the country. Such findings are essential to decipher viral transmission, inform on global spread and to direct implementation of infection prevention and control measures for these vulnerable populations, especially, due to the recent circulation of one of the variants of concern (P.1) associated with major transmissibility and possible reinfections.","Ballesteros, Nathalia; Muñoz, Marina; Patiño, Luz Helena; Hernández, Carolina; González-Casabianca, Felipe; Carroll, Iván; Santos-Vega, Mauricio; Cascante, Jaime; Angel, Andrés; Feged-Rivadeneira, Alejandro; Palma-Cuero, Mónica; Flórez, Carolina; Gomez, Sergio; van de Guchte, Adriana; Khan, Zenab; Dutta, Jayeeta; Obla, Ajay; Alshammary, Hala Alejel; Gonzalez-Reiche, Ana S; Hernandez, Matthew M; Sordillo, Emilia Mia; Simon, Viviana; van Bakel, Harm; Paniz-Mondolfi, Alberto E; Ramírez, Juan David",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,310,16

We outline a methodology in which both health insurance provider network data and publicly available data sources can be used to identify and plan for SARS-CoV-2 vaccinator capacity at the county level. Methods: Sendero Health Plans, Inc. provider network data, Texas State Board of Pharmacy data, US Census Bureau data, and H1N1 monovalent vaccine data were utilized to identify providers with demonstrated capacity to vaccinate the population in Travis County, Texas to achieve an estimated SARS-CoV-2 herd immunity target of 67%. Results: Within the Sendero network, 2,356 non-pharmacy providers were identified with 788 (33.4%) practicing in primary care and 1,569 (66.6%) practicing as specialists. Of the total, 686 (29.1%) provided at least one immunization between January 1, 2019 and September 30, 2020. There are 300 pharmacies with active licenses in Travis County with 161 (53.7%) classified as community pharmacies.

The purpose of this study was to determine how recreation participation has changed over five years on the Monongahela National Forest following the world financial crisis of 2008–2009. Data used for this research were collected with the National Visitor Use Monitoring (NVUM) surveys for fiscal years 2009 and 2014. NVUM surveys are on-site interviews conducted at the end of a visit. The surveys produce descriptive information about visitors. NVUM uses a stratified random sampling methodology to collect data for each use level (e.g., low, medium, high, or very high) and site type (e.g., Day Use Developed Sites, Overnight Use Developed Sites, General Forest Areas, and Wilderness Sites). Data were collected during a 12-month period and a total of 1,851 interviews were completed. Two step cluster analysis of 18 activity participation variables (binary data) was conducted with 5 clusters specified. The clusters include Relaxing in Nature Package, Backpacking and Hiking Package, Viewing Nature and Hunting Package, Picnicking Package, and Purely Fishing, and they were compared with an activity package typology. Changes in demographics, trip spending, nights away from home, and overall satisfaction were examined for each market segment.

This process comprises a sequential pathway of steps that are finely regulated. Genetic predisposition and abnormal immune responses are some of the numerous possible causes of female infertility. The question related to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and fertility has been evoked for several reasons, including the high expression of ACE2 in the female reproductive tissues, the entry receptor for SARS‐CoV‐2, and the potential damage to germline (oocytes) due to the dysfunction of autophagy in COVID‐19. In addition, molecular mimicry may contribute to female infertility by leading to the generation of deleterious autoantibodies, which could also participate to the onset of an autoimmune disease in infected patients. We carried out a systematic study to improve our understanding of the possible effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on female fertility using the angle of molecular mimicry as a starting point. Results show a number of rather long linear sequences shared by the SARS‐CoV‐2 proteins and oogenesis‐related proteins that might play a role in the production of possibly pathogenic crossreactive autoantibodies. SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein was found to share 41 minimal immune determinants, i.e., pentapeptides, with 27 human proteins that relate to oogenesis, uterine receptivity, decidualization, and placentation. All the shared pentapeptides that we identified, with the exception of four, are also present in SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein–derived epitopes that have been experimentally validated as immunoreactive.

Our aim was to describe the characteristics of the disease in this population and to determine predictive factors for poor outcome in terms of severe respiratory distress (ARDS) or death. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients consecutively admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infection were prospectively collected and retrospective statistical analysis was performed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess potential factors for poor outcomes defined as ARDS or death. RESULTS: 63 patients were analyzed, 34 of them developed respiratory failure (70% as ARDS). Lymphocytes/mm3 (412 vs. 686; p=0.001), serum albumin (2.84 vs. 3.1); LDH (670vs. 359; p<0.001) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels (25.8 vs. 9.9; p<0.001) discriminate those that developed respiratory failure. Mortality Rate was 25%, significantly higher among ARDS, neutropenic patients (p=0.01) and in those with bilateral infiltrates (44% vs. 0%; p<0.001). Multivariate logistic analyses model confirmed the predictive value of severe neutropenia (OR 16.54 CI 95% 1.43-190.9, p 0.025), bilateral infiltrates (OR 32.83, CI95% 3.51-307, p 0.002) and tumor lung involvement (OR 4.34, CI95% 1.2-14.95, p 0.02). CONCLUSION: Cancer patients under active treatment admitted for Sars-coV2 infection have worse outcomes in terms of mortality and respiratory failure rates compared with COVID-19 global population.

It is important to use longitudinal data to improve inferences. AIMS: To quantify the prevalence of depression, anxiety and mental well-being before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, to identify groups at risk of depression and/or anxiety during the pandemic. METHOD: Data were from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) index generation (n = 2850, mean age 28 years) and parent generation (n = 3720, mean age 59 years), and Generation Scotland (n = 4233, mean age 59 years). Depression was measured with the Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire in ALSPAC and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 in Generation Scotland. Anxiety and mental well-being were measured with the Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment-7 and the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale. RESULTS: Depression during the pandemic was similar to pre-pandemic levels in the ALSPAC index generation, but those experiencing anxiety had almost doubled, at 24% (95% CI 23–26%) compared with a pre-pandemic level of 13% (95% CI 12–14%). In both studies, anxiety and depression during the pandemic was greater in younger members, women, those with pre-existing mental/physical health conditions and individuals in socioeconomic adversity, even when controlling for pre-pandemic anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence for increased anxiety in young people that is coincident with the pandemic. Specific groups are at elevated risk of depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is important for planning current mental health provisions and for long-term impact beyond this pandemic.","Kwong, Alex S.

Global aerosol retrieval algorithms are typically based on a Look-Up–Table (LUT) technique, requiring high-performance computers. The current eXtensible Bremen Aerosol/cloud and surfacE parameters Retrieval (XBAER) algorithm also utilizes the LUT method. In order to have a near-real time retrieval and achieve a quick and accurate ”FIRST-LOOK” aerosol product without high-demand of computing resource, we have developed a Fast and Accurate Semi-analytical Model of Atmosphere-surface Reflectance (FASMAR) for aerosol remote sensing. The FASMAR is developed based on a successive order of scattering technique. In FASMAR, the first three orders of scattering are calculated exactly. The contribution of higher orders of scattering is estimated using an extrapolation technique and an additional correction function. The evaluation of FASMAR has been performed by comparing with radiative transfer model SCIATRAN for all typical observation/illumination geometries, surface/aerosol conditions, and wavelengths 412, 550, 670, 870, 1600, 2100 nm used for aerosol remote sensing. The selected observation/illumination conditions are based on the observations from both geostationary satellite (e.g. MSG/SEVIRI) and polar-orbit satellite (e.g. OLCI/Sentinel-3). The percentage error of the top of atmosphere reflectance calculated by FASMAR is within ± 3% for typical polar-orbit/geostationary satellites’ observation/illumination geometries. The accuracy decreases for solar and viewing zenith angles larger than 70(∘). However, even in such cases, the error is within the range ± 5%. The evaluation of model performance also shows that FASMAR can be used for all typical surfaces with albedo in the interval [0 - 1] and aerosol with optical thickness in the range [0.01 - 1].","Mei, Linlu; Rozanov, Vladimir; Burrows, John P.",J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transf,310,16

Stability analysis and stationarity test, parameter test, and model diagnostic were also carried out. Finally, the fitting, selection and prediction accuracy of the ARIMA model was evaluated using the AICc model selection criteria. Results: The ARIMA (1,1,0) model was finally selected among ARIMA models based upon the parameter test and Box Ljung test. A ten day forecast was also made from the model, which shows a steep upward trend of the spread of the COVID19 in Nigeria within the selected time frame. Conclusion: Federal Government of Nigeria through the presidential task force can apply the forecasted trend of much more spread to make more informed decisions on the additional measures in place to curb the spread of the virus. Application of the model can also assist in studying the effectiveness of the lockdown on the on the spread of Covid19 in Nigeria.","Ibrahim, R. R.; OLADIPO, O. H.",,310,24

However, their implementation usually requires an extended consultation time. Despite significant advances in medical diagnosis and treatment, no studies have examined consultation time and patient centeredness in Korea. METHODS: We conducted a “15-Minute Consultation” for first-time patients in outpatient clinics of 13 departments. A control group was selected from the same physicians' first-time patients, adjusting for age and gender. A total of 275 patients were selected for receiving in-depth consultation and 141 control patients were selected for regular consultation. Data were collected from patients using a questionnaire comprising a patient-centeredness scale and items on potential predictors such as socio-demographic and clinical factors. We also investigated the participating physician's professionalism. RESULTS: As compared to the control group, the in-depth consultation group scored higher on 5 variables associated with PCC, including (patients' perception of) medical professionals, wait and consultation times, treatment, patient advocacy, and patient satisfaction. While 92.4% of patients in the in-depth consultation group reported that the consultation time was sufficient, only 69.0% of those in the control group reported the same (P < 0.01). In the in-depth consultation group, scores on satisfaction level were the highest for the department of internal medicine, followed by departments of surgery and pediatrics. Participating physicians' improved satisfaction following the intervention proved that in-depth consultation facilitated building a rapport with patients. CONCLUSION: This study illustrated that the provision of sufficiently long consultation for serious and rare diseases could improve PCC and physicians' professionalism. Health authorities should reshuffle the healthcare delivery system and provide sufficient consultation time to ensure PCC and medical professionalism.","Sohn, Kyoung-Hee; Nam, Sarah; Joo, Jungmin; Kwon, Yong Jin; Yim, Jae-Joon",J Korean Med Sci,310,20

Since lncRNAs were first discovered, there has been increasing evidence that they play important roles in the development and function of most organs, including the placenta. The placenta is an essential transient organ that facilitates communication and nutrient exchange between the mother and foetus. The placenta is of foetal origin and begins to form shortly after the embryo implants into the uterine wall. The placenta relies heavily on the successful differentiation and function of trophoblast cells, including invasion as well as the formation of the maternal/foetal interface. Here, we review the current literature surrounding the involvement of lncRNAs in the development and function of trophoblasts and the human placenta.","McAninch, Dale; Roberts, Claire T.; Bianco-Miotto, Tina",Int J Mol Sci,310,10

Telemedicine was implemented in many otolaryngological departments to ensure the continuous care. The purpose of this study is to report our experience about telemedicine in 86 patients consulting virtually in our departments. METHODS: A total of 86 patients benefited from telemedicine consultation from April to Mai May 2020. Patients and physicians were invited to fulfill a satisfaction survey over the 3 days after the consultation. RESULTS: Patients consulted in the following fields: laryngology, voice and swallowing (N=15; 17.4%), head and neck or plastic surgery (N=34; 39.5%), rhinology (N=31; 36.1%) and otology (N=6; 7.0%). Practitioners estimated that the clinical examination would not have changed the consultation issue in 73.2% of cases. The realization of delayed clinical examination was rapidly necessary in 9.3% of cases and useless in 33.7% of cases. Five percent of patients estimated that the consultation did not bring reliable conclusion. Although the majority of patient (87.7%) would recommend telemedicine consultation to friend/family in the context of pandemic, only 44.6% would accept to replace office- consultation by telemedicine consultation outside the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine appears to be an interesting alternative approach in situation of pandemic and lock-down. Because the patient motivation to further participate to telemedicine appears to be conditioned by the context, efforts are still required to understand the patient perception, satisfaction and fears in view of future implementation outside pandemic.

Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","Noorbhai, Habib",Ann Med Surg (Lond),310,24

The increase in workload and new infection control procedures were thought to affect resuscitation and airway management. Our aim was to study the effects of wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) and powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) and the restriction in the number of resuscitation personnel on airway management during the SARS crisis. Data was collected prospectively through an ongoing emergency airway registry. The data was divided into three periods: (1) before PPE was instituted from 1 November 2002 to 31 March 2003; (2) during SARS (when PPE use was mandatory) from 1 April to 31 July 2003; (3) post-SARs (when PPE use was non-mandatory but encouraged) from 1 August to 31 March 2004. There was no change in patient demographics during the three periods. There were significant increases in the proportion of resuscitation cases and airway interventions during the SARS period compared to the pre-SARS period. The resident medical officer intubation rate decreased from 45.1% pre-SARS to 35.2% during SARS and 17.7% post-SARS. The complication rates were 10.5%, 9.9% and 9.4% in periods 1–3, respectively. Restriction in the number of healthcare staff attending to each patient may have influenced the department's decision to allow only the most confident or experienced personnel to manage the airway. The exposure of junior medical officers in emergency airway management during SARS and the immediate post-SARS period was decreased. This trend should be monitored further and intervention may be necessary should it continue to decline.","Wong, Evelyn; Ho, Khoy Kheng",Resuscitation,310,1

Dornase alfa has been used for decades in patients with cystic fibrosis to reduce the viscoelasticity of respiratory tract secretions, to decrease the severity of respiratory tract infections, and to improve lung function. Previous studies have linked abnormal NET formations to lung diseases, especially to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is well known that novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia progresses to ARDS and even multiple organ failure. High blood neutrophil levels are an early indicator of COVID-19 and predict severe respiratory diseases.

However, to date, mostly single-center technical and diagnostic performance's assessments have been carried out without an intralaboratory validation process and a health technology assessment (HTA) systematic approach. Therefore, the rapid HTA for evaluating antibody tests for SARS-COV-2 was applied. METHODS: The use of rapid HTA is an opportunity to test innovative technology. Unlike traditional HTA (which evaluates the benefits of new technologies after being tested in clinical trials or have been applied in practice for some time), the rapid HTA is performed during the early stages of developing new technology. A multidisciplinary team conducted the rapid HTA following the HTA Core Model® (version 3.0) developed by the European Network for Health Technology Assessment. RESULTS: The three methodological and analytical steps used in the HTA applied to the evaluation of antibody tests for SARS-COV-2 are reported: the selection of the tests to be evaluated; the research and collection of information to support the adoption and appropriateness of the technology; and the preparation of the final reports and their dissemination. Finally, the rapid HTA of serological tests for SARS-CoV-2 is summarized in a report that allows its dissemination and communication. CONCLUSIONS: The rapid-HTA evaluation method, in addition to highlighting the characteristics that differentiate the tests from each other, guarantees a timely and appropriate evaluation, becoming a tool to create a direct link between science and health management.","Tomaiuolo, Rossella; Derrico, Pietro; Ritrovato, Matteo; Locatelli, Massimo; Milella, Frida; Restelli, Umberto; Lago, Paolo; Giuliani, Francesco; Banfi, Giuseppe",Int J Technol Assess Health Care,310,26

This paper delineates the process and considerations for implementing remote voice recording and acoustic analysis in a high-volume university voice clinic. STUDY DESIGN Clinical Focus. METHODS Acoustic voice recordings were attempted on 108 unique patients over a 6-month period using a remote voice recording phone application. Development of the clinical process including determining normative data in which to compare acoustic results, clinician training, and clinical application is described. The treating Speech Language Pathologists (SLPs) were surveyed 2 months after implementation to assess ease of application, identify challenges and assess implementation of potential solutions. RESULTS Of 108 unique patients, 83 patients were successful in completing the process of synchronous remote acoustic voice recording in conjunction with their SLP clinician. The process of downloading the application, setting up, and obtaining voice recordings was most commonly 10-20 minutes according to the 8 SLPs surveyed. Challenges and helpful techniques were identified. CONCLUSIONS Remote acoustic voice recordings have allowed SLPs to continue to complete a comprehensive voice evaluation in a telepractice model. Given emerging knowledge about the viability of remote voice recordings, the success in obtaining acoustic data remotely, and the accessibility of a low-cost app for SLPs makes remote voice recordings a viable option to facilitate remote clinical care and research investigation.","Schneider, Sarah L; Habich, Laura; Weston, Zoe M; Rosen, Clark A",Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation,310,10

Patient characteristics, knowledge of the COVID-19 disease, risk behaviour and mental state will differ between individuals. The primary aim of this study was to investigate these variables in patients visiting an emergency department in the Netherlands during the COVID-19 pandemic and to compare the “COVID-19 suspected” (positive and negative tested group) with the “COVID-19 not suspected” (control group) and to compare in the “COVID-19 suspected” group, the positive and negative tested patients. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients, visiting the emergency room at the Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, were asked to fill out questionnaires on the abovementioned items on an iPad. The patients were either “COVID-19 suspected” (positive and negative tested group) or “COVID-19 not suspected” (control group). RESULTS: This study included a total of 159 patients, 33 (21%) tested positive, 85 (53%) negative and 41 (26%) were COVID-19 not suspected (control group). All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. Working as a health care professional was correlated to a higher risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection (p- value 0.04). COVID-19 suspected patients had a significantly higher level of anxiety compared to COVID-19 not suspected patients (p-value < 0.001). The higher the anxiety, the more seriously hygiene measures were followed. The anxiety scores of the patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly higher than without comorbidities. CONCLUSION: This is one of the first (large) study that investigates and compares patient characteristics, knowledge, behaviour, illness perception, and mental state with respect to COVID-19 of patients visiting the emergency room, subdivided as being suspected of having COVID-19 (positive or negative tested) and a control group not suspected of having COVID-19. All patients in this study were generally aware of transmission risks and virulence and adhered to the non-pharmaceutical interventions. COVID-19 suspected patients and patients with (pulmonary) comorbidities were significantly more anxious. However, there is no mass hysteria regarding COVID-19. The higher the degree of fear, the more carefully hygiene measures were observed. Knowledge about the coping of the population during the COVID-19 pandemic is very important, certainly also in the perspective of a possible second outbreak of COVID-19.","van der Valk, J. P.

This paper presents an advanced empirical framework for the need-based approach to health workforce planning with an open-access simulation tool in Microsoft(®) Excel to facilitate real-life health workforce planning in countries. Two fundamental mathematical models are used to quantify the supply of, and need for, health professionals, respectively. The supply-side model is based on a stock-and-flow process, and the need-side model extents a previously published analytical frameworks using the population health needs-based approach. We integrate the supply and need analyses by comparing them to establish the gaps in both absolute and relative terms, and then explore their cost implications for health workforce policy and strategy. To illustrate its use, the model was used to simulate a real-life example using midwives and obstetricians/gynaecologists in the context of maternal and new-born care in Ghana. Sensitivity analysis showed that if a constant level of health was assumed (as in previous works), the need for health professionals could have been underestimated in the long-term. Towards universal health coverage, the findings reveal a need to adopt the need-based approach for HWF planning and to adjust HWF supply in line with population health needs.","Asamani, James Avoka; Christmals, Christmal Dela; Reitsma, Gerda Marie",Int J Environ Res Public Health,310,1

The primary end point is a hierarchical composite of death and HF hospitalization at 12 months and change from baseline to 6 months in the 6-minute walk test distance. CONCLUSIONS: The HEART-FID trial will inform clinical practice by clarifying the role of long-term treatment with intravenous ferric carboxymaltose, added to usual care, in ambulatory patients with symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction with ID.

The Health Belief Model (HBM), personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism), and sociodemographic variables were used to evaluate social distancing during the first month of a state‐mandated Stay At Home (SAH) order. DESIGN: A web‐based convenience sample of 645 Ohioans was surveyed. Hierarchical linear regression and mediation analysis were used to examine predictors of social distancing attitudes and behaviors and whether health beliefs mediated the relationship between personality and social distancing. RESULTS: Most respondents agreed with and adhered to social distancing guidelines. HBM constructs were strong predictors of SAH attitudes, while personality accounted for little additional variance. Anxiety was indirectly related to overall social distancing attitudes and behavior through its relationship with health beliefs. However, violations of social distancing were best explained by situational factors (e.g., being an essential worker). CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate the power of components of the HBM to explain attitudes and behaviors regarding the SAH order beyond any contribution from personality. By examining the role of personality and health beliefs on social distancing attitudes and behaviors, this research will benefit public health nurses and others tasked with communicating and promoting preventative health behavior.","Matthews, Valerie S.; Stough‐Hunter, Anjel; Marazita, John M.",Public Health Nurs,310,16

METHODS: Medical records of all reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive COVID-19 patients followed up in hospital and home isolation between 13(th) of Mar 2020 and 12(th) of May 2020 were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were from Kayseri Province, Turkey. Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics and the factors associated with morbidity and mortality were analyzed. RESULTS: Of all the patients, 773 (95.8%) were alive and 34 (4.24%) died. The fatality rate was 4.2%. There were differences between the age groups in terms of fatality rate (P<0.001). The fatality rate in patients above the age of 65 yr was significantly higher. The fatality rate in the male gender was 2.44 times higher (P<0.05). It was 1.104 times higher in advanced age (P<0.001) and 10.893 times higher in patients with at least one comorbid disease (P<0.05). Hypertension increased mortality by 3.635 times (P<0.05) and chronic pulmonary diseases by 2.926 times (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Advanced age, male gender and accompanying chronic diseases have adverse effects on the course and severity of the disease and hospitalization. They also increased the rate and risk of mortality.","Aslaner, Hümeyra; Aslaner, Hacı Ahmet; Gökçek, Mebrure Beyza; Benli, Ali Ramazan; Yıldız, Orhan",Iran J Public Health,310,1

The program is organized into workstreams focused on end‐to‐end control strategy, equipment flexibility, next generation technology, sustainability, and a physical test bed to evaluate and demonstrate the technologies that are developed. The elements of the program are synergistic. For example, process intensification results in cost reduction as well as increased sustainability. Improved robustness leads to less inventory, which improves costs and supply chain velocity. Flexibility allows more products to be consolidated into fewer factories, reduces the need for new facilities, simplifies the acquisition of additional capacity if needed, and reduces changeover time, which improves cost and velocity. The program incorporates both drug substance and drug product manufacturing, but this paper will focus on the drug substance elements of the program.","Erickson, John; Baker, Jeffrey; Barrett, Shawn; Brady, Ciaran; Brower, Mark; Carbonell, Ruben; Charlebois, Tim; Coffman, Jon; Connell‐Crowley, Lisa; Coolbaugh, Michael; Fallon, Eric; Garr, Eric; Gillespie, Christopher; Hart, Roger; Haug, Allison; Nyberg, Gregg; Phillips, Michael; Pollard, David; Qadan, Maen; Ramos, Irina; Rogers, Kelley; Schaefer, Gene; Walther, Jason; Lee, Kelvin",Biotechnol Bioeng,310,1

Pour y faire face, les hôpitaux de jour gériatriques ont payé un lourd tribut dans le cadre de la restructuration organisationnelle du milieu hospitalier avec une fermeture quasi instantanée imposée par les tutelles. Une enquête a été menée sous l’égide de l’APHJPA auprès des hôpitaux de jour gériatriques pour tirer les enseignements de la gestion de cette crise et mener une réflexion sur le rôle de ces structures dans un tel contexte. Cinquante hôpitaux de jour répartis sur l’ensemble du territoire national ont répondu. Les professionnels ont d’emblée été redéployés dans les services d’hospitalisation classique, que le bassin de population soit fortement impacté par la Covid-19 ou pas. Certains ont assuré une assistance auprès des EHPAD ou des patients confinés à domicile et de leur entourage. S’ils ont accepté les fermetures lors de la période aiguë de la crise, l’absence de lisibilité sur la réouverture de leur unité, malgré les mesures de précaution envisagées, a été mal vécue, avec souvent le sentiment d’une méconnaissance de leur rôle dans le parcours de soins de la personne âgée par les tutelles et parfois, par leur propre direction. Le confinement et les ruptures de prise en charge ont pu entraîner des « décompensations » notamment chez les patients ayant des pathologies neuro-dégénératives. Situés à l’interface ville-hôpital, les hôpitaux de jour ont un rôle majeur dans la prise en soins des personnes âgées. L’enquête met ainsi en avant une capacité d’adaptation et d’engagement des professionnels pour affirmer la place des hôpitaux de jour dans la prise en charge des pathologies chroniques (diagnostic, suivi et réadaptation) mais aussi leur rôle dans la prévention, le repérage et le suivi des patients fragiles. The COVID-19 pandemic generated an unprecedented health crisis. In the subsequent response, geriatric day hospitals paid a heavy price in the organizational restructuring of the hospital environment, with almost instantaneous closures imposed by the authorities. A survey was conducted under the aegis of the APHJPA among day hospitals to learn the lessons from the management of this crisis and to reflect on the role of these structures in contexts of this nature. 50 day hospitals throughout the country answered. Most of the professionals were immediately redeployed to classic hospitalization services, whether or not the population area was heavily impacted by COVID-19. Some of them provided assistance to nursing homes or patients confined to their homes and their families. Although they accepted the closures during the acute period of the crisis, the lack of clarity about the reopening of their units despite the precautionary measures envisaged was not well received, often with the feeling that the authorities and sometimes the management of their establishments were not well acquainted with their role in the care of the elderly. The lockdown and discontinuation of care led to de-compensations, especially among patients with neurodegenerative pathologies. Situated at the interface between the community and hospital health sectors, day hospitals play a major role in the care of the elderly. This survey highlights the ability of professionals to adapt and commit themselves, demonstrating the relevance of day hospitals in the field of chronic diseases (diagnosis, follow-up, rehabilitation) and also in prevention, identification and follow-up of frail patients.","Volpe-Gillot, L.; Michel, J-M",,310,12

At present, more and more information is available on the functional relationship between RPs and virus infection. This review focuses on advancements in my own understanding of critical roles of RPs in the life cycle of viruses. Various RPs interact with viral mRNA and proteins to participate in viral protein biosynthesis and regulate the replication and infection of virus in host cells. Most interactions are essential for viral translation and replication, which promote viral infection and accumulation, whereas the minority represents the defense signaling of host cells by activating immune pathway against virus. RPs provide a new platform for antiviral therapy development, however, at present, antiviral therapeutics with RPs involving in virus infection as targets is limited, and exploring antiviral strategy based on RPs will be the guides for further study.","Li, Shuo",Cells,310,16

METHODS: Patients (n = 58) were grouped according to their main neurological presentation: headache (n = 14); encephalopathy (n = 24); inflammatory neurological diseases, including meningoencephalitis (n = 4), acute myelitis (n = 3), meningitis (n = 2), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) (n = 2), encephalitis (n = 2), and neuromyelitis optica (n = 1); and Guillain-Barré syndrome (n = 6). Data about age, sex, cerebrovascular disease, and intracranial pressure were evaluated in combination with CSF profiles defined by cell counts, total protein and glucose levels, concentration of total Tau and neurofilament light chain (NfL) proteins, oligoclonal band patterns, and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: CSF of patients with inflammatory neurological diseases was characterized by pleocytosis and elevated total protein and NfL levels. Patients with encephalopathy were mostly older men (mean age of 61.0 ± 17.6 years) with evidence of cerebrovascular disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA in CSF was detected in 2 of 58 cases: a patient with refractory headache, and another who developed ADEM four days after COVID-19 symptoms onset. Three patients presented intrathecal IgG synthesis, and four had identical oligoclonal bands in CSF and serum, indicating systemic inflammation. CONCLUSION: Patients with neurological manifestations associated with COVID-19 had diverse CSF profiles, even within the same clinical condition. Our findings indicate a possible contribution of viral replication on triggering CNS infiltration by immune cells and the inflammation promoting neuronal injury.","Espíndola, Otávio Melo; Brandão, Carlos Otávio; Gomes, Yago Côrtes Pinheiro; Siqueira, Marilda; Soares, Cristiane Nascimento; Lima, Marco Antônio Sales Dantas; Leite, Ana Claudia Celestino Bezerra; Torezani, Guilherme; Araujo, Abelardo Queiroz Campos; Silva, Marcus Tulius Teixeira",Int J Infect Dis,310,26

To reduce the burden for the patients, video consultation can be an alternative to traditional in-person hospital consultations. The aim of the current study was, from the perspectives of patients and health care providers, to investigate the perceived benefits and challenges of using video consultations in outpatient renal transplant recipient follow-up. METHODS: Patients (i.e., renal transplant recipients; n = 18) alternated between regular in-person follow-up consultations and video consultations. Patients and health care providers were then invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Patients interviewed (n = 15) were median 53 years old (range 37–64) and 53% female. The video consultation solution used in the study turned out to have major technical deficiencies. Despite the technical challenges, however, the majority of the patients reported appreciating being able to alternate between video and in-person hospital consultations. Main benefits reported included not needing to travel to the hospital and thereby saving time, less focus on being chronically ill and potential economic benefits for patients and society. The health care providers (n = 3) also valued the benefits provided by the use of video consultations, but described the reoccurring technical challenges as disruptive. The fact that patients were in a stable phase of their health condition and already had an established, trusting relationship with their nephrologist, acted as facilitators for success. Possible challenges and harms described included concerns related to security, confidentiality and interruptions, as well as the potential need for physical examinations. CONCLUSIONS: Benefits from using video consultations as an alternative to in-person consultations may outweigh potential technological challenges for patients as well as health care providers. A long-lasting mutually trusting relationship between patient and provider may be an important prerequisite for the experienced benefits of using video consultation. Findings also indicate that starting such care delivery changes in a small-scale, with a few selected patients in a stable phase of their condition, may be an important factor for success.

This mixed methods study investigates the implementation and financial challenges experienced by twelve of the largest urban SFAs in the U.S. during COVID-19. We conducted semi-structured interviews with SFA leaders and analyzed alongside quantitative financial data. We found that SFAs reconfigured their usual operations with nearly no preparation time while simultaneously trying to keep staff from contracting COVID-19, accommodate stakeholders with sometimes competing priorities, and remain financially solvent. Because student participation was much lower than during regular times, and revenue is tied to the number of meals served, SFAs saw drastic decreases in revenue even as they carried regular operating costs. For future crises, disaster preparedness plans that help SFAs better navigate the switch to financially viable community distribution methods are needed.","Kenney, Erica L.; Dunn, Caroline G.; Mozaffarian, Rebecca S.; Dai, Jane; Wilson, Katie; West, Jeremy; Shen, Ye; Fleischhacker, Sheila; Bleich, Sara N.",Nutrients,310,9

Objectives: To report on a COVID-19 testing algorithm from a tertiary care hospital emergency department (ED) that combines both antigen (performed on the ED) and RT-PCR (performed outside the ED) testing. Methods: Between December 2020 and January 2021, in a priori designated, spatially separated COVID-19 or non-COVID-19 ED areas, respectively, symptomatic or asymptomatic patients received SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing on nasopharyngeal swab samples. Antigen results were promptly accessible to guide subsequent, outside performed confirmatory (RT-PCR) testing. Results: Overall, 1083 (100%) of 1083 samples in the COVID-19 area and 1815 (49.4%) of 3670 samples in the non-COVID-19 area had antigen results that required confirmation by RT-PCR.

However, individuals affected by IGD or internet use disorders (IUDs) are often not provided with adequate therapy due to a lack of motivation or absence of adequate local treatment options. To close the gap between individuals with IUDs and the care system, we conduct an online-based motivational intervention to reduce problematic internet use and promote treatment motivation in internet gaming disorder and internet use disorder (OMPRIS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Within the randomised controlled trial, a total of n=162 participants will be allocated by sequential balancing randomisation to the OMPRIS intervention or a waitlist control group. The study includes an extensive diagnostic, followed by a 4-week psychological intervention based on motivational interviewing, (internet-related) addiction therapy, behavioural therapy techniques and additional social counselling. The primary outcome is the reduction of problematic internet use measured by the Assessment of Internet and Computer Game Addiction Scale. Secondary outcomes include time spent on the internet, motivation for change (Stages of Change Readiness and Treatment Eagerness Scale for Internet Use Disorder), comorbid mental symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7), quality of life (EuroQoL Standardised Measure of Health-related Quality of Life–5 Dimensions, General Life Satisfaction-1), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), personality traits (Big Five Inventory-10), therapeutic alliance (Helping Alliance Questionnaire) and health economic costs. The diagnosis of (comorbid) mental disorders is carried out with standardised clinical interviews. The measurement will be assessed before (T0), at midpoint (T1) and after the OMPRIS intervention (T2), representing the primary endpoint. Two follow-up assessments will be conducted after 6 weeks (T3) and 6 months (T4) after the intervention. The outcomes will be analysed primarily via analysis of covariance. Both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses will be conducted. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Participants will provide written informed consent.

The presence of the rol-genes was confirmed by PCR analysis. The hairy roots of the most studied plant from the Scutellaria genus, S. baicalensis, were obtained earlier and used as a reference sample. HPLC-MS showed the predominance of four main flavones (baicalin, baicalein, wogonin and wogonoside) in the methanol extracts of the studied hairy roots. In addition to the four main flavones, the other substances which are typical to the aerial part of plants were found in all the extracts: apigenin, apigetrin, scutellarin and chrysin-7-O-β-d-glucuronide. According to the total content of flavones, the hairy roots of the studied skullcaps form the following series: S. przewalskii (33 mg/g dry weight) > S. baicalensis (17.04 mg/g dry weight) > S. pycnoclada (12.9 mg/g dry weight) > S. lateriflora (4.57 mg/g dry weight).

The majority of planned surgery was cancelled or postponed in March 2020 for the duration of the first wave of the pandemic. We investigated the experiences of staff responsible for delivering rapid changes to surgical services during the first wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom, with the aim of developing lessons for future major systems change (MSC). METHODS: Using a rapid qualitative study design, we conducted 25 interviews with frontline surgical staff during the first wave of the pandemic. Framework analysis was used to organise and interpret findings. RESULTS: Staff discussed positive and negative experiences of rapid service organisation. Clinician-led decision-making, the flexibility of individual staff and teams, and the opportunity to innovate service design were all seen as positive contributors to success in service adaptation. The negative aspects of rapid change were inconsistent guidance from national government and medical bodies, top-down decisions about when to cancel and restart surgery, the challenges of delivering emergency surgical care safely and the complexity of prioritising surgical cases when services re-started. CONCLUSION: Success in the rapid reorganisation of elective surgical services can be attributed to the flexibility and adaptability of staff. However, there was an absence of involvement of staff in wider system-level pandemic decision-making and competing guidance from national bodies. Involving staff in decisions about the organisation and delivery of MSC is essential for the sustainability of change processes.","Singleton, Georgina; Dowrick, Anna; Manby, Louisa; Fillmore, Harrison; Syverson, Aron; Lewis-Jackson, Sasha; Uddin, Inayah; Sumray, Kirsi; Bautista-González, Elysse; Johnson, Ginger; Vindrola-Padros, Cecilia",Int. j. health policy manag,310,24

Les études observationnelles analysant le lien entre la prise de bloqueurs du SRAA et l’évolution de la maladie ont montré des résultats très divergents, avec un effet potentiellement protecteur, neutre ou même délétère. L’objectif de notre étude était de décrire les modifications de prescription des bloqueurs du SRAA chez les patients hospitalisés pour COVID-19 et la mortalité en fonction des différents schémas d’exposition, et de discuter les études existantes à la lumière de ces résultats. Matériels et méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude rétrospective des patients hospitalisés pour COVID-19 dans le service de maladie infectieuse de l’hôpital Bichat (Paris) du 23 janvier au 29 avril 2020. La prescription de bloqueurs du SRAA (IEC ou ARA2), avant l’hospitalisation, et durant les 7 premiers jours d’hospitalisation était recueillie. Le critère de jugement principal était la mortalité à 30jours suivant l’admission à l’hôpital. Résultats Trois cent quarante-sept patients ont été inclus dans l’étude, parmi lesquels 117 (34 %) recevaient des bloqueurs du SRAA avant l’hospitalisation. L’âge moyen était de 61 [51–72] ans, 209 (60 %) étaient des hommes, 169 (49 %) étaient hypertendus. Les bloqueurs du SRAA étaient arrêtés dans les 7 premiers jours d’hospitalisation chez 39 (33 %) des patients traités au préalable. Quarante-sept patients (14 %) sont décédés avant j30. Les taux de mortalité étaient respectivement de 17 % (20/117) et 12 % (27/220) chez les patients exposés et non exposés aux bloqueurs du SRAA avant l’hospitalisation (OR brut 1,60 [IC95 : 0,82–2,89] et ajusté 0,62 [0,25–1,48] pour les patients traités versus non traités). La mortalité était de 33 % (17/39) quand le traitement était interrompu à l’hôpital, 8 % (7/84) quand le traitement était maintenu ou introduit, et 12 % (27/220) chez les patients jamais exposés. L’effet apparemment protecteur des bloqueurs du SRAA (OR ajusté 0,25 [IC95 % : 0,09–0,65] pour une exposition versus non-exposition intra-hospitalière) reflète des biais majeurs, le principal d’entre eux étant l’arrêt du traitement chez les patients les plus sévères, et inversement. Conclusion Cette étude ne montre pas d’association significative entre l’exposition pré-hospitalière aux bloqueurs du SRAA et la mortalité à 30jours, après ajustement sur les principales comorbidités. Les modifications de prescription après l’admission à l’hôpital sont fortement influencées par la sévérité des patients, expliquant l’effet apparemment protecteur associé au traitement intra-hospitalier. Ces biais de prescription rendent les études observationnelles inadaptées à l’étude du lien entre l’exposition hospitalière aux bloqueurs du SRAA et l’évolution de la maladie.","Lahens, A.; Mullaert, J.; Gressens, S.; Mentré, F.; Flamant, M.; Deconinck, L.; Joly, V.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Lescure, F.; Vidal-Petiot, E.",Médecine et Maladies Infectieuses,310,0

Notwithstanding the unprecedented accelerated speed of COVID-19 vaccine development, just 9 months after the emergence of the pandemic in Wuhan, China, benefiting from previous developments in SARS and MERS vaccines, significant gaps persist in global vaccine preparedness. These gaps include issues related to immunity and protection, particularly to the limited vaccine protection against recent emergence of concerning new viral variants in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil and the consequent need for vaccine redesign. We examine these gaps and discuss the main issues that could impact on global vaccine availability in the current pandemic scenario: (1) breakthroughs and constraints in development and production of leading global COVID-19 vaccines; (2) innovation and technological development advances and gaps, providing information on global patent assignees for COVID-19, SARS, and MERS vaccine patents; (3) local capacity for development and production of COVID-19, SARS, and MERS vaccines in three emerging agro-based countries (India, Brazil, and South Africa); and (4) future scenarios, examining how these issues and vaccines redesign for new SARS-CoV-2 variants could impact on global access to vaccines and implications for circular bioeconomy and sustainability in the post-COVID era.","Possas, Cristina; de Souza Antunes, Adelaide Maria; de Oliveira, Alessandra Moreira; de Souza Mendes Santos, Cristina d’Urso; Ramos, Mateus Pinheiro; de Oliveira Rodrigues Schumacher, Suzanne; Homma, Akira",Circ.Econ.Sust.,310,20

The amount of sodium borohydride and reaction time required for reduction varied greatly depending on the N(1)-substituent. The presence of a ß-hydroxyl group on the N(1)-substituent was seen to have a rate enhancing effect on the reduction of the C(5) ester group. The regioselective reduction was attributed to the lower electron densities of the C(5) and the C(5) ester carbonyl carbon of the 1,2,3-triazole, which were further lowered in cases involving intramolecular hydrogen bonding.","Butler, Christopher R; Bendesky, Justin; Schoffstall, Allen Milton",Molecules (Basel),310,27

Early diagnosis and appropriate management of COVID 19 cases is important in preventing transmission and improving patient outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, altitude, and practice of healthcare providers in the United Arab Emirates toward COVID-19 and to examine its determinants. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) of Healthcare providers regarding COVID-19. The study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic from of April 11 to July 23, using an online anonymous self-administered questionnaire. Results A total of 2371 healthcare providers responded to the survey. A total of 1091 worked in inpatient hospitals, 494 in primary health care, and 388 in emergency and ICU care. The overall performance score for all healthcare providers was as follows: 49.1%, poor score; 41.8 %, intermediate score; and 9.2%, good score with a mean result of 17.14. Factors leading to better overall performance scores were years of experience, pediatricians, specialty, and specialist occupation. A total of 55.7% received good direct knowledge from all healthcare providers. In practice, 48% had good practices toward COVID-19. The overall attitude mean was 2.8, from a maximum score of 7, indicating a positive attitude toward COVID-19. Conclusions The study-demonstrated gaps in specific aspects of knowledge and practice that should be focused on in future education and HCP awareness. A structured training program targeting all HCPs is needed to have good clinical knowledge and practice about COVID-19.","Alghfeli, A. K.; Al Zarouni, A. A. R.; Alremeithi, H. M.; Almadhaani, R.

Besides the evident pulmonary and cardiovascular threats, accumulating clinical data points to several neurological complications, which are more common in elderly COVID-19 patients. Recent pieces of evidence have marked events of neuro infection and neuroinvasion, producing several neurological complications in COVID-19 patients; however, a systematic understanding of neuro-pathophysiology and manifested neurological complications, more specifically in elderly COVID-19 patients is largely elusive. Since the elderly population gradually develops neurological disorders with aging, COVID-19 inevitably poses a higher risk of neurological manifestations to the aged patients. In this report, we reviewed SARS-CoV-2 infection and its role in neurological manifestations with an emphasis on the elderly population. We reviewed neuropathological events including neuroinfection, neuroinvasion, and their underlying mechanisms affecting neuromuscular, central- and peripheral- nervous systems. We further assessed the imminent neurological challenges in the COVID-19 exposed population, post-SARS-CoV-2-infection. Given the present state of clinical preparedness, the emerging role of AI and machine learning was also discussed concerning COVID-19 diagnostics and its management. Taken together, the present review summarizes neurological outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated complications, specifically in elderly patients, and underlines the need for their clinical management in advance.","Kalra, Rajkumar Singh; Dhanjal, Jaspreet Kaur; Meena, Avtar Singh; Kalel, Vishal C.; Dahiya, Surya; Singh, Birbal; Dewanjee, Saikat; Kandimalla, Ramesh",Front Aging Neurosci,310,26

Relatively small genomes and high replication rates allow viruses to accumulate mutations and continuously present the host with new challenges. It is therefore, no surprise that they either escape detection or modulate host physiology, often by redirecting normal cellular pathways to their own advantage. Viruses utilize a diverse array of strategies and molecular targets to subvert host cellular processes, while evading detection. These include cell-cycle regulation, major histocompatibility complex-restricted antigen presentation, intracellular protein transport, apoptosis, cytokine-mediated signaling, and humoral immune responses. Moreover, viruses routinely manipulate the host cell cycle to create a favorable environment for replication, largely by deregulating cell cycle checkpoints. This review focuses on our current understanding of the molecular aspects of cell cycle regulation that are often targeted by viruses. Further study of their interactions should provide fundamental insights into cell cycle regulation and improve our ability to exploit these viruses.","Fan, Ying; Sanyal, Sumana; Bruzzone, Roberto",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,310,16

This study examines the direct effects of COVID-19 on the delivery of inpatient care in Croatia. Materials and Methods: The research is a retrospective, comparative analysis of the hospital admission rate across all Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) classes before and during the pandemic. It is based on DRG data from all non-specialized acute hospitals in Croatia, which account for 96% of national inpatient activity. The study also used COVID-19 data from the Croatian Institute of Public Health (CIPH). Results: The results show a 21% decrease in the total number of admissions [incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.8, p < 0.0001] across the hospital network during the pandemic in 2020, with the greatest drop occurring in April, when admissions plunged by 51%. The decrease in activity occurred in non-elective DRG classes such as cancers, stroke, major chest procedures, heart failure, and renal failure. Coinciding with this reduction however, there was a 37% increase (IRR 1.39, p < 0.0001) in case activity across six COVID-19 related DRG classes. Conclusions: The reduction in hospital inpatient activity during 2020, can be attributed to a number of factors such as lock-downs and quarantining, reorganization of hospital operations, the rationing of the medical workforce, and the reluctance of people to seek hospital care. Further research is needed to examine the consequences of disruption to hospital care in Croatia. Our recommendation is to invest multidisciplinary effort in reviewing response procedures to emergencies such as COVID-19 with the aim of minimizing their impact on other, and equally important community health care needs.","Kalanj, Karolina; Marshall, Ric; Karol, Karl; Tiljak, Mirjana Kujundžić; Orešković, Stjepan",Front Public Health,310,1

Given the novelty of the virus, and hence, lack of official guidance on effective containment strategies, individual countries opted for different containment approaches ranging from herd immunity to strict lockdown. The opposing strategies followed by the United Kingdom and its former colony, Malaysia, stand exemplary for this. Real‐time polymerase chain reaction was implemented for testing in both counties. Malaysia acted with strict quarantining rules and infection surveillance. The United Kingdom followed an initially lenient, herd‐immunity approach with strict lockdown only enforced weeks later. Although based on the same health‐care structure historically, Malaysia developed a more unified health system compared with the United Kingdom. We suggest that this more centralized structure could be one possible explanation for why Malaysia was able to react in a more timely and efficient manner, despite its closer geographic proximity to China. We further explore how the differences in testing and quarantining strategy, as well as political situation and societal compliance could account for the discrepancy in the United Kingdom's versus Malaysia's relative success of COVID‐19 containment.","Allaham, Shereen; Demel, Isabel‐Cathérine; Nur, Intesar; Abu Salim, Faizul Nizam; Manikam, Logan",World Med Health Policy,310,1

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective analysis of non-enhanced computer tomographic scans has been performed in the main center for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in Blinded for those scanned from 13(th) of March 2020 to 13(th) of May 2020. Included scans were routinely performed during 24 -hs of admission apart from having respiratory complaint. CT protocol included non-enhanced 1 mm slice thickness by Philips Brilliance Big Bore scanner (Philips; Amsterdam, Netherlands). All computer tomographic scans were reviewed by two senior radiologists with more than 8 years of experience each and senior registrar. Several factors have been thoroughly studied including patient age, gender, positive versus negative pulmonary findings, laterality of lung involvement, lobar distribution, pattern of pulmonary changes on initial and follow-up scans. RESULTS: The total number of patients evaluated was 302. There were 188 men and 114 women studied. Among the totally studied 302 cases; 181 cases (59.9%) showed no pulmonary changes. Positive findings were present in 121 patients with a total number of 191 computer tomographic scans including initial and follow-up scans. Positive findings were present in 51 female and 70 male patients (age range, 12 - 87 years; mean age ± standard deviation, 46.1 ± 16.5). Bilateral disease was more frequently encountered presented in 86 cases (71.1%), while unilateral disease showed two times more predilection for the right lung compared to the left. The incidence of lobar involvement in descending order: right lower (75.2%), left lower (71.9%), right upper (62.8%), left upper (60.3%) and right middle (50.4%). The incidence of the affected lobes on the initial scans were as follow: one (24 %), two (10.7 %), three (9.1 %), four (16.5 %) five (36.4 %). In cases with single lobar involvement (24%); the left upper and right middle lobes showed lowest incidence of involvement accounting for 10.3 % & 13.8 %, respectively; on the other hand, in cases with four lobar involvement (16.5%); the right middle lobe was most commonly spared in two third of cases (63.2 %). Several initial patterns of the pulmonary changes resulting from Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were present with a descending order; ground-glass pattern (96.7%), lenticular pattern (32.2%), Halo sign (15.7% %), rounded (14.9 %), nodular (10.7%), ground-glass with consolidation (8.3%), tree-in-bud (1.7 %) and pleural effusion (1.7 %). Pathologically-enlarged lymph node was not a feature of COVID-19. The total number of patients with positive findings having follow-up scans was 57 including single (45 patients) versus two (12 patients) follow-up scans. Initial follow up scans showed regression and progression of the pulmonary changes in 35 and 22 patients, respectively. A remarkable pattern was seen in almost all regressed cases that showed patchy reticular pattern changes with septal thickening which was referred to “pulmonary synapses” (34 patients) with only one patient showed complete resolution of the parenchymal changes. Patterns seen in progressed cases were lenticular ground-glass (63.6%) vs patchy ground-glass (36.4 %) patterns. CONCLUSION: Computer tomographic scan of the chest is a principal diagnostic measure for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pulmonary changes showed more propensity being bilateral disease and affecting the lower lobes, while the right middle lobe was the least likely involvement. Several pattern of pulmonary changes can be seen on initial scans including ground glass, consolidation, Halo sign, lenticular, nodular, pleural effusion and tree-in-bud patterns. The tree-in-bud is first time described pattern of COVID-19 in the current article and thought to be an excluding criterion. In follow-up scans; the lenticular and patchy ground-glass patterns were present in cases with disease progression, compared with “pulmonary synapses” pattern encountered in cases with disease regression.","Albtoush, Omar M.; Al-Shdefat, Rawan B.; Al-Akaileh, Abed",Eur J Radiol Open,310,20

We recently observed patients with documented COVID-19 develop de novo severe genitourinary symptoms, most notably urinary frequency of ≥ 13 episodes/24 hours and nocturia ≥ 4 episodes/night. We call these associated urinary symptoms COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC). COVID-19 severity is associated with inflammation. We collected urine samples from COVID-19 patients, including patients with CAC, and found elevation of proinflammatory cytokines also in the urine. It has been previously shown that patients with urinary incontinence and ulcerative interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome have elevated urinary inflammatory cytokines compared to normal controls. We therefore hypothesize that CAC, with presentation of de novo severe urinary symptoms, can occur in COVID-19 and is caused by increased inflammatory cytokines that are released into the urine and/or expressed in the bladder. The most important implications of our hypothesis are: 1) Physician caring for COVID-19 patients should be aware of COVID-19 associate cystitis (CAC); 2) De novo urinary symptoms should be included in the symptom complex associated with COVID-19; and 3) COVID-19 inflammation may result in bladder dysfunction.","Lamb, Laura E.; Dhar, Nivedita; Timar, Ryan; Wills, Melissa; Dhar, Sorabh; Chancellor, Michael B.",Med Hypotheses,310,22

Of the participants, 106 subjects (32.1%) showed signs of an anxiety disorder and 26 (7.65%) of a depressive disorder. An anxiety disorder was significantly associated with mental workload, changes in working hours, difficulties in teleworking due to issues of internet connection or due to noise, difficulties in combining family and occupational life, sleep disturbance, worry about media information and worry about the health of a loved one. An anxiety disorder remained associated with occupational stress and personal stress during lockdown after a multivariate logistic regression. Conclusions: This study highlighted the association between an anxiety disorder and perceived occupational and personal stress levels in hospital staff teleworking during the first lockdown. Stress management workshops could be proposed to hospital staff. Prevention of anxiety requires reinforced medical monitoring and reduced stress.","Pelissier, Carole; Paredes, Joelane; Moulin, Martine; Bitot, Thierry; Fakra, Eric; Fontana, Luc",Int J Environ Res Public Health,310,21

This study aims to investigate the association between soluble TREM-1 (sTREM-1) and COVID-19 as a prognostic biomarker to predict the disease severity, lethality and clinical management.Methods: We enrolled 91 patients with COVID-19 in domiciliary care (44 patients) or in hospital care (47 patients), who were classified after admission into mild, moderate, severe and critical groups according to their clinical scores. As non-COVID-19 control, 30 healthy volunteers were included. Data on demographic, comorbidities and baseline clinical characteristics were obtained from their medical and nurse records. Peripheral blood samples were collected at admission and after hospitalization outcome to assess cytokine profile and sTREM-1 level by specific immunoassays Results: Within COVID-19 patients, the highest severity was associated with the most significant elevated plasma levels sTREM-1. Using receiver operating curve analysis (ROC), sTREM-1 was found to be predictive of disease severity (AUC= 0.988) and the best cut-off value for predicting in-hospital severity was [≥] 116.5 pg/mL with the sensitivity for 93.3% and specificity for 95.8%. We also described the clinical characteristics of these patients and explored the correlation with markers of the disease aggravation. The levels of sTREM-1 were positively correlated with IL-6, IL-10, blood neutrophils counts, and critical disease scoring (r= 0.68, p<0.0001). On the other hand, sTREM-1 level was significantly negative correlated with lymphocytes counting, and mild disease (r= -0.42, p<0.0001). Higher levels of sTREM-1 were related to poor outcome and death, patients who received dexamethasone tended to have lower sTREM-1 levels. Conclusion: Our results indicated that sTREM-1 in COVID-19 is associated with severe disease development and a prognostic marker for mortality. The use of severity biomarkers such as sTREM-1 together with patients clinical scores could improve the early recognition and monitoring of COVID-19 cases with higher risk of disease worsening.

This study plans to enroll 1224 patients from 34 VA Medical Centers into a 12- week prospective, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial comparing trazodone, eszopiclone, and gabapentin. The primary outcome measure is insomnia, assessed with the Insomnia Severity Index. A novel aspect of this study is its adaptive design. At the recruitment midpoint, an interim analysis will be conducted to inform a decision to close recruitment to any ""futile"" arms (i.e. arms where further recruitment is very unlikely to yield a significant result) while maintaining the overall study recruitment target. This step could result in the enrichment of the remaining study arms, enhancing statistical power for the remaining comparisons to placebo.

Residents can experience uncontrolled symptoms, poor quality deaths and avoidable hospitalisations. Care home staff can feel unsupported to look after residents at the end of life. Approaches for improving end-of-life care are often education-focused, do not triage residents and rarely integrate clinical care. This study will adapt an evidence-based approach from Australia for the UK context called ‘Palliative Care Needs Rounds’ (Needs Rounds). Needs Rounds combine triaging, anticipatory person-centred planning, case-based education and case-conferencing; the Australian studies found that Needs Rounds reduce length of stay in hospital, and improve dying in preferred place of care, and symptoms at the end of life. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This implementation science study will codesign and implement a scalable UK model of Needs Rounds. The Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARIHS) framework will be used to identify contextual barriers and use facilitation to enable successful implementation. Six palliative care teams, working with 4–6 care homes each, will engage in two phases. In phase 1 (February 2021), stakeholder interviews (n=40) will be used to develop a programme theory to meet the primary outcome of identifying what works, for whom in what circumstances for UK Needs Rounds. Subsequently a workshop to codesign UK Needs Rounds will be run. Phase 2 (July 2021) will implement the UK model for a year. Prospective data collection will focus on secondary outcomes regarding hospitalisations, residents’ quality of death and care home staff capability of adopting a palliative approach. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Frenchay Research Ethics Committee (287447) approved the study. Findings will be disseminated to policy-makers, care home/palliative care practitioners, residents/relatives and academic audiences. An implementation package will be developed for practitioners to provide the tools and resources required to adopt UK Needs Rounds.

In fact, in recent years, various HOCl fluorescent probes have been developed unprecedentively based on various mechanisms. However, because most of the mechanisms are based on the oxidation characteristics of HOCl, the excellent detection performance of probes depends on the activation ability of some functional groups to reaction sites. The C = C bond in the probe is often oxidized by HOCl to realize HOCl detection. However, due to the break of conjugated structure, the probe often present as a quenchable or turning on fluorescence emission. In this work, malononitrile was introduced as the ""double-edged sword"" of passivation-activation when in HOCl fluorescent probe was designed.

Despite the knowledge of these viruses since the 1970’s, vaccination strategies have not been implemented, leading to continuous re-emergence of novel virulent strains. Live attenuated vaccines historically have been the most efficient. We consider that the new trend is the development of recombinant vaccines by using reverse genetics systems to engineer attenuated viruses, which could be used as effective and safe modified live vaccine candidates. To this end, host cell signaling pathways influencing porcine CoV virulence should be identified. Similarly, the identity of viral proteins involved in the modulation of host cell pathways influencing CoV pathogenesis should be analyzed. With this information, and using reverse genetics systems, it is possible to design viruses with modifications in the viral proteins acting as virulence factors, which may lead to attenuated viruses and, therefore, vaccine candidates. In addition, novel antiviral drugs may be developed once the host cell pathways and the molecular mechanism affecting porcine CoV replication and virulence are known. This review is focused in the host cell responses to enteric porcine CoV infection and the viral proteins involved in pathogenesis.","Zuñiga, Sonia; Pascual-Iglesias, Alejandro; Sanchez, Carlos M.; Sola, Isabel; Enjuanes, Luis",Virus Research,310,1

Understanding healthcare workers' (HCWs) knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) toward COVID-19 in the early stages of the pandemic could inform their medical training and improve their preparedness. Methods: A online national cross-sectional survey was conducted between May 26th and May 30th, 2020, to assess KAPs among HCWs in Venezuela. Results: A total of 1,441 HCWs from all 24 regions of the country responded to the survey. The mean age of the HCWs was 44 (SD [standard deviation] 14) years; most were women (66.4%). Most HCWs were specialized doctors (48%), followed by nurses (13%) and resident doctors (12.3%). The majority of HCWs had good knowledge (76.3%), obtained information mainly from scientific literature (85.4%); had negative attitudes (53.6%), felt uncomfortable with their work during the current pandemic (59.8%); and reported appropriate practices (76.9%). However, participation in COVID-19 related training was absent in more than half of the HCWs. Positive attitudes were significantly more frequent in frontline workers than in non-frontline workers (p = 0.001). Bioanalysts, students, and doctors were more likely to have good knowledge; participating in training was a predictor for positive attitudes and older age was an appropriate practice predictor. Conclusions: HCWs, knowledge in Venezuela could be improved by strengthening education and training programs.

More effective treatments that shorten hospital stay and reduce mortality are needed. Initial reports for the use of convalescent plasma (CP) therapy for COVID-19 appear promising. We describe a case series of eight patients with impending respiratory failure, who underwent CP therapy. Methods: Six male and two female (ages 31 to 79) patients that were admitted to the intensive-care unit for severe COVID-19 were transfused with two doses of CP (250 mL per dose, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG titers > 1:100). Donors were six SARS-CoV-2 infected males who remained asymptomatic for > 7 days and were negative for two nasopharyngeal RT-PCR tests. Clinical characteristics, inflammatory and cellular injury markers, chest X-ray findings and viral loads were analyzed before and after CP administration. Viral load association to disease severity was further analyzed on a separate cohort of asymptomatic vs hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Results: Eight patients with respiratory failure were successfully discharged with a median length of stay of 22.5 (IQR 18.25-29.00). After CP therapy, we observed a reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) (median, 22.80 mg/dL vs. 1.63 mg/dL), and of procalcitonin (median, 0.27 ng/mL vs. 0.13 ng/mL). High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI), Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) and Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) were lower, and a mild reduction of pulmonary infiltrates by chest X-ray was observed. Lastly, a reduction of viral load was after CP therapy was found. (log, median [IQR], 1.2 [0.70-2.20] vs. 0.25 [0.00-1.78]). We observed no adverse effects.

The aim of our study is to evaluate the activity trend of the first six months of 2020 in our hospital. Data will be compared to the two semesters of 2019, in order to have two objective samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all the orthopedics surgical procedures performed at Guglielmo da Saliceto Hospital (Piacenza, Emilia Romagna, Northern Italy) between January 1(st) and June 30(th) 2020. 2019 semesters (January 1(st) - June 30(th) 2020 and July 1(st) - December 31(st) 2020) have been used as control group to evaluate the activity trend of the first six months of 2020, compared to the two semesters of 2019. RESULTS: We noticed a significant increase of domestic and retirement houses accidents, a consistent increase in one-month mortality rate of 2020 first semester and a decrease of mean hospitalization time. About surgical procedures, we detect a drop in the total number: in the first semester of 2020 we performed 499 (-39.9%) surgeries less than the first semester of 2019 and 337 (-30.9%) then the second one. Traumatology recorded a decrease of 27.6% than the first semester of 2019 (-204 surgeries) and of 26.3% than the second one (-191 surgeries).

Typically, these methods use a suspension of the test organism to assess the bactericidal, fungicidal or virucidal activity of a given preparation. However, such suspension methods do not fully imitate real-life conditions. To address this issue, carrier methods have been developed, in which microorganisms are applied to the surface of a carrier (e.g., stainless steel, glass and polyvinyl chloride (PVC)) and then dried. Such methods more accurately reflect the applications in real-life clinical practice.

Moreover, rapidly testing many potentially infected individuals is often a limiting factor in controlling COVID-19 outbreaks. Hence, pooling strategies, wherein individuals are grouped and tested simultaneously, are employed. Here, we present a novel pooling strategy that builds on the Bayesian D-optimal experimental design criterion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our strategy, called DOPE (D-Optimal Pooling Experimental design), is built on a novel Bayesian formulation of pooling. DOPE defines optimal pooled tests as those maximizing the mutual information between data and infection states. We estimate said mutual information via Monte-Carlo sampling and employ a discrete optimization heuristic to maximize it. RESULTS: We compare DOPE to other, commonly used pooling strategies, as well as to individual testing. DOPE dominates the other strategies as it yields lower error rates while utilizing fewer tests. We show that DOPE maintains this dominance for a variety of infection prevalence values. DISCUSSION: DOPE has several additional advantages over common pooling strategies: it provides posterior distributions of the probability of infection, rather than only binary classification outcomes; it naturally incorporates prior information of infection probabilities and test error rates; and finally, it can be easily extended to include other, newly discovered information regarding COVID-19. CONCLUSION: DOPE can substantially improve accuracy and throughput over current pooling strategies. Hence, DOPE can facilitate rapid testing and aid the efforts of combating COVID-19 and other future pandemics.","Daon, Yair; Huppert, Amit; Obolski, Uri",J Am Med Inform Assoc,310,20

Within the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common nosocomial infection that is frequently caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing challenge in the care of critically ill patients. Escalating rates of antibiotic resistance add substantially to the morbidity, mortality, and cost related to infection in the ICU. Both gram-positive organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus , and gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Acinetobacter species, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae , such as the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase–producing bacteria, and extended spectrum β-lactamase organisms, have contributed to the escalating rates of resistance seen in VAP and other nosocomial infections. The rising rates of antimicrobial resistance have led to the routine empiric administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics even when bacterial infection is not documented. Moreover, there are several new broader-spectrum antibiotics that have recently become available and others scheduled for approval in the near future. The challenge to ICU clinicians is how to most effectively utilize these agents to maximize patient benefits while minimizing further emergence of resistance. Use of rapid diagnostics may hold the key for achieving this important balance. There is an urgent need for integrating the administration of new and existing antibiotics with the emerging rapid diagnostic technologies in a way that is both cost-effective and sustainable for the long run.","Kollef, Marin H.; Burnham, Carey-Ann D.",Semin Respir Crit Care Med,310,16

Because it grows well in cell culture, FCV is often used as a model virus of non-culturable caliciviruses. In this study, a cell-free and two cell culture-based biosensor assay systems were established to detect FCV protease activity. The assays utilize luciferase sensor technology or second-generation bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET(2)). A luciferase sensor was designed to contain an FCV protease cleavage motif within the permutated luciferase (GloSensor). The BRET(2)-based probe contained the same cleavage motif flanked by a renilla luciferase and a variant of green fluorescent protein. To confirm the specificity of these assay systems, GloSensor or a BRET(2)-based probe containing a mutation in the cleavage motif was also constructed. In a cell-free assay, GloSensor showed increased luminescence in proportion to the amount of FCV protease, while no signal change was observed when the construct harboring the mutant cleavage motif was used. A feline cell line stably expressing GloSensor or the BRET(2)-based probe was established. Increased levels of GloSensor luminescence, and decreased levels of BRET(2) signals were observed according to input FCV titers. In contrast, no significant signal change was observed in the cells stably expressing the mutant cleavage motif. GloSensor and the BRET(2)-based probe were capable of detecting the inhibitory activity of ribavirin in FCV-infected cells.

Returning travellers were identified with infections caused by lineage B.1.258, as well as the more transmissible B.1.1.7 lineage, which has replaced B.1.411 to fuel the ongoing large outbreak in the country. Conclusions: The large outbreak that started in early October, is due to spread of a single virus lineage, B.1.411 until the end of March 2021, when B.1.1.7 emerged and became the dominant lineage.","Jeewandara, Chandima; Jayathilaka, Deshni; Ranasinghe, Diyanath; Hsu, Nienyun Sharon; Ariyaratne, Dinuka; Jayadas, Tibutius Thanesh; Panambara Arachchige, Deshan Madhusanka; Lindsey, Benjamin B.; Gomes, Laksiri; Parker, Matthew D.; Wijewickrama, Ananda; Karunaratne, Malika; Ogg, Graham S.; de Silva, Thushan I.; Malavige, Gathsaurie Neelika",Front Microbiol,310,22

The capsid (Cp) of WNV is thought to play a role in inducing these symptoms through caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. Using WNVCp as bait for a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified that Hsp70 interacted with WNVCp. The interaction between Hsp70 and WNVCp was further substantiated using purified proteins. Deletion analysis of Hsp70 indicated that WNVCp could bind to the substrate binding domain of Hsp70. The presence of WNVCp in the Hsp70-dependent folding system inhibited the refolding of β-galactosidase (β-gal), which showed that WNVCp might function as a negative regulator of Hsp70. Finally, the cytotoxic effect of WNVCp in 293T cells was prevented by ectopic Hsp70, suggesting a negative regulatory role of Hsp70 on WNVCp. Our findings suggest a possible negative regulatory role of Hps70 in the pathway of WNV infection.","Oh, Won-kyung; Song, Jaewhan",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,310,33

We used a novel application of Optimal Transport for computing the distance between the normalized patterns induced by bivariate time series for each pair of cities. Thus, we identified 10 clusters of cities with similar temporal dependencies, and computed the Wasserstein barycenter to describe the overall dynamic pattern for each cluster.

ABSTRACT The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is leading to high mortality and a global health crisis. The primary involvement is respiratory; however, the virus can also affect other organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and liver. The most common symptoms are anorexia and diarrhea. In about half of the cases, viral RNA could be detected in the stool, which is another line of transmission and diagnosis. COVID19 has a worse prognosis in patients with comorbidities, although there is not enough evidence in case of previous digestive diseases. Digestive endoscopies may give rise to aerosols, which make them techniques with a high risk of infection. Experts and scientific organizations worldwide have developed guidelines for preventive measures. The available evidence on gastrointestinal and hepatic involvement, the impact on patients with previous digestive diseases and operating guidelines for Endoscopy Units during the pandemic are reviewed.","Sanz Segura, P; Arguedas Lázaro, Y; Mostacero Tapia, S; Cabrera Chaves, T; Sebastián Domingo Juan, J",Gastroenterol Hepatol,310,26

Methods: Data from 143 COVID-19 patients over 65 years of age admitted to the Humanitas Clinical and Research Center Emergency Department (Milan, Italy) and treated with Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) or Darunavir/cobicistat (DVR/c) associated to Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed by using a logistic regression model and survival analysis to assess the role of different predictors of in-hospital mortality, including an early (<6 days from symptoms onset) vs. late treatment onset, signs and symptoms at COVID-19 presentation, type of antiviral treatment (LPV/r or DVR/c) and patients’ age (65–80 vs. >80 years old). Results: Multivariate analysis showed that an older age (OR: 2.54) and dyspnea as presenting symptom (OR: 2.01) were associated with higher mortality rate, whereas cough as presenting symptom (OR: 0.53) and a timely drug administration (OR: 0.44) were associated with lower mortality. Survival analysis demonstrated that the timing of drug administration had an impact on mortality in 65–80 years-old patients (p = 0.02), whereas no difference was seen in those >80 years-old. This impact was more evident in patients with dyspnea as primary symptom of COVID-19, in whom mortality decreased from 57.1% to 38.3% due to timely drug administration (OR: 0.5; p = 0.04). Conclusions: There was a significant association between the use of a combined antiviral regimen and HCQ and lower mortality, when timely-administered, in COVID-19 patients aged 65–80 years. Our findings support timely treatment onset as a key component in the treatment of COVID-19.","Desai, Antonio; Caltagirone, Giuseppe; Sari, Sharon; Pocaterra, Daria; Kogan, Maria; Azzolini, Elena; Savevski, Victor; Martinelli-Boneschi, Filippo; Voza, Antonio",J Clin Med,310,26

Despite the obvious negative consequences of the pandemic, many have called for efforts to identify transformative opportunities for sustainable development throughout this disorderly time. In the present paper, we explore such potential opportunities in the context of an interdisciplinary, international research project, which is focusing on sustainable marine management in biosphere reserves and marine parks in Southeast Asia. During a virtual workshop conducted as part of the GCRF (Government’s Global Challenges Research Fund) Blue Communities Project, future scenarios were developed depicting the potential effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on five case study sites. All of these sites are in areas of internationally recognized outstanding ecological value (Taka Bonerate Kepulauan-Selayar Biosphere Reserve, Indonesia; Tun Mustapha Park, Sabah, Malaysia; Palawan Biosphere Reserve, Philippines; North Devon Biosphere Reserve, United Kingdom; Cu Lao Cham-Hoi An Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam). At the macro-level, economies, governance structures, and societal norms are undergoing big changes. At the micro-level, the livelihoods, lifestyles, and backyards of local residents have to adapt. Collaboratively, we explored how COVID-19 posed challenges in our five case study sites, but we also focused on the potential COVID-19-related windows of opportunity for future sustainable development. Opportunities could be identified in all three pillars of sustainable development: the environment, the society, and the economy. Although remarkable similarities can be found across all five sites, we conclude that there cannot be a “one-size-fits-all” solution to turn the tide toward achieving sustainable development. Just as before the pandemic, sustainable development starts with engaging with and understanding local environments, challenges, and situations; building on local knowledge; and developing tailor-made solutions for the communities in situ.","Richter, Isabell; Avillanosa, Arlene; Cheung, Victoria; Goh, Hong Ching; Johari, Sofia; Kay, Susan; Maharja, Carya; Nguyễn, Thu Hà; Pahl, Sabine; Sugardjito, Jito; Sumeldan, Joel; van Nguyen, Quyen; Vu, Hien Thuc; Wan Mohamad Ariffin, Wan Nur Syazana; Austen, Melanie C.",Front Psychol,310,28

Until September 10(th), 2020, Indonesia had submitted 54 WGS. In this study, we have analyzed and annotated SARS-CoV-2 mutations in spike protein and main proteases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) of Indonesia were obtained from GISAID data base. The 54 data were taken from March to September 10(th), 2020. The sequences corresponded to Spike Protein (SP), 3-chymotrypsin like protease (3CLpro), and papain like protease (PLpro) were selected. The Wuhan genome was used as reference. RESULTS: In total WGS from Indonesia, we found 5 major clades, which dominated as G clade, where the mutation of D614G was found. This D614G was identified as much as 59%, which mostly reported in late samples submitted. Beside D614G mutation, we report three unique mutations: A352S, S477I, and Q677H. Besides, some mutations were also detected in two domains that were expected to be conserved region, the main viral proteases: PLpro (P77L and V205I), 3CLpro (M49I and L50F). CONCLUSION: The analysis of SARS-CoV-2 from WGS Indonesia showed a high genetic variation. The diversity in SARS-CoV-2 may epidemiologically enhance virulence and transmission of this virus.

Three typical spatial information parameters including working unit/address, onset location and reporting unit were selected and SARS epidemic spread in-out flow in Beijing was defined based on the SARS epidemiological investigation data in China from 2002 to 2003 while its epidemiological characteristics were discussed. Furthermore, by the methods of spatial-temporal statistical analysis and network characteristic analysis, spatial-temporal high-risk hotspots and network structure characteristics of Beijing outer in-out flow were explored, and spatial autocorrelation/heterogeneity, spatial-temporal evolutive rules and structure characteristics of the spread network of Beijing inner in-out flow were comprehensively analyzed. The results show that (1) The outer input flow of SARS epidemic in Beijing concentrated on Shanxi and Guangdong provinces, but the outer output flow was disperse and mainly includes several north provinces such as Guangdong and Shandong. And the control measurement should focus on the early and interim progress of SARS breakout. (2) The inner output cases had significant positive autocorrelative characteristics in the whole studied region, and the high-risk population was young and middle-aged people with ages from 20 to 60 and occupations of medicine and civilian labourer. (3) The downtown districts were main high-risk hotspots of SARS epidemic in Beijing, the northwest suburban districts/counties were secondary high-risk hotspots, and northeast suburban areas were relatively safe. (4) The district/county nodes in inner spread network showed small-world characteristics and information/material flow had notable heterogeneity. The suburban Tongzhou and Changping districts were the underlying high-risk regions, and several suburban districts such as Shunyi and Huairou were the relatively low-risk safe regions as they carried out minority information/material flow. The exploration and analysis based on epidemic spread in-out flow help better detect and discover the potential spatial-temporal evolutive rules and characteristics of SARS epidemic, and provide a more effective theoretical basis for emergency/control measurements and decision-making.","Hu, BiSong; Gong, JianHua; Zhou, JiePing; Sun, Jun; Yang, LiYang; Xia, Yu; Ibrahim, Abdoul Nasser",Sci China Earth Sci,310,18

Individual personality differences played a key role in perceived psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. The present exploratory study sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and identify how psychological wellbeing is influenced by personality traits. A total of 2103 participants (64% female and 36% male) completed an online survey that included the Psychological General Wellbeing Index (PGWBI), the Italian Short Personality Inventory (ITAPI), and a general questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regressions were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) (The findings showed poor psychological wellbeing in the Italian population. Young people reported the lowest scores.

Overall, 224 patients were hospitalized, median age 60 (50-69) years. Black race was a significant factor in the Confirmed + PUI, female and male models (ORs from 1.98 to 2.19). Obesity was associated with higher hospitalization odds in the confirmed, confirmed + PUI, Black and male models (ORs from 1.78 to 2.77). Chronic disease control metrics (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) were associated with lower odds of hospitalization ranging from 48% to 35% in the confirmed + PUI and Black models. Self-reported physical inactivity was associated with 50% higher hospitalization odds in the Black and Female models. Residence in the Northeast region of Atlanta was associated with lower hospitalization odds in the Confirmed + PUI, White and female models (ORs from 0.22 to 0.64) Conclusions: We found that non-Hispanic Black KPGA members had a disproportionately higher risk of infection and, after adjusting for covariates, twice the risk of hospitalization compared to other race groups. We found no significant differences in clinical outcomes or mortality across race/ethnicity groups. In addition to age, sex and comorbidity burden, pre-pandemic self-reported exercise, metrics on quality of care and control of underlying cardio-metabolic diseases, and location of residence in Atlanta were significantly associated with hospitalization risk by race groups. Beyond well-known physiologic and clinical factors, individual and community-level social indicators and health behaviors must be considered as interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 disparities and the systemic effects of racism are implemented.","Lobelo, F.; Bienvenida, A.

Amidst increasing interest in international partnerships to address such issues, how best to develop such collaborations is being actively debated. In 2006, a partnership developed between occupational health and infection control experts in Canada and institutions in South Africa (including an institute with a national mandate to conduct research and provide guidance to protect health workers from infectious diseases and promote improved working conditions). This article describes the collaboration, analyzes the determinants of success and shares lessons learned. METHODS: Synthesizing participant-observer experience from over 9 years of collaboration and 10 studies already published from this work, we applied a realist review analysis to describe the various achievements at global, national, provincial and hospital levels. Expectations of the various parties on developing new insights, providing training, and addressing service needs were examined through a micro-meso-macro lens, focusing on how each main partner organization contributed to and benefitted from working together. RESULTS: A state-of-the-art occupational health and safety surveillance program was established in South Africa following successful technology transfer from a similar undertaking in Canada and training was conducted that synergistically benefitted Northern as well as Southern trainees. Integrated policies combining infection control and occupational health to prevent and control infectious disease transmission among health workers were also launched. Having a national (South-South) network reinforced by the international (North–south) partnership was pivotal in mitigating the challenges that emerged. CONCLUSIONS: High-income country partnerships with experience in health system strengthening – particularly in much needed areas such as occupational health and infection control – can effectively work through strong collaborators in the Global South to build capacity. Partnerships are particularly well positioned to sustainably reinforce efforts at national and sub-national LMIC levels when they adopt a “communities of practice” model, characterized by multi-directional learning. The principles of effective collaboration learned in this “partnership of partnerships” to improve working conditions for health workers can be applied to other areas where health system strengthening is needed.","Yassi, Annalee; Zungu, Muzimkhulu; Spiegel, Jerry M.; Kistnasamy, Barry; Lockhart, Karen; Jones, David; O’Hara, Lyndsay M.; Nophale, Letshego; Bryce, Elizabeth A.; Darwin, Lincoln",Global Health,310,28

However, most relevant studies are retrospective, and the optimal NLR cut-off point has not been determined. The objective of our research was identification and validation of the best NLR cut-off value on admission that could predict high in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Medical files of all patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia in our dedicated COVID-units between March and April 2020 (derivation cohort) and between October and December 2020 (validation cohort) were reviewed. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were included in the study (198 in the derivation and 101 in the validation cohort, respectively). Youden’s J statistic in the derivation cohort determined the optimal cut-off value for the performance of NLR at admission to predict mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The NLR cut-off value of 5.94 had a sensitivity of 62% and specificity of 64%. In ROC curve analysis, the AUC was 0.665 [95% CI 0.530–0.801, p= 0.025]. In the validation cohort, the best predictive cut-off value of NLR was 6.4, which corresponded to a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 64% with AUC 0.766 [95% CI 0.651–0.881, p <0.001]. When the NLR cut-off value of 5.94 was applied in the validation cohort, there was no significant difference in death and survival in comparison with the derivation NLR cut-off. Net reclassification improvement (NRI) analysis showed no significant classification change in outcome between both NLR cut-off values (NRI:0.012, p=0.31). CONCLUSION: In prospective analysis, an NLR value of 5.94 predicted high in-hospital mortality upon admission in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia.","Yildiz, Halil; Castanares-Zapatero, Diego; Pierman, Guillaume; Pothen, Lucie; De Greef, Julien; Aboubakar Nana, Frank; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector; Belkhir, Leila; Yombi, Jean Cyr",Int J Gen Med,310,21

Factors contributing to IPNV pathogenicity are yet poorly understood. Indications of IPNV being able to evade or counteract innate host defense come from its lack of ability to induce strong type I interferon (IFN) responses in cell culture. We show here that addition of salmon rIFN-α1 to cells prior to IPNV infection halts the viral protein synthesis and prevents processing of pVP2 into mature VP2. Furthermore, compared to pre-treatment with IFN-α1 the antiviral state in cells infected with IPNV prior to IFN-treatment, was antagonized by IPNV, as detected by higher viral titers, faster viral protein synthesis and also by reduced Mx expression. The longer headstart the virus gets, the more prominent is the weakening of IFN signaling. IPNV VP4 and VP5 inhibit IFN-induced expression from the Mx promoter, indicating that these proteins contribute to the antagonistic effect.","Skjesol, Astrid; Aamo, Toril; Hegseth, Marit Nøst; Robertsen, Børre; Jørgensen, Jorunn B.",Virus Res,310,16

The drug employs pH-dependent inhibition of functioning and signalling of the endosome, lysosome and trans-Golgi network, immunomodulatory actions, inhibition of autophagy and interference with receptor binding to treat cancer and many viral diseases. The ongoing pandemic of COVID-19 has brought the whole world on the knees, seeking an urgent hunt for an anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. Chloroquine has shown to inhibit receptor binding of the viral particles, interferes with their replication and inhibits “cytokine storm”. Though multiple modes of actions have been employed by chloroquine against multiple diseases, viral diseases can provide an added advantage to establish the anti–SARS-CoV-2 mechanism, the in vitro and in vivo trials against SARS-CoV-2 have yielded mixed results. The toxicological effects and dosage optimization of chloroquine have been studied for many diseases, though it needs a proper evaluation again as chloroquine is also associated with several toxicities. Moreover, the drug is inexpensive and is readily available in many countries. Though much of the hope has been created by chloroquine and its derivatives against multiple diseases, repurposing it against SARS-CoV-2 requires large scale, collaborative, randomized and unbiased clinical trials to avoid false promises. This review summarizes the use and the mechanism of chloroquine against multiple diseases, its side-effects, mechanisms and the different clinical trials ongoing against “COVID-19”.","Kamat, Siya; Kumari, Madhuree",Front Pharmacol,310,14

We look forward to providing policy experience for other countries still in severe epidemics. METHODS: We analyzed data provided by National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China and Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center for the period 10 January 2020 to 25 May 252,020. We used generalized linear model to evaluate the associations between the main control policies and the number of confirmed cases and the policy disparities in response to the first wave of COVID-19 between China and Germany. RESULTS: The generalized linear models show that the following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in China: the Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism; locking down the worst-hit areas; the highest level response to public health emergencies; the expansion of medical insurance coverage to suspected patients; makeshift hospitals; residential closed management; counterpart assistance. The following factors influence the cumulative number of confirmed cases in Germany: the Novel Coronavirus Crisis Command; large gathering cancelled; real-time COVID-19 risk assessment; the medical emergency plan; schools closure; restrictions on the import of overseas epidemics; the no-contact protocol. CONCLUSIONS: There are two differences between China and Germany in non-pharmaceutical interventions: China adopted the blocking strategy, and Germany adopted the first mitigation and then blocking strategy; China’s goal is to eliminate the virus, and Germany’s goal is to protect high-risk groups to reduce losses. At the same time, the policies implemented by the two countries have similarities: strict blockade is a key measure to control the source of infection, and improving medical response capabilities is an important way to reduce mortality.","Zhang, Yuyao; Shi, Leiyu; Chen, Haiqian; Wang, Xiaohan; Sun, Gang",Int J Equity Health,310,23

The literature to date suggests potentially differential underlying mechanisms based on country economic setting. We aimed to study these outcomes in an Icelandic population where uniform lockdown measures were implemented across the country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included all singleton births (n = 20 680) during 2016–2020 identified from the population‐based Icelandic Medical Birth Register. We defined two lockdown periods during March–May and October–December in 2020 according to government implemented nationwide lockdown. We compared monthly rates of cesarean section, induction of labor and preterm birth during lockdown with the same time periods in the 4 previous years (2016–2019) using logit binomial regression adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Our results indicated a reduction in the overall cesarean section rate, which was mainly evident for elective cesarean section, both during the first (adjusted odd ratio [aOR] 0.71, 95% CI 0.51–0.99) and second (aOR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52–0.99) lockdown periods, and not for emergency cesarean section. No change during lockdown was observed in induction of labor. Our results also suggested a reduction in the overall preterm birth rate during the first lockdown (aOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49–0.97) and in the months immediately following the lockdown (June–September) (aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.49–0.89). The reduction during the first lockdown was mainly evident for medically indicated preterm birth (although not statistically significant) and the reduction during June–September was mainly evident for spontaneous preterm birth. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested a reduction in elective cesarean section during COVID‐19 lockdown, possibly reflecting changes in prioritization of non‐urgent health care during lockdown. We also found a reduction in overall preterm birth during the first lockdown and spontaneous preterm birth following the first lockdown, but further research is needed to shed light on the underlying mechanisms for these findings.","Einarsdóttir, Kristjana; Swift, Emma Marie; Zoega, Helga",Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand,310,16

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients who presented to a tertiary care center with laryngology‐related complaints (voice, swallowing, airway, general throat complaints and others) and completed initial telemedicine visits and subsequent in‐person visits with laryngoscopy between March and October 2020 were included (n = 250). Preliminary diagnoses and managements provided during initial telemedicine visits were compared with the diagnoses and managements during subsequent in‐person visits with laryngoscopy. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to compare concordance rates in diagnosis and management by chief complaint categories after adjusting for relevant demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: Overall concordance rates in diagnosis and management between the initial telemedicine visit and subsequent laryngoscopy exam were 86.1% and 93.7%, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) days until laryngoscopy from the initial visit were 21.2 (23.0). Concordance rates were not associated with patient's age, gender, preferred language, provider, telemedicine visit duration, or days until laryngoscopy. Management concordance rate was relatively lower among patients with general throat complaints in comparison with voice‐related complaints (odds ratio: 0.27; 95% confidence interval: 0.08–0.90). Management changes after laryngoscopy included need for further imaging, procedures, voice therapy, and referral to other specialists. CONCLUSION: Concordance rates in diagnosis and management remained high between the initial telemedicine visit and subsequent in‐person visit with laryngoscopy for new patients presenting with laryngology‐related complaints during the COVID‐19 pandemic. While laryngoscopy is still essential to confirm diagnosis and provide appropriate management, telemedicine may be a feasible alternative to provide suitable empiric therapy until laryngoscopy can be safely performed.

Method: Based on individual case data published online by 21 cities of China, we investigated a total of 136 COVID19 patients who traveled to Hubei from 21 cities of China between January 5 and January 31, 2020, remained there for 48 hours or less, and returned to these cities with onset of symptoms between January 10 and February 6, 2020. Among these patients, 110 were found to be aged 15 to 64, 22 aged 65 to 86, and 4 aged under 15. Findings: The differential incubation time histogram of the two age groups 15 to 64 and 65 to 86 are adequately fitted by the log normal model. For the 15 to 64 age group, the median incubation time of 7.00+1.10 - 0.9 days (uncertainties are 95 % CL) is broadly consistent with previous literature. For the 65-86 age group, the median is 10.9+2.7 - 2.0 days is statistically significantly longer. Moreover, for this group, the 95 % confidence contour indicates the data cannot constrain the upper bound of the log normal parameters μ, σ by failing to close there; this is because the sample has a maximum incubation time of 17 days, beyond which we ran out of data even though the histogram has not yet peaked. Thus there is the potential of a much longer incubation time for the 65 to 86 age group than 10 to 14 days. Only a much larger sample can settle this.","Jiang, Ally Bi-zhu; Lieu, Richard; Quenby, Siobhan",,310,23

This raises the question as to how this risk factor can be addressed in the prognosis, clinical management, and the treatment of patients with Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, there are no guidelines or protocols to help alter the course of sex-specific COVID-19 prognosis, especially in severe disease presentations. This is partly due to the lack of research studies characterizing the differences in male vs. female host response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and a lack of a well-rounded understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved. Here, we discuss three distinct but interconnected molecular-level differences in males and females that likely play an essential role in the COVID-19 prognosis. We review interactions of SARS-CoV-2 with host cell angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the viral entry between males vs. females and discuss the differential regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) between the two sexes. Next, we present immune response disparities and how immune function and endocrine regulation may render males increasingly vulnerable to severe COVID-19. We describe the interconnected roles of these three regulatory systems in males and females in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we highlight the clinical implications of these mechanisms to patients with COVID-19 and propose putative targeted therapies that can help reduce COVID-19 severity in those critically ill.","Galbadage, Thushara; Peterson, Brent M.; Wang, Jeffrey S.; Jayasekara, Avishka; Ramirez, Danny A.; Awada, Joseph; Walsh, John P.; Gunasekera, Richard S.",Front Med (Lausanne),310,20

A serine protease physiologically often comes together with a cognate inhibitor for execution of proteolytically biologic function; however, TMPRSS2’s cognate inhibitor is still elusive. To identify the cognate inhibitor of TMPRSS2, in this study, we applied co-immunoprecipitation and LC/MS/MS analysis and isolated hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitors (HAIs) to be potential inhibitor candidates for TMPRSS2. Moreover, the recombinant HAI-2 proteins exhibited a better inhibitory effect on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity than HAI-1, and recombinant HAI-2 proteins had a high affinity to form a complex with TMPRSS2. The immunofluorescence images further showed that TMPRSS2 was co-localized to HAI-2. Both KD1 and KD2 domain of HAI-2 showed comparable inhibitory effects on TMPRSS2 proteolytic activity. In addition, HAI-2 overexpression could suppress the induction effect of TMPRSS2 on pro-HGF activation, extracellular matrix degradation and prostate cancer cell invasion. We further determined that the expression levels of TMPRSS2 were inversely correlated with HAI-2 levels during prostate cancer progression. In orthotopic xenograft animal model, TMPRSS2 overexpression promoted prostate cancer metastasis, and HAI-2 overexpression efficiently blocked TMPRSS2-induced metastasis. In summary, the results together indicate that HAI-2 can function as a cognate inhibitor for TMPRSS2 in human prostate cancer cells and may serve as a potential factor to suppress TMPRSS2-mediated malignancy.","Ko, Chun-Jung; Hsu, Ting-Wei; Wu, Shang-Ru; Lan, Shao-Wei; Hsiao, Ting-Feng; Lin, Hsin-Ying; Lin, Hsin-Hsien; Tu, Hsin-Fang; Lee, Cheng-Fan; Huang, Cheng-Chung; Chen, Mei-Ju May; Hsiao, Pei-Wen; Huang, Hsiang-Po; Lee, Ming-Shyue",Oncogene,310,12

It is unclear what future norovirus disease incidence is likely to look like upon lifting these restrictions. METHODS: Here we use a mathematical model of norovirus fitted to community incidence data in England to project forward expected incidence based on contact surveys that have been collected throughout 2020-2021. RESULTS: We report that susceptibility to norovirus infection has likely increased between March 2020 to mid-2021. Depending upon assumptions of future contact patterns incidence of norovirus that is similar to pre-pandemic levels or an increase beyond what has been previously reported is likely to occur once restrictions are lifted. Should adult contact patterns return to 80% of pre-pandemic levels the incidence of norovirus will be similar to previous years. If contact patterns return to pre-pandemic levels there is a potential for the expected annual incidence to be up to 2-fold larger than in a typical year. The age-specific incidence is similar across all ages. CONCLUSIONS: Continued national surveillance for endemic diseases such as norovirus will be essential after NPIs are lifted to allow healthcare services to adequately prepare for a potential increase in cases and hospital pressures beyond what is typically experienced.","O’Reilly, Kathleen M; Sandman, Frank; Allen, David; Jarvis, Christopher I; Gimma, Amy; Douglas, Amy; Larkin, Lesley; Wong, Kerry LM; Baguelin, Marc; Baric, Ralph S; Lindesmith, Lisa C; Goldstein, Richard A; Breuer, Judith; Edmunds, W John",medRxiv,310,28

Bacteria in short-term biofilms, too, have been shown to be killed by NCT. It was the aim of the present study to demonstrate the activity of NCT against bacteria and yeasts in longer-lasting biofilms, including their co-culture. Materials and methods: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella variicola biofilms were grown for 14 weeks in MBEC(TM) inoculator with 96 well base. Some pegs were pinched off weekly and incubated in 1% NCT in PBS (PBS only for controls) at pH 7.1 and 37 °C, for 30 and 60 min. Subsequently, bacteria were resuspended by ultrasonication and subjected to quantitative cultures. Similar tests were conducted with C. albicans biofilms grown on metal (A2-steel) discs for 4 weeks. Mixed co-cultures of C. albicans plus each of the three bacterial strains on metal discs were grown for 5–7 weeks and weekly evaluated, as mentioned above. Results: Single biofilms of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and K. variicola grew to approximately 1 × 10(6) colony forming units (CFU)/mL and C. albicans to 1 × 10(5) CFU/mL. In combined biofilms, the CFU count was about 1 log(10) lower. Viable counts of biofilms of single bacteria were reduced by 2.8 to 5.6 log(10) in 1% NCT after 60 min (0.9 to 4.7 log(10) after 30 min) with Gram-negative bacteria being more susceptible than S. aureus. Significant reduction of C. albicans by 2.0 to 2.9 log(10) occurred after 4 h incubation. In combined biofilms, viable counts of C. albicans were reduced by 1.1 to 2.4 log(10) after 4 h, while they reached the detection limit after 1 to 2 h with bacteria (2.0 to > 3.5 log(10) reduction). Remarkably, older biofilms demonstrated no increase in resistance but constant susceptibility to NCT. This was valid for all tested pathogens. In electron microscopy, morphological differences between NCT-treated and non-treated biofilms could be found. Conclusions: NCT is active against long-term biofilms of up to several months irrespective of their age. Combined biofilm cultures of yeasts and bacteria show a similar susceptibility pattern to NCT as single ones. These results contribute to the explanation of the clinical efficacy of NCT, for instance, in infected chronic wounds and purulently coated crural ulcerations.","Grimus, Victoria; Coraça-Huber, Débora C.; Steixner, Stephan J.

During virus infection, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level excessively rises. LDH is a cytosolic enzyme and the serum level increases as the cell break down. When anaerobic conditions develop, lactate formation increases from pyruvate. Cell pH is regulated by very complex mechanisms. When lactate increases in the extracellular area, this symporter carries lactate and H(+) ion into the cell, and the intracellular pH quickly becomes acidic. Paradoxically, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger activation takes place. While H(+) ion is thrown out of the cell, Na(+) and Ca(+2) enter the cell. When Na(+) and Ca(+2) increase in the cell, the cells swell and die. Dapagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor. Dapagliflozin has been reported to reduce lactate levels by various mechanisms. Also, it reduces oxygen consumption in tissues and causes the use of glucose in the aerobic pathway, thereby reducing lactate production. A lactate decrease in the environment reduces the activation of lactate/H(+) symporter. Thus, the H ion pumping into the cell by this symporter is reduced and the cytosolic pH is maintained. Dapagliflozin also directly inhibits NHE. Thus, Na(+) and Ca(+2) flow to the cell are inhibited. Dapagliflozin provides the continuation of the structure and functions of the cells. Dapagliflozin can prevent the severe course of COVID-19 infection by preventing the lowering of cytosolic pH and reducing the viral load.","Cure, Erkan; Cumhur Cure, Medine",Diabetes Metab Syndr,310,16

The impact of viral load in asymptomatic infected children is important to understand transmission potential. We sought to determine whether children deemed to be asymptomatic had a difference in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycle threshold (Ct) value of respiratory samples from symptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study to compare PCR Ct values of children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory samples collected over a 4-month period at a large tertiary care children’s hospital. RESULTS: We analyzed 728 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) from a respiratory sample over a 4-month period and for whom data were available in the electronic medical record. Overall, 71.2% of infected children were symptomatic. The mean Ct value for symptomatic patients (Ct mean, 19.9 [standard deviation, 6.3]) was significantly lower than for asymptomatic patients (Ct mean, 23.5 [standard deviation, 6.9]) (P < .001; 95% confidence interval, 2.6–4.6). The mean PCR Ct value was lowest in children <5 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective review of children who tested positive by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, the mean Ct was significantly lower in symptomatic children and was lowest in children <5 years of age, indicating that symptomatic children and younger children infected with SARS-CoV-2 may have a higher viral load in the nasopharynx compared to asymptomatic children. Further studies are needed to assess the transmission potential from asymptomatic children.","Strutner, John; Ramchandar, Nanda; Dubey, Shruti; Gamboa, Mary; Vanderpool, Michelle K; Mueller, Teresa; Wang, Wei; Cannavino, Christopher; Tovar Padua, Leidy; Malicki, Denise; Pong, Alice",Clin Infect Dis,310,5

Current assays use a variety of technologies, measure different classes of immunoglobulin or immunoglobulin combinations and detect antibodies directed against different portions of the virus. The overall accuracy of these tests, however, has not been well-defined. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) convened an expert panel to perform a systematic review of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) serology literature and construct best practice guidance related to SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing. This guideline is the fourth in a series of rapid, frequently updated COVID-19 guidelines developed by IDSA. OBJECTIVE: IDSA’s goal was to develop evidence-based recommendations that assist clinicians, clinical laboratories, patients and policymakers in decisions related to the optimal use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests in a variety of settings. We also highlight important unmet research needs pertaining to the use of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests for diagnosis, public health surveillance, vaccine development and the selection of convalescent plasma donors. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of infectious diseases clinicians, clinical microbiologists and experts in systematic literature review identified and prioritized clinical questions related to the use of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to assess the certainty of evidence and make testing recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on eight diagnostic recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Information on the clinical performance and utility of SARS-CoV-2 serologic tests are rapidly emerging. Based on available evidence, detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies may be useful for confirming the presence of current or past infection in selected situations. The panel identified three potential indications for serologic testing including: 1) evaluation of patients with a high clinical suspicion for COVID-19 when molecular diagnostic testing is negative and at least two weeks have passed since symptom onset; 2) assessment of multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children; and 3) for conducting serosurveillance studies. The certainty of available evidence supporting the use of serology for either diagnosis or epidemiology was, however, graded as very low to moderate.","Hanson, Kimberly E; Caliendo, Angela M; Arias, Cesar A; Englund, Janet A; Hayden, Mary K; Lee, Mark J; Loeb, Mark; Patel, Robin; Altayar, Osama; El Alayli, Abdallah; Sultan, Shahnaz; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Lavergne, Valéry; Morgan, Rebecca L; Murad, M Hassan; Bhimraj, Adarsh; Mustafa, Reem A",Clin Infect Dis,310,1

The students were assessed on the usage of adaptive (humanitarian and seeking social support) and maladaptive coping strategies (acceptance and mental disengagement). The results showed that the students used maladaptive coping strategies more than adaptive coping strategies to deal with anxiety caused by the pandemic and the effect of restriction of movement. Seeking social support and acceptance coping strategies were significantly associated with the level of anxiety. The student's gender, age, ethnicity, level and type of study, and living arrangement were associated with coping strategies.

Historically, the worldwide use of quinoline based-drugs has led to a spectacular reduction in death from malaria. Unfortunately, scientists have been forced to seek alternative drugs to treat malaria due to the emergence of chloroquine-resistant parasites in the 1960s. The repurposing of hydroxychloroquine against viral infections, various types of cancer and autoimmune diseases has been ongoing for more than 70 years, with no clear understanding of its mechanism of action (MOA). Here, we closely examine the MOA of this old but influential drug in and beyond malaria. Better insights into how chloroquine targets the host’s cellular and immune responses may help to develop applications against to new pathogens and diseases, and perhaps even restore the clinical utility of chloroquine against malaria.","Coban, Cevayir",Curr Opin Immunol,310,17

This pandemic forced countries to enforce a socio-economic lockdown to avoid its widespread presence. This study focuses on how the pollution of particulate matter during the coronavirus pandemic in the period from 23 March 2020 to 31 December 2020 was reduced compared to the pre-pandemic situation in the country. The improvement in air quality and atmosphere due to the coronavirus pandemic in Pakistan was identified by both ground-based and satellite observations with a primary focus on the four provincial capitals and country capitals, namely, Peshawar, Karachi, Quetta, Lahore, and Islamabad, and statistically verified through paired Student’s t test. Both datasets have shown a significant decrease in the levels of PM(2.5) pollutions across Pakistan (ranging from 15 to 35% for satellite observations, while 27 to 61% for ground-based observations). The result shows that poor air quality is one of the key factors for a higher COVID-19 spread rate in major Pakistani cities. By extending the same investigation across the nation, there is a greater need to investigate the connections between COVID-19 spread and air pollution. However, both higher population density rates and frequent population exposure can be partially attributed to increased levels of PM(2.5) concentrations before the pandemic of the coronavirus.","Khan, Yousaf Ali",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,310,24

It has become clear that the risk of complications from perioperative COVID-19 infection must be weighed against the risk from delayed surgical treatment. Studies have also shown that prior bariatric surgery conveys protection against mortality from COVID-19 and that obesity is the biggest risk factor for mortality from COVID-19 infection in adults under 45 years of age. Studies in patients who have fully recovered from COVID-19 and underwent elective surgery have not become widely available yet.

Thirteen months since then, schools remain partially closed. Accumulated evidence suggests that children and adolescents are not the primary facilitators of transmission, limiting the restrictive effects of school closures on disease transmission. The negative effects of school closures on K-12 students need to be systematically reviewed. METHODS: Following the guideline of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyzes, a comprehensive literature search from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science regarding school closures and its impact on K-12 students was conducted. The primary outcomes included the impact of school closures on the mitigation of the pandemic and the resulting public health concerns of K-12 students. RESULTS: Prolonged school closures possessed negative effects on K-12 students’ physical, mental, and social well-being and reduced the number of health and social workers, hindering the reopening of the country.

In the world depicted in Harmony, preserving health and life is a top priority. Super-medicine is realized through highly advanced medical technologies. Citizens in Harmony are required to strictly control themselves to achieve perfect health and must always disclose their health information to the public and continuously prove their health. From a bioethical standpoint, the world in Harmony is governed by a “healthy longevity supremacy” principle, with being healthy equated to being good and right. Privacy no longer exists, as it is perceived ethical for citizens to openly communicate health-related information to establish one’s credibility. Moreover, there is no room for self-determination concerning healthcare because medical interventions and care are completely routinized, automated, centralized, and instantly provided. This is a situation where the community exhibits extremely powerful and effective paternalism. One can argue that healthy longevity is highly preferred. But is it right to aim for a perfectly healthy society at all costs? Should we sacrifice freedom, privacy, vivid feelings, and personal dignity to achieve such a world?

Although some PCR and antigen-detection assays have been developed, conventional diagnosis has largely relied on culture, which can take weeks. Our aim was to provide a proof of principle for rationally designing and standardizing PCR assays based on Histoplasma-specific genomic sequences. Via automated comparisons of aligned genome contigs/scaffolds and gene (sub)sequences, we identified protein-coding genes that are present in existing sequences of Histoplasma strains but not in other genera. Two of the genes, PPK and CFP4, were used for designing primer sets for conventional and real-time PCR assays. Both resulted in a 100% analytical specificity in vitro and detected 62/62 H. capsulatum isolates using purified DNA. We also obtained positive detections of 2/2 confirmed H. capsulatum clinical FFPE (formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded) samples using both primer sets. Positive control plasmid 10-fold serial dilutions confirmed the analytical sensitivity of the assays. The findings suggest that these novel primer sets should allow for detection sensitivity and reduce false positive results/cross-reactions.

Proper PPE and airway management techniques are critical to prevent the transmission of respiratory illnesses such as COVID-19. APPROACH: In March 2020, the authors implemented a structured train-the-trainers curriculum to teach PPE techniques and a modified airway management algorithm for suspected COVID-19 patients. A single emergency medicine physician trainer taught 17 subsequent emergency medicine and critical care physician trainers the proper PPE and airway management techniques. The initial trainer and 7 of the subsequent trainers then instructed 99 other emergency medicine resident and attending physicians using in situ simulation. Trainers and learners completed retrospective pre–post surveys to assess their comfort teaching the material and performing the techniques, respectively. OUTCOMES: The surveys demonstrated a significant increase in the trainers’ comfort in teaching simulation-based education, from 4.00 to 4.53 on a 5-point Likert scale (P < .005), and in teaching the airway management techniques through simulation, from 2.47 to 4.47 (P < .001). There was no difference in the change in comfort level between those learners who were taught by the initial trainer and those who were taught by the subsequent trainers. These results suggest that the subsequent trainers were as effective in teaching the simulation material as the initial trainer. NEXT STEPS: Work is ongoing to investigate clinician- and patient-specific outcomes, including PPE adherence, appropriate AGP performance, complication rate, and learners’ skill retention. Future work will focus on implementing similar train-the-trainers strategies for other health professions, specialties, and high-risk or rare procedures.","Peterson, William J.; Munzer, Brendan W.; Tucker, Ryan V.; Losman, Eve D.; Harvey, Carrie; Hatton, Colman; Sefa, Nana; Bassin, Ben S.; Hsu, Cindy H.",Acad Med,310,17

There is an urgent need for preclinical evidence to justify this approach and inform dose, scheduling and mechanisms of action. Materials and methods Female C57BL/6 mice were treated with intranasal bleomycin sulphate (7.5 or 11.25 units/kg, day 0), then exposed to whole lung radiation therapy (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 Gy or sham, day 3). Bodyweight was measured daily and lung tissue harvested for histology and flow cytometry on day 10. Computed tomography (CT) lung imaging was performed pre-radiation (day 3) and pre-endpoint (day 10). Results Bleomycin caused pneumonitis of variable severity which correlated with weight loss. LDLR at 1.0 Gy was associated with a significant increase in the proportion of mice recovering to 98% of initial bodyweight and a proportion of these mice exhibited less severe histopathological lung changes. Mice experiencing moderate initial weight loss were more likely to respond to LDLR than those experiencing severe initial weight loss. Additionally, LDLR (1.0 Gy) significantly reduced bleomycin-induced increases in interstitial macrophages, CD103+ dendritic cells and neutrophil-DC hybrids. Overall, bleomycin-treated mice exhibited significantly higher percentages of non-aerated lung in left than right lungs and LDLR (1.0 Gy) limited further reductions in aerated lung volume in right but not left lungs. LDLR at 0.5 and 1.5 Gy did not improve bodyweight, flow cytometric or radiological readouts of bleomycin-induced pneumonitis. Conclusions Our data support the concept that LDLR can ameliorate acute inflammatory lung injury, identify 1.0 Gy as the most effective dose and provide evidence that it is more effective in the context of moderate than severe pneumonitis. Mechanistically, LDLR at 1.0 Gy significantly suppressed bleomycin-induced accumulation of pulmonary interstitial macrophages, CD103+ dendritic cells and neutrophil-DC hybrids.","Jackson, Mark R; Stevenson, Katrina; Chahal, Sandeep K.; Curley, Emer; Finney, George E; Gutierrez-Quintana, Rodrigo; Onwubiko, Evarest; Rupp, Angie; Strathdee, Karen; Williams, Karin; MacLeod, Megan KL; McSharry, Charles; Chalmers, Anthony J",Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,310,1

Wildfire incidents can be an ideal environment for the transmission of infectious diseases, particularly for wildland firefighters who congregate in work and living settings. In this review, we examine how exposure to wildfire smoke can contribute to an increased likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Human exposure to particulate matter (PM), a component of wildfire smoke, has been associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory responses; increasing the likelihood for adverse respiratory symptomology and pathology. In multiple epidemiological studies, wildfire smoke exposure has been associated with acute lower respiratory infections, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. Co-occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and wildfire smoke inhalation may present an increased risk for COVID-19 illness in wildland firefighters due to PM based transport of SARS CoV-2 virus and up-regulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE-2) (i.e. ACE-2 functions as a trans-membrane receptor, allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to gain entry into the epithelial cell). Wildfire smoke exposure may also increase risk for more severe COVID-19 illness such as cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current infection control measures, including social distancing, wearing cloth masks, frequent cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces, frequent hand washing, and daily screening for COVID-19 symptoms are very important measures to reduce infections and severe health outcomes. Exposure to wildfire smoke may introduce additive or even multiplicative risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection and severity of disease in wildland firefighters. Thus, additional mitigative measures may be needed to prevent the co-occurrence of wildfire smoke exposure and SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Navarro, Kathleen M.; Clark, Kathleen A.; Hardt, Daniel J.; Reid, Colleen E.; Lahm, Peter W.; Domitrovich, Joseph W.; Butler, Corey R.; Balmes, John R.",Sci Total Environ,310,11

Projecting the size of an unmitigated epidemic and the potential effect of different control measures has been crucial to support evidence-based policy making during the early stages of the epidemic. This study assesses the potential impact of different control measures for mitigating the burden of COVID-19 in the UK. METHODS: We used a stochastic age-structured transmission model to explore a range of intervention scenarios, tracking 66·4 million people aggregated to 186 county-level administrative units in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The four base interventions modelled were school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number, R(0). FINDINGS: We projected a median unmitigated burden of 23 million (95% prediction interval 13–30) clinical cases and 350 000 deaths (170 000–480 000) due to COVID-19 in the UK by December, 2021. We found that the four base interventions were each likely to decrease R(0), but not sufficiently to prevent ICU demand from exceeding health service capacity. The combined intervention was more effective at reducing R(0), but only lockdown periods were sufficient to bring R(0) near or below 1; the most stringent lockdown scenario resulted in a projected 120 000 cases (46 000–700 000) and 50 000 deaths (9300–160 000). Intensive interventions with lockdown periods would need to be in place for a large proportion of the coming year to prevent health-care demand exceeding availability. INTERPRETATION: The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that extreme measures are probably required to bring the epidemic under control and to prevent very large numbers of deaths and an excess of demand on hospital beds, especially those in ICUs.

Recent discoveries are revealing that these same ATGs orchestrate processes that are related to, and yet clearly distinct from, classic autophagy. Autophagy-related functions include secretion, trafficking of phagocytosed material, replication and egress of viral particles, and regulation of inflammatory and immune signaling cascades. Here, we define common processes dependent on ATGs, and discuss the challenges in mechanistically separating autophagy from these related pathways. Elucidating the molecular events that distinguish how individual ATGs function promises to improve our understanding of the origin of diseases ranging from autoimmunity to cancer.","Cadwell, Ken; Debnath, Jayanta",J Cell Biol,310,22

The question here is whether these basic principles are still compatible with this unusual COVID-period. This pandemic represents a serious threat to human health, leading to profound changes in behavior in daily life but also in health care. Because of limited resources, health-managers must choose well-balanced solutions able to protect patients and citizens on the one hand and to provide maximal benefit for the society on the other hand. We are going through a moment of rupture that we must acknowledge. Here, we discussed how the doctor-patient relationship could be compromised. Doctors are focused on cares whereas patients are focused on scare. Profound changes occur presently, from the way we present ourselves to each other (including the masks), the poor conditions for physical examination, the mental suffering of both patient and caregiver until sometimes terrible end-of-life conditions. The historical point-of-view helps us to keep in mind previous experiences, and the philosophical perspective helps to contextualize this unedited situation.

Despite availability of effective treatment, too few people receive it and treatment retention is low. Understanding barriers and facilitators of treatment access and retention is needed to improve outcomes for people with OUD. OBJECTIVES: To assess 3-month outcomes pilot data from a patient-centered OUD treatment program in Iowa, USA, that utilized flexible treatment requirements and prioritized engagement over compliance. METHODS: Forty patients (62.5% female: mean age was 35.7 years, SD 9.5) receiving medication, either buprenorphine or naltrexone, to treat OUD were enrolled in an observational study. Patients could select or decline case management, counseling, and peer recovery groups. Substance use, risk and protective factors, and recovery capital were measured at intake and 3 months. RESULTS: Most participants reported increased recovery capital. The median Assessment of Recovery Capital (ARC) score went from 37 at enrollment to 43 (p < 0.01). Illegal drug use decreased, with the median days using illegal drugs in the past month dropping from 10 to 0 (p < 0.001). Cravings improved: 29.2% reported no cravings at intake and 58.3% reported no cravings at 3 months (p < 0.001). Retention rate was 92.5% at 3 months. Retention rate for participants who were not on probation/parole was higher (96.9%) than for those on probation/parole (62.5%, p = 0.021). CONCLUSION: This study shows preliminary evidence that a care model based on easy and flexible access and strategies to improve treatment retention improves recovery capital, reduces illegal drug use and cravings, and retains people in treatment.","Lynch, Alison C.; Weber, Andrea N.; Hedden, Suzy; Sabbagh, Sayeh; Arndt, Stephan; Acion, Laura",Subst Abuse Treat Prev Policy,310,21

So far, there are no drugs available for treatment of rhinovirus infection. We examined the effect of quercetin, a plant flavanol on RV infection in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of airway epithelial cells with quercetin decreased Akt phosphosphorylation, viral endocytosis and IL-8 responses. Addition of quercetin 6 h after RV infection (after viral endocytosis) reduced viral load, IL-8 and IFN responses in airway epithelial cells. This was associated with decreased levels of negative and positive strand viral RNA, and RV capsid protein, abrogation of RV-induced eIF4GI cleavage and increased phosphorylation of eIF2α. In mice infected with RV, quercetin treatment decreased viral replication as well as expression of chemokines and cytokines. Quercetin treatment also attenuated RV-induced airway cholinergic hyperresponsiveness. Together, our results suggest that quercetin inhibits RV endocytosis and replication in airway epithelial cells at multiple stages of the RV life cycle. Quercetin also decreases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves lung function in RV-infected mice. Based on these observations, further studies examining the potential benefits of quercetin in the prevention and treatment of RV infection are warranted.","Ganesan, Shyamala; Faris, Andrea N.; Comstock, Adam T.; Wang, Qiong; Nanua, Suparna; Hershenson, Marc B.; Sajjan, Uma S.",Antiviral Research,310,20

Due to the high contagiousness of the infection, further spread by asymptomatic people, Italy has become in a few weeks the country with the greatest number of infected people in the world. The large number of severe cases among infected people in Italy led to the hospitalization of thousands of patients, with a heavy burden on the National Health Service. METHODS: We analyzed data provided daily by Italian Authorities for the period from 24 February 2020 to 30 March 2020. Considering such information, we developed a forecast model in real-time, based on the cumulative log-logistic distribution. RESULTS: A total of 101,739 infected individuals were confirmed until 30 March 2020, of which 14,620 recovered or discharged, and 11,591 deaths. Until the same date patients quarantined at home were 43,752, whereas hospitalized patients were 31,776, of which 3981 in intensive care. The active cases (i.e. the number of patients not yet recovered until that date) were 75,528. The forecast model estimated a number of infected persons for Italy of 234,000 about, and a duration of the epidemic of approximately 4 months. CONCLUSIONS: One month after the first outbreaks there seemed to be the first signs of a decrease in the number of infections, showing that we could be now facing the descending phase of the epidemic. The forecast obtained thanks to our model could be used by decision-makers to implement coordinative and collaborative efforts in order to control the epidemic.

Here, we explore the diverse mechanisms of SARS-CoV-induced inflammation. We presume that SARS-CoV-2 likely contributes analogous inflammatory responses. Possible therapeutic mechanisms for reducing SARS-CoV-2-mediated inflammatory responses comprise FcR inactivation. Currently, there is no specific remedy available against the SARS-CoV-2. Consequently, recognizing efficacious antiviral leads to combat the virus is crucially desired. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (M(pro) also called 3CL(pro)), which plays an indispensable role in viral replication and transcription, is an interesting target for drug design. This review compiles the latest advances in biological and structural research, along with development of inhibitors targeting CoV M(pros). It is anticipated that inhibitors targeting CoV M(pros) could be advanced into wide-spectrum antiviral drugs in case of COVID-19 and other CoV-related diseases. The crystal structural and docking results have shown that Ebselen, N3, TDZD-8 and α-ketoamide (13b) inhibitors can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of COVID-19 M(pro). α-ketoamide-based inhibitor 13b inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human Calu3 lung cells. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the treatment with Ebselen, TDZD-8 and N3 reduced the amounts of SARS-CoV-2, respectively, 20.3-, 10.19- and 8.4-fold compared to the treatment in the absence of inhibitor. Moreover, repurposing of already present drugs to treat COVID-19 serves as one of the competent and economic therapeutic strategies. Several anti-malarial, anti-HIV and anti-inflammatory drugs as mentioned in Table 2 were found effective for the COVID-19 treatment. Further, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was found more potent than chloroquine (CQ) in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Furthermore, convalescent plasma from patients who have recuperated from viral infections can be employed as a therapy without the appearance of severe adverse events. Hence, it might be valuable to examine the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma transfusion in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients.","Tripathi, Neetu; Tripathi, Neeraj; Goshisht, Manoj Kumar",Mol Divers,310,1

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in massive amounts of international and national information and guidance. This guidance was often conflicting and not suited to New Zealand midwifery. Aim To examine and map the national and international guidance and information provided to midwifery regarding COVID-19 and foreground learnt lessons for future similar crises. Methods A systematic scoping review informed by Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework. A range of sources from grey and empirical literature was identified and 257 sources included. Findings Four categories were identified and discussed: 1) guidance for provision of maternity care in the community; 2) guidance for provision of primary labour and birth care; 3) Guidance for midwifery care to women/wāhine with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 infection, including screening processes and management of neonates of infected women/wāhine 4) Guidance for midwives on protecting self and own families and whānau (extended family) from COVID-19 exposure. Conclusion Guidance was mainly targeted and tailored for hospital-based services. This was at odds with the NZ context, where primary continuity of care underpins practice. It is evident that those providing continuity of care constantly needed to navigate an evolving situation to mitigate interruptions and restrictions to midwifery care, often without fully knowing the personal risk to themselves and their own families. A key message is the need for a single source of evidence-based guidance, regularly updated and timestamped to show where advice changes over time.","Crowther, Susan; Maude, Robyn; Zhao, Ivy Y.; Bradford, Billie; Gilkison, Andrea",Women Birth,310,20

Our institution undertook a process improvement approach to increase hepatitis B vaccination in stage 4 and 5 CKD patients. METHODS: Four strategies were utilized such as: (1) Electronic health record (EHR)-based CKD registry to identify patients, (2) EHR-based physician/nurse reminders, (3) a co-located nurse appointment for vaccine administration, and (4) information sharing and provider awareness effort. The CKD registry was utilized to identify patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD, with at least two clinic visits in the prior 2 years, who had not received the hepatitis B vaccine or did not have serologic evidence of immunity. Target monthly vaccination rate was set at 75%, based on clinic leadership, nephrologist, and nurse consensus. RESULTS: A total of 239 patients were included in the study period, from November 2018 to January 2019 (observation period) and from February 2019 to September 2019 (intervention period). Monthly vaccination rate improved from 48% in November 2018 to the target rate of 75% by the end of the intervention (August and September 2019). There was a statistically significant increase from the rate of vaccination at a unique patient level in the first month of the baseline period, compared to the last month of the intervention period (51 vs. 75% p = 0.03).

The present study implements an immunoinformatic approach for screening the possible antigenic proteins among various pathogenic bacteria to systemically arrive at epitope-based vaccine candidates against 14 pathogenic bacteria. Thousand four hundred and fifty nine virulence factors and Five hundred and forty six products of essential genes were appraised as target proteins to predict potential epitopes with potential to stimulate different arms of the immune system. To address the self-tolerance, self-epitopes were identified by mapping on 1000 human proteome and were removed. Our analysis revealed that 21proteins from 5 bacterial species were found as virulent as well as essential to their survival, proved to be most suitable vaccine target against these species. In addition to the prediction of MHC-II binders, B cell and T cell epitopes as well as adjuvants individually from proteins of all 14 bacterial species, a stringent criteria lead us to identify 252 unique epitopes, which are predicted to be T-cell epitopes, B-cell epitopes, MHC II binders and Vaccine Adjuvants.

Appropriate symptom monitoring can help to improve management and medical treatments and improve the patients’ quality of life. Currently, tremor is evaluated by physical examinations during clinical appointments; however, this method could be subjective and does not represent the full spectrum of the symptom in the patients’ daily lives. In recent years, sensor-based systems have been used to obtain objective information about the disease. However, most of these systems require the use of multiple devices, which makes it difficult to use them in an ambulatory setting. This paper presents a novel approach to evaluate the amplitude and constancy of resting tremor using triaxial accelerometers from consumer smartwatches and multitask classification models. These approaches are used to develop a system for an automated and accurate symptom assessment without interfering with the patients’ daily lives. Results show a high agreement between the amplitude and constancy measurements obtained from the smartwatch in comparison with those obtained in a clinical assessment. This indicates that consumer smartwatches in combination with multitask convolutional neural networks are suitable for providing accurate and relevant information about tremor in patients in the early stages of the disease, which can contribute to the improvement of PD clinical evaluation, early detection of the disease, and continuous monitoring.","Sigcha, Luis; Pavón, Ignacio; Costa, Nélson; Costa, Susana; Gago, Miguel; Arezes, Pedro; López, Juan Manuel; De Arcas, Guillermo",Sensors (Basel),310,1

Trials for both antivirals and vaccines are in progress; candidates include existing repurposed drugs that were originally developed for other ailments. Once these are shown to be effective, their production will need to be ramped up rapidly to keep pace with the growing demand as the pandemic progresses. It is highly likely that the drugs will be in short supply in the interim, which leaves policymakers and medical personnel with the difficult task of determining how to allocate them. Under such conditions, mathematical models can provide valuable decision support. In particular, useful models can be derived from process integration techniques that deal with tight resource constraints. In this paper, a linear programming model is developed to determine the optimal allocation of COVID-19 drugs that minimizes patient fatalities, taking into account additional hospital capacity constraints. Two hypothetical case studies are solved to illustrate the computational capability of the model, which can generate an allocation plan with outcomes that are superior to simple ad hoc allocation.

The circular economy can contribute to the UN SDGs and micro-organisms are central to circular nutrient cycles. The circular economy as described by the Ellen MacArthur foundation has two halves, i.e. technical and biological. On the technical side, non-biological resources enter manufacturing paths where resource efficiency, renewable energy and design extend the life of materials so that they are more easily reused and recycled. Biological resources exist on the other half of the circular economy. These are used to manufacture products such as bioplastics and paper. The conservation of nature’s stocks, resource efficiency and recycling of materials are key facets of the biological half of the circular economy. Microbes play a critical role in both the biological and technical parts of the circular economy. Microbes are key to a functioning circular economy, where natural resources, including biological wastes, are converted by microbes into products of value and use for society, e.g. biogas, bioethanol, bioplastics, building block chemicals and compost for healthy soils.

The COVID-19 (SARS-COV-2) pandemic has led to increased infection control vigilance, including toward the stethoscope, as evidenced by a recent increase in literature highlighting stethoscope hygiene/contamination. A consequence of this increase in awareness is that stethoscopes may be implicated in medical malpractice lawsuits as a potential cause of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). While there is limited evidence demonstrating a direct connection between stethoscope contamination and HAIs, malpractice lawsuits often do not require direct causative evidence. Regardless, efforts should be made to bolster stethoscope hygiene to not only mitigate patient harm, but also prevent providers from potential medical-legal conflicts. The continued relevance and utility of the stethoscope as a rapid, cost-effective diagnostic tool needs to be appropriately balanced with increased hygiene performance.

More than 10 federal departments and agencies currently invest in critical nutrition research, yet with relatively flat investments over several decades. Coordination also remains suboptimal, documented by multiple governmental reports over 50 years. Greater harmonization and expansion of federal investment in nutrition science, not a silo-ing or rearrangement of existing investments, has tremendous potential to generate new discoveries to improve and sustain the health of all Americans. Two identified key strategies to achieve this were as follows: 1) a new authority for robust cross-governmental coordination of nutrition research and other nutrition-related policy and 2) strengthened authority, investment, and coordination for nutrition research within the NIH. These strategies were found to be complementary, together catalyzing important new science, partnerships, coordination, and returns on investment. Additional complementary actions to accelerate federal nutrition research were identified at the USDA. CONCLUSIONS: The need and opportunities for strengthened federal nutrition research are clear, with specific identified options to help create the new leadership, strategic planning, coordination, and investment the nation requires to address the multiple nutrition-related challenges and grasp the opportunities before us.","Fleischhacker, Sheila E; Woteki, Catherine E; Coates, Paul M; Hubbard, Van S; Flaherty, Grace E; Glickman, Daniel R; Harkin, Thomas R; Kessler, David; Li, William W; Loscalzo, Joseph; Parekh, Anand; Rowe, Sylvia; Stover, Patrick J; Tagtow, Angie; Yun, Anthony Joon; Mozaffarian, Dariush",Am J Clin Nutr,310,0

This fine balance between unwavering centeredness and compassionate flexibility is central to DBT (Linehan, 1993), and has proven essential during these times of uncertainty. This short article highlights challenges and innovations faced by our DBT Team, Skills Group, individual DBT sessions, phone coaching, and also our community at large, as we strive to help our patients and team members build a life worth living during and following a pandemic.","O'Hayer, C.

We explored whether telemedicine (defined as a videoconference) might help. We undertook prospective structured phone interviews of urological patients (n = 399). We evaluated their suitability for telemedicine (judged by a panel of four physicians) and their risks from COVID-19 (10 factors for a poor outcome), and collected willingness for telemedicine and demographic data. Risk factors for an adverse outcome from COVID-19 infection were common (94.5% had one or more) and most patients (63.2%) were judged suitable for telemedicine. When asked, 84.7% of patients wished for a telemedical rather than a face-to-face consultation. Those favouring telemedicine were younger (68 [58–75] vs 76 [70–79.2] yr, p < 0.001). There was no difference in preference with oncological (mean 86%) or benign diagnoses (mean 85%), or with COVID-19 risks factors. In subgroup analysis, men with prostate cancer preferred telemedicine (odds ratio: 2.93 [1.07–8.03], p = 0.037). We concluded that many urological patients have risk factors for a poor outcome from COVID-19 and most preferred telemedicine consultations at this time. This appears to be a solution to offer contact-free continuity of care. Patient summary Risk factors for a severe course of coronavirus disease 2019 are common (94.5%) in urology patients. Most patients wished for a telemedical consultation (84.7%). This appears to be a solution to offer contact-free continuity of care.","Boehm, Katharina; Ziewers, Stefani; Brandt, Maximilian P.; Sparwasser, Peter; Haack, Maximilian; Willems, Franziska; Thomas, Anita; Dotzauer, Robert; Höfner, Thomas; Tsaur, Igor; Haferkamp, Axel; Borgmann, Hendrik",Eur Urol,310,29
