7215,Let Him Who Desires Peace Prepare for War: United States Hospitals and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Preparedness,2004-07-15,"Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness; the virus is endemic in West Africa and also of concern with regard to bioterrorism. Transmission of Lassa virus between humans may occur through direct contact with infected blood or bodily secretions. Oral administration of the antiviral drug ribavirin is often considered for postexposure prophylaxis, but no systematically collected data or uniform guidelines exist for this indication. Furthermore, the relatively low secondary attack rates for Lassa fever, the restriction of the area of endemicity to West Africa, and the infrequency of high-risk exposures make it unlikely that controlled prospective efficacy trials will ever be possible. Recommendations for postexposure use of ribavirin can therefore be made only on the basis of a thorough understanding and logical extrapolation of existing data. Here, we review the pertinent issues and propose guidelines based on extensive review of the literature, as well as our experience in this field. We recommend oral ribavirin postexposure prophylaxis for Lassa fever exclusively for definitive high-risk exposures. These guidelines may also serve for exposure to other hemorrhagic fever viruses susceptible to ribavirin.","Bausch, Daniel G.; Hadi, Christiane M.; Khan, Sheik Humarr; Lertora, Juan J.

25245,Biological systems: Applications and perspectives,2007,"In 1959, C.W. Mills published his now famous treatise on what sociology uniquely brings to understanding the world and the people in it. Every sociologist, of whatever ilk, has had at least a brush with the “sociological imagination,” and nearly everyone who has taken a sociology course has encountered some version of it. As Mills argued, the link between the individual and society, between personal troubles and social issues, between biography and history, or between individual crises and institutional contradictions represents the core vision of the discipline of sociology. While reminding ourselves of the “promise” may be a bit trite, its mention raises the critical question: Why do we have to continually remind ourselves of the unique contribution that we, as sociologists, bring to understanding health, illness, and healing?","Pescosolido, Bernice A.","Handbook of the Sociology of Health, Illness, and Healing",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121787/,531

35115,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 as an atypical cause of Bell's palsy in a patient experiencing homelessness,2020-06-08,"Malicious domains are critical resources in network security, behind which attackers hide malware to launch the malicious attacks. Therefore, blocking malicious domains is the most effective and practical way to combat and reduce hostile activities. There are three limitations in previous methods over domain classification: (1) solely based on local domain features which tend to be not robust enough; (2) lack of a large number of ground truth for model-training to get high accuracy; (3) statically learning on graph which is not scalable. In this paper, we present Ringer, a scalable method to detect malicious domains by dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Ringer first uses querying behaviors or domain-IP resolutions to construct domain graphs, on which the dynamic GCN is leveraged to learn the node representations that integrate both information about node features and graph structure. And then, these high-quality representations are further fed to the full-connected neural network for domain classification. Notably, instead of global statically learning, we adopt time-based hash to cut graphs to small ones and inductively learn the embedding of nodes according to selectively sampling neighbors. We construct a series of experiments on a large ISP over two days and compare it with state of the arts. The results demonstrate that Ringer achieves excellent performance with a high accuracy of 96.8% on average. Additionally, we find thousands of potential malicious domains by semi-supervised learning.","Liu, Zhicheng; Li, Shuhao; Zhang, Yongzheng; Yun, Xiaochun; Peng, Chengwei",Computational Science - ICCS 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7304021/,531

44042,367. Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes in Patients with Pneumonia secondary to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2),2020-12-31,"BACKGROUND: Background: Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome of Children (MIS-C) has recently emerged internationally as a serious inflammatory complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection with significant morbidity for the pediatric population. METHODS: This observational retrospective cohort study includes 33 children meeting CDC criteria for MIS-C treated between March 15 and June 17, 2020 at Children’s National Hospital in Washington DC. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from medical records and are summarized. RESULTS: Of 33 hospitalized MIS-C patients, 42% were critically ill, and 58% were non-critically ill. The median age was 8.9 years (0.7–18.7 years). More males (58 %) than females (43 %) were represented in the MIS-C cohort. The majority (75%) of children had no underlying medical condition. Criteria for incomplete or complete Kawasaki Disease (KD) were present in 39% of patients, while an additional 9% had some features of KD. However the remaining 52% of MIS-C patients presented with other sub-phenotypes including prominent severe abdominal pain and/or nonspecific multiorgan dysfunction. 30% presented with shock requiring volume and/or inotropic support. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were present in 61% of patients. Virus was detectable by PCR in 36% of patients. At the time of initial evaluation, 39% (13/33) of children had identified cardiac abnormalities including myocardial dysfunction (5/33; 15%), coronary ectasia (4/33; 12%), coronary aneurysm (3/33; 9%), or pericardial effusion 5/33; 15%) either alone or in combination. Cytokine profiling identified elevation of several cytokines in this cohort, including IL-6. Treatment has included intravenous immunoglobulin, aspirin, anakinra and other immunomodulatory therapies, with overall rapid response to therapy. No deaths have occurred. CONCLUSION: The emergence of MIS-C late in the surge of SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the Washington DC metropolitan region has added to the already significant burden of hospitalized and critically ill children in our region. A significant percentage of these children present with cardiac dysfunction and abnormalities, whether or not with KD features at presentation. Detailed characterization of immune responses and long term outcome of these patients is a priority.

45270,Cropping and attention based approach for masked face recognition,2021-02-01,"Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) typically causes herpes zoster in the elderly due to reactivation, but immunocompromised individuals may develop organ damage such as pneumonia with a poor prognosis. We herein report a case of pneumonia and central nervous system (CNS) infection caused by reactivation of VZV in a 50-year-old man who had received a living-donor kidney transplant. We also conducted a literature review of adult cases with pneumonia or CNS infection caused by VZV after kidney transplantation. It showed that there are cases in which eruptions appeared upto 21 days after the onset of the disease and others in which eruptions did not appear at any time during the clinical course. Furthermore, there may be a wide variety of intervals from kidney transplantation to VZV infection (including both primary infection and reactivation of VZV), ranging from 2 weeks to 11 years. Therefore, it should be kept in mind that kidney transplant patients are always at high risk of VZV infection, as early recognition and treatment of the disease improves its prognosis. Although the diagnosis of varicella pneumonia is generally made by PCR test of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, our case experience suggests that the less invasive PCR test of sputum may be useful for rapid and accurate diagnosis. The efficacy of inactivated recombinant zoster vaccine in immunocompromised individuals at high risk of reactivation of VZV also needs to be examined in the future.","Takahashi, Yoshinori; Hara, Satoshi; Hoshiba, Ryohei; Hibino, Shinya; Ito, Kiyoaki; Zoshima, Takeshi; Suzuki, Yasunori; Inoue, Dai; Mizushima, Ichiro; Fujii, Hiroshi; Kawano, Mitsuhiro",CEN Case Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7838850/,531
45724,Adalimumab/golimumab/infliximab: SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia: 3 case reports,2021-02-13,"The Every Student Succeeds Act supports personalized learning (PL) to close achievement gaps of diverse K-12 learners in the United States. Implementing PL into a classroom entails a paradigm change of the educational system. However, it is demanding to transform traditional practice into a personalized one under the pressure of the annual standardized testing while it is unclear which PL approaches are more likely to result in better academic outcomes than others. Using national survey data of ELA teachers in identified learner-centered schools, this study compared high and low-performing learner-centered schools (determined by their standardized test results) in terms of their use of five PL features (personalized learning plan, competency-based student progress, criterion-referenced assessment, project- or problem-based learning, and multi-year mentoring) and their use of technology for the four functions of planning, learning, assessment, and recordkeeping. Generally, teachers in high-performing schools implemented PL more thoroughly and utilized technology for more functions than those in low-performing schools. Teachers in high-performing schools more frequently considered career goals when creating personal learning plans, shared the project outcomes with the community, and assessed non-academic outcomes. They stayed longer with the same students and developed close relationships with more students. Also, they more frequently used technology for sharing resources and reported having a more powerful technology system than those in low-performing schools. This study informs educators, administrators, and researchers of which PL approaches and technology uses are more likely to result in better academic outcomes measured by standardized assessments.","Lee, Dabae; Huh, Yeol; Lin, Chun-Yi; Reigeluth, Charles M.; Lee, Eunbae",Educ Technol Res Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7870029/,531
53764,Mapping the little brain at the heart by an interdisciplinary systems biology team,2021-05-05,"The objective of the current study is to analyze numerically the effect of the temperature-jump boundary condition on heterogeneous microfluidic immunosensors under electrothermal force. A three-dimensional simulation using the finite element method on the binding reaction kinetics of C-reactive protein (CRP) was performed. The kinetic reaction rate was calculated with coupled Laplace, Navier−Stokes, energy, and mass diffusion equations. Two types of reaction surfaces were studied: one in the form of a disc surrounded by two electrodes and the other in the form of a circular ring, one electrode is located inside the ring and the other outside. The numerical results reveal that the performance of a microfluidic biosensor is enhanced by using the second design of the sensing area (circular ring) coupled with the electrothermal force. The improvement factor under the applied ac field 15 V(rms) was about 1.2 for the first geometry and 3.6 for the second geometry. Furthermore, the effect of temperature jump on heat transfer rise and response time was studied. The effect of two crucial parameters, viz. Knudsen number (Kn) and thermal accommodation coefficient (σ(T)) with and without electrothermal effect, were analyzed for the two configurations.","Echouchene, Fraj; Al-shahrani, Thamraa; Belmabrouk, Hafedh",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157299/,531
55271,"Parkinsonism management issues in a patient with exhausted subthalamic deep brain stimulation battery, stricken by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2",2020-10-06,"SARS‐COV‐2, or COVID‐19, is a respiratory virus infecting over 86 million people worldwide. In addition to respiratory infections, SARS‐COV‐2 has been shown to include cardiovascular (CV) complications, including myocarditis and acute coronary syndrome. Risk of severe complications from SARS‐COV‐2 in individuals with existing CV and metabolic disease has been shown to be increased. Evidence indicates SARS‐COV‐2 enters tissues via the angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and that the virus is primed and activated by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The goal of this study was to determine ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels in pre‐clinical swine models of heart failure (HF). We hypothesized sex, pressure‐overload, and comorbidities would increase ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels. A retrospective analysis was conducted in previously completed studies in our lab including: 1) Female, intact Ossabaw swine that were either lean control or western diet‐fed aortic‐banded (N=4‐5/group); 2) Female Yucatan mini‐swine subject to ovariectomy and/or aortic banding (N=5‐8/group); and 3) Sedentary and exercise trained male, intact Yucatan mini‐swine that were aortic banded. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were evaluated in the left ventricle (LV), right ventricle (RV), and coronary vasculature using qRT‐PCR. Linear regression analysis was used to determine differences between the following variables: pig species, sex hormones, aortic banding, comorbidities, exercise training, and tissue. Data was log‐transformed to meet linear regression assumptions. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were significantly influenced by sex, comorbidity, and tissue type. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels were also influenced by species and disease status. Specifically, ACE2 mRNA levels decreased 57.1% in the LV and increased 169.9% in the RV of males compared to coronary vessels in intact females. TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased in the LV and RV of males (1,218.6% and 5,479.8%, respectively) compared to coronary vessels in intact females. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 344% and 453.4%, respectively, in the LV of Ossabaw swine fed a Western Diet compared to coronary vessels from Yucatan and Ossabaw swine without comorbidities. Species differences indicated TMPRSS2 mRNA levels increased 449.2% in the RV and 498.6% in the LV in Yucatan mini‐swine compared to coronary vessels in Ossabaw swine. A 107.3% increase in TMPRSS2 mRNA level was observed in male swine without HF compared to female intact swine with HF highlighting the importance of sex and disease state. Exercise training did not impact ACE2 or TMPRSS2 mRNA levels irrespective of tissue. In conclusion, these results suggest differences in RV, LV and coronary mRNA levels of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are dependent upon sex and comorbidities. TMPRSS2 levels are additionally influenced by pig species and pressure‐overload. These results provide insight into how ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels may influence the cardiovascular involvement of SARS‐COV‐2 infection in an experimental setting of pre‐clinical HF incorporating different swine species, sex, and comorbidities.","Kelly, Shannon; Thorne, Pamela; Leary, Emily; Emter, Craig",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239813/,531

69850,Why some animals have the power of regeneration.,2020-09-03,"BACKGROUND In September 2012, the World Health Organization reported the first cases of pneumonia caused by the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We describe a cluster of health care-acquired MERS-CoV infections. METHODS Medical records were reviewed for clinical and demographic information and determination of potential contacts and exposures. Case patients and contacts were interviewed. The incubation period and serial interval (the time between the successive onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission) were estimated. Viral RNA was sequenced. RESULTS Between April 1 and May 23, 2013, a total of 23 cases of MERS-CoV infection were reported in the eastern province of Saudi Arabia. Symptoms included fever in 20 patients (87%), cough in 20 (87%), shortness of breath in 11 (48%), and gastrointestinal symptoms in 8 (35%); 20 patients (87%) presented with abnormal chest radiographs. As of June 12, a total of 15 patients (65%) had died, 6 (26%) had recovered, and 2 (9%) remained hospitalized. The median incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 14.7), and the serial interval was 7.6 days (95% CI, 2.5 to 23.1). A total of 21 of the 23 cases were acquired by person-to-person transmission in hemodialysis units, intensive care units, or in-patient units in three different health care facilities. Sequencing data from four isolates revealed a single monophyletic clade. Among 217 household contacts and more than 200 health care worker contacts whom we identified, MERS-CoV infection developed in 5 family members (3 with laboratory-confirmed cases) and in 2 health care workers (both with laboratory-confirmed cases). CONCLUSIONS Person-to-person transmission of MERS-CoV can occur in health care settings and may be associated with considerable morbidity. Surveillance and infection-control measures are critical to a global public health response.","Assiri, Abdullah; McGeer, Allison; Perl, Trish M; Price, Connie S; Al Rabeeah, Abdullah A; Cummings, Derek A T; Alabdullatif, Zaki N; Assad, Maher; Almulhim, Abdulmohsen; Makhdoom, Hatem; Madani, Hossam; Alhakeem, Rafat; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Cotten, Matthew; Watson, Simon J; Kellam, Paul; Zumla, Alimuddin I; Memish, Ziad A",The New England journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1306742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23782161/,531
69996,Induction of alternatively activated macrophages enhances pathogenesis during severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection.,2012,"BACKGROUND Advanced age is the most important risk factor for death as a result of COVID-19, but there is a dearth of knowledge regarding the impact of chronic diseases. Using health registry data, we describe the disease profiles of persons who died after a confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2 during the first three months of the pandemic in Norway. MATERIAL AND METHOD Data from the specialist health service (Norwegian Patient Registry, NPR) and the primary health service (Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care, NRPHC) were linked to information on positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) and on deaths from the National Population Register. The data retrieval included the Norwegian population as of 1 March 2020 with data for confirmed infections, hospitalisations and deaths until 31 May 2020. RESULTS Of 8 412 persons with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, altogether 244 (2.9 %) died, whereof 133 (55 %) were men. Among those with a confirmed infection, the proportion who died varied from 0.2 % (age < 60 years) to 52 % (age ≥ 90 years). Altogether 92 (38 %) patients died in hospital. 25 (16 %) of those who died elsewhere had previously been hospitalised for COVID-19. The proportion with no registered chronic disease was 39 % in the age group < 70 years and 26 % in the age group ≥ 70 years. The disease distribution varied between those patients who had died in and outside of hospital, especially for diagnoses of diabetes, renal failure and dementia. INTERPRETATION Among those who had a SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed during the first three months of the pandemic in Norway, only a small proportion died. The majority of those who died were 70 years or older and had at least one chronic disease, but the disease profile varied between patients who died in and outside of hospital. Health registry data can help provide a better overview of and advice to risk groups in the population during an ongoing pandemic.","Gulseth, Hanne Løvdal; Helland, Eyvind; Johansen, Knut Ivar; Gravningen, Kirsten; Eide, Helena Niemi; Håberg, Siri Eldevik; Bakken, Inger Johanne","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0693; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33322877/,531

Here, we summarize the latest insights into cellular uptake mechanisms and pathways. We highlight limitations of current systems to study endocytosis, particularly problems with non-specific inhibitors. We also summarize alternative genetic approaches to robustly probe these pathways and discuss the need to understand how cells endocytose particles in vivo.

78550,Petechial Skin Rash Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection.,2020-04-30,"Neuroanatomic connections link the olfactory and limbic systems potentially explaining an association between olfactory dysfunction and depression. Some previous studies have demonstrated that olfactory dysfunction is associated with increased depressive symptoms. However, these studies were cross-sectional and unable to establish which develops first. We used longitudinal data to determine if impaired odor identification increased subsequent depressive symptoms or vice versa. We assessed olfaction and depression in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, a nationally-representative, 15-year longitudinal study of older U.S. adults. Olfaction was measured using a validated odor identification test (Sniffin' Sticks). Depressive symptoms were measured using a modified version of the validated Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Multivariable logistic regression models examined the temporal relationships between developing olfactory dysfunction and depression while accounting for demographics, disease comorbidities, alcohol use, smoking, and cognition. Older adults with olfactory dysfunction had concurrent frequent depressive symptoms (OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.00 - 1.43). Among healthy adults at baseline, those who had olfactory dysfunction were more likely to develop frequent depressive symptoms 5 or 10 years later (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.13 - 4.37). Conversely, those with frequent depressive symptoms at baseline were not more likely to develop olfactory dysfunction 5 or 10 years later. We show for the first time that olfactory dysfunction predicts subsequent development of depression in older U.S. adults. These data support screening for depression in older adults with chemosensory impairment and set the stage for disentangling the relationship between olfaction and depression.","Eliyan, Yazan; Wroblewski, Kristen E; McClintock, Martha K; Pinto, Jayant M",Chemical senses,https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjaa075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197253/,531
81208,COVID curbed carbon emissions in 2020 - but not by much.,2021-01-15,"Noroviruses are the major cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans. However, little is known regarding the norovirus life cycle, including cell binding and entry. In contrast to human noroviruses, the recently discovered murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) readily infects murine macrophages and dendritic cells in culture. Many viruses, including the related feline calicivirus, use terminal sialic acids (SA) as receptors for infection. Therefore, we tested whether SA moieties play a role during MNV-1 infection of murine macrophages. Competition with SA-binding lectins and neuraminidase treatment led to a reduction in MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages, suggesting a role for SA during the initial steps of the MNV-1 life cycle. Because SA moieties can be attached to glycolipids (i.e., gangliosides), we next determined whether MNV-1 uses gangliosides during infection. The gangliosides GD1a, GM1, and asialo-GM1 (GA1) are natural components of murine macrophages. MNV-1 bound to ganglioside GD1a, which is characterized by an SA on the terminal galactose, but not to GM1 or asialo-GM1 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The depletion of gangliosides using an inhibitor of glycosylceramide synthase (d-threo-P4) led to a reduction of MNV-1 binding and infection in cultured and primary murine macrophages. This defect was specifically rescued by the addition of GD1a. A similar phenotype was observed for MNV field strains WU11 (GV/WU11/2005/USA) and S99 (GV/Berlin/2006/DE). In conclusion, our data indicate that MNV can use terminal SA on gangliosides as attachment receptors during binding to murine macrophages.","Taube, Stefan; Perry, Jeffrey W; Yetming, Kristen; Patel, Sagar P; Auble, Heather; Shu, Liming; Nawar, Hesham F; Lee, Chang Hoon; Connell, Terry D; Shayman, James A; Wobus, Christiane E",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02245-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19244326/,531
83133,Adaptation of Elecsys® anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 immunoassay to dried blood spots: proof of concept.,2021-02-04,"Family Medicine was a child of the 1960s. Triggered by compelling social need for care outside of large hospitals, Family Medicine emphasized access to personal physicians based in the community. As a protest movement, the ABFP required ongoing recertification for all Diplomates, with both independent examination and chart audit. Fifty years later, society and health care have changed dramatically, and it is time again to consider how Board Certification must respond to those change. We propose three interlocking arguments. First, even before COVID-19, health and health care have been in a time of fundamental transformation. Second, given the role Board Certification plays in supporting improvement of healthcare, Board Certification itself must respond to these changes. Third, to move forward, ABFM and the wider Board community must address a series of wicked problems - i.e., problems which are both complex-with many root causes-and complicated- in which interventions create new problems. The wicked problems confronting board certification include: 1) combining summative and formative assessment, 2) improving quality improvement and 3) reaffirming the social contract and professionalism and its assessment.","Newton, Warren P",Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine : JABFM,https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2020.s1.200214; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32928942/,531

OBJECTIVES To synthesize findings from clinical psychology and affective neuroscience related to the construct of emotional temperament; to examine the effects of antidepressants on the temperament dimensions of positive (PA) and negative affectivity (NA); and to propose a biobehavioral research paradigm for the treatment of MDD. METHODS We begin with an introduction to PA and NA, which emphasizes their construct development, historical context, and relevance to psychopathology. We then review studies of antidepressant effects on PA and NA, and explore two related hypotheses: (1) Cause-correction: The antidepressant response may fundamentally occur through changes in emotional temperament, with subsequent spread to syndrome or symptom changes; (2) preferential effects: Antidepressants with different mechanisms of action may have preferential effects on PA or NA. RESULTS Preliminary findings appear to support the cause-correction hypothesis; there is insufficient clinical evidence to support the preferential effects hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS PA and NA are biologically based temperament dimensions, which modulate emotional, motivational, and behavioral responses to positive and negative incentives. They can be altered by antidepressants, and may independently contribute to depression improvement. In addition, the distinct biobehavioral features of PA and NA suggest that combined pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral treatments targeting these dimensions may have specific, and perhaps, synergistic antidepressant effects.","Soskin, David P; Carl, Jenna R; Alpert, Jonathan; Fava, Maurizio",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-5949.2012.00318.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22672296/,531

96201,Icatibant in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: a case description.,2020-12-04,"BACKGROUND Obesity is associated with reduced pulmonary function. We evaluated pulmonary function and status of asthma and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) before and 5 years after bariatric surgery. METHODS Spirometry was performed at baseline and 5 years postoperatively. Information of asthma and OSAS were recorded. Of 113 patients included, 101 had undergone gastric bypass, 10 duodenal switch and 2 sleeve gastrectomy. RESULTS Eighty (71%) patients were women, mean preoperative age was 40 years and preoperative weight was 133 kg in women and 158 kg in men. Five years postoperatively, weight reduction was 31% (42 kg; p < 0.001) in women and 24% (38 kg; p < 0.001) in men. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) increased 4.1% (116 ml; p < 0.001) in women and 6.7% (238 ml; p = 0.003) in men. Forced vital capacity (FVC) increased 5.8% (209 ml; p < 0.001) in women and 7.6% (349 ml; p < 0.001) in men. Gender and weight loss were independently associated with the improvements in FEV1 and FVC. At follow-up, FEV1 had increased 36% of the difference towards the estimated normal FEV1, and there was a corresponding 70% recovery of FVC. These improvements occurred despite an expected decline in pulmonary function by age during the study period. Of the asthmatics and OSAS patients, 48 and 80%, respectively, were without symptoms 5 years postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS Pulmonary function measured with spirometry was significantly improved 5 years after bariatric surgery, despite an expected age-related decline during this period. Symptoms of asthma and OSAS also improved.","Hewitt, Stephen; Humerfelt, Sjur; Søvik, Torgeir T; Aasheim, Erlend T; Risstad, Hilde; Kristinsson, Jon; Mala, Tom",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-013-1159-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435516/,531

The 2018 new definition proposed in May 2018 consists of new diagnostic criteria for PJI. We conducted a retrospective study and demonstrated that the new definition could improve the diagnostic efficiency in Chinese patients. However, missing data led to bias in the previous retrospective study. Therefore, this prospective study is designed to further validate the feasibility of 2018 new definition (and its modified version) for Chinese patients. METHODS/DESIGN This is a single-centre, prospective diagnostic study with 1 year of follow-up. The patients enrolled in the trial will be divided into a PJI group and an Aseptic group based on the eligibility criteria. We will recruit at least 70 patients for each group from October 2019 to October 2020. Blood samples, synovial fluid samples and intraoperative variables of all the included patients will be collected to assess various indicators. We will integrate the results of the various tests and examine the diagnostic efficiency (sensitivity and specificity) of five diagnostic criteria. DISCUSSION We design the prospective study in the hope of reducing the bias caused by missing data. Therefore, the prospective study will further support the conclusion of our preceding retrospective study. The results of this study will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. CONCLUSION Through this prospective study, we will validate the feasibility of the 2018 new PJI definition (and its modified version) for Chinese patients and determine the optimal method of PJI diagnosis.

109528,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 invasion in the central nervous system: a host-virus deadlock.,2021,"PURPOSE Electrical stimulation of the upper airway dilator muscles is an emerging treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Invasive hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS) has been accepted as treatment alternative to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for selected patients, while transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) of the upper airway is being investigated as non-invasive alternative. METHODS A meta-analysis (CRD42017074674) on the effects of both HNS and TES on the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) in OSA was conducted including published evidence up to May 2018. Random-effects models were used. Heterogeneity and between-study variance were assessed by I2 and τ2, respectively. RESULTS Of 41 identified clinical trials, 20 interventional trials (n = 895) could be pooled in a meta-analysis (15 HNS [n = 808], 5 TES [n = 87]). Middle-aged (mean ± SD 56.9 ± 5.5 years) and overweight (body mass index 29.1 ± 1.5 kg/m2) patients with severe OSA (AHI 37.5 ± 7.0/h) were followed-up for 6.9 ± 4.0 months (HNS) and 0.2 ± 0.4 months (TES), respectively. The AHI improved by - 24.9 h-1 [95%CI - 28.5, - 21.2] in HNS (χ2 79%, I2 82%) and by - 16.5 h-1 [95%CI - 25.1, - 7.8] in TES (χ2 7%, I2 43%; both p < 0.001). The ESS was reduced by - 5.0 (95%CI - 5.9, - 4.1) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Both invasive and transcutaneous electrical stimulation reduce OSA severity by a clinically relevant margin. HNS results in a clinically relevant improvement of symptoms. While HNS represents an invasive treatment for selected patients with moderate to severe OSA, TES should be further investigated as potential non-invasive approach for OSA.","Ratneswaran, Deeban; Guni, Ahmad; Pengo, Martino F; Al-Sherif, Miral; He, Baiting; Cheng, Michael Cf; Steier, Joerg; Schwarz, Esther I",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11325-020-02069-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388780/,531
116091,The analysis of alcohol consumption during the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Italian lockdown.,2021-05-05,"The coccygeal region has complex anatomy, much of which may contribute to or be the cause of coccyx region pain (coccydynia). This anatomy is well depicted at imaging, and management is often dictated by what structures are involved. Coccydynia is a common condition that is known to be difficult to evaluate and treat. However, imaging can aid in determining potential causes of pain to help guide management. Commonly, coccydynia (coccygodynia) occurs after trauma and appears with normal imaging features at static neutral radiography, but dynamic imaging with standing and seated lateral radiography may reveal pathologic coccygeal motion that is predictive of pain. In addition, several findings seen at cross-sectional imaging in patients with coccydynia can point to a source of pain that may be subtle and easily overlooked. Radiology can also offer a role in management of coccygeal region pain with image-guided pain management procedures such as ganglion impar block. In addition to mechanical coccyx pain, a host of other conditions involving the sacrococcygeal region may cause coccydynia, which are well depicted at imaging. These include neoplasm, infection, crystal deposition, and cystic formations such as pilonidal cyst. The authors review a variety of coccydynia causes, their respective imaging features, and common management strategies.©RSNA, 2020.","Skalski, Matthew R; Matcuk, George R; Patel, Dakshesh B; Tomasian, Anderanik; White, Eric A; Gross, Jordan S","Radiographics : a review publication of the Radiological Society of North America, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1148/rg.2020190132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609598/,531

Immunization by replication-competent controlled virus.,2015,"BACKGROUND Most cholangiocarcinoma patients with malignant obstructive jaundice (MOJ) have varying degrees of malnutrition and immunodeficiency preoperatively. Therefore, perioperative nutritional support has important clinical significance in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. AIM To investigate the effects of postoperative early enteral nutrition (EEN) on immunity function and clinical outcomes of cholangiocarcinoma patients with MOJ. METHODS This prospective clinical study included 60 cholangiocarcinoma patients with MOJ who underwent surgery. The patients were randomly divided into an experimental group and a control group according to the nutrition support modes. The control group received postoperative total parenteral nutrition (TPN), whereas the experimental group received postoperative EEN and parenteral nutrition (PN; EEN + PN). The clinical outcomes, postoperative immune function, incidences of surgical site infection and bile leakage, intestinal function recovery time, average hospitalization days, and hospitalization expenses of the two groups were assessed on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 3, and 7. RESULTS The CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD4+T/CD8+T cell count and the immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgM, and IgA levels in the EEN + PN group were significantly higher than those in the TPN group on PODs 3 and 7 (P < 0.05), whereas no significant differences in the CD3+T, CD4+T, CD8+T, and CD4+T/CD8+T cell counts and IgG, IgM, and IgA levels before operation and on POD 1 were found between the two groups (P > 0.05). The intestinal function recovery time and postoperative hospital stay were shorter (P < 0.001 for both) in the EEN + PN group than in the TPN group. The hospitalization expenses of the EEN + PN group were lower than those of the TPN group (P < 0.001). However, the incidence of abdominal distension was higher than in the EEN + PN group than in the TPN group (P < 0.05). The incidence rates of biliary leakage and surgical site infection were not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION A postoperative EEN program could reduce the incidence of postoperative complications and improve the clinical outcomes and immune functions of cholangiocarcinoma patients with MOJ and is thus beneficial to patient recovery.","Ma, Bing-Qiang; Chen, Shi-Yong; Jiang, Ze-Bin; Wu, Biao; He, Yu; Wang, Xin-Xin; Li, Yuan; Gao, Peng; Yang, Xiao-Jun",World journal of gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.3748/wjg.v26.i46.7405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33362392/,531
122906,Identification of key amino acid residues required for horseshoe bat angiotensin-I converting enzyme 2 to function as a receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2010,"Introduction Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is a scientifically proven HIV prevention intervention. Uganda, like many countries has been implementing VMMC for over 10 years but uptake is still low especially in northern Uganda. To attain 80% needed for public health impact, scale-up was recommended with many innovations implemented with sub-optimal results. This study therefore wanted to find out some of the correlates of VMMC uptake in Gulu district, northern Uganda. Methods Two studies were conducted separately but data was analyzed for this study. For the quantitative study, proportions and frequencies were used to measure perception of increased risk of HIV infection using age, gender, occupation, marital and circumcision status. Qualitative study provided data from FGDs, IDIs and KIIs were first transcribed in Acholi and then translated in English. Transcripts were uploaded in MAXDQA software for data management. A code book for emerging themes was developed. Results A total of 548 respondents were interviewed for the quantitative study, where two thirds (66%) of the participants perceived themselves to be at increased risk of HIV infection. For the qualitative study, 149 participants from 19 FGDs, 11 KIIs and 9 IDIs were interviewed. Data were analyzed thematically using both inductive and deductive approaches. Devices were preferred to conventional surgery while mobile services were preferred to static services. However, there were divergent views regarding circumcision service providers' socio-demographics and these were influenced mainly by age, level of education and location. Conclusion People in Northern Uganda perceived themselves to be at an increased risk of HIV infection. They preferred devices to conventional surgery, mobile services to static services but had varying views about the socio-demographics of the service providers.","Nanteza, Barbara M; Gray, Ronald H; Serwadda, David; Kennedy, C; Makumbi, Fredrick",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394216/,531

Radial glial progenitors (RGPs) generate the majority of neurons in developing brains. Here, we evaluated the acute alterations in RGPs after maternal sevoflurane exposure. METHODS Pregnant mice were exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane for 6 hours on gestational day 14.5. Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) of RGPs in the ventricular zone (VZ) of the fetal brain was evaluated by thymidine analogues labelling. Cell fate of RGP progeny was determined by immunostaining using various neural markers. The Morris water maze (MWM) was used to assess the neurocognitive behaviours of the offspring. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed for the potential mechanism, and the potential mechanism validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), Western blot and rescue experiments. Furthermore, INM was examined in human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived 3D cerebral organoids. RESULTS Maternal sevoflurane exposure induced temporary abnormities in INM, and disturbed the cell cycle progression of RGPs in both rodents and cerebral organoids without cell fate alternation. RNA-Seq analysis, qPCR and Western blot showed that the Notch signalling pathway was a potential downstream target. Reactivation of Notch by Jag1 and NICD overexpression rescued the defects in INM. Young adult offspring showed no obvious cognitive impairments in MWM. CONCLUSIONS Maternal sevoflurane exposure during neurogenic period temporarily induced abnormal INM of RGPs by targeting the Notch signalling pathway without inducing long-term effects on RGP progeny cell fate or offspring cognitive behaviours. More importantly, the defects of INM in hESC-derived cerebral organoids provide a novel insight into the effects of general anaesthesia on human brain development.","Jiang, Ming; Tang, Tianxiang; Liang, Xinyue; Li, Juchen; Qiu, Yue; Liu, Shiwen; Bian, Shan; Xie, Yunli; Fang, Fang; Cang, Jing",Cell proliferation,https://doi.org/10.1111/cpr.13042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33955094/,531

The deregulation and dysfunction of miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis have been reported previously. AIMS To identify miRNA(s) playing a role in HSC activation and the underlying mechanism. METHODS We analyzed online microarray expression datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for differentially expressed miRNAs in hepatic fibrosis-related disease liver tissues, examined the specific effects of the candidate miRNA on TGF-β-induced HSC activation, and screened for the targets of the candidate miRNA in the TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Then, the predicted miRNA-mRNA binding, the specific effects of the target mRNA, and the dynamic effects of miRNA and mRNA on TGF-β-induced HSC activation were investigated. RESULTS The miR-503 expression was upregulated in TGF-β-activated HSCs. miR-503 overexpression enhanced, while miR-503 inhibition attenuated TGF-β-induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. miR-503 targeted SMAD7 to inhibit SMAD7 expression. SMAD7 knockdown also aggravated TGF-β-induced HSC proliferation and ECM accumulation in HSCs. The effects of miR-503 overexpression on TGF-β-induced HSC activation were partially reversed by SMAD7 overexpression. In CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis model in rats, miR-503 overexpression aggravated, whereas SMAD7 overexpression improved CCl4-induced fibrotic changes in rats' liver tissues. The effects of miR-503 overexpression on CCl4-induced fibrotic changes were partially reversed by SMAD7 overexpression. CONCLUSION miR-503 acts on HSC activation and hepatic fibrosis through SMAD7.

A 25-year-old cockatiel ( Nymphicus hollandicus ) was diagnosed with distal extremity necrosis after a nonunion of a closed tibiotarsal fracture. In both cases amputation was recommended due to the poor prognosis for healing and because both birds were poor surgical candidates for traditional methods of amputation due to patient size or age. Therefore, stifle disarticulation surgery for amputation of the pelvic limb was performed successfully in both cases and recovery was unremarkable. The outcomes of these 2 cases suggest that stifle disarticulation may be used as an alternative to transfemoral amputation in birds where prolonged surgery, anesthesia, or patient size precludes traditional amputation techniques.","Ozawa, Sarah; Mans, Christoph",Journal of avian medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1647/2015-138; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28358606/,531

Involvement of the visceral vessels (n = 24, 25%) was treated with debranching in 15 (15.6%) or fenestration/stenting in 9 (9.4%). Patients had a mean follow-up of 11.5 ± 10.96 (range: 0-38) months. Overall mortality was 6.25% (n = 6). Mean intensive care unit stay was 6.26 ± 8.55 (range: 1-63, median: 4) days, and hospital stay was 9.97 ± 10.31 (range: 1-65, median: 65) days. Major complications were infrequent and included: spinal cord ischemia (n = 6, 6.25%), stroke (n = 6, 6.25%), myocardial infarction (n = 3, 3.15%), renal failure (n = 6, 6.25%), and wound complications (n = 9, 9.38%). Reoperation was required in 13 (13.54%), with early intervention in 2 (2.1%). The vast majority of patients were discharged directly to home (n = 66, 68.8%). There were no significant differences between death (1/49 [2%] vs 5/47 [10.6%], P = .07), stroke (3/49 [6%] vs 3/47 [6%], P = 1.0), or spinal cord ischemia (3/49 [6%] vs 3/47 [6%], P = 1.0) when comparing urgent/emergent presentation to elective cases, respectively. However, there were significant differences in death (6/58 [10.5%] vs 0/38 [0%], P = .04) and spinal cord ischemia (6/58 [10.5%] vs 0/38 [0%], P = .04) but not stroke (5/58 [8.8%] vs 1/38 [2.5%], P = .24] when procedures were performed outside the specific instructions for use. CONCLUSIONS Results of this single-institution report suggest that endovascular thoracic aortic repair is a safe and effective treatment option for a variety of thoracic pathology including both elective and emergent cases. However, off-label usage of the devices is associated with a significantly higher risk of mortality and spinal cord ischemia, but the risk still appears acceptable given the majority of cases were emergent.","Knowles, Martyn; Murphy, Erin H; Dimaio, J Michael; Modrall, J Gregory; Timaran, Carlos H; Jessen, Michael E; Arko, Frank R",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2010.10.052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21236618/,531

Symptomatology and treatment approach, however, are largely influenced by venous drainage. OBJECTIVE To propose an updated classification system using venous drainage. METHODS CCFs with posterior/inferior drainage only, posterior/inferior and anterior drainage, anterior drainage only, and retrograde drainage into cortical veins with/without other drainage channels were designated as types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. CCFs involving a direct connection between the internal carotid artery and cavernous sinus were designated as type 5. This system was retrospectively applied to 29 CCF patients. RESULTS Our proposed classification was significantly associated with symptomatology (P < .001). Type 2 was significantly associated with coexisting ocular/orbital and cavernous symptoms only (P < .001), type 3 with ocular/orbital symptoms only (P < .01), and type 4 demonstrated cortical symptoms with/without ocular/orbital and cavernous symptoms (P < .01), respectively. There was a significant association of our classification system with the endovascular treatment approach (P < .001). Types 1 and 2 were significantly associated with endovascular treatment through the inferior petrosal sinus (P < .01). Type 3 was significantly associated with endovascular treatment through the ophthalmic vein (P < .01) and type 5 with transarterial approach (P < .01), respectively. Types 2 (27.6%) and 3 (34.5%) were most prevalent in this series, whereas type 1 was rare (6.9%), suggesting that some degree of thrombosis is present, with implications for spontaneous resolution. Type 2 CCFs demonstrated a trend toward partial resolution after endovascular treatment (P = .07). CONCLUSION Our proposed classification system is easily applicable in clinical practice and demonstrates correlation with symptomatology, treatment approach, and outcome.","Thomas, Ajith J; Chua, Michelle; Fusco, Matthew; Ogilvy, Christopher S; Tubbs, R Shane; Harrigan, Mark R; Griessenauer, Christoph J",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1227/neu.0000000000000829; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26280824/,531

A common concern of parents of children with asthma is the risk that in-person learning poses during the pandemic. This Rostrum examines the actual risk of in-person learning among children with asthma during COVID-19, the discrepancy between perceived and actual risk, the contributing factors to this discrepancy, and possible solutions to narrow this divide. Overall, the evidence does not support that children with asthma are at an increased risk of COVID-19 morbidity or mortality compared to children without asthma. Asthma medications do not appear to contribute to incidence or severity of COVID-19 disease. However, there is a high perceived risk of in-person learning that is partially related to how it is portrayed in the media. There is little guidance regarding transitioning asthmatic children back to school and how to properly counsel on mediation of risk. There are differences regionally and locally around school reopening, exemptions, and their implementation. To narrow the divide between perceived and actual risk, clear consistent and ongoing communication will be necessary.","Abrams, Elissa M; Shaker, Marcus; Greenhawt, Matthew",The journal of allergy and clinical immunology.

We review the adaptations and challenges surrounding the preparation and response for pediatric emergency patients, with a specific focus on operational modifications, evolving personal protected equipment (PPE) needs, protected resuscitation responses, clinical characteristics in children, and the unintended effects on children and youth. RECENT FINDINGS COVID-19 has thus far proven to have a milder course in children, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic carriage or typical viral symptoms, to novel clinical entities such as 'COVID toes' and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), the latter associated with potentially significant morbidity. It has had an important effect on primary prevention, injury rates, reduced presentations for emergency care, and increased mental health, abuse and neglect rates in children and youth. PEDs have prepared successfully. The most significant adjustments have occurred with screening, testing, and consistent and effective use of PPE, along with protected responses to resuscitation, adaptations to maintain family-centered care, and technological advances in communication and virtual care. Simulation has been key to the successful implementation of many of these strategies. SUMMARY COVID-19 has pushed PEDs to rapidly adapt to evolving clinical and societal needs, with both resultant challenges and positive advances. Further experience and research will guide how in the face of a global pandemic we can further optimize the clinical and operational care of children and youth, ensure robust educational training programs, and maintain provider safety and wellness.","Beno, Suzanne; Ross, Caitlin; Principi, Tania",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000001010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33782243/,531

Genomic studies indicate that it is zoonotic from bats. The COVID-19 has led to significant loss of lives and a tremendous economic decline in the world. Generally, the population at risk of a fatal outcome are the elderly and those who are debilitated or are immune compromised. The fatality rate is high, but now is reduced after the development of preventive vaccine although an effective treatment by drug against the virus is yet to be developed. The treatment is narrowed to the use of several anti-viral drugs, or other re-purposed drugs. Social distancing, therefore, has emerged as a putative method to decrease the rate of infection. In this review, we summarize the aspects of the disease that is so far have come to light and review the impact of the infection on our society, healthcare, economy, education, and environment.","Das, Kabita; Pingali, M Shivapriya; Paital, Biswaranjan; Panda, Falguni; Pati, Samar Gourav; Singh, Anirudh; Varadwaj, Pritish Kumar; Samanta, Sintu Kumar",Frontiers in bioscience,https://doi.org/10.52586/4931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34162043/,531

AIMS The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effect of cognitive training interventions in the reduction of depression rating scale score in people with cognitive impairment. METHODS Literature searches were conducted via OVID databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated the effect of cognitive training interventions for the reduction of depression rating scale score in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia were included. Mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to combine the results of Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Standardized mean difference (SMD) was used to combine the results of different depression rating scales. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the types of cognitive training and severity of cognitive impairment, i.e. MCI and dementia. RESULTS A total of 2551 people with MCI or dementia were extracted from 36 RCTs. The baseline mean score of GDS-15 was 4.83. Participants received cognitive training interventions had a significant decrease in depression rating scale score than the control group (MD of GDS-15 = -1.30, 95% CI = -2.14--0.47; and SMD of eight depression scales was -0.54 (95% CI = -0.77--0.31). In subgroup analyses, the effect size of computerized cognitive training and cognitive stimulation therapy were medium-to-large and statistically significant in the reduction of depression rating scale score. CONCLUSIONS Cognitive training interventions show to be a potential treatment to ameliorate depression in people with cognitive impairment.","Chan, Joyce Y C; Chan, Tak Kit; Kwok, Timothy C Y; Wong, Samuel Y S; Lee, Allen T C; Tsoi, Kelvin K F",Age and ageing,https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa063; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32378715/,531

STUDY DESIGN Randomized, cadaveric ex vivo mechanical testing. SAMPLE POPULATION Canine cadaveric hemi-diaphragmatic specimens (n = 32 pairs). METHODS Thirty-two cadaveric diaphragm specimens were collected and divided to obtain 64 muscle specimens (9 cm × 4 cm). Paired specimens were bisected in the midpoint of their 9 cm length in the direction of the muscle fibers and apposed using either 2-0 polyglyconate or 2-0 barbed polyglyconate (V-LOC™ 180 Absorbable Wound Closure Device) in a simple continuous pattern. Increasing tension was applied perpendicular to the suture line until specimen failure. Failure mode and maximum load to failure were recorded for each specimen. RESULTS Mean ± SD failure load of simulated herniorrhaphies performed with barbed polyglyconate suture (54.5 ± 10.27 N) was not significantly different than repair with polyglyconate (56.9 ± 10.87 N).

AIMS The aim of this study was to assess its effects on conventional and novel measures of biventricular function, including the recently defined E'/(A'×S') (EAS) index, obtained using pulsed-wave tissue Doppler Imaging (PWTDI) and associated blood brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels. METHODS In this study, 14 healthy subjects aged 30.5 years were assessed at baseline and at >150 minutes following hypobaric hypoxia (HH) to the equivalent altitude of 4800 m for a total of 180 minutes. The combined EAS index (E'/(A' × S')) was calculated at the mitral and tricuspid annulus using data from the peak systolic (S') early (E') and late (A') diastolic filling. RESULTS It was seen that HH increased resting heart rate (63.4 ± 8.4 vs. 85.2 ± 10.2/min; P < 0.0001), cardiac output (4.6 ± 0.7 L/min vs. 6.1 ± 1.2 L/min; P < 0.0001), peak pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (26.3 ± 2.0 mmHg vs. 37.2 ± 6.3 mmHg; P < 0.0001), and reduced SpO2 (98.5 ± 1.1 vs. 72.9 ± 8.1%; P < 0.0001). There was a significant reduction in mitral (0.19 ± 0.06 vs. 0.11 ± 0.03; P < 0.0001) and tricuspid (0.12 ± 0.04 vs. 0.09 ± 0.03; P = 0.03) EAS indices, but no change in left or right ventricular myocardial performance (Tei) indices, global left ventricular (LV) longitudinal systolic strain, BNP levels, or estimated filling pressures (E/E'). Only reducing SpO2 remained as an independent predictor of PASP on multivariate analysis (overall R(2) = 0.77; P < 0.0001). The right and LV EAS indices were significantly correlated (r = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.07-0.7; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION The conclusion from this study was that acute prolonged HH does not adversely affect resting global biventricular function and there is evidence of linked right and LV responses.","Boos, Christopher J; Hodkinson, Pete D; Mellor, Adrian; Green, Nick P; Bradley, Daniel; Greaves, Kim; Woods, David R",Echocardiography,https://doi.org/10.1111/echo.12088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23305563/,531
166421,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2 or COVID-19),2021,"Purpose: Numerous guideline recommendations for airway and perioperative management during the COVID-19 pandemic have been published. We identified, synthesized, and compared guidelines intended for anesthesiologists. Source: Member society websites of the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists and the European Society of Anesthesiologists were searched. Recommendations focused on perioperative airway management of patients with proven or potential COVID-19 disease were included. Accelerated screening was used; data extraction was performed by one reviewer and verified by a second. Data was organized into themes based on perioperative phase of care. Principal Findings: Thirty unique sets of recommendations were identified. None reported methods for systematically searching or selecting evidence to be included. Four were updated following initial publication. For induction and airway management, most recommended minimizing personnel and having the most experienced anesthesiologist perform tracheal intubation. Significant congruence was observed amongst recommendations that discussed personal protective equipment. Of those that discussed tracheal intubation methods, most (96%) recommended video laryngoscopy, while discordance existed regarding use of flexible bronchoscopy. Intraoperatively, 23% suggested specific anesthesia techniques and most (63%) recommended a specific operating room for patients with COVID-19. Postoperatively, a minority discussed extubation procedures (33%), or care in the recovery room (40%). Non-technical considerations were discussed in 27% and psychological support for healthcare providers in 10%. Conclusion: Recommendations for perioperative airway management of patients with COVID-19 overlap to a large extent. However, we also identified significant differences.

This study evaluates the disruptions to US medical oncology practice during the pandemic in terms of number and type of patients (pts) encounters to determine the impact on continuity of patient care. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the CLQD electronic health record database, containing data from 2+ million pts from all 50 states. We assessed changes in the monthly proportions of visit encounter types (in-person outpatient [IPOP] and telehealth [TE]) for new and established patients (NP and EP) with an invasive malignancy, benign or in situ neoplasm, or benign hematology diagnosis having an encounter between 1/1/2018 and 9/30/2020. Results: 781,945 pts were studied. Median age on 1/1/2018 was 64 years (IQR: 53- 73), 38% were female, and 58% had an invasive malignancy. From 12/2019 to 9/2020, total monthly encounters dropped from 157,964 to 90,662. Monthly IPOP visits for NP dropped from 11.2% to 7.9%, an absolute drop of 3.3% and a relative drop of 30%;TE for NP increased by 1.1% (Table). Monthly IPOP visits for EP, as a percentage of all visits, dropped from 94.4% to 86.6% from 12/2019 to 6/2020 but rebounded to 90.4% by 9/2020. Fraction of TE increased substantially during the pandemic period reaching a peak in 6/2020 (13.8% for EP and 1.6% for NP) and decreased in 9/2020 to 9.6% and 1.1% for EP and NP, respectively. Compared to non-Hispanic patients, Hispanic patients had a larger reduction in IPOP and more TE during the study period. Percentage of monthly encounters, by type, from baseline. Conclusions: We observed a reduction in the absolute number and monthly percentage of IPOP encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. For EP, increases in TE does not fully compensate for reductions in IPOP. The reduction in IPOP NP encounters is particularly concerning since it was not accompanied by a compensatory increase in TE. The reduction in NP is consistent with reported pandemicassociated reductions in cancer screening and suggest a notable delay in cancer diagnoses during the pandemic. Reduction in Hispanic IPOP encounters warrants further evaluation. (Table Presented).","Jazieh, A. R.; Riffon, M.; King, J. C.; Rocque, G. B.; Paskett, E. D.; Potter, D.

Since mid-March, most entrepreneurs have had to experience difficulties with running a business. Some companies could not adapt to the situation, so they suffered huge losses due to the suspension of operations and were forced to leave the market. Due to untimely state support, many industries have suffered so much that they will need a very long time to recover. That is why business representatives began to actively send requests for easing the tax regime and providing other support measures. But in the current situation, not all business lines were under threat, someone was able to show flexibility and increase their revenue several times. Some industries were able to quickly switch to the production of masks, gloves, and antiseptics, so they were able to save jobs and profits. After the COVID-19 pandemic, many people will change their attitude to business, stop developing only in one direction, because now every entrepreneur has realized that flexibility is one of the most important criteria for survival in the market. The purpose of the study was to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on Russian business and the effectiveness of government support.

Since these countries implemented different COVID-19 intervention strategies, they provide a natural laboratory for examining how COVID-19 policies and mitigation strategies affected the propagation, evolution and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We explored how the duration, the size and number of transmission clusters, defined as country-specific monophyletic groups in a SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree, differed between the Nordic countries. We found that Sweden had the largest number of COVID-19 transmission clusters followed by Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland. Moreover, Sweden and Denmark had the largest, and most enduring, transmission clusters followed by Norway, Finland and Iceland. In addition, there was a significant positive association between transmission cluster size and duration, suggesting that the size of transmission clusters could be reduced by rapid and effective contact tracing. Thus, these data indicate that to reduce the general burden of COVID-19 there should be a focus on limiting dense gatherings and their subsequent contacts to keep the number, size and duration of transmission clusters to a minimum. Our results further suggest that although geographical connectivity, population density and openness influence the spread and the size of SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters, country-specific intervention strategies had the largest single impact.","Duchene, S.; Featherstone, L.; de Blasio, B.

Shotgun metagenome sequencing provides a snapshot of microbial diversity and the frequency of metabolic and functional gene content. Here, we present an analysis of 20 sediment samples collected from the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge to characterize the taxonomic and functional potential of the microbial and viral communities, and reconstructed metagenome-assembled genomes. A total of 122 medium-quality and 6 high-quality MAGs are reported, three of which likely represent a novel species within the class Dehalococcoidia. The most abundant phyla of bacteria and archaea were Proteobacteria and Euryarchaeota, respectively. Caudovirales was the most abundant viral order. Significant differences in taxonomic composition and diversity were observed among collection sites. Additionally, water samples were analyzed for pH, total nitrogen, total organic carbon, elements (P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, Pb, Ca, S), chloride, electric conductivity, orthophosphate, nitrate, and ammonia, while the sediment samples were analyzed for carbon, nitrogen, and pH. Differences in measured aquatic and sediment analytes revealed significant correlations with numerous phyla. Significant correlations were observed between estimated gene frequencies of both aquatic and sediment analytes, most notably between kup/kdpB and dsrA/cysC with potassium and sulfur, respectively, as well as phoD/phnX and cysC with pH. Together, these data provide an important view into the functional and metabolic potential encoded within the sediment microbial communities in the Florida Everglades.","Alvarez, David A; Cadavid, Nikolya A; Childs, Cale A; Cupelli, Matthew F; De Leao, Victoria A; Diaz, Alyssa M; Eldridge, Sophie A; Elhabashy, Yasmin B; Fleming, Allison E; Fox, Nathan A; Franco, Marianna; Gaspari, James C; Gerstin, Isabella M; Gibson, Kimberlee A; Huott, Alyssa L; Johnson, Alex O; Majhess, Ellie G; Mantilla, Gabriela; Perez, Gabriella S; Prieto, Juliet J; Reutter, Bridget C; Rivera, Elena I; Rootes, Thomas R; Sellers, Jade; Streibig, Allison M; Wilkinson, Joseph S; Zayas-Bazan, Siona; Bhadha, Jehangir H.; Clum, Alicia; Daum, Christopher; Glavina del Rio, Tijana; Lail, Kathleen; Roux, Simon; Eloe-Fadrosh, Emiley A.; Benskin, Jonathan B.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.430518,531

Sporadic cases have been imported worldwide, in Algeria, the first case reported on February 25, 2020 was imported from Italy, and then the epidemic has spread to other parts of the country very quickly with 139 confirmed cases until March 21, 2020. Methods: It is crucial to estimate the cases number growth in the early stages of the outbreak, to this end, we have implemented the Alg-COVID-19 Model which allows to predict the incidence and the reproduction number R0 in the coming months in order to help decision makers. The Alg-COVIS-19 Model initial equation 1, estimates the cumulative cases at t prediction time using two parameters: the reproduction number R0 and the serial interval SI. Results: We found R0=2.55 based on actual incidence at the first 25 days, using the serial interval SI= 4,4 and the prediction time t=26. The herd immunity HI estimated is HI=61%. Also, The Covid-19 incidence predicted with the Alg-COVID-19 Model fits closely the actual incidence during the first 26 days of the epidemic in Algeria Fig. 1.A. which allows us to use it.","HAMIDOUCHE, Mohamed",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.20.20039891,531

Challenges lie in resource-scarce settings, where outbreaks are likely to emerge, but where laboratory diagnostics and bioinformatics capacity are limited. Using unbiased metagenomic next generation sequencing (mNGS), we identified a variety of vector-borne, zoonotic and emerging pathogens responsible for undifferentiated fevers in a peri-urban population in Cambodia. From March 2019 to October 2020, we enrolled 473 febrile patients aged 6 months to 65 years of age presenting to a large peri-urban hospital in Cambodia. We collected sera and prepared sequencing libraries from extracted pathogen RNA for unbiased metagenomic sequencing and subsequent bioinformatic analysis on the global cloud-based platform, IDseq. We employed multivariate Bayesian models to evaluate specific pathogen risk causing undifferentiated febrile illness. mNGS identified vector-borne pathogens as the largest clinical category with dengue virus (124/489) as the most abundant pathogen. Underappreciated zoonotic pathogens such as Plasmodium knowlesi, leptospirosis, and co-infecting HIV were also detected. Early detection of chikungunya virus presaged a larger national outbreak of more than 6,000 cases. Pathogen-agnostic mNGS investigation of febrile persons in resource-scarce Southeast Asia is feasible and revealing of a diverse pathogen landscape. Coordinated and ongoing unbiased mNGS pathogen surveillance can better identify the breadth of endemic, zoonotic or emerging pathogens and deployment of rapid public health response.","Bohl, J.

183639,"[Experience with empirical treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome due to coronavirus, genotype IV].",2011,"A better understanding of antitumor immune responses is key to advancing the field of cancer immunotherapy. Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such as circulating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has been historically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining (sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cell sequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospective identification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clones in the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumor antigens. Lastly, these findings highlight the unique and specialized niche the SN can fill in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE Using high-throughput molecular cloning and antibody proteomics to study coordinated antitumor immunity in breast cancer patients, we simultaneously demonstrate that the sentinel lymph node is a localized source of expanded antitumor B cells undergoing affinity maturation and that their secreted antibodies are abundant as systemic IgG circulating in blood.","McDaniel, Jonathan R.; Pero, Stephanie C.; Voss, William N.; Shukla, Girja S.; Sun, Yujing; Schaetzle, Sebastian; Lee, Chang-Han; Horton, Andrew P.; Harlow, Seth; Gollihar, Jimmy; Ellefson, Jared W.; Krag, Christopher C.; Tanno, Yuri; Sidiropoulos, Nikoletta; Georgiou, George; Ippolito, Gregory C.; Krag, David N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/212308,531
183903,Glycosylation of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus triple-spanning membrane proteins 3a and M.,2006,"Collection of an accurate and comprehensive family cancer history (FCH) can help to identify millions of individuals at risk-for familial cancer syndromes. However, there are no formal guidelines for FCH collection and, as a result, there is wide variability in in strategies employed and accuracy of family health history across medical systems. Information technology (IT) provides a promising solution, a tool that has been shown to improve clinical documentation, workflows, quality of care, patient safety, communication and clinical decision support, and that can be completed remotely and safely during a pandemic. The aim of this study is to evaluate the literature on existing strategies whereby medical providers utilize information technology (IT) to assemble FCH. A systematic search of online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Library) between 1980 and 2020 was performed. Meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled results across studies. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed through the chi-square test (i.e., Cochrane Q test) and the inconsistency statistic (I2). A random effects analysis was used to calculate the pooled proportions and means. The comprehensive search produced 4005 publications. Thirty-two peer-reviewed studies met inclusion criteria. Twenty-seven distinct IT tools were evaluated which included the following categories: electronic survey administered prior to visit (21, 65.6%), electronic survey administered via tablet in the medical office (6, 18.8%), electronic survey via kiosk (4, 12.5%) and animated virtual counselor (1, 3.1%). Among the 196,566 included patients, 87.0% completed the FCH tool (electronic survey prior to the visit - 85.0 %;electronic survey in the medical office - 89.0 %). The time required for survey completion was 35.2 minutes (CI 14.3 -56.2). Twelve percent of patients (n=11,093) were referred for genetic assessment based on the output of the FCH tool. Among the studied methods of FCH collection, 7 (21.9%) had the capacity to interface directly with the patient's electronic medical record. [Display omitted] The rapidly advancing field of germline cancer genetics coupled with a growing emphasis on disease prevention and incorporation of technology into medical care algorithms prior to and accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic make utilization of IT strategies for collection of FCH a promising option. Our systematic review and meta-analysis found that electronic FCH collection can be completed successfully by patients in a time efficient manner.

183953,Specific plant terpenoids and lignoids possess potent antiviral activities against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2007,"Background & Aims Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has a hypoxic, immunosuppressive stroma, which contributes to its resistance to immune checkpoint blockade therapies. The hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) mediate the cellular response to hypoxia, but their role within the PDAC tumor microenvironment remains unknown. Methods We used a dual recombinase mouse model to delete Hif1α or Hif2α in α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-expressing cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) arising within spontaneous pancreatic tumors. The effects of CAF-Hif2α expression on tumor progression and composition of the tumor microenvironment were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, histology, immunostaining, and by both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing. CAF-macrophage crosstalk was modeled ex vivo using conditioned media from CAFs after treatment with hypoxia and PT2399, a HIF2 inhibitor currently in clinical trials. Syngeneic flank and orthotopic PDAC models were used to assess whether HIF2 inhibition improves response to immune checkpoint blockade. Results CAF-specific deletion of HIF2, but not HIF1, suppressed PDAC tumor progression and growth, and improved survival of mice by 50% (n = 21-23 mice/group, Log-rank P = 0.0009). Deletion of CAF-HIF2 modestly reduced tumor fibrosis and significantly decreased the intratumoral recruitment of immunosuppressive M2 macrophages and regulatory T cells. Treatment with the clinical HIF2 inhibitor PT2399 significantly reduced in vitro macrophage chemotaxis and M2 polarization, and improved tumor responses to immunotherapy in both syngeneic PDAC mouse models. Conclusions Together, these data suggest that stromal HIF2 is an essential component of PDAC pathobiology and is a druggable therapeutic target that could relieve tumor microenvironment immunosuppression and enhance immune responses in this disease.","Huang, Yanqing; Garcia Garcia, Carolina J.; Lin, Daniel; Nguyen, Nicholas D.; Fujimoto, Tara N.; Zhao, Jun; Lee, Jaewon J.; Bernard, Vincent; Yu, Meifang; Delahoussaye, Abagail M.; Phan, Jae L.; Deorukhkar, Amit; Molkentine, Jessica M.; Fuentes, Natividad R.; Turner, Madeleine C.; Saur, Dieter; Maitra, Anirban; Taniguchi, Cullen M.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.21.445190,531

Design Prospectively defined observational study using registry data. Setting Four acute NHS Hospitals in east London. Participants Patients aged [≥]16 years with an emergency hospital admission with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st September 2020 and 17th February 2021. Main outcome measures Primary outcome was 30-day mortality from time of index COVID-19 hospital admission. Secondary endpoints were 90-day mortality and need for ICU admission. Multivariable survival analysis was used to assess associations between ethnicity and mortality accounting for predefined risk factors. Age-standardised rates of hospital admission relative to the local population were compared between ethnic groups. Results Of 5533 patients, the ethnic distribution was White (n=1805, 32.6%), Asian/Asian British (n=1983, 35.8%), Black/Black British (n=634, 11.4%), Mixed/Other (n=433, 7.8%), and unknown (n=678, 12.2%). Excluding 678 patients with missing data, 4855 were included in multivariable analysis. Relative to the White population, Asian and Black populations experienced 4.1 times (3.77-4.39) and 2.1 times (1.88-2.33) higher rates of age-standardised hospital admission. After adjustment for various patient risk factors including age, sex, and socioeconomic deprivation, Asian patients were at significantly higher risk of death within 30 days (HR 1.47 [1.24-1.73]). No association with increased risk of death in hospitalised patients was observed for Black or Mixed/Other ethnicity. Conclusions Asian and Black ethnic groups continue to experience poor outcomes following COVID-19. Despite higher-than-expected rates of admission, Black and Asian patients experienced similar or greater risk of death in hospital, implying a higher overall risk of COVID-19 associated death in these communities.","Wan, Y.

186123,Lethal infection of K18-hACE2 mice infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.,2007,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Pre-clinical toxicology evaluation of biotechnology products is a challenge to the toxicologist. The present investigation is an attempt to evaluate the safety profile of the first indigenously developed recombinant DNA anti-rabies vaccine [DRV (100 μg)] and combination rabies vaccine [CRV (100 μg DRV and 1.25 IU of cell culture-derived inactivated rabies virus vaccine)], which are intended for clinical use by intramuscular route in Rhesus monkeys. METHODS: As per the regulatory requirements, the study was designed for acute (single dose - 14 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose - 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose - 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels, viz. therapeutic, average (2x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in monkeys. The selection of the model i.e. monkey was based on affinity and rapid higher antibody response during the efficacy studies. An attempt was made to evaluate all parameters which included physical, physiological, clinical, haematological and histopathological profiles of all target organs, as well as Tiers I, II, III immunotoxicity parameters. RESULTS: In acute toxicity there was no mortality in spite of exposing the monkeys to 10XDRV. In sub chronic and chronic toxicity studies there were no abnormalities in physical, physiological, neurological, clinical parameters, after administration of test compound in intended and 10 times of clinical dosage schedule of DRV and CRV under the experimental conditions. Clinical chemistry, haematology, organ weights and histopathology studies were essentially unremarkable except the presence of residual DNA in femtogram level at site of injection in animal which received 10X DRV in chronic toxicity study. No Observational Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) of DRV is 1000 ug/dose (10 times of therapeutic dose) if administered on 0, 4, 7, 14, 28(th) day. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: The information generated by this study not only draws attention to the need for national and international regulatory agencies in formulating guidelines for pre-clinical safety evaluation of biotech products but also facilitates the development of biopharmaceuticals as safe potential therapeutic agents.","Kumar, B.

The aim of the case series was to explore pulmonary PSMA expression not related to cancer in patients with PCa and concomitant COVID-19. In this retrospective, multicenter case series, patients who underwent 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT for PCa and concomitant proven COVID-19 infection were analyzed. Patients were stratified according to 68Ga-PSMA-11 intensity of uptake in the lung (SUVmax). Low uptake: < blood pool; mild-to-moderate uptake: > blood pool and < liver; intense uptake: > liver. Potential correlation between pulmonary 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake not related to PCa and CT patterns typical for COVID-19 was assessed. Nine patients were included, all of them presenting abnormal 68Ga-PSMA-11 uptake, at different grades: 2/9 low, 6/9 mild-to-moderate, 1/9 high. Uptake distribution was generally bilateral, peripheral and posterior, positively matching with ground-glass CT alterations in 7/9 (78%) patients, while mismatch was observed in 2/9 (22%). 1/9 patients presented PCa lung metastases at 68Ga-PSMA-11. 68Ga-PSMA-11-PET/CT detected increased PSMA uptake within the lung, not related to PCa, matching with CT typical COVID-19 patterns in almost all patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET in COVID-19 patients and the potential role of PSMA overexpression as a biomarker for neoangiogenesis, in both oncological and infective disorders.","Farolfi, Andrea; Telo, Silvi; Castellucci, Paolo; Morais de Campos, Ana Luiza; Rosado-de-Castro, Paulo Henrique; Altino de Almeida, Sergio; Artigas, Carlos; Scarlattei, Maura; Leal, Aline; Deandreis, Desiree; Fanti, Stefano; Fendler, Wolfgang Peter; Mosconi, Cristina; Pianori, Davide; Ruffini, Livia; Ceci, Francesco",American journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513283/,531

Scanning electron microscopy of H9 cells showed characteristic morphological changes in the cells after infection with human T cell lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-IIIB); these included loss of cell microvilli and their replacement by rounded surface protrusions. Virus particles were present over the whole cell surface, but were more numerous between, rather than on, surface protrusions. In contrast, CEM cells infected with three other isolates of the virus showed little change in morphology compared with uninfected cells; they typically had a single large aggregate of virus particles at the posterior end of the cell. Transmission electron microscopy of sections of infected cells showed budding virus in only a small proportion of cells although many had mature virus particles on their surface. The immature particles released by budding had a ring-like morphology in contrast to the mature virus with its characteristic elongated nucleoid. Surface spikes were rarely seen on sectioned virus particles, but were more obvious on the simian immunodeficiency virus than on human isolates. Negative staining of purified virus preparations showed that the peripheral dense material of immature particles had a striated structure. Surface spikes were not seen by negative staining on either immature or mature virus particles.

All nationally notified diseases (except HIV/AIDS and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) were analysed by disease group (n = 8), jurisdiction (six states and two territories), Indigenous status, age group and notification year. In total, 2 421 134 cases were analysed. The 10 diseases with highest notification incidence (chlamydial infection, campylobacteriosis, varicella zoster, hepatitis C, influenza, pertussis, salmonellosis, hepatitis B, gonococcal infection, and Ross River virus infection) comprised 88% of all notifications.

A total of 8·4% of cases were Indigenous Australians. Notification incidence increased by 6·4% per year (12% for sexually transmissible infections and 15% for vaccine-preventable diseases). The number of notifiable diseases also increased from 37 to 65. The number and incidence of notifications increased throughout the study period, partly due to addition of diseases to the NNDSS and increasing availability of sensitive diagnostic tests. The most commonly notified diseases require a range of public health responses addressing high-risk sexual and drug-use behaviours, food safety and immunization. Our results highlight populations with higher notification incidence that might require tailored public health interventions.","Gibney, K B; Cheng, A C; Hall, R; Leder, K",Epidemiology and infection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27586156/,531

189253,Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) patients in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan.,2020-09-01,"Background Recent research has indicated that vitamin D may have immune supporting properties through modulation of both the adaptive and innate immune system through cytokines and regulation of cell signalling pathways. We hypothesize that vitamin D status may influence the severity of responses to Covid-19 and that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in Europe will be closely aligned to Covid-19 mortality. Methods We conducted a literature search on PubMed (no language restriction) of vitamin D status (for older adults) in countries/areas of Europe affected by Covid-19 infection. Countries were selected by severity of infection (high and low) and were limited to national surveys or where not available, to geographic areas within the country affected by infection. Covid-19 infection and mortality data was gathered from the World Health Organisation. Results Counter-intuitively, lower latitude and typically 'sunny' countries such as Spain and Italy (particularly Northern Italy), had low mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and high rates of vitamin D deficiency. These countries have also been experiencing the highest infection and death rates in Europe. The northern latitude countries (Norway, Finland, Sweden) which receive less UVB sunlight than Southern Europe, actually had much higher mean 25(OH)D concentrations, low levels of deficiency and for Norway and Finland, lower infection and death rates. The correlation between 25(OH)D concentration and mortality rate reached conventional significance (P=0.046) by Spearman's Rank Correlation. Conclusions Optimising vitamin D status to recommendations by national and international public health agencies will certainly have benefits for bone health and potential benefits for Covid-19. There is a strong plausible biological hypothesis and evolving epidemiological data supporting a role for vitamin D in Covid-19.","Laird, E; Rhodes, J; Kenny, R A",Irish medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32603576/,531
189634,Multiple enzymatic activities associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus helicase.,2004,"The 2019 novel coronavirus (officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV2) was first found in Wuhan, China. On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the outbreak of the disease caused by SARS-CoV2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), as an emergency of international concern. Based on the current epidemiological surveys, some COVID-19 patients with severe infection gradually develop impairment of the respiratory system, acute kidney injury (AKI), multiple organ failure, and ultimately, death. Currently, there is no established pharmacotherapy available for COVID-19. As seen in influenza, immune damage mediated by excessive production of inflammatory mediators contributes to high incidence of complications and poor prognosis. Thus, removal or blocking the overproduction of these mediators potentially aids in reducing the deleterious cytokine storm and improving critically ill patients' outcomes. Based on previous experience of blood purification to treat cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), here we aimed to review the current literature on extracorporeal hemoperfusion as a potential therapeutic option for CSS-associated conditions, with a focus on severe COVID-19.","Safari, Saeid; Salimi, Alireza; Zali, Alireza; Jahangirifard, Alireza; Bastanhagh, Ehsan; Aminnejad, Reza; Dabbagh, Ali; Lotfi, Amir Hossein; Saeidi, Mohammad",Archives of academic emergency medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33134963/,531

191014,The spectrum of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus infection.,2004,"PURPOSE Both the aetiology and treatment of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is controversial and unnecessary resections can lead to over-treatment in such a benign disease. Our aim was to report our experience in patients with IGM managed mainly with conservative methods, such as antibiotics, drainages and corticosteroids. MATERIAL AND METHODS Pathology database from 2008 to 2018 was reviewed retrospectively. Demographics and symptoms were documented from patient charts. Follow-up information was obtained from clinical reviews, and severity and duration of symptoms were documented. All data were transferred to Excel file and the parameters were compared. RESULTS All 154 patients were women. Mean age was 35.9 years. Empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic, abscess drainage and steroid treatments were seen to be successful in most of the cases (95.4%). In patients with limited regression (2.5%) or persistant lesions (1.9%), a second cycle was employed with a total regression rate of 100%. Recurrence was seen one or two times in 23 (14.9%) and 2 (1.2%) patients in a mean follow-up period of 5.3 years. The average time of recurrence was 2.5 years (range, 9-74 months). CONCLUSIONS Conservative management could be efficacious for IGM, and less and simpler can be enough to achieve more effective results.

192460,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection of golden Syrian hamsters.,2005,"Aminopeptidase N (AP-N) degrades collagen type IV and is proposed to play a role in tumor invasion. However, the precise functions of AP-N in tumor cells and the relationship of AP-N to prostate cancer remains unclear. In our study, we examined a possible role for zinc in the regulation of AP-N enzymatic activity in relation to tumor cell invasion in human prostate. AP-N purified from human prostate was irreversibly inhibited by low concentrations of zinc (Ki = 11.2 microM) and bestatin. AP-N, which has zinc in the active center, was also inhibited by the chelating agents, EDTA, o-phenanthroline and EGTA. EDTA was shown to remove zinc from the enzyme. When the effects of zinc and bestatin on invasion of PC-3 cells were investigated in vitro using a Transwell cell-culture chamber, zinc and bestatin effectively suppressed cell invasion into Matrigel at the concentration range of 50-100 microM. These results strongly suggest that the suppression of PC-3 cell invasion by zinc is based on the inhibition of AP-N activity by zinc. We also evaluated the expression of AP-N to investigate the relationship with the progression of prostate disease in human cancerous prostate. AP-N was found to be located at the cytoplasmic membranes of prostate gland epithelial cells and to be expressed more in prostate cancer, while the expression of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is a useful marker for prostate cancer, was shown in normal and cancer tissues, suggesting that AP-N is potentially a good histological marker of prostate cancer. Thus, highly expressed AP-N in human cancerous prostate probably plays an important role in the invasion and metastasis of prostate cancer cells.","Ishii, K; Usui, S; Sugimura, Y; Yoshida, S; Hioki, T; Tatematsu, M; Yamamoto, H; Hirano, K",International journal of cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11279605/,531

This increase is coincidentwith increasing brucellosis seroprevalence in elk (Cervus elaphus), which is correlated with elk density. Vaccines are a seductive solution, but their use in wildlife systems remains limited by logistical, financial, and scientific constraints. Cattle vaccination is ongoing in the region. Livestock regulations, however, tend to be based on serological tests that test for previous exposure and available vaccines do not protect against seroconversion. The authors review recent ecological studies of brucellosis, with particular emphasis on the Greater Yellowstone Area, and highlight the management options and implications of this work, including the potential utility of habitat modifications and targeted hunts, as well as scavengers and predators. Finally, the authors discuss future research directions that will help us to understand and manage brucellosis in wildlife.","Cross, P C; Maichak, E J; Brennan, A; Scurlock, B M; Henningsen, J; Luikart, G",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23837367/,531

Promoter sequences closely resembling those of subgenomic mRNAs 3 and 7 were inserted into MIDI-C. Both subgenomic RNA promoters gave rise to the synthesis of a subgenomic DI RNA in virus-infected and DI RNA-transfected cells. From a mutagenic analysis of the promoters we concluded the following. (i) The extent of base pairing between the leader RNA and the intergenic promoter sequence does not control subgenomic RNA abundance. (ii) Promoter recognition does not rely on base pairing only. Presumably, transcription initiation requires recognition of the promoter sequence by the transcriptase. (iii) Fusion of leader and body sequences takes place at multiple--possibly random--sites within the intergenic promoter sequence. A model is presented in which, prior to elongation, the leader RNA is trimmed by a processive 3'-->5' nuclease.","van der Most, R G; de Groot, R J; Spaan, W J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8189503/,531
193645,[Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)].,2004,"Transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress the costimulatory ligand B7.2/CD86 on microglia spontaneously develop a T cell-mediated demyelinating disease. Characterization of the inflammatory infiltrates in the nervous tissue revealed a predominance of CD8+ T cells, suggesting a prominent role of this T cell subset in the pathology. In this study, we show that the same neurological disease occurred in Tg mice deficient in the generation of CD4+ T cells, with an earlier time of onset. Analysis of the CD8+ T cell repertoire at early stage of disease revealed the presence of selected clonal expansions in the CNS but not in peripheral lymphoid organs. We further show that Tg animals deficient in IFN-gamma receptor expression were completely resistant to disease development. Microglia activation that is an early event in disease development is IFN-gamma dependent and thus appears as a key element in disease pathogenesis. Collectively, our data indicate that the spontaneous demyelinating disease in this animal model occurs as a consequence of an inflammatory response initiated through the activation of CNS-specific CD8+ T cells by Tg expression of B7.2 within the target organ. Thus, autoreactive CD8+ T cells can contribute directly to the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis.","Brisebois, Marcel; Zehntner, Simone P; Estrada, José; Owens, Trevor; Fournier, Sylvie",Journal of immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16888002/,531

194023,A severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that lacks the E gene is attenuated in vitro and in vivo.,2007,"Linear polyubiquitin is processed at LRLRGG sequences by deubiquitinating enzymes to make free monomeric ubiquitin. This LRLRGG ubiquitin-like motif is found in a limited number of mammalian non-ubiquitin proteins, including the MAP3K Apoptosis Signal-Regulating Kinase-1 (ASK1), which activates MAPK signaling pathways. The c-terminus of ASK1 binds to the 19S cap of the proteasome allowing ASK1 to phosphorylate and inhibit proteasomal activity. We investigated whether the ubiquitin-like sequence in the c-terminus of ASK1 mediates its association with and inhibition of the proteasome. To test this we generated ASK1 with substitutions or deletions in this ubiquitin-like domain and examined the activation of cellular signaling and the association of ASK1 with the 19S cap of the proteasome. We show that ASK1 mutants have reduced association with the 19S cap of the proteasome, reduced capacity to inhibit the proteasome, and diminished ability to inhibit TNF-induced NF-κB activation. Mutant forms of ASK1 also had reduced capacity to activate JNK signaling, suggesting that the ubiquitin-like motif in ASK1 is also important for coordinating the balance between JNK and NF-κB signaling. Together these results demonstrate that the ubiquitin-like sequence of ASK1 is important for binding to and inhibition of the proteasome, and for the coordinated activation of cellular NF-κB and JNK signaling.","Schneider, Jeffrey R; Lodolce, James P; Boone, David L",Journal of biochemical and pharmacological research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24286022/,531

In the present study we evaluated the effects of long-term, low-dose treatment with murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against porcine CD4 and CD8 surface antigens on lymphocyte subsets in pigs. Four-week-old pigs were treated by intramuscular injections of hybridoma cell culture supernatants containing anti-CD mAbs twice a week for a period of 5 weeks. The immunomodulatory effects of the treatments were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Treatment with the anti-CD4 mAb almost completely eliminated the CD4(+) T-cell subset from the circulation after 2 weeks of therapy. This depletion persisted until the end of the experimental period 5 weeks after initiated therapy. Treatment with the anti-CD8 mAb was less effective, reducing the CD8(+) T-cell subset in peripheral blood by approximately 50% of the initial level after 3 weeks of therapy. Further, the anti-CD8 mAb-treated pigs showed a parallel increase in the CD4(+) T-cell subset from day 7. Two-colour FCM analysis indicated that a shift in phenotype from single-positive CD4(+)/CD8(-) to double-positive CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cells might have occurred in these pigs. In the present experiment we demonstrated specific modulation of the peripheral blood T-lymphocyte population in pigs with continuous low-dose injections of specific mAb. The ability to modulate individual T-cell subsets should provide a method to elucidate their functionality in protection against infectious disease.","Lohse, Louise; Nielsen, Jens; Eriksen, Lis","APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16499657/,531

The subjects had been held in long-term captivity and were probably used for fur farming or research, thus allowing sufficient longevity for joint disease to become recognisable. The prevalence of disorders that include osteochondrosis, osteoarthritis and changes compatible with hip dysplasia, was surprisingly high. Other changes that reflect near-normal or mild pathological conditions, including prominent articular margins and mild bony periarticular rim, were also prevalent. Our data form a basis for comparing joint pathology of captive raccoon dogs with other mammals and also suggest that contributing roles of captivity and genetic predisposition should be explored further in non-domestic canids.","Lawler, Dennis F; Evans, Richard H; Nieminen, Petteri; Mustonen, Anne-Mari; Smith, Gail K",Veterinaria italiana,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23277118/,531

A total of 715 unique oligonucleotides (60-mer) representing approximately 100 pathogens were designed based on open reading frames (ORFs) from highly conserved and heterogenic regions within viral families. In addition, viral genes reflecting different stages of pathogen infection were also included to potentially define the stage of the viral infection. Viruses (double-stranded DNA, double- or single-stranded RNA, delta, retroid), parasites, and bacteria were included. Test samples labeled with Cy5 were examined by cohybridization with a reference RNA, labeled with Cy3, to the pathogen microarray chip. Good reproducibility of experiments was observed, based on data generated from duplicate hybridizations and duplicate spots on the microarray platform. A viral transcript detection sensitivity of 1 x 10(3) plaque-forming units (pfus) was achieved using selected cell lines and viruses. These findings suggest that the array-based platform described here is capable of detecting a broad spectrum of viruses in a single assay with relatively high sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility.

PROCEDURE Clinical records and biopsy or necropsy specimens of ferrets with presumed epizootic catarrhal enteritis were reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for coronavirus antigen was performed on paraffin-embedded tissues from approximately 10% of affected ferrets to identify viral antigen and determine its distribution. Transmission electron microscopy was performed on fecal samples and sections of jejunum. Virus isolation studies as well as immunofluorescent tests for other similar viruses were performed. RESULTS Characteristic microscopic lesions consistent with intestinal coronavirus infection (vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of villus enterocytes; villus atrophy, fusion, and blunting; and lymphocytic enteritis) were consistently detected in affected ferrets. Coronavirus particles were identified in feces and jejunal enterocytes by use of transmission electron microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining of jejunal sections revealed coronavirus antigens.

METHODS From March 11 to March 19, 2020, we collected air samples from the clean area, the buffer room and the contaminated area respectively in the COVID-19 wards using a portable bioaerosol concentrator WA-15. And sterile premoistened swabs were used to sample the high-frequency contacted surfaces in the contaminated area and the surfaces of medical staff's protective equipment including outermost gloves, tracheotomy operator's positive pressure respiratory protective hood and isolation clothing. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid of the samples were detected by real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR. During the isolation medical observation period, those medical staff who worked in the COVID-19 wards were detected for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid with oropharyngeal swabs, IgM and IgG antibody in the sera, and chest CT scans to confirm the infection status of COVID-19. RESULTS No SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was detected in the tested samples, including the 90 air samples from the COVID-19 wards including clean area, buffer room and contaminated area, the 38 high-frequency contact surfaces samples of the contaminated area and 16 surface samples of medical staff's protective equipment including outermost gloves and isolation clothing.

The association of CSS with the severity of disease upon admission and the final adverse outcomes was assessed using Pearson's correlation test and logistic regression, respectively. RESULTS: Total of 121 patients (60±16 years), including 54 women and 67 men, with positive RT-PCR tests were enrolled. We found a significant but weak correlation between CSS and qSOFA, as a measure of disease severity (r: 0.261, p = 0.003). No significant association was demonstrated between CSS and LOS. Patients with CSS>8 had at least three-fold higher risk of ICU admission, intubation, and mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CSS in baseline CT scan of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia can predict adverse outcomes and is weakly correlated with initial disease severity.","Khosravi, Bardia; Aghaghazvini, Leila; Sorouri, Majid; Naybandi Atashi, Sara; Abdollahi, Mohammad; Mojtabavi, Helia; Khodabakhshi, Marjan; Motamedi, Fatemeh; Azizi, Fatemeh; Rajabi, Zeynab; Kasaeian, Amir; Sima, Ali Reza; Davarpanah, Amir H; Radmard, Amir Reza",Heart Lung,,531

In this study, we gathered data from 10 community-based organizations (CBO's) in the United States that work to provide services for people experiencing homelessness. The combined CBO's span across rural, urban, and a mixture of both settings. We identified three needs that the CBO's indicated to be urgent: (1) the increased need for basic services among guests/clients, (2) new organizational challenges for the CBO's, and (3) issues related to emergency management and disasters. Among these urgent needs, respondents also indicated the need for emotional support for staff and volunteers experiencing burnout during the COVID-19 response. They also expressed some unique aspects of new care delivery systems, such as clients' willingness to engage in rehabilitation programs because of noncongregate sheltering options corresponding with those support services.","Pixley, Cotina Lane; Henry, Felicia A; DeYoung, Sarah E; Settembrino, Marc R",,,531

207029,"Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, household transmission, and lethality of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection among healthcare workers in Ontario, Canada",2020,"BACKGROUND: Universal screening has been proposed as a strategy to identify asymptomatic individuals infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mitigate transmission. AIM: To investigate the rate of positive tests among pregnant women in Melbourne, Australia. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional prevalence study at three maternity hospitals (one tertiary referral hospital and two secondary maternities) in Melbourne, Australia. SARS-CoV-2 testing was offered to all pregnant women attending face-to-face antenatal visits and to those attending the hospital with symptoms of possible coronavirus disease, between 6th and 19th of May 2020. Testing was performed by multiplex-tandem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on combined oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs. The primary outcome was the proportion of positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed in 350 women, of whom 19 had symptoms of possible COVID-19. The median maternal age was 32 years (IQR 28-35 years), and the median gestational age at testing was 33 weeks and four days (IQR 28 weeks to 36 weeks and two days). All 350 tests returned negative results (pÌ=0%, 95% CI 0-1.0%). CONCLUSION: In a two-week period of low disease prevalence, the rate of asymptomatic coronavirus infection among pregnant women in Australia during the study period was negligible, reflecting low levels of community transmission.","Rolnik, Daniel L; Korman, Tony M; Rindt, Andrea; Stuart, Rhonda L; Giles, Michelle L; Rawlins, Janine; Palmer, Kirsten R; Stripp, Andrew; Wallace, Euan M; Hodges, Ryan J",Women and birth (Online),,531

Understanding the clinical profile and management of COVID-19 will help to plan better prevention and treatment strategies taking the local context into consideration. In this study, we described the clinical profile, treatment used, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients in one of the COVID-19 treatment centers of Ethiopia, Boru Meda Hospital. An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study was carried out using medical records of COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Boru Meda Hospital with a positive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR result from May 9, 2020 to September 20, 2020. All patients with a positive RT-PCR were admitted to the hospital, regardless of symptom and severity status. A total of 279 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. The median age of patients was 28 years (interquartile range 23-40). The majority (69.5%) were male. Around a quarter (n = 73; 26.2%) of the patients were symptomatic, of which cough (n = 49; 67.1%) and fever (n = 32; 43.8%) were common symptoms. Among symptomatic patients, 48 (65.8%) were mild, four (5.5%) moderate, 12 (16.4%) severe, and nine (12.3%) were critical. The case fatality rate was 2.1%. Hypertension, age older than 25 years, and HIV/AIDS were significantly associated with symptomatic infection. In this study, most of the COVID-19 patients were asymptomatic. However, the proportion of severe and critical patients among those with symptoms was high. More studies are needed to assess the effect of HIV/AIDS on the severity and mortality of COVID-19.","Abdela, Seid Getahun; Abegaz, Seid Hassen; Demsiss, Wondmagegn; Tamirat, Koku Sisay; van Henten, Saskia; van Griensven, Johan",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,531

We review licensing and regulations and discuss teleradiology in providing services to rural areas and assisting with disaster response, including the response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. CONCLUSION. Teleradiology can help increase imaging efficiency and mitigate both geographic and temporal discrepancies in imaging care. Technologic limitations and regulatory hurdles hinder the optimal practice of teleradiology, and future attention to these issues may help ensure broader patient access to high-quality imaging across the United States.","Hanna, Tarek N; Steenburg, Scott D; Rosenkrantz, Andrew B; Pyatt, Robert S; Duszak, Richard; Friedberg, Eric B",AJR Am J Roentgenol,,531

This article looks at the potential impact of COVID-19 on student learning as schools abruptly morphed into virtual learning environments using data from several instructional, practice, and assessment solutions offered by Renaissance. First, three hypothetical learning scenarios are considered using normative data from Star assessments to explore the potential impact on reading and math test performace. Next, data on Focus Skills are used to highlight which grades may have missed the most foundational math and reading content if instruction was stopped or reduced. Last, data from two of Renaissance's practice tools are used to evaluate whether students were practicing key skills following school closures. The article concludes that academic decline will likely occur but may be tempered by the increased use of practice tools; effects may look different for math and reading; and may impact grades and schools differently. As such, schools may need to leverage decision-making frameworks, such as the Multi-tiered Systems of Support/Response-to-Intervention (MTSS/RTI) framework, more than ever to identify needs and target instruction where it matters most when school begins in fall 2020.","Wyse, Adam E.; Stickney, Eric M.; Butz, David; Beckler, Amanda; Close, Catherine N.",Educ.

Patients with comorbidities are most vulnerable to this disease. Therefore, cancer patients are reported to be more susceptible to COVID-19 infection, particularly lung cancer patients. To evaluate the probable reasons behind the excessive susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients to COVID-19 infection, we targeted the two most crucial agents, Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and C-X-C motif 10 (CXCL10). ACE2 is a receptor protein that plays a vital role in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cell and CXCL10 is a cytokine mainly responsible for the lung cell damage involving in a cytokine storm. By using the UALCAN and GEPIA2 databases, we observed that ACE2 and CXCL10 are mostly overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC). We then identified the functional significance of ACE2 and CXCL10 in lung cancer development by determining the genetic alteration frequency in their amino acid sequences using the cBioPortal web portal. Lastly, we did the pathological assessment of targeted genes using the PANTHER database. Here, we found that ACE2 and CXCL10 along with their commonly co-expressed genes are involved respectively in the binding activity and immune responses in case of lung cancer and COVID-19 infection. Finally, based on this systemic analysis, we concluded that ACE2 and CXCL10 are two possible biomarkers responsible for the higher susceptibility and fatality of lung cancer patients towards the COVID-19.","Mahmood, Tousif Bin; Chowdhury, Afrin Sultana; Hossain, Mohammad Uzzal; Hasan, Mehedee; Mizan, Shagufta; Aakil, Md Mezbah-Ul-Islam; Hossan, Mohammad Imran",Curr Res Microb Sci,,531

One way to solve this problem is to remove passwords completely. User studies on passwordless FIDO2 authentication using security tokens demonstrated the potential to replace passwords. However, widespread acceptance of FIDO2 depends, among other things, on how user accounts can be recovered when the security token becomes permanently unavailable. For this reason, we provide a heuristic evaluation of 12 account recovery mechanisms regarding their properties for FIDO2 passwordless authentication. Our results show that the currently used methods have many drawbacks. Some even rely on passwords, taking passwordless authentication ad absurdum. Still, our evaluation identifies promising account recovery solutions and provides recommendations for further studies.","Kunke, Johannes; Wiefling, Stephan; Ullmann, Markus; Iacono, Luigi Lo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.12477v1.pdf,531

224358,"Herd Immunity against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection in 10 Communities, Qatar",2021,"There is an increasing realization that biomedical procedures alone cannot guarantee better health. Health is essentially influenced by factors outside the scope of the health sector, especially economic, social, and political forces. Health promotion is the process of empowering people to increase control over their health and its determinants through health literacy efforts and multisectoral action to increase healthy behaviors. Current evidence revealed that the COVID-19 virus is transmitted through respiratory droplets or contact. Contact route occurs when contaminated hands touch the mucosa of the mouth, nose, or eyes; the virus can also be spread from one surface to another by contaminated hands, which facilitates indirect contact transmission. Previously severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) and other threatening diseases were eliminated with the application of preventive health measures (to avoid being exposed) without effective treatment or vaccine. In this review, the author reviewed Medline, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Saudi Digital Library, Springerlink, and PubMed database and relevant websites (e.g. www.who.int and www.cdc.gov) for all available articles and publication related to health promotion or COVID-19.

In detecting RNA and DNA from either self or non-self, nucleic acid sensors mediate the pathogenesis of many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Despite promising pre-clinical data and investigational use in the clinic, relatively few drugs targeting nucleic acid sensors are approved for therapeutic use. Nevertheless, there is growing appreciation for the untapped potential of nucleic acid sensors as therapeutic targets, driven by the need for better therapies for cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders. This review highlights the diverse mechanisms by which nucleic acid sensors are activated and exert their biological effects in the context of various disease settings.

Utilising a case study of Italian vaccination policy, the article considers counterfactuals and the challenges of governing health policy in an age of disinformation. It counterposes two methods of governing vaccination compliance: discipline, which uses public institutions to inculcate the population with favourable attitudes and practices, and modulation, which uses access to public institutions as a form of control. The Italian government ineffectively employed discipline for a number of years. Epistemological and organisational constraints stymied its efforts to tackle a significant childhood vaccination compliance problem. With a loss of control over the information environment, vaccinations were not served well by exogenous crises, the sensationalism of the news cycle and online misinformation. Hampered by austerity, lack of capacity and epistemic shortcomings, the Italian government did not protect the public legitimacy of the vaccination programme. Instead of employing communications to reassure a hesitant population, they focused on systemic and delivery issues, until it was too late to do anything except make vaccinations mandatory (using modulation). The apparent short-term success of this measure in generating population compliance does not foreclose the need for ongoing governance of vaccine confidence through effective discipline. This is evident for the COVID-19 vaccination campaign, with many Italians still indicating that they would not accept a vaccine despite the devastation that the disease has wrought throughout their country.","Attwell, Katie; Harper, Tauel; Rizzi, Marco; Taylor, Jeannette; Casigliani, Virginia; Quattrone, Filippo; Lopalco, PierLuigi",Policy Sci,,531
227207,Household Transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 from Adults to Children,2020,"Background: There is little empirical evidence with respect to the implementation (adherence) of occupational health and safety guidelines in Germany. Recommendations for the prevention of SARS-CoV­2 infections in hairdressing services were provided by the German Statutory Accident Insurance for the Health and Welfare Services (BGW) in an occupational health and safety (OHS) standard in spring 2020. Research question: To what extent are the recommendations adhered to in this service profession as judged by hairdresser's customers after their visits? Material and methods: The survey was conducted as a covert participant observational study between the beginning of October and the middle of December 2020 as a non-systematic opportunistic sample in three cities. The standardized checklist included three domains: a) measures of general, mainly technical nature, b) in contact with the customer and c) on an individual level for infection prevention.The results on domain and overall level were summarized in a standardized sum index (0-1) of SARS-CoV­2 OHS standard adherence. Nonparametric Wilcoxon tests were used to examine possible differences among the three subindices. Results: The overall adherence index of 162 observations was 0.75 (SD 0.14). The two subindices on infection prevention in contact with the customer (e.g. indications for behavior rules) and on the individual level (e.g. wearing a mouth-nose covering) were significantly better than the one on general measures (e.g., hand cleaning possibility for customers). Discussion: The observed adherence for prevention of SARS-CoV-2-infections in hairdresser salons was higher than experiences of the BGW on OHS adherence suggest. This might be explained by the general public awareness of risks of infection. The results on the adherence are only slightly lower than those resulting from around 400 standardized personal surveys of the BGW prevention services. Limitations: Given the non-systematic opportunistic sample, a (positive) bias in the adherence results cannot be excluded.","Michaelis, Martina; Stößel, Ulrich; Stranzinger, Johanna; Nienhaus, Albert",Zentralbl Arbeitsmed Arbeitsschutz Ergon,,531

METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochran Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for the relevant records up to April 2021. Moreover, we scanned MedRxiv, Google Scholar, and clinical registry databases to identify additional records. We have used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and Cochrane risk of bias tools to assess the quality of studies. This Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan software (version 5.3). RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included. No significant difference was observed between lopinavir/ritonavir and non-antiviral treatment groups in terms of negative rate of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on day 7 (risk ratio [RR]: 0.83;95% CI: 0.63 to 1.09;P=0.17), and day 14 (RR: 0.93;95% CI: 0.81 to 1.05;P=0.25), PCR negative conversion time (mean difference [MD]: 1.09;95% CI: -0.10 to 2.29;P=0.07), secondary outcomes, and adverse events (P&gt;0.05). There was no significant difference between lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine as well as lopinavir/ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine regarding the efficacy outcomes (P&gt;0.05). However, lopinavir/ritonavir showed better efficacy than arbidol for the same outcomes (P&lt;0.05). Lopinavir/ritonavir plus arbidol was effective compared to arbidol alone in terms of the negative rate of PCR on day 7 (P=0.02). However, this difference was not significant regarding other efficacy outcomes (P&gt;0.05).

228628,Neurological manifestations of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-a controversy 'gone viral',2020,"OBJECTIVE: This review aimed at systematically evaluating the efficacy and safety of Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine in the treatment of pneumonia. METHODS: A systematic search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on pneumonia treatment using a combination of Yinqiao powder and western medicine was performed in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, Weipu (VIP) and CBM. The retrieval time limit was from the establishment of the database to June 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted the data and evaluated the bias risk of the included studies. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan5.3 software. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULT: Fifteen RCTs involving 1705 patients were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis results revealed the total effective rate of the treatment group [RR = 1.21, 95% CI (1.15, 1.27), P < 0.00001], bacterial clearance rate [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (1.05, 1.22), P = 0.001], adverse reactions [RR = 0.54, 95% CI (0.38, 0.76), P = 0.0005]. There were statistically significant differences in the cooling time, T cell number, procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) value decline rate (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the decline rate of neutrophils and leukocytes (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The current evidence indicated that the Yinqiao powder combined with western medicine can improve total efficiency in the treatment of pneumonia patients. The combination therapy performed better when compared to western medicine alone in the cooling time, bacterial clearance rate, T cell count, decline rates of CRP and PCT as well as in the incidences of adverse reactions. However, there was no significant difference in the decline rates of neutrophils and leucocytes between the two groups. The funnel plot, Egger's test and Begg's test indicated publication bias, which may be associated with unpublished negative study results. Due to the limitation of the quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality studies should be performed to verify our conclusions.","Fan, Yihua; Liu, Wei; Wan, Renhong; Du, Shaopeng; Wang, Aihua; Xie, Qing; Yang, Rumeng",Complement Ther Clin Pract,,531

TheCOVID-19 pandemic precipitated the use of restrictive personal protective equipment (PPE) which might reduce dexterityand decrease PDRs. We audited our polyp excision rates both prior to and post the COVID-19 pandemic in order to assesswhether restrictive PPE led to a diminution therein. Methods Our endoscopy database was queried for all colonoscopies performed between 01/01/2014 and 29/02/2020 (Pre-COVID-19, n = 18,231) and between 01/03/2020 and 02/09/2020 (Post-COVID-19, n = 825) and subsequently irrevocablyanonymised. A polyp excision rate (PER) was calculated for each period as a proxy for PDR. A comparative odds ratio was calculated. An ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, using number of polyps excised as the dependent variable and procedure in thepost-COVID-19 period as a primary explanatory variable, was performed. The regression was controlled for age, malegender and procedure coded as therapeutic (as opposed to diagnostic). Results 4,346 and 209 patients had at least one polyp excised in the pre-COVID-19 (PER 23.8 %) and post-COVID-19 (PER25.3 %) periods respectively. Odds ratio 1.08 (95 %CIs: 0.92, 1.27). OLS regression established positive relationships between number of polyps excised and age (0.004, 95 %CIs: 0.003,0.005), male gender (0.10, 95 %CIs: 0.07, 0.13) and procedure coded as therapeutic (1.75, 95 %CIs: 1.71, 1.78). Itdemonstrated no significant relationship between procedure in the post-COVID-19 period (-0.003, 95 %CIs:-0.07, 0.07)and number of polyps excised. Conclusions Odds ratios comparing PERs and an OLS regression analysing number of polyps excised failed to demonstrateany significant difference between the pre-COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 eras.","Matthews, T.; Breslin, N.; McNamara, D.; O039,; Connor, A.; Sarah, O.; Ryan, B.",Endoscopy,,531

METHODS: We have modeled the mortality and the intensive care unit (ICU) requirement for the care of patients with cancer infected with COVID-19 in Latin America. A dynamic multistate Markov model was constructed. Transition probabilities were estimated on the basis of published reports for cumulative probability of complications. Basic reproductive number (R0) values were modeled with R using the EpiEstim package. Estimations of days of ICU requirement and absolute mortality were calculated by imputing number of cumulative cases in the Markov model. RESULTS: Estimated median time of ICU requirement was 12.7 days, median time to mortality was 16.3 days after infection, and median time to severe event was 8.1 days. Peak ICU occupancy for patients with cancer was calculated at 16 days after infection. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed an interval for mortality between 18.5% and 30.4%. With the actual incidence tendency, Latin America would be expected to lose approximately 111,725 patients with cancer to SARS-CoV-2 (range, 87,116-143,154 patients) by the 60th day since the start of the outbreak. Losses calculated vary between < 1% to 17.6% of all patients with cancer in the region. CONCLUSION: Cancer-related cases and deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 will put a great strain on health care systems in Latin America. Early implementation of interventions on the basis of data given by disease modeling could mitigate both infections and deaths among patients with cancer.","Ruiz-Patiño, Alejandro; Arrieta, Oscar; Pino, Luis E; Rolfo, Christian; Ricaurte, Luisa; Recondo, Gonzalo; Zatarain-Barron, Zyanya-Lucia; Corrales, Luis; Martín, Claudio; Barrón, Feliciano; Vargas, Carlos; Carranza, Hernán; Otero, Jorge; Rodriguez, July; Sotelo, Carolina; Viola, Lucia; Russo, Alessandro; Rosell, Rafael; Cardona, Andrés F",JCO Glob Oncol,,531

240770,The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) in Dentistry. Management of Biological Risk in Dental Practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Testing plays a critical role in treatment and prevention responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared to nucleic acid tests (NATs), antigen-detection rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs) can be more accessible, but typically have lower sensitivity and specificity. By quantifying these trade-offs, we aimed to inform decisions about when an Ag-RDT would offer greater public health value than reliance on NAT. METHODS: Following an expert consultation, we selected two use cases for analysis: rapid identification of people with COVID-19 amongst patients admitted with respiratory symptoms in a 'hospital' setting and early identification and isolation of people with mildly symptomatic COVID-19 in a 'community' setting. Using decision analysis, we evaluated the health system cost and health impact (deaths averted and infectious days isolated) of an Ag-RDT-led strategy, compared to a strategy based on NAT and clinical judgement. We adopted a broad range of values for 'contextual' parameters relevant to a range of settings, including the availability of NAT and the performance of clinical judgement. We performed a multivariate sensitivity analysis to all of these parameters. RESULTS: In a hospital setting, an Ag-RDT-led strategy would avert more deaths than a NAT-based strategy, and at lower cost per death averted, when the sensitivity of clinical judgement is less than 90%, and when NAT results are available in time to inform clinical decision-making for less than 85% of patients. The use of an Ag-RDT is robustly supported in community settings, where it would avert more transmission at lower cost than relying on NAT alone, under a wide range of assumptions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their imperfect sensitivity and specificity, Ag-RDTs have the potential to be simultaneously more impactful, and have a lower cost per death and infectious person-days averted, than current approaches to COVID-19 diagnostic testing.","Ricks, Saskia; Kendall, Emily A; Dowdy, David W; Sacks, Jilian A; Schumacher, Samuel G; Arinaminpathy, Nimalan",BMC Med,,531
240834,Emergence of deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 during 2019-2020. (Special issue on the global emergence of corona virus in human.),2020,"Delirium is the clinical expression of an acute cerebral dysfunction caused by various noxious insults. Its prevalence is very high in the elderly, especially in the hospital setting, and in older patients it can be the presenting symptom of an acute underlying disease. Delirium is associated with several adverse clinical and functional outcomes, along with cognitive decline, institutionalization, and short- and long-term mortality. It is thus crucial to increase the attention on this geriatric syndrome, which has been demonstrated to be prevented in a large proportion of cases. Delirium is not only a marker of patient vulnerability and clinical instability, but also an index of the quality of care and the efficiency of its organization. By systematically assessing the presence of delirium during the whole length of hospital stay, physicians may closely monitor the patient’s clinical status. The aims of this chapter are to review the current clinical practice in delirium, focusing particularly on older and frail individuals. The topics covered include epidemiology and outcomes, causes, clinical features and diagnosis, prevention and treatment. Finally, implications for clinical practice are discussed.","Bellelli, Giuseppe Brathwaite Justin S.; Mazzola, Paolo",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,,531
240966,Role of Immunoglobulin M and A Antibodies in the Neutralization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,2021,"The research on the psychological and behavioural consequences of the perceived threat of infectious diseases is still in its early stage. The current study aims to contribute to this line of research by (a) developing and validating a scale for the perceived threat of coronavirus (COVID-19) and (b) investigating outcomes, the underlying mechanism and boundary condition of the perceived threat of COVID-19 through the lens of conservation of resources theory. This study proposes that the perceived threat of COVID-19 enhances turnover intention among nurses through psychological anxiety. The study further proposes an ideological contract as a buffer reducing turnover intention among nurses as a result of psychological anxiety. The current study data were collected with online questionnaires from Pakistani nurses (N = 117) treating COVID-19 patients. The Model 4 specification of the process macros developed by Hayes. Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach. New York, NY: The Guilford Press.) was utilized to test direct and indirect effects, while the Model 1 specification was used to test the moderation hypothesis. The results showed that the perceived threat of COVID-19 enhances psychological anxiety (ß = 0.30, P < 0.001) and turnover intention among nurses (ß = 0.35, P < 0.001). The mediation hypothesis was also supported, as psychological anxiety playing an underlying role in the relationship between perceived threat of COVID-19 and turnover intention (indirect effect = 0.13, LL = 0.05, UL = 0.23). The combined effect of psychological anxiety and ideological contract on turnover intentions was negative and significant (ß = -.33, P < 0.001), confirming the moderation hypothesis. These results offer important implications for nursing managers. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed.","Irshad, Muhammad; Khattak, Sana Aroos; Hassan, Muhammad Mubbashar; Majeed, Mehwish; Bashir, Sajid",Int. j. ment. health nurs,,531

250407,Trophoblast damage with acute and chronic intervillositis: disruption of the placental barrier by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"BACKGROUND: The emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading worldwide in 2020. Coronaviruses could mainly cause respiratory tract infections in humans and multiple system infections in many animals. The coronavirus enters the host cell through the binding of surface spike glycoprotein (S Protein) with host angiotensin-converting enzyme-â ¡ (ACE2) protein. METHODS: ACE2 sequences of various species were aligned with human ACE2, accordingly, homology models for different species were constructed. Then, S-protein-ACE2 complexes were constructed using the generated homology models. The molecular dynamics simulations and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) were carried out to study the dynamical behavior of the generated S-ACE2 virtual complexes. Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) and Radius of Gyration (Rg) were calculated to evaluate protein stability and compactness. RESULTS: The binding free energies of S protein with ACE2 from Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius are about equal to that of humans. By comparing the free binding energies it were possible to identify potential viral hosts that could transmit the virus to human (risk of cross-species transmission). The predication showed that, besides human beings, SARS-CoV-2 may possibly infect Procyon lotor and Camelus dromedarius as well.","Guo, Sheng; Yang, Jing; Lei, Yu; Liu, Bin; Zhang, Wei; Zhang, Li; Zuo, Zhili",J Mol Graph Model,,531

Here, we review the management of diabetes in pregnancy before and during the lockdown. Methods: Majority of antenatal diabetes and obstetric visits are provided remotely, with pregnant women attending hospital clinics only for essential ultrasound scans and labor and delivery. Online resources for supporting women planning pregnancy and for self-management of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using intermittent or continuous glucose monitoring are provided. Retinal screening procedures, intrapartum care, and the varying impact of lockdown on maternal glycemic control are considered. Alternative screening procedures for diagnosing hyperglycemia during pregnancy and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are discussed. Case histories describe the remote initiation of insulin pump therapy and automated insulin delivery in T1D pregnancy. Results: Initial feedback suggests that video consultations are well received and that the patient experiences for women requiring face-to-face visits are greatly improved. As the pandemic eases, formal evaluation of remote models of diabetes education and technology implementation, including women's views, will be important. Conclusions: Research and audit activities will resume and we will find new ways for supporting pregnant women with diabetes to choose their preferred glucose monitoring and insulin delivery.","Murphy, Helen R",Diabetes Technol Ther,,531

261173,Characteristics and Outcomes of 241 Births to Women With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Infection at Five New York City Medical Centers,2020,"BACKGROUND: To this end, the influence of COVID-19 on pregnant women and their neonates is not completely clear. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to investigate maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Besides, it investigates the likelihood of vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from pregnant women to their neonates. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted in three medical centers during the period from March to November 2020. Data were collected from the available medical records in the respective hospitals using a standardized questionnaire on maternal and neonatal clinical outcomes. All pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection across the three hospitals and their neonates were eligible to participate in this study. Descriptive statistics were presented as a median and interquartile range (IQR) or frequencies and percentages as appropriate using SPSS 24.0 software. RESULTS: This study has identified a total of 288 pregnant women with confirmed COVID-19 infection over the study period of a median age of 30 years and median GA at diagnosis 38 weeks (IQR: 39 -33) as well as 27% of them were obese (n=78). The majority of pregnant women were symptomatic with cough (n=92, 31.9%) being the most frequent COVID-19 symptom followed by fever and dyspnea (n=36, 12.5%). Two-hundred and four pregnant delivered (70.84%) and caesarean sections were prevalent among 35.8% of them. The most common adverse pregnancy outcome was premature (n=31, 15.5%), followed by fetal distress (n=13, 6.5%), preeclampsia (n=4, 2.0%), and one pregnant woman died. The laboratory results exhibit that temperature higher than 38 (n=27), leukopenia (n=19), neutropenia (n=54), ALT (n=12), AST (n=31), and thrombocytopenia (n=35) were less frequent among pregnant women while lymphopenia (n=126), hemoglobin levels lower than 13.0 (n=218), deceased albumin levels (n=195) were most frequent among them. However, a small proportion of pregnant women were admitted to the ICU (3.8%). The most frequent maternal treatments were antibiotics (n=81), antiviral (n=49), and corticosteroid (n=24). Of 204 neonates, four had died and all the remaining neonates were alive. The median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks (IQR: 35-40). Most neonates had normal laboratory results. However, 14 had lymphopenia (7.0%), 22 had neutropenia (11.0%), and 11 had thrombocytopenia (5.5%). Four infants had low hemoglobin levels of less than 13.0 (2.0%) and 81 had hyperbilirubinemia (e.g., total bilirubin of higher than 23; 40.5%). Approximately less than one-half of neonates required admission to the NICU (n=86, 43%), 7% of them required respiratory support of mechanical ventilation, and none of them get infected with COVID-19 disease. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study suggests that the majority of pregnant women had mild or moderate disease symptoms. Nevertheless, this study did not find any evidence of possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 infection from mothers to their babies. This study may provide a baseline for further studies focusing on investigating long-term maternal and neonate's outcomes and possible vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mothers to their newborn babies.","Al-Matary, Abdulrahman; Almatari, Faeza; Al-Matary, Mariam; AlDhaefi, Alaa; Alqahtani, Mohammed Hassan S; Alhulaimi, Emad Ahmad; AlOtaiby, Shahad; Almehiny, Khowlah; John, Lincy Soosan; Alanazi, Faisal Samah; Azad, Aisha; Aldandan, Faisal K",J Infect Public Health,,531

263539,Petechial Skin Rash Associated With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection,2020,"Amoebic gill disease is a parasitic condition that commonly affects marine farmed Atlantic salmon. The causative agent, Neoparamoeba perurans, induces a marked proliferation of the gill mucosa and focal superficial necrosis upon branchial lesions. The effect that amoebic branchialitis has upon gill associated commensal bacteria is unknown. A 16S rRNA sequencing approach was employed to profile changes in bacterial community composition, within amoebic gill disease (AGD)-affected and non-affected gill tissue. The bacterial diversity of biopsies with and without diseased tissue was significantly lower in the AGD-affected fish compared to uninfected fish. Furthermore, within the AGD-affected tissue, lesions appeared to contain a significantly higher abundance of the Flavobacterium, Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi compared to adjunct unaffected tissues. Quantitative PCR specific to both N. perurans and T. dicentrarchi was used to further examine the co-abundance of these known fish pathogens. A moderate positive correlation between these pathogens was observed. Taken together, the present study sheds new light on the complex interaction between the host, parasite and bacterial communities during AGD progression. The role that T. dicentrarchi may play in this complex relationship requires further investigation.","Slinger, Joel; Adams, Mark B; Wynne, James W",,,531

We selected 7272 adult COVID-19 patients from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment COVID-19 database for this nationwide retrospective cohort study. Among these, 686 patients with asthma were assessed by their severities and evaluated by the clinical outcome of COVID-19 compared to patients without asthma. Of 7272 adult COVID-19 patients, 686 with asthma and 6586 without asthma were compared. Asthma was not a significant risk factor for respiratory failure or mortality among all COVID-19 patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.99, P = 0.997 and OR = 1.06, P = 0.759) after adjusting for age, sex, and the Charlson comorbidity score. However, a history of acute exacerbation (OR = 2.63, P = 0.043) was significant risk factors for death among COVID-19 patients with asthma. Asthma is not a risk factor for poor prognosis of COVID-19. However, asthma patients who had any experience of acute exacerbation in the previous year before COVID-19 showed higher COVID-19-related mortality, especially in case of old age and male sex.","Lee, Sang Chul; Son, Kang Ju; Han, Chang Hoon; Jung, Ji Ye; Park, Seon Cheol",Sci Rep,,531

274107,High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,2020,"Previous research has suggested that sharing autobiographical memories in a coherent manner has a beneficial impact on consequent social reactions of listeners. In this experimental study, we were able to replicate earlier findings by demonstrating that listeners (N = 107) showed significantly more willingness to interact with, more social support towards, and a more positive attitude towards coherent than incoherent narrators. Remarkably, these beneficial effects of coherence were observed only for narratives about positive memories. Results are explained in the light of the relevance of positive memories for the social bonding function of autobiographical memory. Furthermore, earlier work was extended and refined by investigating effects of the individual constituting dimensions of coherence (context, chronology, theme) on social responses. In line with our predictions, the dimensions of chronology and theme were most important in impacting social responses of listeners. Possibly a reduction of the attraction effect due to increased effortful processing and reduced credibility due to insufficient emotional elaboration might explain these results respectively. Furthermore, social responses were worse when narratives were incoherent with regard to more than one dimension, in line with the expected additive effect. Overall, fully incoherent narratives, which had had low scores on context, chronology, and theme, had the most adverse effect on listeners' social responses. This study adds significantly to the domain of memory and cognition by showing how cognitive psychological research would benefit from extending a merely intrapersonal perspective to include an interpersonal perspective that considers social implications of memory and cognition as well.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Hermans, Dirk",Mem. cogn,,531
275512,In silico assessment of the impact of 2019 novel coronavirus genomic variation on the efficiency of published real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction detection assays,2020,"CONTEXT AND BACKGROUND: Corona virus (COVID) has rapidly gained a foothold and caused a global pandemic. Particularists try their best to tackle this global crisis. New challenges outlined from various medical perspectives may require a novel design solution. Asymptomatic COVID-19 carriers show different health conditions and no symptoms; hence, a differentiation process is required to avert the risk of chronic virus carriers. OBJECTIVES: Laboratory criteria and patient dataset are compulsory in constructing a new framework. Prioritisation is a popular topic and a complex issue for patients with COVID-19, especially for asymptomatic carriers due to multi-laboratory criteria, criterion importance and trade-off amongst these criteria. This study presents new integrated decision-making framework that handles the prioritisation of patients with COVID-19 and can detect the health conditions of asymptomatic carriers. METHODS: The methodology includes four phases. Firstly, eight important laboratory criteria are chosen using two feature selection approaches. Real and simulation datasets from various medical perspectives are integrated to produce a new dataset involving 56 patients with different health conditions and can be used to check asymptomatic cases that can be detected within the prioritisation configuration. The first phase aims to develop a new decision matrix depending on the intersection between 'multi-laboratory criteria' and 'COVID-19 patient list'. In the second phase, entropy is utilised to set the objective weight, and TOPSIS is adapted to prioritise patients in the third phase. Finally, objective validation is performed. RESULTS: The patients are prioritised based on the selected criteria in descending order of health situation starting from the worst to the best. The proposed framework can discriminate among mild, serious and critical conditions and put patients in a queue while considering asymptomatic carriers. Validation findings revealed that the patients are classified into four equal groups and showed significant differences in their scores, indicating the validity of ranking. CONCLUSIONS: This study implies and discusses the numerous benefits of the suggested framework in detecting/recognising the health condition of patients prior to discharge, supporting the hospitalisation characteristics, managing patient care and optimising clinical prediction rule.","Albahri, A S; Hamid, Rula A; Albahri, O S; Zaidan, A A",Artif Intell Med,,531

Here, to meet this urgent demand, we report a homogeneous immunoassay to detect IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. This serological assay, called SATiN, is based on a tri-part Nanoluciferase (tNLuc) approach, in which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and protein G, fused respectively to two different tNLuc tags, are used as antibody probes. Target engagement of the probes allows reconstitution of a functional luciferase in the presence of the third tNLuc component. The assay is performed directly in the liquid phase of patient sera and enables rapid, quantitative and low-cost detection. We show that SATiN has a similar sensitivity to ELISA, and its readouts are consistent with various neutralizing antibody assays. This proof-of-principle study suggests potential applications in diagnostics, as well as disease and vaccination management.","Yao, Zhong; Drecun, Luka; Aboualizadeh, Farzaneh; Kim, Sun Jin; Li, Zhijie; Wood, Heidi; Valcourt, Emelissa J; Manguiat, Kathy; Plenderleith, Simon; Yip, Lily; Li, Xinliu; Zhong, Zoe; Yue, Feng Yun; Closas, Tatiana; Snider, Jamie; Tomic, Jelena; Drews, Steven J; Drebot, Michael A; McGeer, Allison; Ostrowski, Mario; Mubareka, Samira; Rini, James M; Owen, Shawn; Stagljar, Igor",Nat Commun,,531

288656,Determinants of survival after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection in Mexican outpatients and hospitalised patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Given the magnitude and speed of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, achieving timely and effective manual contact tracing has been a challenging task. Early in the pandemic, contact tracing apps generated substantial enthusiasm due to their potential for automating tracing and reducing transmission rates while enabling targeted confinement strategies. However, although surveys demonstrate public interest in using such apps, their actual uptake remains limited. Their social acceptability is challenged by issues around privacy, fairness, and effectiveness, among other concerns. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine the extent to which design and implementation considerations for contact tracing apps are detailed in the available literature, focusing on aspects related to participatory and responsible eHealth innovation, and synthesize recommendations that support the development of successful COVID-19 contact tracing apps and related eHealth technologies. METHODS: Searches were performed on five databases, and articles were selected based on eligibility criteria. Papers pertaining to the design, implementation, or acceptability of contact tracing apps were included. Articles published since 2019, written in English or French, and for which the full articles were available were considered eligible for analysis. To assess the scope of the knowledge found in the current literature, we used three complementary frameworks: (1) the Holistic Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies, (2) the Montreal model, and (3) the Responsible Innovation in Health Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 63 articles qualified for the final analysis. Less than half of the selected articles cited the need for a participatory process (n=25, 40%), which nonetheless was the most frequently referenced item of the Framework to Improve the Uptake and Impact of eHealth Technologies. Regarding the Montreal model, stakeholder consultation was the most frequently described level of engagement in the development of contact tracing apps (n=24, 38%), while collaboration and partnership were cited the least (n=2, 3%). As for the Responsible Innovation in Health framework, all the articles (n=63, 100%) addressed population health, whereas only 2% (n=1) covered environmental considerations. CONCLUSIONS: Most studies lacked fundamental aspects of eHealth development and implementation. Our results demonstrate that stakeholders of COVID-19 contact tracing apps lack important information to be able to critically appraise this eHealth innovation. This may have contributed to the modest uptake of contact tracing apps worldwide. We make evidence-informed recommendations regarding data management, communication, stakeholder engagement, user experience, and implementation strategies for the successful and responsible development of contact tracing apps.","Osmanlliu, Esli; Rafie, Edmond; Bédard, Sylvain; Paquette, Jesseca; Gore, Genevieve; Pomey, Marie-Pascale",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,531

The study found that 92 percent of respondents reported implementing voluntary actions with 35 percent reporting quarantine and 37 percent reporting isolation actions. The attributes of respondents and the agencies and communities they work in are categorized in terms of personal, disciplinary, or professional backgrounds, as attributes such as urban versus rural, coastal versus non-coastal, and other factors. Three dependent variables are modeled including 1) risk tolerance;2) level of preparedness (including support for training), and 3) implementation of protective measures for social distancing, quarantine, and isolation to ascertain the influences of personal, professional, and regional, locational characteristics. A risk tolerance score is implemented by asking respondents “what percentage of the population would need to be sick to implement voluntary and non-voluntary actions. Using Poisson regression analysis and correspondence analysis, the patterns, associations, and clustering of backgrounds and other attributes are modeled to show the relationships between risk perceptions, preparedness, and professional backgrounds. In addition to identifying which places and people are more inclined to support protective actions for the pandemic, this analysis also helps to demonstrate the intersections and mutual interests across public health, transportation, and emergency management. Overall, this study found a low level of preparedness for the pandemic with 70 percent of the respondents supporting additional training.","Kim, Karl E.; Yamashita, Eric Ghimire Jiwnath Transportation Research Board",,,531

306379,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Vertical Transmission from an Asymptomatic Mother,2021,"PURPOSE: Recently, more than 10 models have been developed to predict remission of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) after metabolic surgery. The ABCD score was compared to the individualized metabolic surgery (IMS) score in terms of prediction of T2DM remission, but which of the two scoring systems is better remains controversial. METHODS: Patient data from 463 obese East Asian patients who underwent laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or SG with duodenojejunal bypass (SG-DJB) as a primary operation and were followed for at least 3 years were retrospectively collected from 24 institutions. The correlation between the ABCD and IMS scoring systems and the discrimination power of the models was evaluated. The cut-off point for the IMS stage of T2DM severity was also revised to adjust the scoring system to obese East Asian patients. RESULTS: The two scoring systems were significantly well correlated. The IMS scoring system showed significant differences in T2DM remission rates between the procedures in the moderate stage, but the ABCD score showed no significant differences in each category. The discrimination power of the IMS score was comparable to that of the ABCD score at both 3 and 5 years. The revised IMS scoring system showed that SG-DJB had significantly higher T2DM remission rates in the moderate stage at 5 years than RYGB or SG.

306741,"Rapid, Sensitive, Full-Genome Sequencing of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2",2020,"The World Health Organization (WHO) declared novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, as Pandemic in March 2020. It has affected more than 40 million people in 216 countries. Almost in all the affected countries, the number of infected and deceased patients has been enhancing at a distressing rate. As the early prediction can reduce the spread of the virus, it is highly desirable to have intelligent prediction and diagnosis tools. The inculcation of efficient forecasting and prediction models may assist the government in implementing better design strategies to prevent the spread of virus. In this paper, a state-of-the-art analysis of the ongoing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods in the diagnosis and prediction of COVID-19 has been done. Moreover, a comparative analysis on the impact of machine learning and other competitive approaches like mathematical and statistical models on COVID-19 problem has been conducted. In this study, some factors such as type of methods(machine learning, deep learning, statistical & mathematical) and the impact of COVID research on the nature of data used for the forecasting and prediction of pandemic using computing approaches has been presented. Finally some important research directions for further research on COVID-19 are highlighted which may facilitate the researchers and technocrats to develop competent intelligent models for the prediction and forecasting of COVID-19 real time data.","Swapnarekha, H; Behera, Himansu Sekhar; Nayak, Janmenjoy; Naik, Bighnaraj",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,531

We and others have previously demonstrated that cats are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and can efficiently transmit the virus to naïve cats. Here, we address whether cats previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2 can be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. In two independent studies, SARS-CoV-2-infected cats were re-challenged with SARS-CoV-2 at 21 days post primary challenge (DPC) and necropsies performed at 4, 7 and 14 days post-secondary challenge (DP2C). Sentinels were co-mingled with the re-challenged cats at 1 DP2C. Clinical signs were recorded, and nasal, oropharyngeal, and rectal swabs, blood, and serum were collected and tissues examined for histologic lesions. Viral RNA was transiently shed via the nasal, oropharyngeal and rectal cavities of the re-challenged cats. Viral RNA was detected in various tissues of re-challenged cats euthanized at 4 DP2C, mainly in the upper respiratory tract and lymphoid tissues, but less frequently and at lower levels in the lower respiratory tract when compared to primary SARS-CoV-2 challenged cats at 4 DPC. Viral RNA and antigen detected in the respiratory tract of the primary SARS-CoV-2 infected cats at early DPCs were absent in the re-challenged cats. Naïve sentinels co-housed with the re-challenged cats did not shed virus or seroconvert.

Specifically, immunosuppression and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are two important risk factors. This case report describes the rehabilitation course of a 62-yr-old woman with a history of a double lung transplant for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 2016 who contracted a severe COVID-19 infection. After nearly a month in the intensive care unit, she underwent a 10-day course of inpatient rehabilitation and regained substantial independence and was able to return home only needing supervision. Although other cases in the rehabilitation literature have documented successful rehabilitation after COVID-19 infection, this transplant-related case required intensive coordination of care to meet goals and achieve success for the patient. Because of the limited numbers of studies, this information may prove valuable in future considerations for candidates of inpatient rehabilitation.","Nicolosi, Christian; Barber, Kristina; Draganich, Christina; Niehaus, William",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,531

Studies have shown that the learning process during the quarantine in the spring of 2020 was stressful for all participants in the educational process. This was caused by the lack of previous experience of distance learning and the response from the government and the number of educational problems. It is proved that the problem of insufficient universal access to the internet and the equipment necessary for training has affected both teachers and students. The current situation shows that some teachers working at higher education institutions replaced remote classes with the form of written works, which led to excessive workload of students. Such methods do not contribute to the quality of material assimilation, but on the contrary, create additional stress. It is proved that computerization affects all spheres of human activity and is an important factor in changing the quality of society life. The authors note that in order to ensure the development of higher distance education, it is necessary to improve the regulatory framework in the field of higher distance education, create a computer infrastructure, prepare software for the introduction of electronic educational platforms, as well as train and retrain teachers for conducting distance education courses. It is noted that during the process remote technologies, teachers use various forms of work with students. In particular, including Zoom classes, Skype classes, web classes, where students independently study an educational resource, perform tasks and the teacher checks it and gives a mandatory review of the completed task. The algorithm for assessing the quality of distance learning systems is justified and the use of an integral indicator with weighting coefficients is proposed, which allows us to quantify the value of local quality indicators and complex quality characteristics of distance learning systems. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","Abuselidzeand, G.; Radzivilova, I.; Mohylevska, O.","2021 Ural Environmental Science Forum on Sustainable Development of Industrial Region, UESF 2021",,531

Currently, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is being used widely to detect COVID-19 from various types of biological specimens, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive and may not be rapidly deployable in remote or resource-limited settings. This might lead to hindrance in acquiring realistic data of infectivity and community spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the population. This review summarizes the existing status of current diagnostic methods, their possible limitations, and the advantages of biosensor-based diagnostics over the conventional ones for the detection of SARS-Cov-2. Novel biosensors used to detect RNA-viruses include CRISPR-Cas9 based paper strip, nucleic-acid based, aptamer-based, antigen-Au/Ag nanoparticles-based electrochemical biosensor, optical biosensor, and Surface Plasmon Resonance. These could be effective tools for rapid, authentic, portable, and more promising diagnosis in the current pandemic that has affected the world economies and humanity. Present challenges and future perspectives of developing robust biosensors devices for rapid, scalable, and sensitive detection and management of COVID-19 are presented in light of the test-test-test theme of the World Health Organization (WHO).","Samson, Rachel; Navale, Govinda R.; Dharne, Mahesh S.",3 Biotech,,531

At the end of March 2020, the first and so far largest outbreak of the disease occurred in a retirement home in Hamburg. Methods: Analysis of procedures in dealing with a residential unit affected by SARS-CoV­2, accommodating a risk group of 60 seniors with dementia is presented as well as a detailed presentation of post-mortem examination results of all 8 deceased tested positive for SARS-CoV­2. Results: Out of 60 residents, 39 were infected by SARS-CoV­2. Due to preventive procedures it was possible to stop further spreading of the infection to other residential areas. In all 8 fatal cases, the autopsy diagnosis was death due to COVID-19. Autopsies revealed all COVID-19 patients to have a fatal (broncho)pneumonia and signs of relevant pre-existing cardiac, renal and pulmonary conditions in all cases. In 75% (nâ¯= 6) of the cases a fresh venous thrombosis was found. In 66.7% (nâ¯= 4) of the cases thrombotic events were combined with peripheral pulmonary artery thromboembolisms. Conclusion: The cohort of SARS-CoV­2 infected residents of a nursing home is characteristic for clinical and epidemiological features of the new coronavirus disease. Due to a centralized evaluation of all fatalities at the Institute of Legal Medicine in Hamburg, a detailed examination of all deceased positive for SARS-CoV­2 was possible. Thereby, increased case fatality rates of approximately 20% could in all cases be assigned to a relevant number of pre-existing comorbidities of multiple organ systems, which was consistent with the clinical data available.","Klein, A; Edler, C; Fitzek, A; Fröb, D; Heinemann, A; Meißner, K; Mushumba, H; Püschel, K; Schröder, A S; Sperhake, J P; Ishorst-Witte, F; Aepfelbacher, M; Heinrich, F",Rechtsmedizin (Berl),,531

Methods: Here, we fit structured compartmental models to seroprevalence data from New York State and analyze how herd immunity thresholds (HITs), final sizes, and epidemic risk change across groups. Results: A simple model where interactions occur proportionally to contact rates reduced the HIT, but more realistic models of preferential mixing within groups increased the threshold toward the value observed in homogeneous populations. Across all models, the burden of infection fell disproportionately on minority populations: in a model fit to Long Island serosurvey and census data, 81% of Hispanics or Latinos were infected when the HIT was reached compared to 34% of non-Hispanic whites. Conclusions: Our findings, which are meant to be illustrative and not best estimates, demonstrate how racial and ethnic disparities can impact epidemic trajectories and result in unequal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Here, we investigate whether the COVID-19 pandemic affects acute stroke care through interruptions in the stroke chain of survival. METHODS: A descriptive analysis of acute stroke care activity before and after the COVID-19 outbreak is given for a stroke network in southern Europe. To quantify the impact of the pandemic, the number of stroke code activations, ambulance transfers, consultations through telestroke, stroke unit admissions, and reperfusion therapy times and rates are described in temporal relationship with the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the region. RESULTS: Following confinement of the population, our stroke unit activity decreased sharply, with a 25% reduction in admitted cases (mean number of 58 cases every 15 days in previous months to 44 cases in the 15 days after the outbreak, P<0.001). Consultations to the telestroke network declined from 25 every 15 days before the outbreak to 7 after the outbreak (P<0.001). The increasing trend in the prehospital diagnosis of stroke activated by 911 calls stopped abruptly in the region, regressing to 2019 levels. The mean number of stroke codes dispatched to hospitals decreased (78% versus 57%, P<0.001). Time of arrival from symptoms onset to stroke units was delayed >30 minutes, reperfusion therapy cases fell, and door-to-needle time started 16 minutes later than usual. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is disruptive for acute stroke pathways. Bottlenecks in the access and delivery of patients to our secured stroke centers are among the main challenges. It is critical to encourage patients to continue seeking emergency care if experiencing acute stroke symptoms and to ensure that emergency professionals continue to use stroke code activation and telestroke networks.","Montaner, Joan; Barragán-Prieto, Ana; Pérez-Sánchez, Soledad; Escudero-Martínez, Irene; Moniche, Francisco; Sánchez-Miura, José Antonio; Ruiz-Bayo, Lidia; González, Alejandro",Stroke,,531

In rural areas, where coroners are more common, there is often less access to health care, including COVID-19 testing.9 Coroners may also be less likely to perform postmortem COVID-19 testing as a result of budget limitations. [...]prior research has identified partisan differences in attitudes toward COVID-19 and behaviors such as physical distancing and mask wearing.10 Thus, partisan differences could affect the likelihood that an individual or their family members seek COVID-19 testing while alive and whether coroners pursue postmortem testing.

322693,Review of studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronavirus-2 pathogenesis in human organoid models,2021,"Great attention has been paid to endothelial dysfunction (ED) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is growing evidence to suggest that the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2 receptor) is expressed on endothelial cells (ECs) in the lung, heart, kidney, and intestine, particularly in systemic vessels (small and large arteries, veins, venules, and capillaries). Upon viral infection of ECs by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronarvirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), ECs become activated and dysfunctional. As a result of endothelial activation and ED, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin -1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;), chemokines (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1), von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, vWF activity, and factor VIII are elevated. Higher levels of acute phase reactants (IL-6, C-reactive protein, and D-dimer) are also associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that ED contributes to COVID-19-associated vascular inflammation, particularly endotheliitis, in the lung, heart, and kidney, as well as COVID-19-associated coagulopathy, particularly pulmonary fibrinous microthrombi in the alveolar capillaries. Here we present an update on ED-relevant vasculopathy in COVID-19. Further research for ED in COVID-19 patients is warranted to understand therapeutic opportunities.","Zhang, Jun; Tecson, Kristen M; McCullough, Peter A",Rev Cardiovasc Med,,531

METHODS: To analyze initial and long-term humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 in a hemodialysis population, we retrospectively evaluated findings from SARS-CoV-2 IgG serologic assays targeting the nucleocapsid antigen or spike antigen up to 6 months of follow-up in patients on hemodialysis in the Paris, France, region who had recovered from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). RESULTS: Our analysis included 83 patients (median age 65 years); 59 (71%) were male and 28 (34%) had presented with severe COVID-19. We observed positive initial SARS-CoV-2 IgG antinucleocapsid serology in 74 patients (89%) at a median of 67 days postdiagnosis. By multivariable analysis, immunocompromised status was the only factor significantly associated with lack of an IgG antinucleocapsid antibody response. Follow-up data were available at 6 months postdiagnosis for 60 of 74 patients (81%) with positive initial antinucleocapsid serology, and 15 (25%) of them had negative antinucleocapsid serology at month 6. In total, 14 of 15 sera were tested for antispike antibodies, 3 of 14 (21%) of which were also negative. Overall, 97% of antinucleocapsid-antibody-positive specimens were also antispike-antibody positive. Female sex, age >70 years, and nonsevere clinical presentation were independently associated with faster IgG antinucleocapsid titer decay in multivariable analysis. After adjustment for sex and age >70 years, nonsevere clinical presentation was the only factor associated with faster decay of IgG antispike antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: This study characterizes evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in patients on hemodialysis and identifies factors that are associated with lack of seroconversion and with IgG titer decay.","Sakhi, Hamza; Dahmane, Djamal; Attias, Philippe; Kofman, Thomas; Bouvier, Magali; Lapidus, Nathanael; Fourati, Slim; El Karoui, Khalil",J Am Soc Nephrol,,531
324776,Large-Scale Testing of Asymptomatic Healthcare Personnel for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2,2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Information on stroke survivors infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. The aim of this study was to describe specific clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with COVID-19 with a history of stroke. METHODS: All the confirmed cases of COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were included in our cohort study. Clinical data were analyzed and compared between patients with and without a history of stroke. RESULTS: Of the included 1875 patients with COVID-19, 50 patients had a history of stroke. The COVID-19 patients with medical history of stroke were older with more comorbidities, had higher neutrophil count, and lower lymphocyte and platelet counts than those without history of stroke. The levels of D-dimers, cardiac troponin I, NT pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and interleukin-6 were also markedly higher in patients with history of stroke. Stroke survivors who underwent COVID-19 developed more acute respiratory distress syndrome and received more noninvasive mechanical ventilation. Data from propensity-matched analysis indicated a higher proportion of patients with COVD-19 with a history of stroke were admitted to the intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation and were more likely to be held in the unit or die, compared with non-stroke history COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 with a history of stroke had more severe clinical symptoms and poorer outcomes compared with those without a history of stroke.","Qin, Chuan; Zhou, Luoqi; Hu, Ziwei; Yang, Sheng; Zhang, Shuoqi; Chen, Man; Yu, Haihan; Tian, Dai-Shi; Wang, Wei",Stroke,,531

Following a Transfer Learning approach, we utilize the pre-trained Transformer-based XLNet model to classify tweets as Misleading or Non-Misleading and validate against a random subset of results manually. We build on this to study and contrast the characteristics of tweets in the corpus that are misleading in nature against non-misleading ones. This exploratory analysis enables us to design features (such as sentiments, hashtags, nouns, pronouns, etc) that can, in turn, be exploited for classifying tweets as (Non-)Misleading using various ML models in an explainable manner. Specifically, several ML models are employed for prediction, with up to 90% accuracy, and the importance of each feature is explained using SHAP Explainable AI (XAI) tool. While the thrust of this work is principally exploratory analysis in order to obtain insights on the online discourse on Covid-19 vaccination, we conclude the paper by outlining how these insights provide the foundations for a more actionable approach to mitigate misinformation.

330159,Potential pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"Big Events are periods during which abnormal large-scale events like war, economic collapse, revolts, or pandemics disrupt daily life and expectations about the future. They can lead to rapid change in health-related norms, beliefs, social networks and behavioural practices. The world is undergoing such Big Events through the interaction of COVID-19, a large economic downturn, massive social unrest in many countries, and ever-worsening effects of global climate change. Previous research, mainly on HIV/AIDS, suggests that the health effects of Big Events can be profound, but are contingent: Sometimes Big Events led to enormous outbreaks of HIV and associated diseases and conditions such as injection drug use, sex trading, and tuberculosis, but in other circumstances, Big Events did not do so. This paper discusses and presents hypotheses about pathways through which the current Big Events might lead to better or worse short and long term outcomes for various health conditions and diseases; considers how pre-existing societal conditions and changing 'pathway' variables can influence the impact of Big Events; discusses how to measure these pathways; and suggests ways in which research and surveillance might be conducted to improve human capacity to prevent or mitigate the effects of Big Events on human health.","Friedman, Samuel R; Mateu-Gelabert, Pedro; Nikolopoulos, Georgios K; Cerdá, Magdalena; Rossi, Diana; Jordan, Ashly E; Townsend, Tarlise; Khan, Maria R; Perlman, David C",Glob Public Health,,531
332574,Clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) patients in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan,2020,"Confronted with an emerging infectious disease, the medical community faced relevant concerns regarding the performance of autopsies of COVID-19 deceased at the beginning of the pandemic. This attitude has changed, and autopsies are now recognized as indispensable tools for elucidating COVID-19; despite this, the true risk of infection for autopsy staff is still debated. To elucidate the rate of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs were taken at nine locations of the PPE of one physician and an assistant each from 11 full autopsies performed at four different centers. Further samples were obtained for three minimally invasive autopsies (MIA) conducted at a fifth center. Lung/bronchus swabs of the deceased served as positive controls. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by RT-qPCR. In 9/11 full autopsies PPE samples were tested RNA positive with PCR, in total 21% of all PPE samples taken. The main contaminated parts of the PPE were the gloves (64% positive), the aprons (50% positive), and the upper sides of shoes (36% positive) while for example the fronts of safety goggles were only positive in 4.5% of the samples and all face masks were negative. In MIA, viral RNA was observed in one sample from a glove, but not in other swabs. Infectious virus isolation in cell culture was performed in RNA positive swabs from full autopsies. Of all RNA positive PPE samples, 21% of the glove samples were positive for infectious virus taken in 3/11 full autopsies. In conclusion, in >80% of autopsies, PPE was contaminated with viral RNA. In >25% of autopsies, PPE was found to be even contaminated with infectious virus, signifying a potential risk of infection among autopsy staff. Adequate PPE and hygiene measures, including appropriate waste deposition, are therefore mandatory to enable safe work environment.","Brandner, Johanna M; Boor, Peter; Borcherding, Lukas S; Edler, Carolin; Gerber, Sven; Heinemann, Axel; Hilsenbeck, Julia; Kasajima, Atsuko; Lohner, Larissa; Märkl, Bruno; Pablik, Jessica; Schröder, Ann Sophie; Sommer, Linna; Slotta-Huspenina, Julia; Sperhake, Jan-Peter; Stillfried, Saskia von; Dintner, Sebastian",,,531

Amidst the initial spread of SARS-CoV-2 across Asia, an epidemiologic trend emerged in relation to high altitude (HA) populations. Compared with the rest of Asia, SARS-CoV-2 exhibited attenuated rates of expansion with limited COVID-19 infection severity along the Tibetan plateau. These characteristics were soon evident in additional HA regions across Bolivia, central Ecuador, Nepal, Bhutan, and the Sichuan province of mainland China. This mini-review presents a discussion surrounding attributes of the HA environment, aspects of HA physiology, as well as, genetic variations among HA populations which may provide clues for this pattern of SARS-CoV-2 expansion and COVID-19 infection severity.

Epigenetic changes play a key role in the immune response to bacteria, among which DNA modifications that include methylation have received much attention in recent years. The extent of DNA methylation is well known to regulate gene expression. Whilst historically DNA methylation was considered to be a stable epigenetic modification, accumulating evidence indicates that DNA methylation patterns can be altered rapidly upon exposure of cells to changing environments and pathogens. Furthermore, the action of proteins regulating DNA methylation, particularly DNA methyltransferases and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases, may be modulated, at least in part, by bacteria. This review discusses the principles of DNA methylation, and recent insights about the regulation of host DNA methylation during bacterial infection.","Qin, Wanhai; Scicluna, Brendon P; van der Poll, Tom",Front Immunol,,531

Our protocol includes a virtual smart card (software-based) feature to ease integration of authentication features of emerging national health-IT infrastructures. The security evaluation shows that our protocol resists most online and offline threats while exhibiting performance comparable to traditional, albeit less secure, password-based authentication methods.

While subunit vaccines are one of the prominent options for combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the immunogenicity of spike protein-based antigens remains unknown. When immunized in mice, the S1 domain induced much higher IgG and IgA antibody levels than the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and more efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 when adjuvanted with alum. It is inferred that a large proportion of these neutralization epitopes are located in the S1 domain but outside the RBD and that some of these are spatial epitopes. This finding indicates that expression systems with posttranslational modification abilities are important to maintain the natural configurations of recombinant spike protein antigens and are critical for effective COVID-19 vaccines. Further, adjuvants prone to a Th1 response should be considered for S1-based subunit COVID-19 vaccines to reduce the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of infection.","Wang, Yunfei; Wang, Lichun; Cao, Han; Liu, Cunbao",J. med. virol,,531

On the 11th of March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and nations around the world have taken drastic measures to reduce transmission of the disease. The situation is similar in Switzerland, a small high-income country in Central Europe, where the first COVID-19 case was registered on the 25th of February 2020. Through literature review as well as correspondence with public health professionals and experts in mathematical modeling, this case study focuses on the outbreak's impact on Switzerland and on the measures this country has implemented thus far. Along with the rapid spread of the virus, the political organization, economy, healthcare system, and characteristics of the country greatly influence the approach taken in facing the crisis. Switzerland appears to be structurally well-prepared, but, according to mathematical modeling predictions, in order to avoid total collapse of healthcare facilities, the measures taken by the Swiss Government need to reduce the virus transmission chain by at least 70%. Fortunately, updated models on April 22nd show evidence that the non-pharmaceutical measures invoked have decreased transmission by an estimated 89%, proving effective management by the federal government and allowing for progressive deconfinement measures.","Giachino, Marina; Valera, Camille Beatrice G; Rodriguez Velásquez, Sabina; Dohrendorf-Wyss, Muriel Anna; Rozanova, Liudmila; Flahault, Antoine",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,531

Therefore, the present paper aims to compare the home advantage score in the last ten rounds in 2019-2020 season with the first 24 rounds in same season using Pollard's (1986) and Matos et al.'s (2020) methods. In addition, comparisons across different seasons (2016-2017;2017-2018;2018-2019 and 2019-2020) using the same methods were also analyzed. Results showed no differences (p &gt; 0.05) between first 24 rounds and the last 10 in 2019-2020 season as well as in the 3 previous seasons. With Pollard's method, no differences (p &gt; 0.05) were also found among those four seasons on global (all 34 rounds) home advantage. However, a significance difference between 2017-2018 and 2019-2020 (p &lt; 0.05) was founded using Matos et al.'s (2020) method, which is an indicator of the importance of using complementary methods when analyzing the same realities. Overall, despite what might be expectable from recent findings, the lack of an audience in the last 10 rounds of Portuguese Football League 2019-2020 season, due to COVID-19 pandemic, did not affect home advantage. Therefore, future studies could try to analyze other different variables in Portuguese Football League, such as referees' behaviors, rules changing (e.g., the possibility of making five substitutions, instead of three), crowd dimension and density as well as include variables about odds as forecasts in football being played without crowds.","Matos, R.; Monteiro, D.; Antunes, R.; Mendes, D.; Botas, J.; Clemente, J.; Amaro, N.",International Journal of Environmental Research &amp; Public Health [Electronic Resource],,531

Remote teaching of learning outcomes that have been traditionally taught in the field, necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, presents unique challenges for students, instructors, and institutions. A survey of 117 faculty conducted during spring 2020 revealed substantial reduction of learning outcomes typically taught in the field, and frequent substitutions of less active and more instructor-centered remote activities for field activities. The survey revealed generally negative instructor views on many remote teaching substitutions, yet also showed several approaches that instructors regarded as more effective, despite potential challenges with equitably teaching them. I suggest several models of remote substitutions for traditional field teaching of identification, field techniques, data collection, and study design in the context of the results of this survey.","Barton, Daniel C",,,531

This study investigates the socio-economic impact of the situation of the closed-loop system of solid waste recycling. Several recommendations for tackling this problem are presented in this research. Primary data collection for the waste bank and informal recycling sector was carried out in the eastern part of Surabaya during large-scale social restrictions. In-depth interviews were conducted with waste bank customers, waste bank unit representatives and the informal recycling sector to understand the pandemic's socio-economic impact on the closed-loop system. Results show that this pandemic has significant impacts on individuals and stakeholders engaged in waste recycling activities. Customers of waste banks, who mostly belong to low-income communities, mentioned that the waste bank closure gave rise to social and economic problems, such as increasing unmanaged solid waste and decreasing income. This result also applied to the informal recycling sector. The government can use the recommendations in this study to generate related policies, such as enforcing the health protocol within solid waste management to keep the recycling system in place and the business alive.","Warmadewanthi, Idaa; Wulandari, Dwi; Cahyadi, Mokhamad Nur; Pandebesie, Ellina Sitepu; Anityasari, Maria; Dwipayanti, Ni Made Utami; Purnama, I Gede Herry; Nisaa, Ainul Firdatun",Waste Manag Res,,531

OBJECTIVES: To measure changes in patients' utilization of nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments for chronic low back pain and related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A pre-post study was conducted within the Pain Registry for Epidemiological, Clinical, and Interventional Studies and Innovation (PRECISION Pain Research Registry) using data in the 3 months before and 3-6 months after the declaration of a national emergency related to COVID-19. Participants 21-79 years old with chronic low back pain were included in the study and provided self reported data at relevant quarterly encounters. Use of exercise therapy, yoga, massage therapy, spinal manipulation, acupuncture, cognitive behavioral therapy, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and opioids for low back pain was measured. The primary outcomes were low back pain intensity and back related functioning measured with a numerical rating scale and the Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire, respectively. Secondary outcomes included health related quality of life scales measured with the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System, including scales for physical function, anxiety, depression, low energy/fatigue, sleep disturbance, participation in social roles and activities, and pain interference with activities. RESULTS: A total of 476 participants were included in this study. The mean age of participants at baseline was 54.0 years (standard deviation, ±13.2 years; range, 22-81 years). There were 349 (73.3%) female participants and 127 (26.7%) male participants in the study. Utilization of exercise therapy (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.57), massage therapy (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.25-0.83), and spinal manipulation (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.93) decreased during the pandemic. A reduction in NSAID use was also observed (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-0.99). Participants reported a significant, but not clinically relevant, improvement in low back pain intensity during the pandemic (mean improvement, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.03-0.34; Cohen's d, 0.11). However, White participants reported a significant improvement in low back pain intensity (mean improvement, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.10-0.46), whereas Black participants did not (mean improvement, -0.13; 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.19; p for interaction=0.03). Overall, there was a significant and clinically relevant improvement in pain interference with activities (mean improvement, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.20-2.02; Cohen's d, 0.20). The use of NSAIDs during the pandemic was associated with marginal increases in low back pain intensity. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, decreased utilization of treatments for chronic low back pain did not adversely impact pain and functioning outcomes during the first 6 months of the pandemic. However, Black participants experienced significantly worse pain outcomes than their White counterparts.","Licciardone, John C",,,531

Whereas most of the research efforts have focused on large mygalomorph spiders, araneomorph spiders are equally promising but require more sensitive and sophisticated approaches given their limited size and reduced venom yield. Belonging to the latter group, the genus Lycosa (""wolf spiders"") contains many species widely distributed throughout the world. These spiders are ambush predators that do not build webs but instead rely strongly on their venom for prey capture. Lycosa tarantula is one of the largest species of wolf spider, but its venom composition is unknown. Using a combination of RNA sequencing of the venom glands and venom proteomics, we provide the first overview of the peptides and proteins produced by this iconic Mediterranean spider. Beside the typical small disulfide rich neurotoxins, several families of proteins were also identified, including cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISP) and Hyaluronidases. Proteomic analysis of the electrically stimulated venom validated 30 of these transcriptomic sequences, including nine putative neurotoxins and eight venom proteins. Interestingly, LC-MS venom profiles of manual versus electric stimulation, as well as female versus male, showed some marked differences in mass distribution. Finally, we also present some preliminary data on the biological activity of L. tarantula crude venom.","Koua, Dominique; Mary, Rosanna; Ebou, Anicet; Barrachina, Celia; El Koulali, Khadija; Cazals, Guillaume; Charnet, Pierre; Dutertre, Sebastien",Toxins (Basel),,531

However, little is known about outcomes in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH), an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective review was performed between 2002 and 2019 for all adult patients undergoing isolated mitral valve (MV) surgery. Patients with PH (mean pulmonary artery pressure &#8805; 25 mmHg) were stratified by FS or MIMVS and nearest-neighbor propensity score matching was performed to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 591 surgeries (317 MIMVS, 274 FS) met inclusion criteria during the study period. Nearest neighbor propensity matching generated 112 well-matched pairs. Cardiopulmonary bypass (137 vs 89.5 min, P < 0.001), cross clamp (102 vs 63 min, P < 0.001), and total operative times (241 vs. 178.5 min, p < 0.001) were longer for the MIMVS group. Postoperatively, MIMVS was associated with shorter initial ventilator times (6 vs 9.6 hrs, P < 0.001) and hospital lengths of stay (7 vs. 8 days, p = 0.049), as well as blood product utilization rates (26.8% vs. 41.1%, p = 0.03). Thirty-day (0.0% vs 2.7%, P = 0.12) and 10-year survival (Log-rank, P = 0.661) were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: MIMVS is safe in patients with PH and provides traditional benefits of minimally invasive surgery including shorter initial ventilator times and hospital LOS, without compromising on long-term survival.","Helmers, Mark R; Kim, Samuel T; Altshuler, Peter; Han, Jason J; Iyengar, Amit; Kelly, John; Smood, Benjamin; Hargrove, W Clark; Atluri, Pavan",Ann. thorac. surg,,531

There is a concerted effort within the global scientifi c community to identify (and thereby potentially mitigate) the possible modes of transmission through which the virus spreads throughout populations. OBJECTIVE Summarize the ways in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted and provide scientifi c support for the prevention and control of COVID-19. EVIDENCE AQUISITION We conducted an extensive literature search using electronic databases for scientifi c articles addressing SARSCoV-2 transmission published from December 28, 2019 through July 31, 2020. We retrieved 805 articles, but only 302 were included and discussed in this review. The report captured relevant studies investigating three main areas: 1) viral survival, 2) transmission period and transmissibility, and 3) routes of viral spread. DEVELOPMENT Currently available evidence indicates that SARSCoV-2 seems to have variable stability in different environments and is very sensitive to oxidants, such as chlorine. Temperature and humidity are important factors infl uencing viral survival and transmission. SARSCoV-2 may be transmitted from person to person through several different routes. The basic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets, or via indirect contact. Aerosolized transmission is likely the dominant route for the spread of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in healthcare facilities. Although SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in non-respiratory specimens, including stool, blood and breast milk, their role in transmission remains uncertain. A complicating factor in disease control is viral transmission by asymptomatic individuals and through what would otherwise be understood as innocuous human activities. CONCLUSIONS This article provides a review of the published research regarding human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and insights into developing effective control strategies to stop viral propagation.

The FCV-19S also showed good concurrent validity, as it was significantly and positively related to the Preventive Behaviors related to COVID-19 Scale and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale as well as significantly and negatively related to the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. The scale also showed good internal consistency reliability. Further, the association of age with FCV-19S indicated that younger students experienced greater fear of COVID-19. The analyses of mean differences revealed that women as compared to men, bachelor's and master's students as compared to post-master's students, and unemployed students as compared to employed students experienced greater fear of the outbreak. Also, those suffering from severe anxiety experienced greater fear of COVID-19 followed by those suffering from moderate, mild, and minimal anxiety. Moreover, knowing someone suffering from the coronavirus, being afraid that someone close might contract the virus, and believing that the current COVID-19 situation adversely affects academic performance were linked to higher levels of fear of the pandemic. Practice implications, limitations, and avenues for future research are also discussed.","Green, Zane Asher; Noor, Uzma; Ahmed, Farooq; Himayat, Lubna",Psychol Rep,,531
383112,"Susceptibility to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Among Children and Adults: A Seroprevalence Study of Family Households in the Barcelona Metropolitan Region, Spain",2021,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-COV2 and has resulted in more than four million cases globally and the death cases exceeded 300,000. Normally, a range of surviving and propagating host factors must be employed for the completion of the infectious process including RPs. Viral protein biosynthesis involves the interaction of numerous RPs with viral mRNA, proteins which are necessary for viruses replication regulation and infection inside the host cells. Most of these interactions are crucial for virus activation and accumulation. However, only small percentage of these proteins is specifically responsible for host cells protection by triggering the immune pathway against virus. This research proposes RPs extracted from bacillus sp. and yeast as new forum for the advancement of antiviral therapy. Hitherto, antiviral therapy with RPs-involving viral infection has not been widely investigated as critical targets. Also, exploring antiviral strategy based on RPs could be a promising guide for more potential therapeutics.","Rofeal, Marian; El-Malek, Fady Abd",Med Hypotheses,,531

Here we present results which draw attention to the fact that the reappearance of irrelevant and unattended background contexts of encoding significantly impairs memory discrimination functions. This manuscript presents the results of two experiments in which participants made indoor/outdoor judgements for a large number of object images presented together with individual, irrelevant and presumably unattended background scenes. On a subsequent unexpected recognition test participants saw the incidentally encoded target objects, visually similar lures or new foil objects on the same or new background scenes. Our results showed that although the reappearance of the background scene raised the hit rate for target objects, it decreased mnemonic discrimination, a behavioral score for pattern separation, a hippocampal function that is affected in early dementia. Furthermore, the presence of the encoded background scene at the recognition test increased the false recognition of lure objects, even when participants were explicitly instructed to neglect the context scene. Altogether these results gave evidence that if context increases recognition hits for target memories, it does so at the cost of increasing false recognition and diminished discriminability for similar information.","Racsmány, Mihály; Bencze, Dorottya; Pajkossy, Péter; Szollosi, Ágnes; Marián, Miklós",Sci Rep,,531

This article aims to describe the prevention of COVID-19 nosocomial transmission during radiographic procedures by the utilization of stringent infection prevention measures at a leading tertiary hospital in Singapore. METHODS: The implemented measures are the appropriate use of personal protective equipment, staff education, infection controls measures such as equipment disinfection, physical distancing and segregation of staff and patients. RESULTS: Despite the handling of 1637 COVID-19 cases as of July 25, 2020, there has not been a single case of known nosocomial transmission of the disease in the institution. DISCUSSION: The absence of nosocomial transmission suggests that the implemented measures are adequate. These measures will need to be sustainable for the long term in order to ensure continued success. CONCLUSION: Radiographers are a crucial part of the team in the fight against COVID-19 and are at risk of contracting COVID-19. Strict adherence to appropriate infection control measures is essential for the safety of Radiology staff and their patients, and the successful control of this pandemic.","Heng, Ai Ling; Ooi, Chin Chin; Wen Eu, Benjamin Jun; San Kiew, Yen; Wong, Agnes Sau Kheng; Da Zhuang, Kun",Journal of medical imaging and radiation sciences (Online),,531

401486,Optimized chloroquine phosphate dosage regimens for early virological clearance of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 using Monte Carlo simulation,2021,"In the field of in vitro diagnostics, detection of nucleic acids and proteins from biological samples is typically performed with independent platforms; however, co-detection remains a major technical challenge. Specifically, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the ability to simultaneously detect viral RNA and human antibodies would prove highly useful for efficient diagnosis and disease course management. Herein, we present a multiplex one-pot pre-coated interface proximity extension (OPIPE) assay that facilitates the simultaneous recognition of antibodies using a pre-coated antigen interface and a pair of anti-antibodies labeled with oligonucleotides. Following anti-antibody-bound nucleic acid chain extension to form templates in proximity, antibody signals can be amplified, together with that of targeted RNA, via a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using four-color fluorescent TaqMan probes, we demonstrate the co-detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies and viral nucleic acids in a single bio-complex sample, including nucleocapsid protein-specific IgG and IgM, and the RNA fragments of RdRp and E genes. The serum detection limit for this platform is 100 fg/mL (0.67 fM) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody and 10 copies/µL for viral RNA. The OPIPE assay offers a practical and affordable solution for ultrasensitive co-detection of nucleic acids and antibodies from the same trace biological sample without the additional requirement of complicated equipment.","Yan, Sijia; Ahmad, Khan Zara; Warden, Antony R; Ke, Yuqing; Maboyi, Nokuzola; Zhi, Xiao; Ding, Xianting",Biosens Bioelectron,,531
408341,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Clinical Syndromes and Predictors of Disease Severity in Hospitalized Children and Youth,2020,"BACKGROUND: Undergraduate medical education was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As traditional clinical rotations were suspended, medical students quickly began alternative, novel educational experiences. Third-year medical students at an academic medical center were given the opportunity to join inpatient eConsult teams within the department of medicine. This study describes the development and implementation of this program as well as the experiences of student and faculty participants. METHODS: Student eConsult participation was rapidly developed and implemented within medical subspecialty teams in either infectious diseases (ID) or nephrology. Twelve third-year medical students and 15 subspecialty attendings participated in this program during an eight-week period from April 6 through May 29, 2020. Breadth of student clinical experience was assessed via review of clinical documentation and surveys. Participating students and attending physicians completed surveys to reflect upon their impressions of the program. Surveys were returned by nine students and eight faculty members. Survey responses were summarized with descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Over an eight-week period, student consultants wrote 126 notes on 100 patients; 74 of these patients (74%) were hospitalized with COVID-19. Student experiences were largely positive with most strongly agreeing that attendings promoted interactive and engaged learning (N = 8 of 8, 100%), that the experience helped to expand their knowledge about consultant roles (N = 6, 75%), and that they would participate in a remote eConsult program again if given the opportunity (N = 6, 75%). Faculty also were largely positive about the experience with most agreeing or strongly agreeing with the importance of teaching medical students about telehealth (N = 7 of 8, 88%) and eConsults (N = 6, 75%). In narrative responses, students and faculty agreed that teaching was a strength of the program whereas lack of in-person contact was a challenge. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid development of an inpatient eConsult-based educational experience for third-year medical students was feasible and successful. Student-consultants saw a range of pathology including COVID-19 and related complications. Students were satisfied with the program. They were able to develop a strong relationship with attendings while learning about the role of a consultant. Faculty agreed with the importance of teaching students about telehealth and eConsults specifically.","Kopp, Adam R; Rikin, Sharon; Cassese, Todd; Berger, Matthew A; Raff, Amanda C; Gendlina, Inessa",BMC Med Educ,,531

410778,Clinical Validation of a Sensitive Test for Saliva Collected in Healthcare and Community Settings with Pooling Utility for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Mass Surveillance,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a significant toll on the health of structurally vulnerable patient populations as well as healthcare workers. The concepts of structural stigma and moral distress are important and interrelated, yet rarely explored or researched in medical education. Structural stigma refers to how discrimination towards certain groups is enacted through policy and practice. Moral distress describes the tension and conflict that health workers experience when they are unable to fulfil their duties due to circumstances outside of their control. In this study, the authors explored how resident physicians perceive moral distress in relation to structural stigma. An improved understanding of such experiences may provide insights into how to prepare future physicians to improve health equity. METHODS: Utilizing constructivist grounded theory methodology, 22 participants from across Canada including 17 resident physicians from diverse specialties and 5 faculty members were recruited for semi-structured interviews from April-June 2020. Data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis. RESULTS: Results describe a distinctive form of moral distress called structural distress, which centers upon the experience of powerlessness leading resident physicians to go above and beyond the call of duty, potentially worsening their psychological well-being. Faculty play a buffering role in mitigating the impact of structural distress by role modeling vulnerability and involving residents in policy decisions. CONCLUSION: These findings provide unique insights into teaching and learning about the care of structurally vulnerable populations and faculty's role related to resident advocacy and decision-making. The concept of structural distress may provide the foundation for future research into the intersection between resident well-being and training related to health equity.","Sukhera, Javeed; Kulkarni, Chetana; Taylor, Taryn",Perspectives on medical education,,531

418174,The Natural History of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A Composite But Incomplete Picture,2020,"BACKGROUND: The understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving. Although it is primarily a respiratory illness, other manifestations, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, immune thrombocytopenia, and immune-mediated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, have been described. We present a case of a patient with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis secondary to COVID-19 treated with tocilizumab with a marked biochemical improvement. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case report we present a Caucasian patient with COVID-19 who developed a marked elevation of inflammatory parameters with ferritin 36,023 µg/L, but also elevated C-reactive protein 334 mg/L and lactate dehydrogenase 1074 U/L, 1 week after admission to the intensive care unit. He met five of eight criteria for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, but he lacked the high fever and cytopenia seen in the majority of cases. He was treated with tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-6 receptor, and over the next days, a rapid decrease in ferritin and C-reactive protein levels was observed. However, his respiratory failure only improved gradually, and he was weaned off the respirator 11 days later. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 may induce a hyperinflammatory clinical picture and in some cases develop into hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. In our patient's case, therapeutic interleukin-6 blockade abrogated signs of hyperinflammation but did not seem to improve pulmonary function. Measurement of ferritin and C-reactive protein, as well as quantification of interleukin-6 on indication, should be performed in patients with severe COVID-19. Specific treatment in such patients must also be contemplated, preferably in randomized controlled trials.","Tholin, Birgitte; Hauge, Marit Teigen; Aukrust, Pål; Fehrle, Lutz; Tvedt, Tor Henrik",J Med Case Rep,,531

Recent data showed that hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were the most prevalent comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, data indicate that hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are important risk factors for progression and unfavorable outcome in COVID-19 patients. There is only limited amount of data regarding follow-up of these patients, and they provided conflicting results. The main limitation is a small number of participants and particularly those who experienced primary composite outcome (admission in intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death). Additionally, the limited number of patients was essential obstacle for performing analysis that would include many confounding factors such as advanced age, smoking status, and obesity and potentially change conclusion. So far, there is no study that demonstrated independent predictive value of diabetes on mortality in COVID-19 patients, but there are many speculations about the association between diabetes and susceptibility to novel coronavirus, as well as its impact on progression and prognosis of COVID-19. The aim of this review article was to summarize the current knowledge about the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 and its role in outcome in these patients.","Tadic, Marijana; Cuspidi, Cesare; Sala, Carla",J Clin Hypertens (Greenwich),,531

However, the mechanistic insights of interaction between plasmon energy and organic molecules is still under debate. Herein, we proposed a comprehensive study of the plasmon-assisted reaction mechanism using unsymmetric iodonium salts (ISs) as an organic probe. The experimental and theoretical analysis allow us to exclude the possible thermal effect or hot electron transfer. We found that plasmon interaction with unsymmetrical ISs led to the intramolecular excitation of electron followed by the regioselective cleavage of C-I bond with the formation of electron-rich radical species, which cannot be explained by the hot electron excitation or thermal effects. The high regioselectivity is explained by the direct excitation of electron to LUMO with the formation of a dissociative excited state according to quantum-chemical modeling, which provides novel opportunities for the fine control of reactivity using plasmon energy.","Miliutina, Elena; Guselnikova, Olga; Soldatova, Natalia S; Bainova, Polina; Elashnikov, Roman; Fitl, Premysl; Kurten, Theo; Yusubov, Mekhman S; Svorcík, Václav; Valiev, Rashid R; Chehimi, Mohamed M; Lyutakov, Oleksiy; Postnikov, Pavel S",J Phys Chem Lett,,531

429898,Prevalence of Asymptomatic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection Among Youth,2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019. AIMS: to review, analyse and discuss all works about the wearing and development of facemasks as potential protection against SARS-COV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: PubMed, SciELO, Google Scholar and DOAJ were browsed. KEYWORDS: ""mask and (SARS or Cov)"" (1 August 2019 to 12 April 2020). INCLUSION CRITERIA: original research. PRISMA criteria were followed. RESULTS: Twenty-one works were selected. Identified topics: effectiveness of protective equipment/devices (PE) (n = 3), universal wearing of facemasks plus other protective measures in the community (n = 3), impact of infection control measures on hospitals and epidemiological tracing (n = 3), development of new PE (n = 2), sanitisation of facemasks (n = 4), clinical guidance (n = 4) and questionnaires (n = 2). DISCUSSION: It seems that the effectiveness of PE, namely facemasks, is not fully known. Universal wearing of facemasks may be simultaneously recommended with other protective measures. Nosocomial and community infections seem to be preventable. New PE, methods of facemask sanitisation and clinical guidance are emerging, but caution is recommended regarding their adoption, revision and monitoring by international boards and institutions. Questionnaires are useful tools for collecting citizens' opinions on implementing public health measures, and thus contribute to mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Universal wearing of facemasks in the community is likely to be recommended during the COVID-19pandemic. Since SARS-COV-2 is highly contagious, a set of measures should be considered. Facemask sanitisation is possible, but standardised procedures are lacking. New PE is emerging and requires detailed regulatory approval. It is advisable to monitor public opinion.","Pires, Carla",Int J Clin Pract,,531

A cross-sectional investigation was conducted with 6,325 participants of both genders (68% women), over 18 years of age and from five countries: Brazil (N = 2,171), Argentina (N = 1,111), Peru (N = 1,174), Mexico (N = 686), and Spain (N = 1,183). Data were collected during the year 2020, between April 01 and June 30 in Spain and between July 13 and September 26, in the other countries studied using a self-administered online survey designed for the assessment of sociodemographic, employment, physical activity, health status, and dietary habits changes. Most participants (61.6%), mainly those from Spain, remained constant, without improving or worsening their pattern of food consumption. Among those who changed, a pattern of better eating choices prevailed (22.7%) in comparison with those who changed toward less healthy choices (15.7%). Argentina and Brazil showed the highest proportion of changes toward a healthier pattern of food consumption. Peruvians and Mexicans were less likely to make healthy changes in food consumption (OR: 0.51;95% CI: 0.4-0.6 and OR: 0.69;95% CI: 0.4-0.8, respectively), when compared to Argentinians. Most respondents did not change their pattern of meal consumption, but those who did reduced their consumption of main meals and increased intake of small meals and snacks. Although most participants affirmed to be doing physical activity at home, about one-half reported perception of weight gain. Individuals with alterations in sleep pattern (either by increasing or decreasing sleep time) were more likely to change their diets to a healthier pattern. In contrast, individuals with confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and those who reported feeling anxious were more likely to perform changes to a less healthy eating pattern (OR: 1.72;95% CI: 1.2-2.3 and OR: 1.21;95% CI: 1.1-1.4, respectively). In conclusion, although most participants remained constant in their eating habits, lifestyle changes and anxiety feelings were reported. Among those who changed patterns of food consumption, healthier choices prevailed, with differences between countries. However, there were alterations in the distribution of meals, with higher consumption of snacks and small meals. These results can be used to guide policies to prevent deleterious consequences that may affect the incidence of chronic diseases.","Enriquez-Martinez, O. G.; Martins, M. C. T.; Pereira, T. S.

430646,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Antibodies in Adults in Madrid, Spain",2021,"Highly detailed physically-based groundwater models are often applied to make predictions of system states under unknown forcing. The required analysis of uncertainty is often unfeasible due to the high computational demand. We combine two possible solution strategies: a) the use of faster surrogate models, and b) a robust data worth analysis combining quick first-order second-moment uncertainty quantification with null-space Monte Carlo techniques to account for parametric uncertainty. A structurally and parametrically simplified model and a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) surrogate are investigated. Data worth estimations by both surrogates are compared against estimates by a complex MODFLOW benchmark model of an aquifer in New Zealand. Data worth is defined as the change in post-calibration predictive uncertainty of groundwater head, river-groundwater exchange flux and drain flux data, compared to the calibrated model. It incorporates existing observations, potential new measurements of system states (""additional"" data) as well as knowledge of model parameters (""parametric"" data). The data worth analysis is extended to account for non-uniqueness of model parameters by null-space Monte Carlo sampling. Data worth estimates of the surrogates and the benchmark suggest good agreement for both surrogates in estimating worth of existing data. The structural simplification surrogate only partially reproduces the worth of ""additional"" data and is unable to estimate ""parametric"" data, while the POD model is in agreement with the complex benchmark for both ""additional"" and ""parametric"" data. The variance of the POD data worth estimates suggests the need to account for parameter non-uniqueness, like presented here, for robust results.","Gosses, Moritz; Wöhling, Thomas",,,531

We aimed to assess whether COVID19 related social isolation affects lifestyle and weight control in women with PCOS. We performed an online survey including 232 women with PCOS and 157 healthy controls on isolation characteristics, weight alterations, physical activity, sleeping and eating patterns by validated questionnaires. Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-18), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) were used. PCOS-related quality of life questionnaire (PCOSQ) was also completed by patients. During over 14 weeks of isolation, 48.5% participants gained weight, 13.9% participants’ weight was stable, and 37.6% participants lost weight. The patient and control groups did not show any difference in weight alteration (p=0.44). Physical activity was reduced (p&amp;lt;0.001 for both), eating patterns did not show a significant change in both groups, whereas sleep quality was reduced in PCOS group only (p&amp;lt;0.001). Within the weight gainers, increase in BMI was more prominent in PCOS group (1.3±1 kg/m2) than controls (1.0±0.6 kg/m2) (p=0.01). In weight gainer group, delta BMI values showed positive correlations with delta PSQI scores (r = 0.24, p=0.004), delta sleep induction time (r=0.25, p=0.001) and delta TFEQ-18 scores (r=0.25, p=0.001). Weight changes during social isolation are similar in women with PCOS and healthy women. However, the increase in BMI of weight gainers is higher in PCOS and is mainly related to sleep quality and eating habits rather than reduced physical activity.","Eyupoglu, Nesrin Damla Aksun Seren Ozturk Mervenur Yildiz Bulent Okan",Journal of the Endocrine Society,,531

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 282 couples with one spouse diagnosed with cancer were selected from the Three-City cohort study. Dyadic analyses were used to determine whether trait anxiety affects the risk of depression and whether a mutual influence process occurs prior and post cancer diagnosis. Cross-sectional analyses were performed at two time-points: before and after receiving the diagnosis. RESULTS: A higher level of anxiety among cancer patients resulted in a decreased risk of depression among spousal caregivers. Moreover, a higher anxiety among spousal caregivers increased their own risk of depression, but it didn't influence depression risk among cancer patients. While there is an intra-individual relationship between a higher level of trait anxiety and a greater risk of depression prior to cancer diagnosis, there is no cross-influence between spouses. DISCUSSION: The study findings indicate that a dyadic psychological adjustment process might help older adults to cope with cancer by limiting the risk of depression among spousal caregivers.","Caillot-Ranjeva, Sybille; Gourlain, Samuel; Amieva, Hélène; Helmer, Catherine; Bergua, Valérie",Journal of geriatric oncology,,531

PATIENTS: A 80-year-old man was referred to our department because of a visual defect in his right eye. His best corrected decimal visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.7 (Snellen equivalent [SE], 20/30). METHODS: A fundus examination revealed clustered temporal juxafoveal microaneurysms and foveal CME. The patient refused to undergo conventional treatments, including direct retinal photocoagulation for microaneurysms, intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injection, and intravitreal triamcinolone injection. However, he provided consent to undergo cystotomy and en bloc removal of the fibrinogen-rich component of the cystoid lesion. RESULTS: His BCVA was 0.2 (SE, 20/100) just before the surgery. A 27-gauge vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling was performed. Cystotomy was performed during the surgery, and the fibrinogen clot visible in the cystoid cavity was also removed. CME rapidly disappeared after the surgery. Three years postoperatively, the patient had BCVA of 0.5 (SE, 20/40) at the last medical examination, and the CME had not recurred. CONCLUSION: Cystotomy and en bloc removal of the fibrinogen-rich component of the cystoid lesion could be valid treatment options for CME secondary to MacTel type 1.","Maki, Hitomi; Imai, Hisanori; Yamada, Hiroko; Tetsumoto, Akira; Hayashida, Mayuka; Otsuka, Keiko; Miki, Akiko; Nakamura, Makoto",Retin. cases brief rep.

We investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified patients with a history of cancer admitted to two large hospitals between March 13, 2020, and May 10, 2020, with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and matched them 1:2 to patients without a history of cancer. RESULTS: Men made up 56.2% of the population, with a median age of 69 years (range, 30-96). The median time since cancer diagnosis was 35.6 months (range, 0.39-435); 80% had a solid tumor, and 20% had a hematologic malignancy. Among patients with cancer, 27.8% died or entered hospice versus 25.6% among patients without cancer. In multivariable analyses, the odds of death/hospice were similar (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-1.82). The odds of intubation (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.28-0.78), shock (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91), and intensive care unit admission (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.32-0.81) were lower for patients with a history of cancer versus controls. Patients with active cancer or who had received cancer-directed therapy in the past 6 months had similar odds of death/hospice compared with cancer survivors (univariable OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.66-2.60; multivariable OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 0.69-3.16). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a history of cancer hospitalized for COVID-19 had similar mortality to matched hospitalized patients with COVID-19 without cancer, and a lower risk of complications. In this population, patients with active cancer or recent cancer treatment had a similar risk for adverse outcomes compared with survivors of cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study investigated whether a current cancer diagnosis or cancer history is an independent risk factor for death or hospice admission in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Active cancer, systemic cancer therapy, and a cancer history are not independent risk factors for death from COVID-19 among hospitalized patients, and hospitalized patients without cancer are more likely to have severe COVID-19. These findings provide reassurance to survivors of cancer and patients with cancer as to their relative risk of severe COVID-19, may encourage oncologists to provide standard anticancer therapy in patients at risk of COVID-19, and guide triage in future waves of infection.","Klein, Isaac A; Rosenberg, Shoshana M; Reynolds, Kerry L; Zubiri, Leyre; Rosovsky, Rachel; Piper-Vallillo, Andrew J; Gao, Xin; Boland, Genevieve; Bardia, Aditya; Gaither, Rachel; Freeman, Hannah; Kirkner, Gregory J; Rhee, Chanu; Klompas, Michael; Baker, Meghan A; Wadleigh, Martha; Winer, Eric P; Kotton, Camille N; Partridge, Ann H",Oncologist,,531

Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. From a completely agnostic point of view, our findings uncover predictive effects (association) of observed policies and behavioral changes on future health outcomes, controlling for informational and other confounding variables.","Chernozhukov, Victor; Kasahara, Hiroyuki; Schrimpf, Paul",Journal of econometrics,,531

In both cases, BCG scar inflammation appeared after 24 hours of vaccination of the second dose, without signs of reaction on the injection site, and resolved within four days. Dermoscopic findings in one case showed arborizing and comma-shaped vessels. Pharmacovigilance surveillance of BCG scar reactions following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines should be considered particularly in countries where BCG is part of their national immunization programs.","Lopatynsky-Reyes, E.

443426,"Healthcare-Associated Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Transmission in a Neonatal Unit: The Importance of Universal Masking, Hand Hygiene, and Symptom Screening in Containment",2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged from China and globally affected the entire population through the human-to-human transmission of a newly emerged virus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes several proteins that are essential for multiplication and pathogenesis. The main protease (Mpro or 3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a central role in its pathogenesis and thus is considered as an attractive drug target for the drug design and development of small-molecule inhibitors. We have employed an extensive structure-based high-throughput virtual screening to discover potential natural compounds from the ZINC database which could inhibit the Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. Initially, the hits were selected on the basis of their physicochemical and drug-like properties. Subsequently, the PAINS filter, estimation of binding affinities using molecular docking, and interaction analyses were performed to find safe and potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We have identified ZINC02123811 (1-(3-(2,5,9-trimethyl-7-oxo-3-phenyl-7H-furo[3,2-g]chromen-6-yl)propanoyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide), a natural compound bearing appreciable affinity, efficiency, and specificity towards the binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The identified compound showed a set of drug-like properties and preferentially binds to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to evaluate the conformational dynamics, stability and interaction mechanism of Mpro with ZINC02123811. MD simulation results indicated that Mpro with ZINC02123811 forms a stable complex throughout the trajectory of 100 ns. These findings suggest that ZINC02123811 may be further exploited as a promising scaffold for the development of potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro to address COVID-19.","Shamim Jairajpuri, Deeba; Hussain, Afzal; Nasreen, Khalida; Mohammad, Taj; Anjum, Farah; Rehman, Tabish; Mustafa Hasan, Gulam; Alajmi, Mohamed F; Hassan, Imtaiyaz",,,531
443476,Clotting disorder in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the global financial markets, including energy commodities. The aim of the paper is to examine the reaction of the energy commodity market to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the epidemic status, the stringency of the government antiCOVID-19 policy, and the stock market volatility. We use daily data on the S&P GSCI Energy index, the number of new confirmed COVID-19 global cases, the self-developed Global Stringency Index, and the VIX index. The research covers the period from January 2 to September 30, 2020, i.e. the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a structural vector autoregressive model we observe a significant and negative energy commodity market’s reaction to the changes in the stock market volatility. Moreover, the results imply that the increase in the Global Stringency Index leads to the decline in the S&P GSCI Energy index but the reaction is significant only on the third day after the shock. We reveal no significant impact of global epidemic status on energy commodity prices. © 2021, Econjournals.

445786,Perspectives on Pediatric Appendicitis and Appendectomy During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs for treatment. Despite multiple clinical trials using different agents, there is still a lack of specific treatment for COVID-19. Having the potential role in suppressing inflammation, immune modulation, antiviral and improving respiratory symptoms, this review discusses the potential role of methylxanthine drugs like pentoxifylline and caffeine in the management of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 pathogenesis for clinical features like severe pneumonia, acute lung injury (ALI) / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failures are excessive inflammation, oxidation, and cytokine storm by the exaggerated immune response. Drugs like pentoxifylline have already shown improvement of the symptoms of ARDS and caffeine has been in clinical use for decades to treat apnea of prematurity (AOP) in preterm infants and improve respiratory function. Pentoxifylline is well-known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative molecules that have already shown to suppress Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF-&#945;) as well as other inflammatory cytokines in pulmonary diseases, and this may be beneficial for better clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Pentoxifylline enhances blood flow, improves microcirculation and tissue oxygenation, and caffeine also efficiently improves tissue oxygenation, asthma, decreases pulmonary hypertension and an effective analgesic. There are significant shreds of evidence that proved the properties of pentoxifylline and caffeine against virus-related diseases as well. Along with the aforementioned evidences and high safety profiles, both pentoxifylline and caffeine offer a glimpse of considerations for future use as a potential adjuvant to COVID-19 treatment. However, additional clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation.","Monji, Faezeh; Al-Mahmood Siddiquee, Abrar; Hashemian, Farshad",Eur J Pharmacol,,531
445787,Perspectives on Pediatric Appendicitis and Appendectomy During the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (Covid-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to the labor market. The pandemic has a devastating and disproportionate effect on young workers, their interest in entrepreneurship, and their mental health. Research is needed to develop evidence-based strategies to improve coping and reduce adverse psychological problems. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact that Covid-19 pandemic perception and psychological need satisfaction have on university students and their self-employment intention. In addition, we also analyzed the role of moderation played by psychological aspects. These psychological factors (i.e., Optimism and Proactiveness) can also improve young people's mental health and well-being. METHODS: An explorative study (online survey) was conducted in March 2020 934 university students from Latin America. Regression analysis models were built to examine the relationships between Covid-19 pandemic perception, personality variables, and entrepreneurial intention. Mediation models, through the bootstrapping method, were performed to analyze the mediating role of proactiveness and optimism. RESULTS: Results indicate that students' perception of Covid-19 and psychological need satisfaction are associated with entrepreneurial intention. Additionally, the present study argues that proactiveness and optimism mediate these relationships. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies psychological factors associated with a lower level of Covid-19 impact and that can be used for psychological interventions that result in an improvement in the mental health of these vulnerable groups during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Hernández-Sánchez, Brizeida Raquel; Cardella, Giuseppina Maria; Sánchez-García, José Carlos",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,531

Modifications of glycosylation are found in numerous diseases, notably in cancers. All types of glycosylation can be affected and this leads to dysfunctions of cellular metabolism. In this review, we present the current knowledge on the regulation of glycosylation mechanisms and illustrate how the alteration of these regulatory mechanisms can lead to abnormal protein and lipid glycosylation, and take part in the development of cancers.","Groux-Degroote, Sophie; Foulquier, François; Cavdarli, Sumeyye; Delannoy, Philippe",Med Sci (Paris),,531

We enrolled all adult SOT recipients at our center with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection who underwent antibody testing with a single commercially available anti-nucleocapsid antibody test at least 7 days after diagnosis in a retrospective cohort. 70 SOT recipients were studied (56% kidney, 19% lung, 14% liver +/- kidney, and 11% heart +/- kidney recipients). 36 (51%) had positive anti-nucleocapsid antibody testing, and 34 (49%) were negative. Recipients of a kidney allograft were less likely to have positive antibody testing compared those who did not receive a kidney (p=0.04). In the final multivariable model, the years from transplant to diagnosis (OR 1.26, p=0.002) and baseline immunosuppression with more than 2 agents (OR 0.26, p=0.03) were significantly associated with the antibody test result, controlling for kidney transplantation. In conclusion, among SOT recipients with confirmed infection, only 51 % of patients had detectable anti-nucleocapsid antibodies, and transplant-related variables including the level and nature of immunosuppression are important predictors. These findings raise the concern that SOT recipients with COVID-19 may be less likely to form SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","Burack, Daniel; Pereira, Marcus R; Tsapepas, Demetra S; Harren, Patricia; Farr, Maryjane A; Arcasoy, Selim; Cohen, David J; Mohan, Sumit; Emond, Jean C; Hod, Eldad A; Verna, Elizabeth C",Am. j. transplant,,531

This work evaluates trainee perspectives of the impact of the pandemic on medical genetics education. METHODS: A Qualtrics survey was sent to physician trainees who rotated in genetics before or midpandemic. Questions assessed patient care, didactic education, and competency in multiple domains. Number of clinic visits completed by trainees were collated through review of documentation. RESULTS: Twenty-three rotating residents completed the surveys. Five of the pediatric residents completed the elective during the pandemic. All residents participated in virtual care during the pandemic, and rotating residents reported an improvement in self-assessed competency in multiple domains. Potential weak areas of education midpandemic included dysmorphology and genetic counseling. CONCLUSION: Residents on a genetics elective can gain crucial skills and knowledge even when the rotation is in a primarily virtual format. Supplemental dysmorphology and genetic counseling education may improve remote educational experiences. Further research across institutions may deepen understanding of the impact of the pandemic on education in genetics.","Pritchard, Amanda Barone; Sloan-Heggen, Christina; Keegan, Catherine E; Quinonez, Shane C",Genet. med,,531

Apart from just euglycaemia (a state of normal blood glucose levels), every Indian living with DM has some requirements and rights, that can be summarised with the help of three basic principles of the Constitution, ie, justice, equality and liberty. Together, these words remind us to practise accurate and appropriate diabetes care, delivered in a patient-centred manner.

Studies have shown that contaminated surfaces may contain viable virus for up to 72 hours in laboratory settings. The purpose of this study was to investigate contamination of SARS-CoV-2 on commonly used environmental surfaces in a tertiary cancer care center. METHODS: This study evaluated the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in high-touch outpatient and inpatient cancer center spaces. Surfaces were tested over a 2-week period after patient or staff exposure but before scheduled disinfection services according to the World Health Organization protocols for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) surface sampling. Samples were analyzed via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. RESULTS: Two hundred four environmental samples were obtained from inpatient and outpatient oncology clinics and infusion suites, and they were categorized as 1) public areas, 2) staff areas, or 3) medical equipment. One hundred thirty surfaces from 2 outpatient hematology and oncology clinics and 36 surfaces from an inpatient leukemia/lymphoma/chimeric antigen receptor T-cell unit were examined, and all 166 samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. One of 38 samples (2.6%) from COVID-19+ inpatient units was positive. Altogether, the positive test rate for SARS-CoV-2 RNA across all surfaces was 0.5% (1 of 204). CONCLUSIONS: This prospective, systematic quality assurance investigation of real-world environmental surfaces, performed in inpatient and outpatient hematology/oncology units, revealed overall negligible detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA when strict mitigation strategies against COVID-19 transmission were instituted. LAY SUMMARY: The potential risks of nosocomial infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have deterred patients with cancer from seeking timely care despite consensus guidelines.

469512,Typical environmental factors of high-altitude areas: Possible inactivation mechanisms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"2020 was a year like no other, with the COVID-19 virus upending life as we know it. When governments around the world imposed lockdown measures to curb the spread of COVID-19, advocates in the domestic and family violence (DFV) sector recognised that these measures were likely to result in increases in violence against women, particularly intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV can take many forms, including physical, emotional, psychological, financial, coercive controlling behaviours, surveillance and isolation tactics. Lockdown conditions provide fertile ground for the exercise of coercive control by encouraging people to stay at home, limiting social interactions to household members, reducing mobility and enabling perpetrators to closely monitor their partner's movements. However, media reports and awareness of IPV are generally dominated by a focus on physical violence and lethality, which are easily defined and measured. By contrast, coercive control as a concept is difficult to operationalise, measure and action in law, policy and frontline interventions. This paper discusses the challenges inherent in measuring coercive control and engages with current debates around the criminalisation of coercive control in NSW. Such reflection is timely as the conditions of COVID-19 lockdowns are likely to lead to an increase in coercive controlling behaviours.","Smyth, Ciara; Cullen, Patricia; Breckenridge, Jan; Cortis, Natasha; Valentine, Kylie",Aust. j soc. issues,,531

Membrane-bound ACE2 is depleted as a result of this entry mechanism. The consequence is that the protective renin-angiotensin system (RAS), of which ACE2 is an essential component, is compromised through lack of production of the protective peptides angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(1-9), and therefore decreased stimulation of Mas (receptor Mas) and angiotensin AT2-receptors (AT2Rs), while angiotensin AT1-receptors (AT1Rs) are overstimulated due to less degradation of angiotensin II (Ang II) by ACE2. The protective RAS has numerous beneficial actions, including anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulative, anti-fibrotic effects along with endothelial and neural protection; opposite to the deleterious effects caused by heightened stimulation of angiotensin AT1R. Given that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibit an excessive immune response, endothelial dysfunction, increased clotting, thromboses and stroke, enhancing the activity of the protective RAS is likely beneficial. In this article, we discuss the evidence for a dysfunctional protective RAS in COVID and develop a rationale that the protective RAS imbalance in COVID-19 may be corrected by using AT2R agonists. We further review preclinical studies with AT2R agonists which suggest that AT2R stimulation may be therapeutically effective to treat COVID-19-induced disorders of various organ systems such as lung, vasculature, or the brain. Finally, we provide information on the design of a clinical trial in which patients with COVID-19 were treated with the AT2R agonist Compound 21 (C21). This trial has been completed, but results have not yet been reported.","Steckelings, U Muscha; Sumners, Colin",Clin Sci (Lond),,531

The unavailability of specific vaccines and anti-viral drug for nCoV, science demands sincere efforts in the field of drug design and discovery for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro) play a crucial role during the disease propagation, and hence SARS-CoV-2 Mpro represents as a drug target for the drug discovery. Herein, we have applied bioinformatics approach for screening of chemical compounds from Indian spices as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (PDBID: 6Y84). The structure files of Indian spices chemical compounds were taken from PubChem database or Zinc database and screened by molecular docking, by using AutoDock-4.2, MGLTools-1.5.6, Raccoon virtual screening tools. Top 04 hits based on their highest binding affinity were analyzed. Carnosol exhibited highest binding affinity -8.2 Kcal/mol and strong and stable interactions with the amino acid residues present on the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Arjunglucoside-I (-7.88 Kcal/mol) and Rosmanol (-7.99 Kcal/mol) also showed a strong and stable binding affinity with favourable ADME properties. These compounds on MD simulations for 50ns shows strong hydrogen-bonding interactions with the protein active site and remains stable inside the active site. Our virtual screening results suggest that these small chemical molecules can be used as potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and may have an anti-viral effect on nCoV. However, further validation and investigation of these inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 main protease are needed to claim their candidacy for clinical trials.","Kundu, Debanjan; Selvaraj, Chandrabose; Singh, Sanjeev Kumar; Dubey, Vikash Kumar",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,531

Online learning is being carried out to avoid face to face contact in emergency scenarios such as coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Students need to adapt to new roles of learning through information technology to succeed in academics amid COVID-19. Objective: However, access and use of online learning resources and its link with satisfaction of students amid COVID-19 are critical to explore. Therefore, in this paper, we aimed to assess and compare the access & use of online learning of Bruneians and Pakistanis amid enforced lockdown using a five-items satisfaction scale underlying existing literature. Method: For this, a cross-sectional study was done in the first half of June 2020 after the pandemic situation among 320 students' across Pakistan and Brunei with a pre-defined questionnaire. Data were analyzed with statistical software package for social sciences (SPSS) 2.0. Results: The finding showed that there is a relationship between students' satisfaction and access & use of online learning. Outcomes of the survey suggest that Bruneian are more satisfied (50%) with the use of online learning amid lockdown as compared to Pakistanis (35.9%). Living in the Urban area as compared to a rural area is also a major factor contributing to satisfaction with the access and use of online learning for both Bruneian and Pakistanis. Moreover, previous experience with the use of online learning is observed prevalent among Bruneians (P = .000), while among friends and family is using online learning (P = .000) were encouraging factors contributed to satisfaction with the use of online learning among Pakistanis amid COVID-19. Correlation results suggest that access and use factors of online learning amid COVID-19 were positively associated with satisfaction among both populations amid COVID-19 pandemic. However, Bruneian is more satisfied with internet access (r = 0.437, P < .000) and affordability of gadgets (r = 0.577, P < .000) as compare to Pakistanis (r = 0.176, P < .050) and (r = 0.152, P < .050). Conclusion: The study suggested that it is crucial for the government and other policymakers worldwide to address access and use of online learning resources of their populace amid pandemic.","Qazi, Atika; Naseer, Khulla; Qazi, Javaria; AlSalman, Hussain; Naseem, Usman; Yang, Shuiqing; Hardaker, Glenn; Gumaei, Abdu",Child Youth Serv Rev,,531

A screening of the literature (Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science) was carried out in December 2020 to collect studies: i. comparing one or more methodological approaches for the assessment of tidal volume with the outcome of a state-of-the-art measurement device (i.e., spirometry or optoelectronic plethysmography); ii. dealing with technological solutions designed to be exploited in wearable devices. From the initial 1031 documents, only 36 citations met the eligibility criteria. These studies highlighted that the tidal volume can be estimated by using different technologies ranging from IMUs to strain sensors (e.g., resistive, capacitive, inductive, electromagnetic, and optical) or acoustic sensors. Noticeably, the relative volumetric error of these solutions during quasi-static tasks (e.g., resting and sitting) is typically &#8805;10% but it deteriorates during dynamic motor tasks (e.g., walking).

Based on inter-city networked coupling effects, a fractional-order SEIHDR system with the real-data from 23 January to 18 March, 2020 of COVID-19 is discussed. Meanwhile, hospitalized individuals and the mortality rates of three types of individuals (exposed, infected and hospitalized) are firstly taken into account in the proposed model. And infectivity of individuals during incubation is also considered in this paper. By applying least squares method and predictor-correctors scheme, the numerical solutions of the proposed system in the absence of the inter-city network and with the inter-city network are stimulated by using the real-data from 23 January to $18-m$ March, 2020 where $m$ is equal to the number of prediction days. Compared with integer-order system ($\alpha=0$), the fractional-order model without network is validated to have a better fitting of the data on Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Huanggang and other cities. In contrast to the case without network, the results indicate that the inter-city network system may be not a significant case to virus spreading for China because of the lock down and quarantine measures, however, it may have an impact on cities that have not adopted city closure. Meanwhile, the proposed model better fits the data from 24 February to 31, March in Italy, and the peak number of confirmed people is also predicted by this fraction-order model. Furthermore, the existence and uniqueness of a bounded solution under the initial condition are considered in the proposed system. Afterwards, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is analyzed and it is found to hold a threshold: the disease-free equilibrium point is locally asymptotically stable when $R_0\le 1$, which provides a theoretical basis for whether COVID-19 will become a pandemic in the future.","Lu, Zhenzhen; Yu, Yongguang; Chen, YangQuan; Ren, Guojian; Xu, Conghui; Wang, Shuhui; Yin, Zhe",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12308v3.pdf,531

Several observational studies investigated the relationship between Proton Pump Inhibitors use and the risk of COVID-19 development and mortality. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this meta-analysis is to investigate the association between current PPIs use and the development of COVID-19 as well as its mortality. METHODS: Pubmed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and medRxiv were searched until November 21, 2020 using the following keywords: proton pump inhibitors and COVID-19 as well as their related MESH terms. The studies considered in the meta-analysis were either cohort or case-control in design and adjusted for confounding factors. The quality of the studies included in this meta-analysis was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. In addition, a random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled Odds Ratio (ORs) and the corresponding confidence interval (95% CI). Heterogeneity was evaluated using The Cochran's Q heterogeneity test and I2 statistic. RESULTS: Six observational studies with 195,230 participants were included. In this meta-analysis, current use of PPIs increased risk of COVID-19 development (ORâ¯=â¯1.19; 95% CI: 0.62-2.28) and mortality (ORâ¯=â¯1.67; 95% CI: 1.41-1.97).

The impact of the crisis on the healthcare of patients with cancer is largely unexplored. This multicenter cohort study aimed to investigate a potential screening delay and its consequences in patients with oral cancer (OC) during the pandemic. (2) Material and Methods: Data of patients who were first diagnosed with OC during different periods were collected, especially in terms of OC incidence, tumor stage/entity and time to intervention. The periods lockdown (LD) (13 March–16 June 2020), post-lockdown (PLD) (17 June–1 November 2020), and the corresponding equivalents in 2018/19 were differentiated and compared. (3) Results: There was no obvious trend towards a higher incidence of OC or higher tumor stages, whereas a trend towards a shorter time to intervention during the LD2020 could be observed. Subgroup analyses revealed an increased incidence in OC within the PLD2020 in Mainz, which might be explained by the partial closure of dental practices in this federal state during LD. (4) Conclusions: While there was no overall higher incidence of OC, we found closure of practices during LD to possibly delay cancer diagnosis. Therefore, measures must be taken to identify patients at risk and to ensure basic healthcare, especially in the context of dental screening measures.","Heimes, Diana Müller Lena Katharina Schellin Alexandra Naujokat Hendrik Graetz Christian Schwendicke Falk Goedecke Maximilian Beck-Broichsitter Benedicta Kämmerer Peer W.",Cancers,,531
501793,Characterization of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Stability in Multiple Water Matrices,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recombinant human growth hormone has been used for more than 30 years and its indications have increased worldwide. There is concern that this treatment might increase mortality, but published data are scarce. We present data from the entire dataset of all eight countries of the Safety and Appropriateness of Growth hormone treatments in Europe (SAGhE) consortium, with the aim of studying long-term overall and cause-specific mortality in young adult patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood and relating this to the underlying diagnosis. METHODS: This cohort study was done in eight European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK). Patients were classified a priori based on pre-treatment perceived mortality risk from their underlying disease and followed up for cause-specific mortality. Person-years at risk of mortality and expected rates from general population data were used to calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs). FINDINGS: The cohort comprised 24â232 patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood, with more than 400â000 patient-years of follow-up. In low-risk patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, all-cause mortality was not significantly increased (SMR 1·1, 95% CI 0·9-1·3). In children born small for gestational age, all-cause mortality was significantly increased when analysed for all countries (SMR 1·5, CI 1·1-1·9), but this result was driven by the French subcohort. In patients at moderate or high risk, mortality was increased (SMR 3·8, 3·3-4·4; and 17·1, 15·6-18·7, respectively). Mortality was not associated with mean daily or cumulative doses of recombinant human growth hormone for any of the risk groups. Cause-specific mortality from diseases of the circulatory and haematological systems was increased in all risk groups. INTERPRETATION: In this cohort, the largest, to our knowledge, with long-term follow-up of patients treated with recombinant human growth hormone during childhood, all-cause mortality was associated with underlying diagnosis. In patients with isolated growth hormone deficiency or idiopathic short stature, recombinant human growth hormone treatment was not associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, mortality from certain causes was increased, emphasising the need for further long-term surveillance.

During early February, spread of misinformation and rumors driven by the fear of linking chicken meat and eggs in the transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among human population is witnessed in India. This resulted drastic reduction in consumption of poultry products with subsequent fall in demand thereby prices. The COVID-19-driven lockdown during March in the country has further accentuated the crippling poultry industry following the arrest of feed and healthcare essentials and destruction of eggs, chicks, and birds. Here, we have analyzed the impact of COVID-19 on the poultry industry and showed the realistic flow of events that resulted in its economic fallout by disruption of poultry protein chain during pandemic crisis. The projected loss caused because of these events for the Indian poultry industry is around USD 3053 million. The economic impact is not uniform across the country owing to regional differences in consumption pattern and percent non-vegetarians.","Kolluri, Gautham; Tyagi, Jagbir Singh; Sasidhar, Polamraj Venkata Kesava",Poult Sci,,531

This shift has given rise to a mass movement of cloth mask making. Artists have leapt into action to produce masks for healthcare and frontline workers or as an alternative economy for lost income, while others customize masks to communicate identity, beliefs, or concerns. Mask making has also raised questions about the future of fashion with regards to health and sustainability. Through a series of conversations, experts from the arts, fashion, sustainability, and medical fields were invited to talk about the variety of issues, and questions this moment of mask making and wearing have produced. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, Dr. Ana María Rule has been helping the scientific community and the public understand the spread of particulates and the effectiveness of masks. Through scholarly publications, Rule has proposed ways of safely reusing limited personal protective equipment, and questioned the results of studies gauging the safety of textile facemasks. Rule agreed to speak in the Art of Masks series as a way to educate the textile interested community about the limits of fabric facemasks, and how best to protect themselves and others. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Kipp, C.; Rule, A.

Pathogenesis can be derived from infection, coagulopathy, and inflammation. Malignant tumors metastasize to dura mater is one of the most infrequent causes. The exact mechanism remains elusive in spite of several possible speculations. The clinical manifestations, management and outcomes vary among reported cases.Case Description: A 45-year-old woman without history of trauma presented with headache, vomiting and disturbance of consciousness and developed brain hernia rapidly. On arival, she has lost into coma with Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score 5, bilateral pupils were not equal, with disappeared reflectance. Emergency imaging prompted large acute EDH, combined with SDH, arising from dural granular neoplasm confirmed intraoperatively. Four days after surgery, the bilateral pupils were equal in size and sensitive to light reflection.Conclusion: Dural metastases can cause EDH, chronic SDH can also be resulted from metastatic tumors of dura mater. When dealing with spontaneous non-traumatic hematoma around the dura mater, to make the precise diagnosis is sometimes doubtful and confusing. The stream of diagnostic thinking should be opened, including medical diseases such as liver and kidney disease, drug history, history of cancer and other possible clues. Thus, a detailed and purposeful systematic medical history review and physical examination is important in order to make more appropriate strategies for the clinic.","Zhao, Chenhui; Wei, Yi; Liu, Jie; Xu, Shanshui; Jiang, Xiaochun; Di, Guangfu",Int J Neurosci,,531

511316,"The Dynamic Expression of Potential Mediators of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Cellular Entry in Fetal, Neonatal, and Adult Rhesus Monkeys",2020,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) define chronic diseases as conditions that last 1 year or more and that require ongoing medical attention or limit activities of daily living, or both (1). Chronic diseases may be influenced by a combination of genetics, lifestyle and social behaviors, health care system factors, community influences, and environmental determinants of health (2). These risk factors often coexist and interact with each other. Therefore, a better understanding of determinants of chronic diseases such as tobacco use, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity stands to benefit from effective strategies for improving primary, secondary, and tertiary disease prevention and management in diverse global settings (3). Strategies to prevent and manage chronic disease outcomes such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have global commonalities (4-7). The impact of chronic diseases is disproportionately evident in Black and Brown communities (8,9). Chronic disease prevention and management typically focus on behavioral interventions such as healthy eating, increased physical activity, and cessation of unhealthy practices such as tobacco and alcohol use (10-15). In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic added to the fact that chronic diseases disproportionately affect low-resource communities, where many Black and Brown populations live (16,17). COVID-19 demonstrated that chronic disease disparities actually present as preexisting conditions in Black and Brown communities, who are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 outcomes. Although most of the articles in this Preventing Chronic Disease (PCD) collection were published before the pandemic, the insights they present, combined with the racial and ethnic data on the burden of COVID-19 thus far, support this reality. Many researchers and public health practitioners often consider the need to sufficiently address the relationships between chronic diseases and social, behavioral, and community factors (18). Global lessons in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, therefore, can help researchers and practitioners benefit from the shared lessons and experience derived from research and interventions conducted in different parts of the world. There are more than 7 billion people worldwide, who speak diverse languages and who have different nationalities, identities, and health systems. Yet, if we share challenges and opportunities for chronic disease prevention and management, many of the global adversities to improving health and well-being can be ameliorated, which is the purpose of this collection. The authors in this collection share lessons that represent experiences in diverse contexts across countries and regions of the world.","Airhihenbuwa, Collins O; Tseng, Tung-Sung; Sutton, Victor D; Price, LeShawndra",Prev Chronic Dis,,531

512724,Prevalence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2-specific Antibodies in German Blood Donors during the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Objectives: The aim of the current study was to investigate meaning-making in 57 older predominantly female adults (M = 72.68) required to temporarily cease attending a university-affiliated integrated care clinic in Australia with a focus on exercise and well-being due to COVID-19 restrictions, specifically regarding consequential grief, loss, hopelessness, and loss of purpose.Methods: Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by telephone interviews and an online survey.Results: Results indicated that most participants valued attending the Clinic, and experienced a number of physical, social and emotional benefits from attending, including a sense of meaning. Specifically, some participants developed social connections, learned to cope more effectively with mental health conditions, and regained strength following stressful or traumatic events through their attendance at the clinic.Conclusions: Throughout the pandemic, most participants retained their resilience and continued to derive meaning from various sources, including their families, careers, interests, and attitude toward life.Clinical implications: Older adults may experience enhanced physical, emotional and social health from engaging in community-based programs focused on exercise and overall wellness. Furthermore, meaning-making has the potential to buffer the harmful effects of stress and traumatic events on the physical, emotional and social health of older adults.","Beasley, Elizabeth A; Scott, Theresa L; Pachana, Nancy A",Clin Gerontol,,531
512928,The case of a liver-transplant recipient with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection who had a favorable outcome,2021,"The first case of COVID-19 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) was reported by Nigeria on February 27, 2020. Whereas case counts in the entire region remain considerably less than those being reported by individual countries in Europe, Asia, and the Americas, variation in preparedness and response capacity as well as in data availability has raised concerns about undetected transmission events in the SSA region. To capture epidemiological details related to early transmission events into and within countries, a line list was developed from publicly available data on institutional websites, situation reports, press releases, and social media accounts. The availability of indicators-gender, age, travel history, date of arrival in country, reporting date of confirmation, and how detected-for each imported case was assessed. We evaluated the relationship between the time to first reported importation and the Global Health Security Index (GHSI) overall score; 13,201 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported by 48 countries in SSA during the 54 days following the first known introduction to the region. Of the 2,516 cases for which travel history information was publicly available, 1,129 (44.9%) were considered importation events. Imported cases tended to be male (65.0%), with a median age of 41.0 years (range: 6 weeks-88 years; IQR: 31-54 years). A country's time to report its first importation was not related to the GHSI overall score, after controlling for air traffic. Countries in SSA generally reported with less publicly available detail over time and tended to have greater information on imported than local cases.","Skrip, Laura A; Selvaraj, Prashanth; Hagedorn, Brittany; Ouédraogo, Andre Lin; Noori, Navideh; Orcutt, Amanda; Mistry, Dina; Bedson, Jamie; Hébert-Dufresne, Laurent; Scarpino, Samuel V; Althouse, Benjamin M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,531

516334,A tug-of-war between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and host antiviral defence: lessons from other pathogenic viruses,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 testing demand has outpaced its supply. Pooling samples for lower risk populations has the potential to accommodate increased demand for SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and reproducibility of 4-way pooling of SARS-CoV-2 specimens for high-throughput RT-PCR. STUDY DESIGN: Individual samples were pooled 1:4 through automated liquid handling, extracted, and assayed by our emergency use authorized CDC-based RT-PCR laboratory developed test. Positive samples were serially diluted and theoretical and empirical PCR cycle thresholds were evaluated. Thirty-two distinct positive samples were pooled into negative specimens and individual CTs were compared to pooled CTs. Low positive samples were repeated for reproducibility and 32 four-way pools of negative specimens were assayed to determine specificity. RESULTS: Four-way pooling was associated with a loss of sensitivity of 1.7 and 2.0 CTs for our N1 and N2 targets, respectively. Pooling correctly identified SARS-CoV-2 in 94 % (n = 30/32) of samples tested. The two low positive specimens (neat CT > 35) not detected by pooling were individually repeated and detected 75 % (n=6/8) and 37.5 % (n = 3/8) of the time, respectively. All specimens individually determined negative were also negative by pooling. CONCLUSION: We report that 1:4 pooling of samples is specific and associated with an expected 2 CT loss in analytical sensitivity. Instead of running each sample individually, pooling of four samples will allow for a greater throughput and conserve scarce reagents.","Perchetti, Garrett A; Sullivan, Ka-Wing; Pepper, Greg; Huang, Meei-Li; Breit, Nathan; Mathias, Patrick; Jerome, Keith R; Greninger, Alexander L",J Clin Virol,,531

A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the incidence and the impact of COVID-19-related AKI on mortality. METHODS: All trials reporting the incidence of AKI in COVID-19 patients were searched using MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases (last update April 26, 2020). RESULTS: Ten trials with a sample of 5,166 patients were included. AKI occurred in 947 out of 5,166 (18.3%) patients. AKI incidence was higher in severe cases: 62/305 severe patients developed AKI (20%) versus 27/1,268 nonsevere patients (2%) (p = 0.00001). AKI occurred in 475 out of 915 (52%) deceased patients versus 183 out of 2,678 (7%) survivors (p = 0.00001). Continuous renal replacement therapy was significantly more frequent in severe cases and in dead patients. CONCLUSION: A significant increase in mortality rate was observed in COVID patients who developed AKI, and AKI incidence was also higher in severe cases. Any supportive strategies to protect kidney could represent valuable intervention to reduce mortality in severe COVID-19 patients.","Brienza, Nicola; Puntillo, Filomena; Romagnoli, Stefano; Tritapepe, Luigi",Blood Purif,,531
519830,Laboratory diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,2020,"In recent years, a total of seven human pathogenic coronaviruses (HCoVs) strains were identified, i.e., SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Here, we performed an analysis of the protease recognition sites and antigenic variation of the S-protein of these HCoVs. We showed tissue-specific expression pattern, functions, and a number of recognition sites of proteases in S-proteins from seven strains of HCoVs. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, we found two new protease recognition sites, each of calpain-2, pepsin-A, and caspase-8, and one new protease recognition site each of caspase-6, caspase-3, and furin. Our antigenic mapping study of the S-protein of these HCoVs showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus strain has the most potent antigenic epitopes (highest antigenicity score with maximum numbers of epitope regions). Additionally, the other six strains of HCoVs show common antigenic epitopes (both B-cell and T-cell), with low antigenicity scores compared to SARS-CoV-2. We suggest that the molecular evolution of structural proteins of human CoV can be classified, such as (i) HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E, (ii) SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV and (iii) HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1. In conclusion, we can presume that our study might help to prepare the interventions for the possible HCoVs outbreaks in the future.","Chakraborty, Chiranjib; Sharma, Ashish Ranjan; Bhattacharya, Manojit; Saha, Rudra P; Ghosh, Sanmitra; Biswas, Soham; Samanta, Saikat; Sharma, Garima; Agoramoorthy, Govindasamy; Lee, Sang-Soo",Infect Genet Evol,,531

520499,Treatment and Outcome of a Patient With Lung Cancer Infected With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2,2020,"INTRODUCTION: Since the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic of 2009 to 2010, numerous studies have described the clinical course and outcome of the different subtypes of influenza (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B). A recent systematic literature review concluded that there were no appreciable differences in either clinical presentation or disease severity among these subtypes, but study parameters limit the applicability of these results to military populations. We sought to evaluate differences in disease severity among influenza subtypes in a cohort of healthy, primarily outpatient adult U.S. Department of Defense beneficiaries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2009 to 2014, we enrolled otherwise healthy adults age 18 to 65 years with influenza-like illness in an observational cohort study based in 5 U.S. military medical centers. Serial nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for determination of etiology and viral shedding by polymerase chain reaction. The presence and severity of symptoms was assessed by interview and patient diary. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period, a total of 157 adults with laboratory-confirmed influenza and influenza subtype were enrolled. Of these, 69 (44%) were positive for influenza A(H1N1), 69 (44%) for influenza A(H3N2), and 19 (12%) for influenza B. About 61% were male, 64% were active duty military personnel, and 72% had received influenza vaccine in the past 8 months. Almost 10% were hospitalized with influenza. Seasonal influenza virus distribution among enrollees mirrored that of nationwide trends each year of study. Individuals with A/H1N1 had upper respiratory composite scores that were lower than those with A/H3N2. Multivariate models indicated that individuals with A(H1N1) and B had increased lower respiratory symptom scores when compared to influenza A(H3N2) (A[H1N1]: 1.51 [95% CI 0.47, 2.55]; B: 1.46 [95% CI 0.09, 2.83]), whereas no other differences in symptom severity scores among influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B infection were observed. Overall, influenza season (maximum in 2012-2013 season) and female sex of the participant were found to be associated with increased influenza symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study of influenza in a cohort of otherwise healthy, outpatient adult Department of Defense beneficiaries over 5 influenza seasons revealed few differences between influenza A(H1N1), influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B infection with respect to self-reported disease severity or clinical outcomes. This study highlights the importance of routine, active, and laboratory-based surveillance to monitor ongoing trends and severity of influenza in various populations to inform prevention measures.","Schofield, Christina; Colombo, Rhonda E; Richard, Stephanie A; Chen, Wei-Ju; Fairchok, Mary P; Maves, Ryan C; Arnold, John C; Danaher, Patrick J; Deiss, Robert G; Lalani, Tahaniyat; Rajnik, Michael; Millar, Eugene V; Coles, Christian L; Burgess, Timothy H",Mil Med,,531

This analysis employs social media listening and analysis to discern top themes arising from social and online media posts referencing veterinarians. Social media sentiment analysis is also employed to aid in quantifying the search results, in terms of whether they are positivity/negativity associated. From September 2017-November 2019, over 1.4 million posts and 1.7 million mentions were analyzed; the top domain in the search results was Twitter (74%). The mean net sentiment associated with the search conducted over the time period studied was 52%. The top terms revealed in the searches conducted revolved mainly around care of or concern for pet animals. The recognition of challenges facing the veterinary medicine profession were notably absent, except for the mention of suicide risks. While undeniably influenced by the search terms selected, which were directed towards client-clinic related verbiage, a relative lack of knowledge regarding veterinarians' roles in human health, food safety/security, and society generally outside of companion animal care was recognized. Future research aimed at determining the value of veterinarians' contributions to society and, in particular, in the scope of One Health, may aid in forming future communication and education campaigns.","Widmar, Nicole; Bir, Courtney; Lai, John; Wolf, Christopher",Vet.

The data were described using descriptive statistical measures, and for the estimation of change point’s E-divisive procedure was employed. Further, the trend within the estimated change points was tested using Sen’s slope and Mann Kendal tests. India, along with the African Region, American region, and South East Asia regions experienced a significant surge in the fresh cases up to the 5th Change point. Among the WHO regions, The American region was the worst hit by the pandemic in case of fresh cases and deaths. While the European region experienced an early negative trend of fresh cases during the 3rd and 4th change point, but later the situation reversed by the 5th (7th July 2020) and 6th (6th August 2020) change point. The trend of deaths in India and the South-East Asia Region was similar, and global deaths had a negative trend from the 4th (17th May 2020) Change point onwards. The change points were estimated with prefixed significance level [Formula: see text] < 0.002. Infections and deaths were positively significant for India and SEARO region across change points. Infection was significant at every 30 days interval across other WHO regions, and any delay in the infections was due to the interventions. The European region is expected to have a second wave of positive infections during the 5th and 6th change points though the early two change points were negatively significant.

The causative agent of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide resulting in a pandemic of unprecedented magnitude. To date, no clinically safe drug or vaccine is available and the development of molecules to combat SARS-CoV-2 infections is imminent. A well-known strategy to identify molecules with inhibitory potential against SARS-CoV-2 proteins is the repurposing of clinically developed drugs, e.g., anti-parasitic drugs. The results described in this study demonstrate the inhibitory potential of quinacrine and suramin against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (3CLpro). Quinacrine and suramin molecules present a competitive and non-competitive mode of inhibition, respectively, with IC50 and KD values in low μM range. Using docking and molecular dynamics simulations we identified a possible binding mode and the amino acids involved in these interactions. Our results suggested that suramin in combination with quinacrine showed promising synergistic efficacy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro. The identification of effective, synergistic drug combinations could lead to the design of better treatments for the COVID-19 disease.

592068,Inhibiting fusion with cellular membrane system: therapeutic options to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection,2020-09-01,"PURPOSE: Lactate is an established prognosticator in critical care. However, there still is insufficient evidence about its role in predicting outcome in COVID-19. This is of particular concern in older patients who have been mostly affected during the initial surge in 2020. METHODS: This prospective international observation study (The COVIP study) recruited patients aged 70 years or older (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04321265) admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 disease from March 2020 to February 2021. In addition to serial lactate values (arterial blood gas analysis), we recorded several parameters, including SOFA score, ICU procedures, limitation of care, ICU- and 3-month mortality. A lactate concentration ≥ 2.0 mmol/L on the day of ICU admission (baseline) was defined as abnormal. The primary outcome was ICU-mortality. The secondary outcomes 30-day and 3-month mortality. RESULTS: In total, data from 2860 patients were analyzed. In most patients (68%), serum lactate was lower than 2 mmol/L. Elevated baseline serum lactate was associated with significantly higher ICU- and 3-month mortality (53% vs. 43%, and 71% vs. 57%, respectively, p < 0.001). In the multivariable analysis, the maximum lactate concentration on day 1 was independently associated with ICU mortality (aOR 1.06 95% CI 1.02–1.11; p = 0.007), 30-day mortality (aOR 1.07 95% CI 1.02–1.13; p = 0.005) and 3-month mortality (aOR 1.15 95% CI 1.08–1.24; p < 0.001) after adjustment for age, gender, SOFA score, and frailty. In 826 patients with baseline lactate ≥ 2 mmol/L sufficient data to calculate the difference between maximal levels on days 1 and 2 (∆ serum lactate) were available. A decreasing lactate concentration over time was inversely associated with ICU mortality after multivariate adjustment for SOFA score, age, Clinical Frailty Scale, and gender (aOR 0.60 95% CI 0.42–0.85; p = 0.004). CONCLUSION: In critically ill old intensive care patients suffering from COVID-19, lactate and its kinetics are valuable tools for outcome prediction. Trial registration number: NCT04321265.

592283,Influence of Different Inactivation Methods on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 RNA Copy Number,2020-07-23,"Population-based seroprevalence surveys can provide useful estimates of the number of individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 and still susceptible as well as contribute to better estimates of the case fatality rate and other measures of COVID-19 severity. No serological test is 100% accurate, however, and the standard correction that epidemiologists use to adjust estimates relies on estimates of the test sensitivity and specificity often based on small validation studies. This paper develops a fully Bayesian approach to adjust observed prevalence estimates for sensitivity and specificity. Application to a seroprevalence survey conducted in New York State in 2020 demonstrates that this approach results in more realistic -- and narrower -- credible interval than the standard sensitivity analysis using confidence interval endpoints. In addition, the model permits incorporating data on the geographical distribution of reported case counts to create informative priors on the cumulative incidence to produce estimates and credible intervals for smaller geographic areas than often can be precisely estimated with seroprevalence surveys.","Meyer, M.

To investigate the effectiveness of this strategy, we linked family practitioner, prescribing, laboratory, hospital and death records and compared COVID-19 outcomes among shielded and non-shielded individuals in the West of Scotland. Of the 1.3 million population, 27,747 (2.03%) were advised to shield, and 353,085 (26.85%) were classified a priori as moderate risk. COVID-19 testing was more common in the shielded (7.01%) and moderate risk (2.03%) groups, than low risk (0.73%). Referent to low-risk, the shielded group had higher confirmed infections (RR 8.45, 95% 7.44–9.59), case-fatality (RR 5.62, 95% CI 4.47–7.07) and population mortality (RR 57.56, 95% 44.06–75.19). The moderate-risk had intermediate confirmed infections (RR 4.11, 95% CI 3.82–4.42) and population mortality (RR 25.41, 95% CI 20.36–31.71) but, due to their higher prevalence, made the largest contribution to deaths (PAF 75.30%). Age ≥ 70 years accounted for 49.55% of deaths. In conclusion, in spite of the shielding strategy, high risk individuals were at increased risk of death. Furthermore, to be effective as a population strategy, shielding criteria would have needed to be widely expanded to include other criteria, such as the elderly.","Jani, Bhautesh D.; Ho, Frederick K.; Lowe, David J.; Traynor, Jamie P.; MacBride-Stewart, Sean P.; Mark, Patrick B.; Mair, Frances S.; Pell, Jill P.",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-94630-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34315958/,531

The aim of this study is to investigate the safety and effect of Orbera365. METHOD: Prospective study on our initial experience with a consecutive group of patients who underwent the insertion of Orbera365 in the period between September 2019 and August 2020. The patients were followed up to assess, pain, nausea, and vomiting after procedure, weight loss, and the complication rate. RESULTS: A total of 97 patients underwent Orbera365 placement. Mean weight and BMI before the procedure were 93.8 ± 15.2 kg and 35.2 ± 4.4 kg/m(2), respectively, which dropped to 80.6 ± 13.1 kg and 29.8 ± 4.0 kg/m(2) by 8.2 months and were 82.4 ± 16.1 and 30.4 ± 4.6 at the last day of follow-up of 12.9 months. Fourteen patients did not tolerate the balloon, and had to have it removed, six of them in the first week, and eight within the first 8 months of insertion. Other than intolerance, two patients had balloon rupture, three patients had leakage at time of insertion requiring balloon replacement, two patient had pancreatitis, one patient had spontaneous balloon hyperinflation, and one patient had balloon deflation and vomited the balloon. At day of last follow-up, total body weight loss % (TBWL%) was 16.2 ± 10.1 and %EWL was 54.6 ± 38.3. CONCLUSION: Orbera365 is safe and effective for weight loss.

METHODS: We employ the difference-in-differences model that exploits the differential timing of the mask mandate implementation across states. RESULTS: Our findings show that the Public Mask Mandate significantly lowers the incidence of developing all COVID-19 symptoms by 0.29 percentage points. The estimate implies an average reduction of 290%, compared to the proportion of the mandate-unaffected individuals who display all symptoms (0.1%). CONCLUSION: The study provides suggestive evidence for the health benefits of wearing masks in public in the initial stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study also highlights the relevance of public mask wearing for the ongoing pandemic where the vaccination rate is precarious and access to vaccines is still limited in many countries.","Nguyen, My",Clinicoecon Outcomes Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/ceor.s326728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34429625/,531

There exists controversy regarding the implications of eosinophils in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)’s pathology. We report a retrospective cohort study including the comparison of leukocyte counts in COVID-19 patients, considering the outcomes of recovery (n = 59) and death (n = 60). Among the different types of leukocytes, the eosinophil counts were those that showed the greatest difference between recovered and deceased patients. Eosinopenia (eosinophil count < 0.01 × 10(9)/L) was more frequently observed in deceased than recovered patients (p = 0.0012). The eosinophil counts more rapidly increased and showed a greater proportion over the course of the disease in the recovered than deceased patients. Furthermore, the estimated survival rate was greater in patients without eosinopenia than in patients with eosinopenia (p = 0.0070) during hospitalization. Importantly, recovered but not deceased patients showed high negative correlations of the eosinophils with the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and neutrophil counts at Day 9 of the onset of clinical symptoms (p ≤ 0.0220). Our analysis suggests that eosinopenia may be associated with unfavorable disease outcomes and that the eosinophils have a beneficial function in COVID-19 patients, probably contributing by controlling the exacerbated inflammation induced by neutrophils.","Cortés-Vieyra, Ricarda; Gutiérrez-Castellanos, Sergio; Álvarez-Aguilar, Cleto; Baizabal-Aguirre, Víctor Manuel; Nuñez-Anita, Rosa Elvira; Rocha-López, Angélica Georgina; Gómez-García, Anel",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34578258/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v13091675,531

598622,"Etiology of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 2013–2017",2018-08-31,"BACKGROUND: . Teriflunomide is an immunomodulatory drug approved for Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment that inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a mitochondrial enzyme involved in the de novo pyrimidine synthesis pathway. This mechanism can produce antiviral effects, thus teriflunomide has gained attention during COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, in the last months, some case-reports have been published describing MS patients treated with teriflunomide who developed mild and self-limiting forms of COVID-19. METHODS: Here, we describe the case of a 57-year-old man affected by MS, and treated with teriflunomide, who developed a mild form of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, we provide a detailed literature review about the available cases of COVID-19 in MS patients treated with teriflunomide. We report clinical features, disease course and outcome, and we discuss similarities and differences among patients. RESULTS: Apart from the present report, since February 2020, five papers have been published describing 14 MS patients who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection during teriflunomide treatment. Patients were mostly female (53%), with an average age of 50.5 (±11.3) years. Median EDSS was 2.25 (range 0–6). The average time on treatment with teriflunomide was 3.7 (± 1.6) years. Relevant comorbidities were present in 4 patients (27%). Regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, the most common symptom was fever (100%) followed by gastrointestinal disturbances (67%), fatigue (55%) and cough (55%). 5 patients were hospitalized and 2 required oxygen support. In patient hospitalized (n=5) compared to the others (n=10), age was significantly higher (59.6 vs 45.9 years, p=0.025) while gender, EDSS, duration of teriflunomide therapy and comorbidities were not significantly different. Outcome was good for all patients with a variable recovery time, ranging from few days to some weeks. Teriflunomide was continued during the entire course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in all patients except for two. Compared to the patients already described, our patient was 7 years older, average time on teriflunomide treatment was about 2.5 years shorter, and median EDSS was 1.5 point lower. Despite significant comorbidities, the outcome was good since our patient was hospitalized but he did not require oxygen supplementation nor intensive care and was able to return at home after only 10 days. Teriflunomide therapy was continued throughout the period. CONCLUSION: Available data suggest that teriflunomide therapy should not be discontinued in MS patients who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, also in presence of significant comorbidities or clinical conditions requiring hospitalization. Additional studies are necessary to assess if the drug can also have a protective role against SARS-CoV-2.","Capone, Fioravante; Motolese, Francesco; Luce, Tiziano; Rossi, Mariagrazia; Magliozzi, Alessandro; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo",Mult Scler Relat Disord,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2211034820308087; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211034820308087; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102734; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429305/,531

The first case of COVID-19 in Singapore was detected on January 23, 2020, and by March 16, a total of 243 cases had been confirmed, including 157 locally acquired cases. Clinical and epidemiologic findings of all COVID-19 cases in Singapore through March 16 were reviewed to determine whether presymptomatic transmission might have occurred. Presymptomatic transmission was defined as the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from an infected person (source patient) to a secondary patient before the source patient developed symptoms, as ascertained by exposure and symptom onset dates, with no evidence that the secondary patient had been exposed to anyone else with COVID-19. Seven COVID-19 epidemiologic clusters in which presymptomatic transmission likely occurred were identified, and 10 such cases within these clusters accounted for 6.4% of the 157 locally acquired cases. In the four clusters for which the date of exposure could be determined, presymptomatic transmission occurred 1-3 days before symptom onset in the presymptomatic source patient. To account for the possibility of presymptomatic transmission, officials developing contact tracing protocols should strongly consider including a period before symptom onset. Evidence of presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the critical role social distancing, including avoidance of congregate settings, plays in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wei, Wycliffe E.; Li, Zongbin; Chiew, Calvin J.; Yong, Sarah E.; Toh, Matthias P.; Lee, Vernon J.",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271722/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6914e1,531

Using French data on cases and tests for the period following the first lock-down - from May 13, 2020, onwards - our acceleration index shows that the ongoing pandemic resurgence can be dated to begin around July 7. It uncovers that the pandemic acceleration has been stronger than national average for the [59-68] and [69-78] age groups since early September, the latter being associated with the strongest acceleration index, as of October 25. In contrast, acceleration among the [19-28] age group is the lowest and is about half that of the [69-78], as of October 25. In addition, we propose an algorithm to allocate tests among French departments, based on both the acceleration index and the feedback effect of testing. Our acceleration-based allocation differs from the actual distribution over French territories, which is population-based. We argue that both our acceleration index and our allocation algorithm are useful tools to guide public health policies as France enters a second lock-down period with indeterminate duration.","Baunez, C.; Degoulet, M.; Luchini, S.; Pintus, P.; Teschl, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.11.05.20226597v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.05.20226597,531

Successful implementation requires thorough understanding of its preformulation characterization. In this work, preformulation assessments were conducted to characterize GRFT and identify its degradation pathways under selected conditions of temperature, light, pH, shear, ionic strength, and oxidation. Compatibility with vaginal fluid simulant, vaginal enzymes, Lactobacillus spp., and human cervicovaginal secretions was assessed. The purity, melting temperature, and HIV gp120-binding affinity of GRFT stored at 4°C and 25°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were assessed for 2 years. Chemical modifications were evaluated by intact mass analysis and peptide sequencing. Excised human ectocervical tissue permeability and localization of GRFT were evaluated. Our results demonstrated GRFT to be safe and stable under all the preformulation assessment conditions studied except oxidative stress. When GRFT was exposed to hydrogen peroxide or human cervicovaginal secretion, methionine 78 in the protein sequence underwent oxidation. GRFT did not permeate through human cervical tissue but adhered to the superficial epithelial tissue. The 2-year stability study revealed no significant change in GRFT’s aggregation, degradation, melting temperature, or gp120-binding affinity despite a slow increase in oxidation over time. These studies elucidated desirable safety and bioactivity profile for GRFT, showing promise as a potential drug candidate for HIV prevention. However, susceptibility to oxidative degradation was identified. Effective protection of GRFT from oxidation is required for further development.","Kramzer, Lindsay F.; Hamorsky, Krystal T.; Graebing, Phillip W.; Wang, Lin; Fuqua, Joshua L.; Matoba, Nobuyuki; Lasnik, Amanda B.; Moncla, Bernard J.; Zhang, Junmei; Palmer, Kenneth E.; Rohan, Lisa C.",AAPS PharmSciTech,https://doi.org/10.1208/s12249-021-01931-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625602/,531

The system is overstretched with little to no surge capacity to deal with crisis situations, its reach restrained due to overreliance on brick and mortar clinics, and its behavior overwhelmingly more reactive than preventive. As delivery systems reorganize on the fly to fight COVID-19, many are turning to tools like telemedicine, pre-visit planning, and centralized population health programs. We propose how these rapid transformations happening across the country, born out of necessity, present a silver lining opportunity to fix primary care. We describe how integrating telemedicine, patient-generated data, and preventive care into a retooled intake and care optimization process is achievable through an approach powered by humans and augmentable with artificial intelligence. Primary care must retool to meet the challenge of COVID-19 and emerge in the post-crisis world better equipped to care for a wounded nation. Our collective willingness to invest in primary care teams, relaxation of rules around telemedicine reimbursement and patient-generated data sharing, workforce training, and movement to value-based payments are necessary to achieve this vision.","Lin, Steven; Sattler, Amelia; Smith, Margaret",Mayo Clin Proc,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.06.050; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0025619620307606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32861324/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619620307606?v=s5,531
607323,Clinical Validation of a Sensitive Test for Saliva Collected in Health Care and Community Settings with Pooling Utility for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Mass Surveillance,2021-05-04,"As the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to grow globally, testing to detect COVID-19 and isolating individuals who test positive remains to be the primary strategy for preventing community spread of the disease. The current gold standard method of testing for COVID-19 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The RT-PCR test, however, has an imperfect sensitivity (around 70%), is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and is in short supply, particularly in resource-limited countries. Therefore, automatic and accurate detection of COVID-19 using medical imaging modalities such as chest X-ray and Computed Tomography, which are more widely available and accessible, can be beneficial. We develop a novel hierarchical attention neural network model to classify chest radiography images as belonging to a person with either COVID-19, other infections, or no pneumonia (i.e., normal). We refer to this model as Artificial Intelligence for Detection of COVID-19 (AIDCOV). The hierarchical structure in AIDCOV captures the dependency of features and improves model performance while the attention mechanism makes the model interpretable and transparent. Using a publicly available dataset of 5801 chest images, we demonstrate that our model achieves a mean cross-validation accuracy of 97.8%. AIDCOV has a sensitivity of 99.3%, a specificity of 99.98%, and a positive predictive value of 99.6% in detecting COVID-19 from chest radiography images. AIDCOV can be used in conjunction with or instead of RT-PCR testing (where RT-PCR testing is unavailable) to detect and isolate individuals with COVID-19 and prevent onward transmission to the general population and healthcare workers.","Zokaeinikoo, M.; Mitra, P.; Kumara, S.; Kazemian, P.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.24.20111922; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.24.20111922v1?rss=1,531

Objective We sought to examine the relation of the nasal microbiota at bronchiolitis-related hospitalization and 3 later points to the risk of recurrent wheezing by age 3 years. Methods In 17 US centers researchers collected clinical data and nasal swabs from infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. Trained parents collected nasal swabs 3 weeks after hospitalization and, when healthy, during the summer and 1 year after hospitalization. We applied 16S rRNA gene sequencing to all nasal swabs. We used joint modeling to examine the relation of longitudinal nasal microbiota abundances to the risk of recurrent wheezing. Results Among 842 infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis, there was 88% follow-up at 3 years, and 31% had recurrent wheezing. The median age at enrollment was 3.2 months (interquartile range, 1.7-5.8 months). In joint modeling analyses adjusting for 16 covariates, including viral cause, a 10% increase in relative abundance of Moraxella or Streptococcus species 3 weeks after day 1 of hospitalization was associated with an increased risk of recurrent wheezing (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.38 and 95% high-density interval [HDI] of 1.11-1.85 and HR of 1.76 and 95% HDI of 1.13-3.19, respectively). Increased Streptococcus species abundance the summer after hospitalization was also associated with a greater risk of recurrent wheezing (HR, 1.76; 95% HDI, 1.15-3.27). Conclusions Enrichment of Moraxella or Streptococcus species after bronchiolitis hospitalization was associated with recurrent wheezing by age 3 years, possibly providing new avenues to ameliorate the long-term respiratory outcomes of infants with severe bronchiolitis.","Mansbach, Jonathan M.; Luna, Pamela N.; Shaw, Chad A.; Hasegawa, Kohei; Petrosino, Joseph F.; Piedra, Pedro A.; Sullivan, Ashley F.; Espinola, Janice A.; Stewart, Christopher J.; Camargo, Carlos A.",Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2019.10.034; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0091674919315167; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674919315167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31738994/,531

Given the current vaccine shortage, vaccination programs must prioritize their distribution to the most appropriate segments of the population. Methods: We carried out a prospective cohort study with 63 health care workers (HCWs) from a public General Hospital. We compared antibody responses to two doses of BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine between HCWs with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection before vaccination (experienced HCWs) and HCWs who were not previously infected (naive HCWs). Results: Seven days after the first vaccine dose HCWs with previous infection experienced a 126 fold increase in antibody levels (GMC 26955 AU; 95% CI 18785-35125). However, in the HCW naive group the response was much lower and only 5 of them showed positive antibody levels (>50 AU). The HCWs with previous infection did not significantly increased their antibody levels after the second dose while there was a significant increase in the naive HCW group (16 fold; GMC 20227 AU; 95% CI: 15179-25275). Approximately two months after completing vaccination, the level of antibodies was much lower in naive HCWs (GMC 6595 AU vs. 25003 AU; p<0.001) Conclusion: The study shows that 10 months after the disease has passed, the immune system is capable of producing a rapid and powerful secondary antibody response after one single dose of the vaccine. This response reflects the persistence of immunological memory and it is independent of whether or not anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are detected in blood. Besides, we found that the second dose does not improve the antibody response in individuals with previous Covid-19 infection. Nonetheless, two months later, the persistence of antibody levels is still higher in the experienced HCWs. These data suggest that immune memory remains for a long time in recovered individuals, and therefore, vaccination in this group could be postponed until immunization of the rest of the population is complete.","Ontanon, J.; Blas, J.; de Cabo, C.; Santos, C.; Ruiz-Escribano, E.; Garcia, A.; Marin, L.; Saez, L.; Beato, J.

Although most respiratory pathogens, such as human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV), rarely cause severe disease in healthy human adults, they are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in wild great apes habituated to humans for research or tourism. To prevent pathogen transmission, most great ape projects have established a set of hygiene measures ranging from keeping a specific distance, to the use of surgical masks and establishment of quarantines. This study investigates the incidence of respiratory symptoms and human respiratory viruses in humans at a human‐great ape interface, the Taï Chimpanzee Project (TCP) in Côte d'Ivoire, and consequently, the effectiveness of a 5‐day quarantine designed to reduce the risk of potential exposure to human respiratory pathogens. To assess the impact of quarantine as a preventative measure, we monitored the quarantine process and tested 262 throat swabs for respiratory viruses, collected during quarantine over a period of 1 year. Although only 1 subject tested positive for a respiratory virus (HRSV), 17 subjects developed symptoms of infection while in quarantine and were subsequently kept from approaching the chimpanzees, preventing potential exposure in 18 cases. Our results suggest that quarantine—in combination with monitoring for symptoms—is effective in reducing the risk of potential pathogen exposure. This research contributes to our understanding of how endangered great apes can be protected from human‐borne infectious disease.","Grützmacher, Kim; Keil, Verena; Leinert, Vera; Leguillon, Floraine; Henlin, Arthur; Couacy‐Hymann, Emmanuel; Köndgen, Sophie; Lang, Alexander; Deschner, Tobias; Wittig, Roman M.; Leendertz, Fabian H.",Am J Primatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28095600/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ajp.22619,531
615279,Molecular biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus,2004-07-28,"OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of the COVID‐19 pandemic required rapid public compliance with advice from health authorities. Here, we ask who was most likely to do so during the first wave of the pandemic. DESIGN: Quota‐sampled cross‐sectional and panel data from eight Western democracies (Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). METHODS: We fielded online public opinion surveys to 26,508 citizens between 19 March and 16 May. The surveys included questions about protective behaviour, perceptions of the pandemic (threat and self‐efficacy), as well as broader attitudes towards society (institutional and interpersonal trust). We employ multilevel and fixed‐effects regression models to analyse the relationship between these variables. RESULTS: Consistent with prior research on epidemics, perceptions of threat turn out as culturally uniform determinants of both avoidant and preventive forms of protective behaviour. On this basis, authorities could foster compliance by appealing to fear of COVID‐19, but there may be normative and practical limits to such a strategy. Instead, we find that another major source of compliance is a sense of self‐efficacy. Using individual‐level panel data, we find evidence that self‐efficacy is amendable to change and exerts an effect on protective behaviour. Furthermore, the effects of fear are small among those who feel efficacious, creating a path to compliance without fear. In contrast, two other major candidates for facilitating compliance from the social sciences, interpersonal trust and institutional trust, have surprisingly little motivational power during the first wave of the COVID‐19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: To address future waves of the pandemic, health authorities should thus focus on facilitating self‐efficacy in the public.","Jørgensen, Frederik; Bor, Alexander; Petersen, Michael Bang",Br J Health Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763971/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12519,531

The current review comprehensively summarized the nutritional qualities functional food attributes, and bioactive properties of these organisms. Among the phylum mollusca, Cephalopoda, Bivalvia, and Gastropoda were mostly reported for their nutraceutical applications and bioactive properties. The online search tools, like Scifinder/Science Direct/PubMed/Google Scholar/MarinLit database and marine natural product reports (1984-2019) were used to comprehend the information about the molluscs. More than 1334 secondary metabolites were reported from marine molluscs between the periods from 1984 to 2019. Among various classes of specialized metabolites, terpenes were occupied by 55 % in gastropods, whereas sterols occupied 41 % in bivalves. The marketed nutraceuticals, such as Cadalmin(TM) green mussel extract (Perna viridis) and Lyprinol® (Perna canaliculus) were endowed with potential anti-inflammatory activities, and were used against arthritis. Molluscan-derived therapeutics, for example, ziconotide was used as an analgesic, and elisidepsin was used in the treatment of cancer. Greater numbers of granted patents (30 %) during 2016-2019 recognized the increasing importance of bioactive compounds from molluscs. Consumption of molluscs as daily diets could be helpful in the enhancement of immunity, and reduce the risk of several ailments.

We compared air pollution between the lockdown period and the period before the lockdown using a difference-in-differences (DID) model and estimated the mortality burden caused by the number of deaths related to air pollution changes. The NO(2) and CO concentrations during the lockdown period (17 days) declined by 8.94 μg/m(3) (relative change: 16.94%; 95% CI: 3.71, 14.16) and 0.20 mg/m(3) (relative change: 16.95%; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.35) on an average day, respectively, and O(3) increased by 8.41 μg/m(3) (relative change: 32.80%; 95% CI: 4.39, 12.43); no meaningful impacts of the lockdown policy on the PM(2.5), PM(10), SO(2), or the AQI values were observed. Based on the three clearly changed air pollutants, the lockdown policy prevented 8.22 (95% CI: 3.97, 12.49) all-cause deaths. Our findings suggest that the overall excess deaths caused by air pollution during the lockdown period declined. It is beneficial for human health when strict control measures, such as upgrading industry structure and promoting green transportation, are taken to reduce emissions, especially in cities with serious air pollution in China, such as Shijiazhuang.","Xu, Zhihu; Cao, Ru; Hu, Xin; Han, Wenxing; Wang, Yuxin; Huang, Jing; Li, Guoxing",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34444451/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18168702,531

One such lethal complication being reported in patients in India in recent times, who have tested positive for Covid-19 and are gradually recovering, is a fungal disease called Mucormycosis or the black fungus. With several hundreds of cases being reported all over the country, it has triggered an additional wave of panic among the general public. Post-Covid-19 patients who are more vulnerable to Mucormycosis are those with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and also those who are immuno-compromised and have been treated with steroids and other drugs for Covid-19. The aim of this short review is to briefly cover the epidemiology of mucormycosis, its possible pathophysiology in Post Covid scenario, the clinical presentation and its diagnosis and management.","Nambiar, Manjusha; Varma, Sudhir Rama; Damdoum, Marah",Saudi J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sjbs.2021.07.004; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1319562X21005775; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305427/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1319562X21005775?v=s5,531

Evidence suggests continuity of care in England is declining. AIM To confirm reports of declining continuity of care, explore differences in decline according to practice characteristics, and examine associations between practice populations or appointment provision and changes in continuity of care. DESIGN AND SETTING Longitudinal design on GP Patient Survey data reported annually in June or July from 2012 to 2017, whereby the unit of analysis was English general practices that existed in 2012. METHOD Linear univariable and bivariable multilevel models were used to determine decline in average annual percentage of patients having a preferred GP and seeing this GP 'usually' according to practicelevel continuity of care, rural/urban location, and deprivation. Associations between percentage of patients having a preferred GP or seeing this GP usually and patients' experiences with the appointment system and practice population characteristics were modelled. RESULTS In 2012, 56.7% of patients had a preferred GP, which had declined by 9.4 percentage points (pp) (95% CI = -9.6 to -9.2) by 2017. Of patients with a preferred GP, 66.4% saw that GP 'usually' in 2012; this had declined by 9.7 pp (95% CI = -10.0 to -9.4) by 2017. This decline was visible in all types of practices, irrespective of baseline continuity, rural/urban location, or level of deprivation. At practice level, an increase over time in the percentage of patients reporting good overall experience of making appointments was associated with an increase in both the percentage of patients having a preferred GP and those able to see that GP 'usually'. CONCLUSION Patients reported a steady decline in continuity of care over time, which should concern clinicians and policymakers. Ability of practices to offer patients a satisfactory appointment system could partly counteract this decline.","Tammes, Peter; Morris, Richard W; Murphy, Mairead; Salisbury, Chris",The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgp.2020.0935; https://bjgp.org/content/bjgp/early/2020/12/13/BJGP.2020.0935.full.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33947666/,531
624660,Expression and Purification of N and E Proteins from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-Associated Coronavirus: a Comparative Study,2005,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is affecting the whole world and threatening human health. We aim to investigate the immunological characteristics of monocytes in critical patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The number and immune status of monocytes were detected by flow cytometry in 32 COVID-19 patients and 18 healthy individuals. RESULTS: In critical patients with COVID-19, the absolute number of total monocytes and CD16(-) monocytes was significantly decreased but CD16(+) pro-inflammatory monocytes was increased compared to healthy controls. Antigen presentation potential of monocytes, as measured by HLA-DR expression, was suppressed, while their inflammatory phenotype (CD38 expression) was enhanced. Cytokine levels showed sustained increases in critical patients. And the levels of IL-6 were positively correlated with CD16(+) monocytes number. IL-6 and IL-10 levels were negatively correlated with HLA-DR expression of monocytes. During the recovery of COVID-19 patients, the count and immune status of monocyte subsets were restored by degrees. HLA-DR(+) monocytes possessed good sensitivity and specificity for predicting the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In critical patients with COVID-19, decline in number and HLA-DR expression of monocytes might lead to decreased antigen presentation potential and thus immunosuppression, while increased CD16(+) pro-inflammatory monocytes might mediate hyperinflammation. HLA-DR(+) monocytes might be a meaningful assisted indicator to predict the incidence of critical patients with COVID-19.","Qin, Shuang; Jiang, Yujie; Wei, Xin; Liu, Xiaoyuan; Guan, Jingjing; Chen, Yingxiao; Lu, Hong; Qian, Jingjing; Wang, Zhongyong; Lin, Xiangyang",Hum Immunol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0198885920304444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33531264/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885920304444?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.humimm.2020.12.010,531

The products of translation are an N-terminal nested series of polyproteins. These polyproteins enter the secretory system of the host cell and are proteolytically processed to yield the mature virion glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, and two non-structural glycoproteins. By means of pulse-chase immune precipitation experiments we identify the Gn and Gc precursor molecules and also show that signal peptidase cleavage is required for mature Gn and Gc production. We also demonstrate that a hydrophobic domain at the N-terminus of Gn acts as a signal peptide only in the context of the polyprotein precursors that initiate at the second, fourth or fifth AUGs. In addition, we document that formation of Gn/Gc heteromeric complexes occur rapidly (<5 min) and can occur prior to signal peptidase processing of Gn, suggesting that this complex forms in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, Gc can form a complex with a glycoprotein that has been considered nonstructural, a discovery that has implications for both the topology and potential packaging of this glycoprotein.","Gerrard, Sonja R.; Nichol, Stuart T.",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682206005460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16963099/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682206005460,531

Some studies have linked smoking with severity of illness of COVID-19 whereas others have found no such association. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all adults hospitalised with COVID-19 from 9 March to 18 May 2020. RESULTS: 1173 patients met the study criteria. 837 patients never smoked whereas 336 patients were either current smokers or past smoker and were grouped together in smokers group. Patients in smokers group were more likely to be male and had higher incidence of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (19% vs 6%, p<0.001), HIV infection (11% vs 5%, p<0.001), cancer (11% vs 6%, p=0.005), congestive heart failure (15% vs 8%, p<0.001), coronary artery disease (15% vs 9%, p=0.3), chronic kidney disease (11% vs 8%, p=0.037) and end-stage renal disease (10% vs 6%, p=0.009) compared with non-smokers. Outcome analysis showed that smokers were more likely to develop critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation (47% vs 37% p=0.005). Univariate Cox model for survival analysis by smoking status showed that among smokers only current smokers had higher risk of death compared with never smokers (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.22 to 2.12, p<0.001). In the multivariate approach, Cox model for the survival, female sex, young age, low serum lactate dehydrogenase and systemic steroid use were associated with overall improved survival.

In previous published studies, the association between the mean Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection rate, and mortality among the adult population in European countries was examined. The aim of this study was to re-examine the relationship between the Vit D status of each country and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality using updated data and a different methodological approach. Methods: Information only form the last decade on Vit D concentration/deficiency for each country was retrieved through literature search on PubMed database. As of February, 4th 2021, COVID-19 infections and mortalities per one million population as well as total recoveries were extracted from the Worldometer website. The association between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection, recovery, and mortality were explored using correlation coefficients and scatterplots. Results: The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among European countries ranged from 6.0 (Finland) to 75.5% (Turkey), with several countries facing more than 50% of vitamin D deficiency among their population. Non-significant correlations were observed between the number of COVID-19 infections (r=0.190; p=0.374), recoveries (rs=0.317, p=0.131), and mortalities (r=0.129; p=0.549) per one million population, with the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.

Neutralizing antibodies (Nab) were detected in 15% of early responders after the first dose, and in 90% of early responders and 58% of late responders after the second dose. Sab titers after the second dose were higher in patients with Nab than without Nab (598 [IQR, 246-882] versus 134 [IQR, 61-390], p < 0.0001). All patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection developed both Sab and Nab, and their titers of Sab and Nab were higher than in late responders CONCLUSIONS: Most HD patients develop a substantial humoral response against SARS-COV2, with neutralizing antibodies, following the mRNA vaccine. Whether this immunity persists over time, and is able to efficiently protect patients from COVID-19, remains to be determined.","Giot, Matthieu; Fourié, Toscane; Lano, Guillaume; Villarroel, Paola Mariela Saba; de Lamballeri, Xavier; Gully, Marion; Samson, Laurent; Farault, Julien; Bouchouareb, Dammar; Jehel, Océane; Brunet, Philippe; Jourde-Chiche, Noémie; Ninove, Laetitia; Robert, Thomas",Clin Kidney J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603701/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ckj/sfab128,531
635745,Pseudoephedrine and its derivatives antagonize wild and mutated severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV-2 viruses through blocking virus invasion and antiinflammatory effect,2021,"Although 70% of the genome is transcribed to RNA in humans, only ∼2% of these transcripts are translated into proteins. The rest of the transcripts are defined as noncoding RNAs, including Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) and MicroRNAs (miRNAs) that mostly function post-transcriptionally to regulate the gene expression. The outbreak of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has caused a major public health concern across the globe. The SARS-CoV is the seventh coronavirus that is known to cause human disease. There are currently no promising antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. As of July 13, 2020, SARS-CoV has been infected more than 13 million cases in more than 213 countries, with an estimated mortality rate of ∼3%. Thus, it is of utmost important priority to develop novel therapies for COVID-19. It is not fully investigated whether noncoding RNAs regulate signaling pathways that SARS-CoV involved in. Hence, computational analysis of the noncoding RNA interactions and determining importance of key regulatory noncoding RNAs in antiviral defense mechanisms will likely be helpful in developing new drugs to attack SARS-CoV infection.. To elucidate this, we utilized bioinformatic approaches to find the interaction network of SARS-CoV/human proteins, miRNAs, and lncRNAs. We found TGF-beta signaling pathway as one of the potential interactive pathways. Furthermore, potential miRNAs/lncRNAs networks that the virus might engage during infection in human host cells have been shown. Altogether, TGF-beta signaling pathway as well as hub miRNAs, and LncRNAs involve during SARS-CoV pathogenesis can be considered as potential therapeutic targets.","Alahari, Suresh K.; Yousefi, Hassan; Poursheikhani, Arash; bahmanpour, Zahra; Vatanmakanian, Mousa; Taheri, Mohammad; Mashouri, Ladan",Biomed Pharmacother,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0753332220307411?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110548; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0753332220307411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475497/,531
637007,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Clinical Outcome and Prognostic Correlates,2003-09-11,"PURPOSE: Many institutionalized older people have died during the first wave of COVID-19. Other related consequences have not yet been described objectively. The aim of this study was to compare functional, cognitive, and nutritional status before and after the first wave among nursing home residents, in both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. METHODS: Older adults institutionalized in four nursing homes were assessed from May to June 2020, by a geriatric multidisciplinary team in collaboration with the nursing homes staff. Comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed including functional, cognitive, and nutritional variables before and after the first wave of the pandemic. Data from residents with positive results for microbiological testing for SARS-CoV-2 were compared with those who did not. RESULTS: 435 nursing home residents were included. The median age was 86.77 ± 8.5 years, 78.4% were women. 190 (43.9%) tested positive for coronavirus. Functional decline after the first wave was detected in 20.2% according to the Barthel Index and in 18.5% according to functional ambulation categories, p < 0.001. Cognitive status worsened by 22 and 25.9% according to the global deterioration scale (p < 0.001) and Lobo’s Mini-Examen Cognoscitivo (p 0.01), respectively. Onset of depressive symptoms was found in 48% (p < 0.001). The prevalence of malnutrition increased by 36.8 and 38.4% lost weight. When comparing the functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients no clinical or statistically significant differences were found except for the presence of prior malnutrition, higher in the COVID-19 group. CONCLUSION: We observed a significative functional, cognitive, and nutritional decline in institutionalized elderly after the first wave of COVID-19. These results may be caused by the lockdown itself, since no differences have been found between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. According to these results, interventions are necessary during social isolation or confinement to prevent systemic decline in the elderly.","Pérez-Rodríguez, Patricia; Díaz de Bustamante, Macarena; Aparicio Mollá, Salvador; Arenas, María Caridad; Jiménez-Armero, Susana; Lacosta Esclapez, Pilar; González-Espinoza, Liliana; Bermejo Boixareu, Cristina",Eur Geriatr Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34165775/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s41999-021-00524-1,531

AIM: To investigate several factors associated with complications and worse prognosis, such as defining the method of surgical drainage and treatment of a PTA which remains an area of controversy in the literature METHODS: The purpose of this retrospective study is to examine the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory findings of 601 adult patients and to discuss them along with their treatment plan. RESULTS: Pharyngalgia was the most common reported symptom, followed by trismus, odynophagia, fever, hot potato voice, malaise, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Sixty-eight patients developed complications. Streptococcus species were the most common pathogens. A statistically significant difference was found in days of hospitalization, WBC and CRP levels, age, and the pre-existing systemic diseases between patients with and without complications. A comparison of patients treated with intravenous and oral antibiotics revealed no statistically significant difference. CONCLUSION: Οver 10% of PTA cases may develop complications, the most common of which is extension into deep neck spaces. Comorbid conditions increase the risk of complications. Despite the wide range of treatment strategies, incision and drainage remain the cornerstone of surgical treatment. In patients with no comorbidities, intravenous antibiotics appear to have no advantage over oral antibiotics.","Sideris, Giorgos; Malamas, Vangelis; Tyrellis, George; Maragkoudakis, Pavlos; Delides, Alexander; Nikolopoulos, Thomas",Ir J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34617243/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11845-021-02796-9,531

To determine the performance of keyword-search algorithm in call reports to emergency medical communication centers (EMCC) to describe trends in symptoms during the COVID-19 crisis. We retrospectively retrieved all free text call reports from the EMCC of the Gironde department (SAMU 33), France, between 2005 and 2020 and classified them with a simple keyword-based algorithm to identify symptoms relevant to COVID-19. A validation was performed using a sample of manually coded call reports. The six selected symptoms were fever, cough, muscle soreness, dyspnea, ageusia and anosmia. We retrieved 38,08,243 call reports from January 2005 to October 2020. A total of 8539 reports were manually coded for validation and Cohen’s kappa statistics ranged from 75 (keyword anosmia) to 59% (keyword dyspnea). There was an unprecedented peak in the number of daily calls mentioning fever, cough, muscle soreness, anosmia, ageusia, and dyspnea during the COVID-19 epidemic, compared to the past 15 years. Calls mentioning cough, fever and muscle soreness began to increase from February 21, 2020. The number of daily calls reporting cough reached 208 on March 3, 2020, a level higher than any in the previous 15 years, and peaked on March 15, 2020, 2 days before lockdown. Calls referring to dyspnea, anosmia and ageusia peaked 12 days later and were concomitant with the daily number of emergency room admissions. Trends in symptoms cited in calls to EMCC during the COVID-19 crisis provide insights into the natural history of COVID-19. The content of calls to EMCC is an efficient epidemiological surveillance data source and should be integrated into the national surveillance system.","Cédric, Gil-Jardiné; Gabrielle, Chenais; Catherine, Pradeau; Eric, Tentillier; Phillipe, Revel; Xavier, Combes; Michel, Galinski; Eric, Tellier; Emmanuel, Lagarde",Intern Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34324146/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02818-5,531

OBJECTIVE: To identify predictors of willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 in five cities with varying COVID-19 incidence in the US, UK, and Australia. DESIGN: Online, cross-sectional survey of adults from Dynata’s research panel in July-September 2020 PARTICIPANTS, SETTING: Adults aged 18 and over in Sydney, Melbourne, London, New York City, or Phoenix MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine; reason for vaccine intention STATISTICAL METHODS: To identify predictors of intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, we used Poisson regression with robust error estimation to produce prevalence ratios. RESULTS: The proportion willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine was 70% in London, 71% NYC, 72% in Sydney, 76% in Phoenix, and 78% in Melbourne. Age was the only sociodemographic characteristic that predicted willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in all five cities. In Sydney and Melbourne, participants with high confidence in their current government had greater willingness to receive the vaccine (PR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.07-1.44 and PR = 1.38; 95% CI = 1.74-1.62), while participants with high confidence in their current government in NYC and Phoenix were less likely to be willing to receive the vaccine (PR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.72 - 0.85 and PR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.76-0.96). LIMITATIONS: Consumer panels can be subject to bias and may not be representative of the general population CONCLUSIONS: Success for COVID-19 vaccination programs requires high levels of vaccine acceptance. Our data suggests more than 25% of adults may not be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, but many of them were not explicitly anti-vaccination and thus may become more willing to vaccinate over time. Among the three countries surveyed, there appears to be cultural differences, political influences, and differing experiences with COVID-19 that may affect willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.","Trent, Mallory; Seale, Holly; Ahmad Chughtai, Abrar; Salmon, Daniel; Raina MacIntyre, C.",Vaccine,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21007982?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X21007982; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.06.048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34218963/,531

A large body of evidence links eveningness to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). However, to date, evidence quantifying this association is limited. The current meta-analysis included 43 effect sizes from a total 27,996 participants. Using a random-effects model it was demonstrated that eveningness is associated with a small effect size (Fisher’s Z = − 2.4, 95% CI [− 0.27. − 0.21], p < 0.001). Substantial heterogeneity between studies was observed, with meta-regression analyses demonstrating a significant effect of mean age on the association between diurnal preference and depression. There was also evidence of potential publication bias as assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger’s test. The association between diurnal preference and depression is small in magnitude and heterogenous.

Recently, healthcare teams at COVID-19 epicenters have been inundated with critically ill patients. Patients isolated for COVID-19 have had no contact with their family or loved ones and may have likely experienced death without closure. This situation highlights concerns about patients’ psychological and spiritual well-being with COVID-19 and their families, as they permanently part ways. While palliative care has advanced to adequately address these patients’ needs, the COVID-19 pandemic presents several barriers that force healthcare teams to deprioritize these essential aspects of patient care. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 gave us a glimpse of these challenges as these patients were also isolated in hospitals. Here, we discuss the importance of the biopsychosocial spiritual model in end-of-life care and its implications on patients dying with COVID-19. Furthermore, we outline an integrative approach to address the unique and holistic needs of critically ill patients dying with COVID-19. These include intentional and increased coordination with trained palliative care staff, early and frequent goals of care including discussion of end-of-life plans, broader use of technology to improve connectedness, and shared decision making with patients’ families.","Galbadage, Thushara; Peterson, Brent M.; Wang, David C.; Wang, Jeffrey S.; Gunasekera, Richard S.",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33281686/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.588623,531

Although there are already many surveys in the literature, there is a need to keep up with the rapidly growing number of publications on COVID-19-related applications of ML. This paper presents a review of recent reports on ML algorithms used in relation to COVID-19. We focus on the potential of ML for two main applications: diagnosis of COVID-19 and prediction of mortality risk and severity, using readily available clinical and laboratory data. Aspects related to algorithm types, training data sets, and feature selection are discussed. As we cover work published between January 2020 and January 2021, a few key points have come to light. The bulk of the machine learning algorithms used in these two applications are supervised learning algorithms. The established models are yet to be used in real-world implementations, and much of the associated research is experimental. The diagnostic and prognostic features discovered by ML models are consistent with results presented in the medical literature.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network repository. Machine learning algorithms were applied to evaluate for vaccine allergy documentation, and Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical codes were used for PEG allergy or allergy to common injectable medications containing PEG (CIMCP). RESULTS: The prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine allergy in Canada was 0.037% (395/1,055,677) and of PEG allergy was 0.0009% (10/1,055,677). In total, 0.01% of patients had a documented allergy to either PEG or CIMCP (135/1,055,677). None of the patients with PEG allergy had a documented allergy to a CIMCP.

METHODS: A method for the determination of HCQ in human blood using LC-HRMS was developed, validated, and applied for the determination of HCQ levels in WB, serum, and plasma from 26 SLE patients. The reproducibility of the method, in the three matrices, was evaluated using quality control samples and repeated preparations and measurements of patient samples. The performance of the developed method for HCQ measurement in serum was further evaluated by comparison with two previously reported extraction methods. RESULTS: The performance of the presented method demonstrated high accuracy and precision. A large range of HCQ concentrations was observed for the SLE patients in all three matrices (WB, serum, and plasma). The mean levels in WB were approximately two-fold the levels in serum and plasma (813 ng/mL compared to 436 ng/mL and 362 ng/mL, respectively). Spiked quality controls showed high reproducibility for all matrices (coefficient of variation, CV, approx. 5%), whereas in patient samples, equally high-precision was only found using WB as the matrix (CV 3%). The CV for serum and plasma was 14% and 39%, respectively. Two alternative methods applied to serum samples did not demonstrate improved precision. CONCLUSIONS: A LC-HRMS method for the measurement of HCQ in human blood was developed and validated. Whole blood was found to be the superior sample matrix in terms of sample reproducibility. Thus, whole blood samples should be used for HCQ analysis when patients are monitored for HCQ treatment effects. The assay is in clinical use to monitor levels of HCQ in patients.","Carlsson, Henrik; Hjorton, Karin; Abujrais, Sandy; Rönnblom, Lars; Åkerfeldt, Torbjörn; Kultima, Kim",Arthritis Res Ther,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13075-020-02211-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32475347/,531

We aimed to review the public health interventions used during the COVID-19 outbreak and describe the impact on seasonal influenza activity in Korea. METHODS: National response strategies and public health interventions, along with daily COVID-19 confirmed cases in Korea were reviewed during the pandemic. National influenza surveillance data were compared between seven sequential seasons. Characteristics of each season, including the rate of influenza-like illness (ILI), duration of epidemic, date of termination of epidemic, distribution of influenza virus strain and hospitalization were analyzed. RESULTS: After various public health interventions including enforced public education on hand hygiene, cough etiquette and staying at home with respiratory symptoms, universal mask use in public places, refrain from non-essential social activities and school closure, the duration of the influenza epidemic in 2019/2020 decreased by 6-12 weeks and the influenza activity peak rated 49.8 ILI/1,000 visits compared to 71.9-86.2 ILI/1,000 visits of previous seasons. During the period of enforced social distancing from week 9 to 17 of 2020, influenza hospitalization cases were 11.9-26.9-fold lower compared with previous seasons. During the 2019/2020 season, influenza B accounted for only 4%, in contrast with previous seasons in which influenza B accounted for 26.6% to 54.9% of all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to activate high level national response not only led to a decrease in COVID-19, but also substantial decrease in seasonal influenza activity. Interventions applied to control COVID-19 may serve as useful strategies for prevention and control of influenza in upcoming seasons.","Lee, Hyunju; Lee, Heeyoung; Song, Kyoung-Ho; Kim, Eu Suk; Park, Jeong Su; Jung, Jongtak; Ahn, Soyeon; Jeong, Eun Kyeong; Park, Hyekyung; Kim, Hong Bin",Clin Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa672; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32472687/,531

This information is necessary for government and philanthropic agencies to tailor mental health supports, services, and resources for veterans in the peri- and post-pandemic periods. The objective of this study was to compare mental health symptoms between Canadian Armed Forces (CAFs) veterans and the general Canadian older adult population in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study of older adults in the national Canadian COVID-19 Coping Study. Individuals aged 55 years and older were eligible. A convenience sample of older adults was recruited through a web-based survey administered between May 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Canadian Armed Force military service history status (yes/no) was ascertained. The eight-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the five-item Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the three-item Loneliness Scale were used to measure mental health symptoms. Multivariable logistic regression compared the odds of screening positive for depression, anxiety, and loneliness between veterans and non-veterans. RESULTS: Of 1,541 respondents who answered the final question (87% survey completeness rate), 210 were veterans. Forty percent of veterans met criteria for at least one of the mental health diagnoses compared to 46% of non-veterans (P = .12). The odds of reporting elevated symptoms of depression, anxiety, and loneliness were similar for veteran and non-veteran respondents after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSION: Veterans’ report of mental health symptoms was similar to the general population Spring 2020 of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although veterans’ military training may better prepare them to adapt in the face of a pandemic, additional research is needed to understand the longitudinal impacts on physical and mental health.","Mahar, Alyson L; Rindlisbacher, Christina R; Edgelow, Megan; Siddhpuria, Shailee; Hallet, Julie; Rochon, Paula A; Cramm, Heidi",Mil Med,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904931/,531
649027,Secretion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in urine,2020-07-20,"In January 2020, a cluster of pneumonia cases was reported in Wuhan, China. A global pandemic followed. The infection, called novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Common symptoms of COVID-19 illness included fever, cough, and abnormal findings on chest computed tomography. Nucleic acid testing, in the form of real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, is essential for diagnosing COVID-19 from respiratory samples from infected patients. Still, many questions remain surrounding the optimization of pre-analytical factors, such as specimen selection, collection, and transport. This review summarizes the current publications that describe viral density and specimen suitability for molecular detection methods. Of note, many of the reports represent studies with small sample sizes, and information may change as more is learned about specimen types as the pandemic continues.","Martinez, Raquel M.",Clin Microbiol Newsl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196439920300477; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinmicnews.2020.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834295/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196439920300477,531

OBJECTIVES: An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL). STUDY DESIGN: MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) encapsulating specific RNA sequences of MERS-CoV were prepared as positive specimens. The assessment panel, which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of VLPs, was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions for molecular detection. RESULTS: Among the received data sets, three employed an in-house-developed real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and the others applied various commercial rRT-PCR kits. Overall, the majority of laboratories (46/56, 82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection, but three laboratories (5.4%) still had room for improvement. Consequently, all negative samples were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. The false-negative rate was 3.1%, and most of the false-negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration, indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak-positive specimens. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV. Moreover, EQA is indispensable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories.","Zhang, Lei; Hao, Mingju; Zhang, Kuo; Zhang, Rui; Lin, Guigao; Jia, Tingting; Zhang, Dong; Chang, Le; Xie, Jiehong; Li, Jinming",J Clin Virol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcv.2015.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26702992/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653215007830; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653215007830,531
649887,Isolation and characterization of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in Turkey,2020-09-16,"BACKGROUND: In pandemics such as COVID-19, shortages of personal protective equipment are common. One solution may be to decontaminate equipment such as facemasks for reuse. AIM: To collect and synthesize existing information on decontamination of N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using microwave and heat-based treatments, with special attention to impact on mask function (aerosol penetration, airflow resistance), fit, and physical traits. METHODS: A systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020177036) of literature available from Medline, Embase, Global Health, and other sources was conducted. Records were screened independently by two reviewers, and data was extracted from studies that reported on effects of microwave- or heat-based decontamination on N95 FFR performance, fit, physical traits, and/or reductions in microbial load. FINDINGS: Thirteen studies were included that used dry/moist microwave irradiation, heat, or autoclaving. All treatment types reduced pathogen load by a log10 reduction factor of at least three when applied for sufficient duration (>30s microwave, >60 min dry heat), with most studies assessing viral pathogens. Mask function (aerosol penetration <5% and airflow resistance <25mmH(2)O) was preserved after all treatments except autoclaving. Fit was maintained for most N95 models, though all treatment types caused observable physical damage to at least one model. CONCLUSIONS: Microwave irradiation and heat may be safe and effective viral decontamination options for N95 FFR reuse during critical shortages. The evidence does not support autoclaving or high-heat (>90(o)C) approaches. Physical degradation may be an issue for certain mask models, and more real-world evidence on fit is needed.","Gertsman, Shira; Agarwal, Anirudh; O’Hearn, Katharine; Webster, Richard; Tsampalieros, Anne; Barrowman, Nick; Sampson, Margaret; Sikora, Lindsey; Staykov, Emiliyan; Ng, Rhiannon; Gibson, Jess; Dinh, Tri; Agyei, Kwame; Chamberlain, Graham; McNally, James Dayre",J Hosp Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2020.08.016; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0195670120304035; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670120304035?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32841704/,531

The challenges associated with existing therapeutics in COVID-19 include lack of in vivo stability, efficacy, and safety. Nanoparticles (NPs) can offer a handful of tools to tackle these problems by enabling efficacious and safe delivery of both virus- and host-directed therapeutics. Furthermore, they can enable maximized clinical outcome while eliminating the chance of resistance to therapy by tissue-targeting and concomitant delivery of multiple therapeutics. The promising application of NPs as vaccine platforms is reflected by the major advances in developing novel COVID-19 vaccines. Two of the most critical COVID-19 vaccines are mRNA-based vaccines delivered via NPs, making them the first FDA-approved mRNA vaccines. Besides, NPs have been deployed as simple, rapid, and precise tools for point of care disease diagnosis. Not enough said NPs can also be exploited in novel ways to expedite the drug discovery process.

Although the genome of SARS-CoV-2 acquires mutations at a slower rate compared with other RNA viruses, evolutionary pressures derived from the widespread circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population have progressively favored the global emergence, though natural selection, of several variants of concern that carry multiple non-synonymous mutations in the spike glycoprotein. These are often placed in key sites within major antibody epitopes and may therefore confer resistance to neutralizing antibodies, leading to partial immune escape, or otherwise compensate infectivity deficits associated with other non-synonymous substitutions. As previously shown by other authors, several emerging variants carry recurrent deletion regions (RDRs) that display a partial overlap with antibody epitopes located in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD). Comparatively, very little attention has been directed towards spike insertion mutations. This manuscript describes a single recurrent insertion region (RIR1) in the N-terminal domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, characterized by at least 25 independent acquisitions of 2-8 additional codons between Arg214 and Asp215 in different viral lineages. Even though RIR1 is unlikely to confer antibody escape, its association with two distinct formerly widespread lineages (A.2.5 and B.1.214.2) and with known VOCs and VOIs warrants further investigation concerning its effects on spike structure and viral infectivity.","Gerdol, Marco; Dishnica, Klevia; Giorgetti, Alejandro",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.17.440288,531

Arts and psychomotor therapists said that they had almost no experience with working online, but despite the fact that they felt incapable, they were positive towards it. Method: This qualitative action research was aimed at how arts and psychomotor therapists can become more skilled in offering online arts and psychomotor therapy and how they can methodically enlist the VR Health Experience (a virtual arts and psychomotor therapy space) in therapy. It is envisaged that the arts and psychomotor therapist could be telepresent in order to offer arts and psychomotor therapy remotely. In online training that made use of the Lean Startup Method, participants (n = 5) integrated their working knowledge with the VR Health Experience. The interventions were immediately tested by the participants and in practice. Participants were interviewed retrospectively and their experiences were thematically analysed. Results: The VR Health Experience came forward as an innovative addition to the usual arts and psychomotor therapy. Often, clients were encouraged to play and experiment, and the VR world offered several options. The VR Health Experience lowered the threshold, expanded the training areas and held a great attraction for play. Discussion: This project offered an innovative quality boost for arts and psychomotor therapy. Arts and psychomotor therapy have proven to be possible remotely via telepresence of the therapist. The therapist is present together with the client in the VR Health Experience, the virtual arts and psychomotor therapy space, where connectedness can be felt and new experiences can be gained.

FINDINGS: In this study, an optimized new, simple, low cost method for sampling of airborne viruses using Low Melting Agarose (LMA) plates and a conventional microbial air sampling device has been developed. The use of LMA plates permits the direct nucleic acids extraction of the captured viruses without the need of any preliminary elution step. Molecular detection and quantification of airborne viruses is performed using real-time quantitative (RT-)PCR (Q(RT-)PCR) technique. The method has been tested using Adenoviruses (AdVs) and Noroviruses (NoVs) GII, as representative DNA and RNA viruses, respectively. Moreover, the method has been tested successfully in outdoor experiments, by detecting and quantifying human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in the airborne environment of a wastewater treatment plant. CONCLUSIONS: The great advantage of LMA is that nucleic acids extraction is performed directly on the LMA plates, while the eluted nucleic acids are totally free of inhibitory substances.

658030,Zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2: a review and implications for Africa,2021-01-14,"BACKGROUND: Spatio-temporal trends in mosquito-borne diseases are driven by the locations and seasonality of larval habitat. One method of disease control is to decrease the mosquito population by modifying larval habitat, known as larval source management (LSM). In malaria control, LSM is currently considered impractical in rural areas due to perceived difficulties in identifying target areas. High resolution drone mapping is being considered as a practical solution to address this barrier. In this paper, the authors’ experiences of drone-led larval habitat identification in Malawi were used to assess the feasibility of this approach. METHODS: Drone mapping and larval surveys were conducted in Kasungu district, Malawi between 2018 and 2020. Water bodies and aquatic vegetation were identified in the imagery using manual methods and geographical object-based image analysis (GeoOBIA) and the performances of the classifications were compared. Further, observations were documented on the practical aspects of capturing drone imagery for informing malaria control including cost, time, computing, and skills requirements. Larval sampling sites were characterized by biotic factors visible in drone imagery and generalized linear mixed models were used to determine their association with larval presence. RESULTS: Imagery covering an area of 8.9 km(2) across eight sites was captured. Larval habitat characteristics were successfully identified using GeoOBIA on images captured by a standard camera (median accuracy = 98%) with no notable improvement observed after incorporating data from a near-infrared sensor. This approach however required greater processing time and technical skills compared to manual identification. Larval samples captured from 326 sites confirmed that drone-captured characteristics, including aquatic vegetation presence and type, were significantly associated with larval presence. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the potential for drone-acquired imagery to support mosquito larval habitat identification in rural, malaria-endemic areas, although technical challenges were identified which may hinder the scale up of this approach. Potential solutions have however been identified, including strengthening linkages with the flourishing drone industry in countries such as Malawi. Further consultations are therefore needed between experts in the fields of drones, image analysis and vector control are needed to develop more detailed guidance on how this technology can be most effectively exploited in malaria control.

659477,Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the Nervous System: Implications of COVID-19 in Neurodegeneration,2020-11-16,"Nonsense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway used by cells to control the quality mRNAs and to fine-tune transcript abundance. NMD plays an important role in cell cycle regulation, cell viability, DNA damage response, while also serving as a barrier to virus infection. Disturbance of this control mechanism caused by genetic mutations or dys-regulation of the NMD pathway can lead to pathologies, including neurological disorders, immune diseases and cancers. The role of NMD in cancer development is complex, acting as both a promoter and a barrier to tumour progression. Cancer cells can exploit NMD for the downregulation of key tumour suppressor genes, or tumours adjust NMD activity to adapt to an aggressive immune microenvironment. The latter case might provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention as NMD inhibition has been shown to lead to the production of neoantigens that stimulate an immune system attack on tumours. For this reason, understanding the biology and co-option pathways of NMD is important for the development of novel therapeutic agents. Inhibitors, whose design can make use of the many structures available for NMD study, will play a crucial role in characterizing and providing diverse therapeutic options for this pathway in cancer and other diseases.","Pawlicka, Kamila; Kalathiya, Umesh; Alfaro, Javier",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12030765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32213869/,531

Alcohol-based hand rub contains either ethanol or isopropanol or both. COVID-19 pandemic has led to wide scale usage of sanitizers. Patients with alcohol use disorders, on disulfiram, might experience disulfiram ethanol like reactions with alcohol-based sanitizers. METHODS: We telephonically contacted 339 patients, prescribed disulfiram between January 2014 and March 2020. The assessment pertained to the last 3 months (i.e. third week of March to third week of June 2020). RESULT: The sample consisted of middle-aged men with a mean 16 years of alcohol dependence. Among the 82 (24%) patients adherent to disulfiram, 42 (12.3%) were using alcohol-based hand rubs. Out of these, a total of eight patients (19%; 95% CI 9–33) had features suggestive of DER; four of whom also had features indicative of IT. Five patients (62.5%) had mild and self-limiting symptoms. Severe systemic reactions were experienced by three (37.5%). Severe reactions were observed with exposure to sanitizers in greater amounts, on moist skin or through inhalation. CONCLUSION: Patients on disulfiram should be advised to use alternate methods of hand hygiene.","Ghosh, Abhishek; Mahintamani, Tathagata; Balhara, Y P S; Roub, Fazl E; Basu, Debashish; BN, Subodh; Mattoo, S K; Mishra, Eepsita; Sharma, Babita",Alcohol Alcohol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150930/; https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/agaa096,531
660922,Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus‐2 natural animal reservoirs and experimental models: systematic review,2020-11-18,"Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and has since become a global pandemic. Singapore was one of the first countries outside of China to be affected and reported its first case in January 2020. Strategies that were deployed successfully during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome have had to evolve to contain this novel coronavirus. Like the rest of the health care services in Singapore, the practice of ophthalmology has also had to adapt to this rapidly changing crisis. This article discusses the measures put in place by the 3 largest ophthalmology centers in Singapore's public sector in response to COVID-19, and the challenges of providing eye care in the face of stringent infection control directives, staff redeployments and “social distancing.” The recently imposed “circuit breaker,” effectively a partial lockdown of the country, has further limited our work to only the most essential of services. Our staff are also increasingly part of frontline efforts in the screening and care of patients with COVID-19. However, this crisis has also been an opportunity to push ahead with innovative practices and given momentum to the use of teleophthalmology and other digital technologies. Amidst this uncertainty, our centers are already planning for how ophthalmology in Singapore will be practiced in this next stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, and beyond.","Khor, Wei Boon; Yip, Leonard; Zhao, Paul; Foo, Valencia H.X.; Lim, Louis; Ting, Daniel S.W.; Loon, Seng Chee; Wong, Edmund; Yong, Vernon; Tan, Clement; Wong, Tien Yin; Wong, Hon Tym",Asia Pac J Ophthalmol (Phila),https://doi.org/10.1097/apo.0000000000000306; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32657805/,531
661513,"Defining Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Placentitis: A Report of 7 Cases with Confirmatory In Situ Hybridization, Distinct Histomorphologic Features, and Evidence of Complement Deposition.",2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a heavy burden on health care systems and governments. Health literacy (HL) and eHealth literacy (as measured by the eHealth Literacy Scale [eHEALS]) are recognized as strategic public health elements but they have been underestimated during the pandemic. HL, eHEALS score, practices, lifestyles, and the health status of health care workers (HCWs) play crucial roles in containing the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the eHEALS and examine associations of HL and eHEALS scores with adherence to infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures, lifestyle changes, and suspected COVID-19 symptoms among HCWs during lockdown. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of 5209 HCWs from 15 hospitals and health centers across Vietnam from April 6 to April 19, 2020. Participants answered questions related to sociodemographics, HL, eHEALS, adherence to IPC procedures, behavior changes in eating, smoking, drinking, and physical activity, and suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Principal component analysis, correlation analysis, and bivariate and multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used to validate the eHEALS and examine associations. RESULTS: The eHEALS had a satisfactory construct validity with 8 items highly loaded on one component, with factor loadings ranked from 0.78 to 0.92 explaining 76.34% of variance; satisfactory criterion validity as correlated with HL (ρ=0.42); satisfactory convergent validity with high item-scale correlations (ρ=0.80-0.84); and high internal consistency (Cronbach α=.95). HL and eHEALS scores were significantly higher in men (unstandardized coefficient [B]=1.01, 95% CI 0.57-1.45, P<.001; B=0.72, 95% CI 0.43-1.00, P<.001), those with a better ability to pay for medication (B=1.65, 95% CI 1.25-2.05, P<.001; B=0.60, 95% CI 0.34-0.86, P<.001), doctors (B=1.29, 95% CI 0.73-1.84, P<.001; B 0.56, 95% CI 0.20-0.93, P=.003), and those with epidemic containment experience (B=1.96, 95% CI 1.56-2.37, P<.001; B=0.64, 95% CI 0.38-0.91, P<.001), as compared to their counterparts, respectively. HCWs with higher HL or eHEALS scores had better adherence to IPC procedures (B=0.13, 95% CI 0.10-0.15, P<.001; B=0.22, 95% CI 0.19-0.26, P<.001), had a higher likelihood of healthy eating (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, P=.001; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02-1.07, P=.002), were more physically active (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.03, P<.001; OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05, P<.001), and had a lower likelihood of suspected COVID-19 symptoms (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, P<.001; OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.98, P<.001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The eHEALS is a valid and reliable survey tool. Gender, ability to pay for medication, profession, and epidemic containment experience were independent predictors of HL and eHEALS scores. HCWs with higher HL or eHEALS scores had better adherence to IPC procedures, healthier lifestyles, and a lower likelihood of suspected COVID-19 symptoms. Efforts to improve HCWs’ HL and eHEALS scores can help to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and minimize its consequences.","Do, Binh N; Tran, Tien V; Phan, Dung T; Nguyen, Hoang C; Nguyen, Thao T P; Nguyen, Huu C; Ha, Tung H; Dao, Hung K; Trinh, Manh V; Do, Thinh V; Nguyen, Hung Q; Vo, Tam T; Nguyen, Nhan P T; Tran, Cuong Q; Tran, Khanh V; Duong, Trang T; Pham, Hai X; Nguyen, Lam V; Nguyen, Kien T; Chang, Peter W S; Duong, Tuyen Van",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/22894; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33122164/,531

In general, the available IH/OEHS tools were designed to control hazards originating in the workplace; however, attempts to tailor them specifically to the control of infectious disease outbreaks have been limited. This analysis evaluated the IH decision-making framework (Anticipate, Recognize, Evaluate, Control, and Confirm (“ARECC”)) as it relates to biological hazards, in general, and to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), specifically. Available IH/OEHS risk assessment and risk management tools (e.g. control banding and the hierarchy of controls) are important components of the ARECC framework. These conceptual models, however, were primarily developed for controlling chemical hazards and must be adapted to the unique characteristics of highly infectious and virulent pathogens, such as SARS-CoV-2. This assessment provides an overview of the key considerations for developing occupational infection control plans, selecting the best available controls, and applying other emerging tools (e.g. quantitative microbial risk assessment), with the ultimate goal of facilitating risk management decisions during the current global pandemic.","Zisook, Rachel E; Monnot, Andrew; Parker, Justine; Gaffney, Shannon; Dotson, Scott; Unice, Kenneth",Toxicol Ind Health,https://doi.org/10.1177/0748233720967522; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085585/,531

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the determinants of quality of life (QOL) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Impacts of lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 100 patients with PD and their caregivers/spouses were assessed. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to assess anxiety and depression. The physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores of the short form (SF)-8 were used to evaluate health-related QOL. RESULTS: Regarding health-related QOL, physical function, role physical, general health, vitality and the PCS score were significantly worse in PD patients than in caregivers. Worsening of PD-related symptoms, increased stress, and decreased physical activity were observed in 29.0%, 37.0% and 44.0% of PD patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (16.0%) experienced problems with hospital access, but none reported medication shortages. Strong concerns about COVID-19 were reported by 47.0% of caregivers and 50.0% of PD patients. In PD patients, increased gait disturbance and rigidity, disease severity, smoking, the levodopa equivalent dose and decreased body weight predicted a worse PCS score; anxiety, depression, female sex, stress and long disease duration predicted a worse MCS score. In caregivers, age and smoking contributed to a worse PCS score; depression, stress and worsening patient mood contributed to a worse MCS score. CONCLUSION: We report the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related QOL and its determinants in PD patients and their caregivers.","Suzuki, Keisuke; Numao, Ayaka; Komagamine, Tomoko; Haruyama, Yasuo; Kawasaki, Akiko; Funakoshi, Kei; Fujita, Hiroaki; Suzuki, Shiho; Okamura, Madoka; Shiina, Tomohiko; Hirata, Koichi",J Parkinsons Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780375/; https://doi.org/10.3233/jpd-212560,531

Some pediatric patients develop a severe complication associated with high mortality, the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). In both scenarios, there are reports of neurological manifestations. This article aims to review the cases of pediatric patients with severe neurological issues and a coexisting positive SARS-CoV-2 test. A literature search was performed between March 2020 and May 2021. The results included the data from 41 studies, with 159 children with severe neurological manifestations, within an age range from 24 h to 17 years. The neurological disorders included 38 cases with stroke, 32 with encephalitis, 22 with encephalopathy, and 10 with Guillain–Barre syndrome. Sixty-five out of 159 cases with severe neurological manifestations were diagnosed with MIS-C. Direct neuroinvasion and the exaggerated immune response in some patients seem to be the most critical factors triggering these manifestations. Further research in the ongoing pandemic is needed to elucidate the precise mechanism.","O’Loughlin, Lauren; Alvarez Toledo, Nilo; Budrie, Leon; Waechter, Randall; Rayner, Joanna",Neurol Int,https://doi.org/10.3390/neurolint13030041; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34449704/,531

In our study, we aimed to describe the clinical characteristics of the first 100 hospitalized patients of confirmed COVID-19 in a developing country. Materials and methods The study included all the admitted patients (n = 100) having COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive, and evaluated clinical profiles and characteristics of the patients linking to disease severity. Results Out of the 100 patients, 67 were in the ward, 33 were in ICU, 78 of them recovered, while 22 deaths reported. The mean age was 52.58 ± 15.68, with most frequent comorbidities are diabetes and hypertension while frequent symptoms are fever and dry cough. Bilateral lower zone patchy infiltrates are frequent chest radiographic findings. Amongst the patients admitted in ICU, there were significant differences in the total leukocyte count (P = 0.001), neutrophils and lymphocytes (P =< 0.001), monocytes (P = 0.027), urea (P =< 0.001), creatinine (P = 0.002), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) increasing with disease severity, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and lymphocyte-to-C‐reactive protein ratio (LCR) decreasing with mortalities. Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) followed by aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are frequent hepatic derangements, while C-reactive protein (CRP) levels predicting ICU admission with area under the curve (AUC): 0.806, positive predictive value (PPV): 85.1% and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) predicting mortality with AUC: 0.877, PPV: 97.3%, while NLR (AUC: 0.806, PPV: 95.8%) for mortality and neutrophils (AUC: 0.773, PPV: 87.5%) for ICU patients.

669335,Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome: Lessons from Singapore,2003-10-11,"Background: Brain death/death by neurologic criteria (BD/DNC) guidelines are routinely analyzed, compared and updated in the majority of countries and are later implemented as national criteria. At the same time, extensive works have been conducted in order to unify clinical procedures and to validate and implement new technologies into a panel of ancillary tests. Recently evaluated computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion (CTA/CTP) seem to be superior to traditionally used digital subtraction angiography (DSA), transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral perfusion scintigraphy for diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest (CCA). In this narrative review, we would like to demonstrate scientific evidence supporting the implementation of CTA/CTP in Polish guidelines for BD/DNC diagnosis. Research and implementation process: In the first of our base studies concerning the potential usefulness of CTA/CTP for the confirmation of CCA during BD/DNC diagnosis procedures, we showed a sensitivity of 96.3% of CTA in a group of 82 patients. CTA was validated against DSA in this report. In the second study, CTA showed a sensitivity of 86% and CTP showed a sensitivity of 100% in a group of 50 patients. In this study, CTA and CTP were validated against clinical diagnosis of BD/DNC supported by TCD. Additionally, we propose our CCA criteria for CTP test, which are based on ascertainment of cerebral blood flow (CBF) < 10 mL/100 g/min and cerebral blood volume < 1 mL/100 g in regions of interest (ROIs) localized in all brain regions. Based on our research results, CTA/CTP methods were implemented in Polish BD/DNC criteria. To our knowledge, CTP was implemented for the first time in national guidelines. Conclusions: CTA and CTP-derived CTA might be in future the tests of choice for CCA diagnosis, proper and/or Doppler pretest might significantly increase sensitivity of CTA in CCA diagnosis procedures. Whole brain CTP might be decisive in some cases of inconclusive CTA. Implementation of CTA/CTP in the Polish BD/DNC diagnosis guidelines does not show any major obstacles. We believe that in next edition of “The World Brain Death Project” CTA and CTP will be recommended as ancillary tests of choice for CCA confirmation during BD/DNC diagnosis procedures.","Bohatyrewicz, Romuald; Pastuszka, Joanna; Walas, Wojciech; Chamier-Cieminska, Katarzyna; Poncyljusz, Wojciech; Dabrowski, Wojciech; Wojczal, Joanna; Luchowski, Piotr; Guzinski, Maciej; Jurkiewicz, Elzbieta; Bekiesinska-Figatowska, Monika; Owczuk, Radoslaw; Walecki, Jerzy; Rowinski, Olgierd; Zukowski, Maciej; Kusza, Krzysztof; Piechota, Mariusz; Piotrowski, Andrzej; Migdal, Marek; Zielinska, Marzena; Sawicki, Marcin",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34575352/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10184237,531

While mental health became a major concern during the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact on the migrants' mental health has still been neglected. The purpose of this study was to examine the COVID-19 outbreak's impact on the mental health of immigrants in South Korea. METHODS A total number of 386 immigrants in South Korea participated in this quantitative cross-sectional study. The standardized e-questionnaire, including the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, was used to measure the anxiety level. Logistic regression analysis was performed to find out the determinants of anxiety disorders among immigrants. RESULTS The prevalence of severe anxiety among immigrants was found to be 47.2%. Female immigrants (28.6%) had a lower anxiety disorder than males (71.4%). Immigrants who were married, living alone, had a low income, had a history of health problems were suffered from moderate to severe anxiety. Immigrants who were unemployed (OR 2.302, 95% CI = 1.353-3.917) and lost their jobs due to the COVID-19 outbreak (OR 2.197, 95% CI = 1.312-3.678) have a higher anxiety disorder. Immigrants aged over 30 years were found to suffer from a high level of anxiety (OR 2.285, 95% CI = 1.184-4.410). Relief support from the government was significantly associated with anxiety disorder among immigrants (p < 0.01, OR = 3.151, 95% CI = 1.962-5.061). CONCLUSION With very limited studies on immigrants' mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, this paper provides scientific research evidence of the COVID-19 outbreak's impact on the mental health of migrants. Our study has consequences for implementing integrated psychological interventions and health promotion strategies for the well-being of immigrants' mental health.","Acharya, Shiva Raj; Moon, Deog Hwan; Chun, Jin-Ho; Shin, Yong Chul",International journal of psychiatry in medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34425688/; https://doi.org/10.1177/00912174211042695,531

Recalcati et al. expand their previously reported case series to include 32 patients with CLLs. In 21 of 32 cases, no nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) was tested for SARS‐CoV‐2. Two of 11 patients subjected to molecular testing were positive for SARS‐CoV‐2, but no serological test was performed to verify the seroconversion. Three patients tested positive for IgM and negative for IgG antibodies without any confirmation of infection through NPS.","Caselli, D.; Chironna, M.; Loconsole, D.; Aricò, M.",Br J Dermatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32974916/; https://doi.org/10.1111/bjd.19563,531

683539,A Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 detection method based on nasal and nasopharyngeal lavage fluid: A pilot feasibility study,2021-07-27,"Anethole (AN) is widely used as an odor cleaner in daily necessities, and can also be applied in the fields of food additives, drug synthesis, natural preservatives, and polymeric materials’ preparation. Considering environmental and economic benefits, the use of biomass raw materials with non-precious metal catalysts to prepare high-value fine chemicals is a very promising route. Here, we developed an acid-base bifunctional polymeric material (PhP-Hf (1:1.5)) composed of hafnium and phenylphosphonate in a molar ratio of 1:1.5 for catalytic conversion of biomass-derived 4′-methoxypropiophenone (4-MOPP) to AN via cascade Meerwein–Pondorf–Verley (MPV) reduction and dehydration reactions in a single pot. Compared with the traditional catalytic systems that use high-pressure hydrogen as a hydrogen donor, alcohol can be used as a safer and more convenient hydrogen source and solvent. Among the tested alcohols, 2-pentanol was found to be the best candidate in terms of pronounced selectivity. A high AN yield of 98.1% at 99.8% 4-MOPP conversion (TOF: 8.5 h(−1)) could be achieved over PhP-Hf (1:1.5) at 220 °C for 2 h. Further exploration of the reaction mechanism revealed that the acid and base sites of PhP-Hf (1:1.5) catalyst synergistically promote the MPV reduction step, while the Brønsted acid species significantly contribute to the subsequent dehydration step. In addition, the PhP-Hf polymeric nanocatalyst can be recycled at least five times, showing great potential in the catalytic conversion of biomass.","Liu, Yixuan; Chen, Dandan; Li, Mingrui; Zhang, Heng; Li, Hu",Polymers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451345/; https://doi.org/10.3390/polym13162808,531

We outline some of the challenges of remote working and how we are seeking to mitigate them, informed by the over‐riding principle that individual relationships and the experiences of the child, young person and family must remain the central concern. The importance of maintaining a mentalising stance in remote working is discussed. We argue that a mentalising relationship which generates epistemic trust is possible in remote working, but this will require particular thought and effort on the part of the therapist. In particular, it is suggested that mentalising processes can be supported in remote working through, in the absence of the more implicit communications that are possible in face‐to‐face work, more explicit communications about mental states.","Fonagy, Peter; Campbell, Chloe; Truscott, Alexandra; Fuggle, Peter",Child Adolesc Ment Health,https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32623792/,531
684611,Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody encephalitis following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in a pediatric patient,2021-02-01,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a major public health burden around the world. The novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has infected over one million people worldwide as of April, 2020, and has led to the deaths of nearly 300,000 people. No approved vaccines or treatments in the USA currently exist for COVID-19, so there is an urgent need to develop effective countermeasures. The IMPDH inhibitor merimepodib (MMPD) is an investigational antiviral drug that acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor of IMPDH. It has been demonstrated to suppress replication of a variety of emerging RNA viruses. We report here that MMPD suppresses SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro. After overnight pretreatment of Vero cells with 10 μM of MMPD, viral titers were reduced by 4 logs of magnitude, while pretreatment for 4 hours resulted in a 3-log drop. The effect is dose-dependent, and concentrations as low as 3.3 μM significantly reduced viral titers when the cells were pretreated prior to infection. The results of this study provide evidence that MMPD may be a viable treatment option for COVID-19.","Bukreyeva, Natalya; Mantlo, Emily K.; Sattler, Rachel A.; Huang, Cheng; Paessler, Slobodan; Zeldis, Jerry",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.07.028589,531
684872,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: The Laboratory Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome",2004-01-15,"BACKGROUND: In this study we evaluated the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among intubated patients with critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluated different case definitions of invasive aspergillosis. METHODS: Prospective, multicentre study on adult patients with microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 receiving mechanical ventilation. All included participants underwent screening protocol for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis with bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan and cultures performed on admission at 7 days and in case of clinical deterioration. Cases were classified as coronavirus associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) according to previous consensus definitions. The new definition was compared with putative invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (PIPA). RESULTS: A total of 108 patients were enrolled. Probable CAPA was diagnosed in 30 (27.7%) of patients after a median of 4 (2-8) days from intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significant higher 30-day mortality rate from ICU admission among patients with either CAPA (44% vs 19%, p= 0.002) or PIPA (74% vs 26%, p<0.001) when compared with patients not fulfilling criteria for aspergillosis. The association between CAPA [OR 3.53 (95%CI 1.29-9.67), P=0.014] or PIPA [OR 11.60 (95%CI 3.24-41.29) p<0.001] with 30-day mortality from ICU admission was confirmed even after adjustment for confounders with a logistic regression model. Among patients with CAPA receiving voriconazole treatment (13 patients, 43%) A trend toward lower mortality (46% vs 59% p=0.30) and reduction of galactomannan index in consecutive samples was observed.

687070,A Review on the Effectivity of the Current COVID-19 Drugs and Vaccines: Are They Really Working Against the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Variants?,2021-07-03,"Acute liver failure (ALF) refers to a state of severe hepatic injury that leads to altered coagulation and sensorium in the absence of pre-existing liver disease. ALF has different causes, but the clinical characteristics are strikingly similar. In clinical practice, however, inconsistency in the definition of ALF worldwide and confusion regarding the existence of pre-existing liver disease raise diagnostic dilemmas. ALF mortality rates used to be over 80% in the past; however, survival rates on medical treatment have significantly improved in recent years due to a greater understanding of pathophysiology and advances in critical care management. The survival rates in acetaminophen-associated ALF have become close to the post-transplant survival rates. Given that liver transplantation (LT) is an expensive treatment that involves a major surgical operation in critically ill patients and lifelong immunosuppression, it is very important to select accurate patients who may benefit from it. Still, emergency LT remains a lifesaving procedure for many ALF patients. However, there is a lack of consistency in current prognostic models that hampers the selection of transplant candidates in a timely and precise manner. The other problems associated with LT in ALF are the shortage of graft, development of contraindications on the waiting list, vaguely defined delisting criteria, time constraints for pre-transplant evaluation, ethical concerns, and comparatively poor post-transplant outcomes in ALF. Therefore, there is a desperate need to establish accurate prognostic models and explore the roles of evolving adjunctive and alternative therapies, such as liver support systems, plasma exchange, stem cells, auxiliary LT, and so on, to enhance transplant-free survival and to fill the void created by the graft shortage","Kumar, Ramesh; Anand, Utpal; Priyadarshi, Rajeev Nayan",World J Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164294/; https://doi.org/10.5500/wjt.v11.i6.187,531

This study seeks to develop and validate a data-driven personalized mortality risk calculator for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. De-identified data was obtained for 3,927 COVID-19 positive patients from six independent centers, comprising 33 different hospitals. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory variables were collected at hospital admission. The COVID-19 Mortality Risk (CMR) tool was developed using the XGBoost algorithm to predict mortality. Its discrimination performance was subsequently evaluated on three validation cohorts. The derivation cohort of 3,062 patients has an observed mortality rate of 26.84%. Increased age, decreased oxygen saturation (≤ 93%), elevated levels of C-reactive protein (≥ 130 mg/L), blood urea nitrogen (≥ 18 mg/dL), and blood creatinine (≥ 1.2 mg/dL) were identified as primary risk factors, validating clinical findings. The model obtains out-of-sample AUCs of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94) on the derivation cohort. In the validation cohorts, the model obtains AUCs of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88–0.95) on Seville patients, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.84–0.91) on Hellenic COVID-19 Study Group patients, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76–0.85) on Hartford Hospital patients. The CMR tool is available as an online application at covidanalytics.io/mortality_calculator and is currently in clinical use. The CMR model leverages machine learning to generate accurate mortality predictions using commonly available clinical features. This is the first risk score trained and validated on a cohort of COVID-19 patients from Europe and the United States.","Bertsimas, Dimitris; Lukin, Galit; Mingardi, Luca; Nohadani, Omid; Orfanoudaki, Agni; Stellato, Bartolomeo; Wiberg, Holly; Gonzalez-Garcia, Sara; Parra-Calderón, Carlos Luis; Robinson, Kenneth; Schneider, Michelle; Stein, Barry; Estirado, Alberto; a Beccara, Lia; Canino, Rosario; Dal Bello, Martina; Pezzetti, Federica; Pan, Angelo",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33296405/,531

Currently, however, there is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine. Considering the relatively high identity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) in 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV, it is urgent to assess the cross-reactivity of anti-SARS CoV antibodies with 2019-nCoV spike protein, which could have important implications for rapid development of vaccines and therapeutic antibodies against 2019-nCoV. Here, we report for the first time that a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, CR3022, could bind potently with 2019-nCoV RBD (KD of 6.3 nM). The epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the ACE2 binding site within 2019-nCoV RBD. These results suggest that CR3022 may have the potential to be developed as candidate therapeutics, alone or in combination with other neutralizing antibodies, for the prevention and treatment of 2019-nCoV infections. Interestingly, some of the most potent SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies (e.g. m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.","Tian, Xiaolong; Li, Cheng; Huang, Ailing; Xia, Shuai; Lu, Sicong; Shi, Zhengli; Lu, Lu; Jiang, Shibo; Yang, Zhenlin; Wu, Yanling; Ying, Tianlei",Emerg Microbes Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065055/; https://doi.org/10.1080/22221751.2020.1729069,531
