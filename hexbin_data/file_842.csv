Previous studies have shown that indica and japonica varieties varied in machine transplanting efficiency and optimal seeding density. In this study, a RIL population derived from '9311' and 'Nipponbare' were performed to explore the seedling traits variations and the genetic mechanism under three seeding densities. RESULTS The parents and RIL population exhibited similar trends as the seeding density increased, including seedling height and first leaf sheath length increases, shoot dry weight and root dry weight decreases. Among the 37 QTLs for six traits detected under the three seeding densities, 12 QTLs were detected in both three seeding densities. Five QTL hotspots identified clustered within genomic regions on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6 and 11. Specific QTLs such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1 were detected under low and high seeding densities, respectively. Detailed analysis the QTL regions identified under specific seeding densities revealed several candidate genes involved in phytohormones signals and abiotic stress responses. Whole-genome additive effects showed that '9311' contributed more loci enhancing trait performances than 'Nipponbare', indicating '9311' was more sensitive to the seeding density than 'Nipponbare'. The prevalence of negative epistasis effects indicated that the complementary two-locus homozygotes may not have marginal advantages over the means of the two parental genotypes. CONCLUSIONS Our results revealed the differences between indica rice and japonica rice seedling traits in response to seeding density. Several QTL hotspots involved in different traits and specific QTLs (such as qRDW1.1 and qFLSL5.1) in diverse seeding densities had been detected. Genome-wide additive and two-locus epistasis suggested a dynamic of the genetic control underlying different seeding densities. It was concluded that novel QTLs, additive and epistasis effects under specific seeding density would provide adequate information for rice seedling improvement during machine transplanting.","Zhu, Dan; Zhang, Yuping; Xiang, Jing; Wang, Yaliang; Zhu, Defeng; Zhang, Yikai; Chen, Huizhe",BMC genetics,842,31

However, overlap of A2 and P2 and the change in heart sound morphologies have complicated detection of the S2 splitting interval. This study introduces a novel S-transform amplitude ridge tracking (START) algorithm for estimating S2 splitting interval and investigates the relationship between S2 splitting and interventricular relaxation dyssynchrony (IRD). First, the START algorithm was validated in a simulated model of heart sound. It showed small errors (<5 ms) in estimating splitting intervals from 10 to 70 ms, with A2/P2 amplitude ratios from 0.2 to 5, and signal-to-noise ratios from 10 to 30 dB. Subsequently, the START algorithm was evaluated in a porcine model employing a wide range of paced RV-LV delays. IRD was quantified by the time difference between invasively measured LV and RV pressure downslopes. Between LV pre-excitation to RV pre-excitation, mean S2 splitting interval decreased from 47 ms to 23 ms (p < .001), accompanied by a decrease in mean IRD from 8 ms to -18 ms (p < .001). S2 splitting interval was significantly correlated with IRD in each experiment (p < .001). In conclusion, the START algorithm can accurately assess S2 splitting and may serve as a useful tool to assess interventricular dyssynchrony.","Luo, Hongxing; Westphal, Philip; Shahmohammadi, Mehrdad; Heckman, Luuk I B; Kuiper, Marion; Cornelussen, Richard N; Delhaas, Tammo; Prinzen, Frits W",Physiological reports,842,17

One example of such 'big data' is video data. Within the medical arena, more disciplines are using video as a diagnostic tool. Given the large amount of data stored within a video image, it is one of most time consuming types of data to process and analyse. Therefore, it is desirable to have automated techniques to extract, process and analyse data from video images. While many methods have been developed for extracting and processing video data, statistical modelling to analyse the outputted data has rarely been employed. We develop a method to take a video sequence of periodic nature, extract the RGB data and model the changes occurring across the contiguous images. We employ harmonic regression to model periodicity with autoregressive terms accounting for the error process associated with the time series nature of the data. A linear spline is included to account for movement between frames. We apply this model to video sequences of retinal vessel pulsation, which is the pulsatile component of blood flow. Slope and amplitude are calculated for the curves generated from the application of the harmonic model, providing clinical insight into the location of obstruction within the retinal vessels. The method can be applied to individual vessels, or to smaller segments such as 2 × 2 pixels which can then be interpreted easily as a heat map.","Betz-Stablein, Brigid; Hazelton, Martin L; Morgan, William H",Statistical methods in medical research,842,1

Selected literature review. Febrile seizures are the most common convulsive event in humans, occurring in 2-6% of the population. The aetiology is complex with strong evidence for a heterogeneous genetic predisposition interacting with fever of any cause, with certain viral infections having a greater effect. A large amount of literature has established that febrile seizures have no long-term consequences on cognition or behaviour. Unfortunately, about 40% of children with a first febrile seizure will have a recurrence. The strongest predictor of recurrence is age <14-16 months at the time of the first febrile seizure. Epilepsy follows febrile seizures in ∼3% cases, with the concepts of simple and complex febrile seizures providing relatively weak prediction. Very prolonged febrile seizures may lead to mesial temporal sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy although the degree of risk remains uncertain. Investigations beyond establishing the cause of the provoking fever are nearly always unnecessary. Treatment is mainly reassurance and there is some evidence that parents eventually ""come to grips"" with the fear that their children are dying during a febrile seizure. Antipyretic medications are remarkably ineffective to prevent recurrences. Daily and intermittent prophylactic medications are ineffective or have unacceptable side effects or risks. ""Rescue"" benzodiazepines may prevent prolonged recurrences for selected patients with a first prolonged febrile seizure although this has not been proven. Genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a complex autosomal dominant disorder usually caused by mutations in SCN1A (a voltage-gated sodium channel). One third of patients have febrile seizures only; two thirds have a variety of epilepsy syndromes, both focal and generalized. Febrile seizures may distress parents but rarely have any long-term consequences. Reassurance is the only treatment for the vast majority. Identifying patients with GEFS plus may lead to further investigations and counselling.","Camfield, Peter; Camfield, Carol",Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,842,1

The aim of this scoping review was to study how the concept of social participation is described in empirical research, and how it is associated with mental health outcomes. METHODS In total, 64 studies were identified through searches in PubMed, PsycInfo, and Sociological Abstracts. These studies describe various forms of social participation among refugees and asylum seekers, and 33 of them also addressed various forms of mental health outcomes. RESULTS The identified studies described forms and conditions of social participation-both in the host country and transnationally-that could be synthesized into three broad dimensions: (1) Regulatory frameworks, conditions and initiatives; (2) Established societal organizations and social structures; and (3) Community organized groups. Each of these consisted of several sub-domains. The identified dimensions of social participation were also associated with psychosocial well-being and decreased psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS There is a need for policies to enable and support the participation of refugees and asylum seekers in various dimensions of social structures in host societies. Social participation enhances resilience, re-establishes social lives, and acts as a protective factor against poor mental health outcomes.","Niemi, Maria; Manhica, Hélio; Gunnarsson, David; Ståhle, Göran; Larsson, Sofia; Saboonchi, Fredrik",International journal of environmental research and public health,842,7

While additive manufacturing has entered many metalcasting processes, including both expendable and permanent mold processes, this paper specifically examines the sand casting process. ExOne’s development of binder jetting technology over the last 20 years has allowed designers in the sand casting field to directly 3D print sand molds for metalcasting. Use of binder jet additively manufactured sand molds allows for quicker turnaround time for testing prototypes, new gating designs, and for producing one-off parts. Additive manufacturing of sand molds for metalcasting may implement any of the same foundry sands as green sand processes, but uses a furan binder instead of the traditional mixture of bentonite clay and water. The use of a chemical binder had led to questions about the resulting dimensional capabilities and mechanical properties of the castings produced by the mold. This study investigated the dimensional tolerancing capabilities, surface finish, mechanical properties, microstructure, and defects present in identical castings made from both a traditional olivine green sand molding process and a binder jet additively manufactured silica sand molding process. It was concluded that binder jet additively manufactured sand molds are capable of either equal or better dimensional accuracy and tolerance capabilities than traditional olivine green sand molds. The olivine green sand parts had an average of approximately 1 μm better surface finish than the binder jet sand molds; however, it is likely that both the addition of sea coal to the green sand and the difference in final part color significantly affected this result. The mean hardness of the binder jet parts was 58.9 HBW with a standard deviation of 5.6 HBW, compared to the mean of the green sand parts of 47.7 HBW with a standard deviation of 7.2 HBW. The hardness findings were confirmed by the presence of a finer microstructure in the binder jet parts than the green sand parts. While both types of molds produced parts with defects, a greater variety of defects was evident in the olivine green sand molds. Porosity tended to move toward the surface of the olivine green sand parts, but was relatively evenly spread through the additively manufactured sand mold parts.","Hasbrouck, C.

In the murine coronavirus a selective interaction between the viral transmembrane envelope protein M and the viral ribonucleoprotein complex, composed of N protein and viral RNA containing a short cis-acting RNA element, the packaging signal, determines the selective RNA packaging into virus particles. In this report we show that expressed coronavirus envelope protein M specifically interacted with coexpressed noncoronavirus RNA transcripts containing the short viral packaging signal in the absence of coronavirus N protein. Furthermore, this M protein-packaging signal interaction led to specific packaging of the packaging signal-containing RNA transcripts into coronavirus-like particles in the absence of N protein. These findings not only highlight a novel RNA packaging mechanism for an enveloped virus, where the specific RNA packaging can occur without the core or N protein, but also point to a new, biologically important general model of precise and selective interaction between transmembrane proteins and specific RNA elements.","Narayanan, Krishna; Chen, Chun-Jen; Maeda, Junko; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,842,17

Identifying people's preferences is key to building public confidence and planning for successful national health intervention strategies. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the sources of information for COVID-19 used by the Malaysian public and identifies those that are associated with building public confidence and positive perceptions toward the Malaysian government. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey of 4850 Malaysian residents was conducted. Participant demographics, media use, information sources, and attitudes surrounding COVID-19 were assessed. Descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to gauge the relationship between demographics, information sources, and attitudes toward COVID-19. RESULTS: Malaysians primarily used television and internet news portals to access information on COVID-19. The Malaysian Ministry of Health was the most preferred source of COVID-19 information. Respondents who referred to the Ministry of Health, television, and the Malaysian National Security Council for information were more likely to believe that the country could win the battle against COVID-19 and that the government was handling the health crisis well compared to those who referred to other information sources. Those who used the World Health Organization, friends, YouTube, family, and radio as sources of information were less likely to harbor confidence and positive belief toward combating COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Managing information and sustaining public confidence is important during a pandemic. Health authorities should pay considerable attention to the use of appropriate media channels and sources to allow for more effective dissemination of critical information to the public.","Mohamad, Emma; Tham, Jen Sern; Ayub, Suffian Hadi; Hamzah, Mohammad Rezal; Hashim, Hasrul; Azlan, Arina Anis",J Med Internet Res,842,26

OBJECTIVE: For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the Covid-19 pandemics. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The organization of health care has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of spinal tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. METHODS: An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons, and radiation oncologists was formed to analyze the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during Covid-19 pandemics. RESULTS: Spine metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture, and/or neurological symptoms. Primary spine tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like en bloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like chordoma or chondrosarcomas, if intensive care unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteogenic sarcoma must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. In immunocompromised patients, (treated by chemotherapy), it is necessary to avoid contact with affected or exposed people. CONCLUSION: Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy.

However, intervention studies that verify whether recommended ventilation targets can be achieved in practice with reasonable ventilation regimes and that are also suitable for countries with cold winters are practically non-existent. To explore the initial situation in Switzerland we carried out carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements during the winter in 100 classrooms, most of which (94%) had natural window ventilation. In more than two thirds of those, the hygienic limit value of 2000 ppm specified for CO2 in the Swiss Standard SN 520180 (2014) was exceeded. To improve ventilation behavior, an intervention was implemented in 23 classrooms during the heating season. Ventilation was performed exclusively during breaks (to avoid discomfort from cold and drafts), efficiently, and only for as long as was necessary to achieve the ventilation objective of compliance with the hygienic limit value (strategic ventilation). The intervention included verbal and written instructions, awareness-raising via a school lesson and an interactive tool for students, which was also used to estimate the required duration of ventilation. CO2 exposure was significantly reduced in pilot classes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p = 3.815e-06). Median CO2 levels decreased from 1600 ppm (control group) to 1097 ppm (intervention group), and the average proportion of teaching time at 400-1400 ppm CO2 increased from 40% to 70%. The duration of ventilation was similar to spontaneous natural window ventilation (+5.8%). Stricter ventilation targets are possible.

OBJECTIVES: This study sought to explore disease progression patterns and risk factors associated with mortality of deceased patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and imaging data (from 15 January to 26 March 2020) of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were collected retrospectively from two hospitals, Hubei province, China. Disease progression patterns of patients were analyzed based on laboratory data, radiological findings, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. Risk factors associated with death were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 792 patients were enrolled in this study, of whom 68 died and 724 survived. Complications during hospitalization, such as sepsis, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, and acute kidney injury, were markedly more frequent in deceased patients than in surviving patients. Deceased patients presented progressive deterioration pattern in laboratory variables, chest computed tomography evaluation, and SOFA score, while surviving patients presented initial deterioration to peak level involvement followed by improvement pattern over time. Days 10 to 14 after illness onset was a critical stage of disease course. Older age, number of preexisting comorbidities &#8805;2, and SOFA score were independently associated with death for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Multiorgan dysfunction was common in deceased COVID-19 patients.

Here, we show that the twist angle can be used to control the spin-valley properties of transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers by changing the momentum alignment of the valleys in the two layers. Specifically, we observe that the interlayer excitons in twisted WSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ bilayers exhibit a high (>60%) degree of circular polarization (DOCP) and long valley lifetimes (>40 ns) at zero electric and magnetic fields. The valley lifetime can be tuned by more than three orders of magnitude via electrostatic doping, enabling switching of the DOCP from ~80% in the n-doped regime to<5% in the p-doped regime. These results open up new avenues for tunable chiral light-matter interactions, enabling novel device schemes that exploit the valley degree of freedom.","Scuri, Giovanni; Andersen, Trond I.; Zhou, You; Wild, Dominik S.; Sung, Jiho; Gelly, Ryan J.; B'erub'e, Damien; Heo, Hoseok; Shao, Linbo; Joe, Andrew Y.; Valdivia, Andr'es M.

The literature on epidemics indicates that the early diagnosis of a coronavirus infection can lead to a reduction in mortality rates. To prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from spreading, the regular identification and monitoring of infected patients are needed. In this regard, wireless body area networks (WBANs) can be used in conjunction with machine learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) to identify and monitor the human body for health-related information, which in turn can aid in the early diagnosis of diseases. This paper proposes a novel coronavirus-body area network (CoV-BAN) model based on IoT technology as a real-time health monitoring system for the detection of the early stages of coronavirus infection using a number of wearable biosensors to examine the health status of the patient. The proposed CoV-BAN model is tested with five machine learning-based classification methods, including random forest, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron classifiers, to optimize the accuracy of the diagnosis of COVID-19. For the long-term sustainability of the sensor devices, the development of energy-efficient WBAN is critical. To address this issue, a long-range (LoRa)-based IoT program is used to receive biosensor signals from the patient and transmit them to the cloud directly for monitoring. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model using the random forest classifier outperforms models using the other classifiers, with an average accuracy of 88.6%. In addition, power consumption is reduced when LoRa technology is used as a relay node.","Bilandi, Naveen; Verma, Harsh K; Dhir, Renu",Arab J Sci Eng,842,15

It is an important way of reducing clinical risk. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid move to mainly remote consultations within the musculoskeletal field, safety netting is an important strategy to embed within all consultations. Only those presenting with potentially serious conditions are offered face to face consultations. Screening for Red Flags and any indication of a serious cause of symptoms is always first line in any consultation, however, clinical presentations are not always black and white with patients falling into a clear diagnostic category. With patients minds more focussed on COVID-19 symptoms this can be problematic. With the additional ramifications of public health social restrictions, onward management can be a conundrum. Many people with risk factors of serious pathology are also as a consequence, vulnerable to contracting COVID-19. In situations of uncertain clinical presentations, to avoid unnecessary social contact, safety netting can help to monitor symptoms over time until the clinical context becomes more certain. Embedding safety netting within physiotherapy best practice could be a silver lining in this pandemic black cloud.","Greenhalgh, Sue; Finucane, Laura M; Mercer, Christopher; Selfe, James",Musculoskelet Sci Pract,842,21

Prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations are non-reassuring fetal heart rate characteristics, which do not uniformly predict poor fetal outcome but can prompt obstetricians to proceed with cesarean delivery. The objective of this manuscript is to identify a strategy to reduce the primary cesarean section rate in patients with prolonged fetal heart rate decelerations in labor. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study over a 5-year period at an academic medical center, including patients undergoing primary cesarean section following labor induction, augmentation, or spontaneous labor who were noted to have prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration(s) in the 1 h prior to the time of delivery. Two groups were compared: ""crash"" cesarean sections versus ""emergent"" cesarean sections. The primary outcome was if fetal heart tones were rechecked in the operating room prior to cesarean section incision. Secondary outcomes included maternal-fetal monitoring versus Doppler fetal heart tones in the operating room, return to baseline noted in the operating room, fetal outcomes, fetal monitoring characteristics, and anesthesia type between crash versus emergent groups. RESULTS: Of 1969 term singleton cesarean sections, 119 patients met our inclusion criteria (emergent group n = 80) (crash group n = 39), which accounted for 13.9% of all primary cesarean sections during the study period. The emergent group had a significantly higher rate of reassessment of fetal heart tones in the operating room n = 61 (76.2%) versus the crash group n = 15 (38.4%) (p &#8804; 0.0001). There were no statistically significant differences regarding fetal outcomes between the two groups. The crash group had a higher rate of category 1 fetal heart rate tracing prior to the prolonged deceleration, a longer median prolonged deceleration, and a deeper median nadir of the prolonged deceleration; these differences were statistically significant. The prolonged-to-delivery interval was significantly shorter in the crash group (median = 15 min) than tin he emergent group (median = 33 min) (p &#8804; 0.0001). The crash group also had a higher rate of general anesthesia (n = 11, 28.2%) than the emergent group (n = 6, 7.5%) (p = 0.002). The crash group was specifically investigated. Of the 15 patients with fetal heart tones rechecked in the crash group, 7 had returned to baseline in the operating room, but underwent cesarean section without fetal monitoring. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the practice of placing patients on fetal monitor upon arrival to the operating room prior to performing crash cesarean delivery could reduce the rate of primary cesarean deliveries performed for prolonged decelerations in labor. When fetal heart tones have returned to baseline upon arrival in the operating room, the decision to proceed with cesarean delivery can be reconsidered. However, many clinical factors must be taken into consideration, and the decision to proceed is ultimately at the discretion of the obstetrics provider.","Morgan, John A; Hankins, Miriam E; Wang, Yuping; Hutchinson, Donna; Sams, Hannah L; Voltz, John H; McCathran, Charles E; Kaye, Alan D; Lewis, David F",Adv. ther,842,6

METHODS: This was an analytical, observational, retrospective study based on secondary data that were obtained from public Brazilian databases and covered the period from March 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 (epidemiological weeks 10-44). Data on weekly COVID-19 cases, hospitalisations and deaths due COVID-19, sales of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and social isolation indices were obtained. Associations between the variables were tested using multiple linear regression analysis. RESULTS: In all regions of Santa Catarina, there were almost simultaneous peaks of COVID-19 pandemic in weeks 28-31, followed by a sudden decrease. Social isolation indices were not associated with the outcomes; sales of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine were significant predictors of all outcomes (p < 0.001). COVID-19 prevalence was significantly different across the state regions when COVID-19 cases started to decline (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Collective immunity and social isolation may not have been the only causes for the reduction of the COVID-19 pandemic observed in Santa Catarina. The results of this study were compatible with the hypothesis that early treatment of COVID-19 cases with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine may contribute to reducing the transmissibility of COVID-19 in the population. This hypothesis needs to be further tested in future studies.","Neves, Fabricio Souza",Travel Med Infect Dis,842,10

However, access to these programs is limited, particularly for populations experiencing health disparities. Primary care settings have become recognized as a potential delivery system in which these programs may be implemented at scale. The purpose of this trial is to test the effectiveness of the Family Check-Up 4 Health (FCU4Health) program, an adaptation of the FCU for primary care, and assess program implementation in an integrated primary care setting. Methods We will conduct a hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation trial in partnership with a primary care clinic in a low-income, majority Latino community. Families with 2- to 5-year-old children will be eligible to participate. Families will be randomized to receive the intervention (n = 130) or services as usual (n = 70) and will be assessed annually over three years. Outcomes are informed by the RE-AIM framework (i.e., reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance). Effectiveness outcomes include child health behaviors (e.g., Dietary Screener Questionnaire), behavioral health (e.g., Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and parenting (e.g., Proactive Parenting). Early stage implementation outcomes are also included (e.g., cost, acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility). Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed via intent-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Implementation outcomes will be primarily descriptive with comparisons to prior trials of FCU4Health and the original FCU. Projected outcomes This trial will provide evidence related to the potential of integrated primary care settings to deliver evidence-based preventive interventions with a dual focus on behavioral and physical health.","Berkel, Cady; Smith, Justin D.; Bruening, Meg M.; Jordan, Neil; Fu, Emily; Mauricio, Anne M.; Grimm, Kevin J.; Winslow, Emily; Ray, Kristen; Bourne, Annette; Dishion, Thomas J.",Contemp Clin Trials,842,16

The first approach is more goal-focused while the latter is more autonomy-focused. Here we compared these two approaches in motor performance and psychological outcomes. Nineteen resistance-trained participants (10-males) first completed one repetition-maximum (RM) tests in the barbell-squat and bench-press, and were familiarized with the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP). In the next two counterbalanced sessions, participants completed two sets of the squat and bench-press using 70%1RM, and two sets of the IMTP. In the predetermined session, participants completed 10 repetitions in all sets, and in the self-selected session, participants chose how many repetitions to complete out of an 8–12 range. Bar-velocity was measured in the squat and bench-press, and force production in the IMTP. Enjoyment, perceived-autonomy, and approach-preferences were collected post-sessions. We observed comparable bar-velocity, force production, and enjoyment in both conditions (all BF(01) > 2.1), and an even approach-preferences split. However, in the self-selected condition, participants demonstrated considerable variability in the number of repetitions and reported greater perceived-autonomy.

In order to maximize the use of limited medical resources, we should distinguish between mild and severe patients as early as possible. Objective: To systematically review the evidence of risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Evidence Review: We conducted a comprehensive search for primary literature in both Chinese and English electronic bibliographic data bases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Weipu, Chinese Biomedicine Literature Database (CBM-SinoMed), MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register, and Web of science. The American agency for health research and quality (AHRQ) tool were used for assessing risk of bias. Mata-analysis was undertaken using STATA version 15.0. Results: 20 articles (N=4062 participants) were eligible for this systematic review and meta-analysis. First in this review and meta-analysis, we found that elderly male patients with a high body mass index, high breathing rate and a combination of underlying diseases (such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) were more likely to develop into critically ill patients. second, compared with ordinary patients, severe patients had more significant symptom such as fever and dyspnea. Besides, the laboratory test results of severe patients had more abnormal than non-severe patients, such as the elevated levels of white-cell counts, liver enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, c-reactive protein and procalcitonin, etc, while the decreased levels of lymphocytes and albumin, etc. Interpretation: This is the first systematic review investigating the risk factors for severe corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on university students’ engagement in HRB has yet received limited attention. We investigated whether HRB changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, assessed factors associated with change and profiles of HRB changes in university students. A web-based survey was conducted in May 2020, including 5021 students of four German universities (69% female, the mean age of 24.4 years (SD = 5.1)). Sixty-one percent of students reported consuming alcohol, 45.8% binge drinking, 44% inactivity, 19.4% smoking and 10.8% cannabis use. While smoking and cannabis use remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24.4% reported a decrease in binge drinking while 5.4% reported an increase. Changes to physical activity were most frequently reported, with 30.6% reporting an increase and 19.3% reporting a decrease in vigorous physical activity. Being female, younger age, being bored, not having a trusted person and depressive symptoms were factors associated with a change in HRB. Five substance use behavior profiles were identified, which also remained fairly unchanged. Efforts to promote student health and wellbeing continue to be required, also in times of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Busse, Heide; Buck, Christoph; Stock, Christiane; Zeeb, Hajo; Pischke, Claudia R.; Fialho, Paula Mayara Matos; Wendt, Claus; Helmer, Stefanie Maria",Int J Environ Res Public Health,842,1

To understand how host responses contribute to COVID-19 pathophysiology, we used a multi-omics approach to identify molecular markers in peripheral blood and plasma samples that distinguish COVID-19 patients experiencing a range of disease severities. A large number of expressed genes, proteins, metabolites and extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) were identified that exhibited strong associations with various clinical parameters. Multiple sets of tissue-specific proteins and exRNAs varied significantly in both mild and severe patients, indicative of multi-organ damage. The continuous activation of IFN-I signalling and neutrophils, as well as a high level of inflammatory cytokines, were observed in severe disease patients. In contrast, COVID-19 in mild patients was characterised by robust T cell responses. Finally, we show that some of expressed genes, proteins and exRNAs can be used as biomarkers to predict the clinical outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data refine our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical progress of COVID-19 and will help guide future studies in this area.","Chen, Y.-M.; Zheng, Y.; Yu, Y.; Wang, Y.; Huang, Q.; Qian, F.; Sun, L.; Song, Z.-G.; Chen, Z.; Feng, J.; An, Y.; Yang, J.; Su, Z.; Sun, S.; Dai, F.; Chen, Q.; Lu, Q.; Li, P.; Ling, Y.; Yang, Z.; Tang, H.; Shi, L.; Jin, L.; Holmes, E.

It has been recommended that medical students work as volunteers, undergo appropriate training, not undertake any activity beyond their level of competence, and receive continuous supervision and adequate personal protective equipment. However, the motivation of medical students must be evaluated to make volunteering a more evidence-based initiative. The aim of our study was to evaluate the motivation of medical students to be part of health teams to aid in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a questionnaire specifically to evaluate medical students’ perceptions about participating in the care of patients with suspected infection with coronavirus during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire had two parts: a) one part with questions on individual characteristics, year in medical school and geographic location of the medical school and b) a second part with twenty-eight statements assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (totally agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree and totally disagree). To develop the questionnaire, we performed consensus meetings with a group of faculty and medical students. The questionnaire was sent to student organizations of 257 medical schools in Brazil and answered by 10,433 students. We used multinomial logistic regression models to analyze the data. Statements associated with greater odds ratios for participation of medical students in the COVID-19 pandemic were related to a sense of purpose or duty (“It is the duty of the medical student to put himself or herself at the service of the population in the pandemic”), altruism (“I am willing to take risks by participating in practice in the context of the pandemic”), and perception of good performance and professional identity (“I will be a better health professional for having experienced the pandemic”). Males were more prone than females to believe that only interns should participate in the care of patients with COVID-19 (odds ratio 1.36 [coefficient interval 95%:1.24–1.49]) and that all students should participate (OR 1.68 [CI:1.4–1.91]). CONCLUSIONS: Medical students are more motivated by a sense of purpose or duty, altruism, perception of good performance and values of professionalism than by their interest in learning. These results have implications for the development of volunteering programs and the design of health force policies in the present pandemic and in future health emergencies.","Tempski, Patricia; Arantes-Costa, Fernanda M.; Kobayasi, Renata; Siqueira, Marina A.
