METHODS We analyzed the data on 1792 patients who underwent complete resection from 2003 to 2011 at the National Cancer Center Hospital East, Japan. We reevaluated preoperative thin-section computed tomography (TSCT) to determine solid size and pathological invasive size using the fourth edition of the WHO classification and reclassified them according to the new TNM classification. The discriminative power of survival curves by the seventh edition was compared with that by the eighth edition by using concordance probability estimates and Akaike's information criteria calculated using a univariable Cox regression model. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to elucidate the correlation between radiological solid size using TSCT and pathological invasive size. RESULTS The overall survival curves in the eighth edition were well distinct at each clinical and pathological stage. The 5-year survival rates of patients with clinical and pathological stage 0 newly defined were both 100%. The concordance probability estimate and Akaike's information criterion values of the eighth edition were higher than those of the seventh edition in discriminatory power for overall survival. Solid size on TSCT scan and pathological invasive size showed a positive linear relationship, and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated as 0.83, which indicated strong correlation. CONCLUSIONS This TNM classification will be feasible regarding patient survival, and radiological solid size correlates significantly with pathological invasive size as a new T factor.","Aokage, Keiju; Miyoshi, Tomohiro; Ishii, Genichiro; Kusumoto, Masahiro; Nomura, Shogo; Katsumata, Shinya; Sekihara, Keigo; Hishida, Tomoyuki; Tsuboi, Masahiro",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,887,27

We counted the number of rheotaxic sperm and sperm with spiral motion. We also analyzed motile sperm trajectories. As the cylindrical channel diameter was decreased, the percentage of sperm cells exhibiting rheotaxis, the percentage of sperm cells exhibiting spiral motion, the frequency-to-diameter ratio of the sperm cells' spiral trajectories, and the surface area of the microfluidic channel increased, while the flagellar motion at the channel wall decreased. The percentage of sperm exhibiting a spiral trajectory and the frequency-to-diameter ratio of the sperm cells' spiral trajectories were thus affected by the channel diameter. Our findings suggest that the oviduct structure affects the swimming properties of sperm cells, guiding them from the uterus to the ampulla for egg fertilization. These results could contribute to the development of motile sperm-sorting microfluidic devices for assisted reproductive technologies.","Nishina, Saori; Matsuura, Koji; Naruse, Keiji",Acta medica Okayama,887,1

Because of its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, naloxone has limited utility under some conditions and would not be effective to counteract mass casualties involving large-scale deployment of weaponized synthetic opioids. To address shortcomings of current medical countermeasures for opioid toxicity, a trans-agency scientific meeting was convened by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID/NIH) on 6-7 August 2019 to explore emerging alternative approaches for treating opioid overdose in the event of weaponization of synthetic opioids. The meeting was initiated by the Chemical Countermeasures Research Program (CCRP), organized by NIAID, and was a collaboration with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA/NIH), the FDA, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). This paper provides an overview of several presentations at that meeting that discussed emerging new approaches for treating opioid overdose, including the following: 1) intranasal nalmefene, a competitive, reversible opioid receptor antagonist with a longer duration of action than naloxone; 2) methocinnamox, a novel opioid receptor antagonist; 3) covalent naloxone nanoparticles; 4) serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonists; 5) fentanyl-binding cyclodextrin scaffolds; 6) detoxifying biomimetic ""nanosponge"" decoy receptors; and 7) antibody-based strategies. These strategies could also be applied to treat opioid use disorder (OUD).","France, Charles P; Ahern, Gerard; Averick, Saadyah; Disney, Alex; Enright, Heather A; Esmaeli-Azad, Babak; Federico, Arianna; Gerak, Lisa R; Husbands, Stephen M; Kolber, Benedict; Lau, Edmond Y; Lao, Victoria; Maguire, David R; Malfatti, Michael A; Martinez, Girardo; Mayer, Brian P; Pravetoni, Marco; Sahibzada, Niaz; Skolnick, Phil; Snyder, Evan Y; Tomycz, Nestor; Valdez, Carlos A; Zapf, Jim",Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,887,1

DESIGN Using a cross-sectional study, we recruited English-language migrants (n = 411) living in Israel to respond to an online questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic, from 3 April to 16 May 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The dependent variable comprised the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) scores, which attained an internal consistency of 0.91 in this sample. RESULTS PSS scores were related to lower age (p < 0.0001), being single (p = 0.0095), not possessing high (p = 0.0069) or medium resilience (p = 0.0002), reporting below average SES (p = 0.0196), being ""extremely"" worried about getting COVID-19 (p < 0.0001), and having high health literacy (p = 0.0007). Additionally, the interaction between health literacy and resilience (p < 0.0001) showed that migrants with high resilience and high health literacy had the lowest perceived stress; and migrants with low resilience and high health literacy had the highest perceived stress. CONCLUSIONS Interventions are needed to assist migrants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The optimal intervention will aim to address the psychological distress while increasing both health literacy and resilience.","Zlotnick, Cheryl; Dryjanska, Laura; Suckerman, Suzanne",Psychology & health,887,16

These diseases are caused by the Leishmania species complex. Activation of the CD8+ T cell is crucial for protection against intracellular pathogens, and peptide antigens are attractive strategies for the precise activation of CD8+ T in vaccine development against intracellular infections. The traditional approach to mine the epitopes is an arduous task. However, with the advent of immunoinformatics, in silico epitope prediction tools are available to expedite epitope identification. In this study, we employ different immunoinformatics tools to predict CD8+ T cell specific 9 mer epitopes presented by HLA-A*02 and HLA-B40 within the highly conserved 3'-ectonucleotidase of Leishmania donovani. We identify five promiscuous epitopes, which have no homologs in humans, theoretically cover 85% of the world's population and are highly conserved (100%) among Leishmania species. Presentation of selected peptides was confirmed by T2 cell line based HLA-stabilization assay, and three of them were found to be strong binders. The in vitro peptide stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from cured HLA-A02+ visceral leishmaniasis (VL) subjects produced significantly higher IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-12 compared to no peptide control healthy subjects. Further, CD8+ cells from treated VL subjects produced significantly higher intracellular IFN-γ, lymphocyte proliferation and cytotoxic activity against selected peptides from the PBMCs of treated HLA-A02+ VL subjects. Thus, the CD8+ T cell specific epitopes shown in this study will speed up the development of polytope vaccines for leishmaniasis.","Vijayamahantesh,; Amit, Ajay; Dikhit, Manas R; Singh, Ashish K; Venkateshwaran, T; Das, V N R; Das, Pradeep; Bimal, Sanjiva",Microbes and infection,887,6

In contrast to many well-studied enveloped viruses that assemble and bud at the plasma membrane, coronaviruses assemble by budding into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment and are released from the cell by exocytosis. For this to occur, the viral envelope proteins must be efficiently targeted to the Golgi region of the secretory pathway. Although the envelope protein (E) makes up only a small percentage of the viral envelope, it plays an important, as-yet-undefined role in virus production. To dissect the targeting of the SARS-CoV E protein to the Golgi region, we exogenously expressed the protein and various mutants from cDNA and determined their localization using immunofluorescence microscopy and biochemical assays. We show that the cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV E protein is sufficient to redirect a plasma membrane protein to the Golgi region. Through site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that a predicted beta-hairpin structural motif in the tail is sufficient for Golgi complex localization of a reporter protein. This motif is conserved in E proteins of beta and gamma coronaviruses (formerly referred to as group 2 and 3 coronaviruses), where it also functions as a Golgi complex-targeting signal. Dissecting the mechanism of targeting of the SARS-CoV E protein will lead to a better understanding of its role in the assembly and release of virions.","Cohen, Jennifer R; Lin, Lisa D; Machamer, Carolyn E",Journal of virology,887,1

In recent years, the great success of pre-trained models for embedding contextual information from texts motivates researchers to utilize these embeddings in different natural language processing tasks. However, in a complex task like fake news detection, it is not determined which contextualized embedding can assist the classifier with more valuable features. Due to the lack of a comparative study about utilizing different contextualized pre-trained models besides distinct neural classifiers, we aim to dive into a comparative study about using different classifiers and embedding models. In this paper, we propose three classifiers with different pre-trained models for embedding input news articles. We connect Single-Layer Perceptron (SLP), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) after the embedding layer which consists of novel pre-trained models such as BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2, and Funnel Transformer in order to benefit from deep contextualized representation provided by those models as well as deep neural classifications. We evaluate our proposed models on three well-known fake news datasets: LIAR (Wang, 2017), ISOT (Ahmed et al., 2017), and COVID-19 Patwa et al. (2020). The results on these three datasets show the superiority of our proposed models for fake news detection compared to the state-of-the-art models. The results show 7% and 0.1% improvements in classification accuracy compared to the proposed model by Goldani et al. (2021) on LIAR and ISOT, respectively.

We used community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) as a benchmark to define the processes that occur in a bacterial pulmonary infection, and tested the hypothesis that baseline inflammatory markers and their response to antibiotic therapy could distinguish CAP from COVID-19. MethodsIn patients admitted to Royal Free Hospital (RFH) and Barnet Hospital (BH) we defined CAP by lobar consolidation on chest radiograph, and COVID-19 by SARS-CoV-2 detection by PCR. Data were derived from routine laboratory investigations. ResultsOn admission all CAP and >90% COVID-19 patients received antibiotics. We identified 106 CAP and 619 COVID-19 patients at RFH. CAP was characterised by elevated white cell count (WCC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) compared to COVID-19 (median WCC 12.48 (IQR 8.2-15.3) vs 6.78 (IQR 5.2-9.5) x106 cells/ml and median CRP CRP 133.5 (IQR 65-221) vs 86 (IQR 42-160) mg/L). Blood samples collected 48-72 hours into admission revealed decreasing CRP in CAP but not COVID-19 (CRP difference -33 (IQR -112 to +3.5) vs +15 (IQR -15 to +70) mg/L respectively). In the independent validation cohort (BH) consisting of 169 CAP and 181 COVID-19 patients, admission WCC >8.2x106 cells/ml or falling CRP during admission identified 95% of CAP cases, and predicted the absence of bacterial co-infection in 45% of COVID-19 patients. ConclusionsWe propose that in COVID-19 the absence of both elevated baseline WCC and antibiotic-related decrease in CRP can exclude bacterial co-infection and facilitate antibiotic stewardship efforts.","Mason, Claire Y; Kanitkar, Tanmay; Richardson, Charlotte J; Lanzman, Marisa; Stone, Zak; Mahungu, Tabitha; Mack, Damien; Wey, Emmanuel Q; Lamb, Lucy; Balakrishnan, Indran; Pollara, Gabriele",,887,26

Relentless research efforts have been on to improve key performance indicators for detection, isolation and early treatment. The aim of this study is to conduct a comparative study on the detection of COVID-19 and develop a Deep Transfer Learning Convolutional Neural Network (DTL-CNN) Model to classify chest X-ray images in a binary classification task (as either COVID-19 or Normal classes) and a three-class classification scenario (as either COVID-19, Viral-Pneumonia or Normal categories). Dataset was collected from Kaggle website containing a total of 600 images, out of which 375 were selected for model training, validation and testing (125 COVID-19, 125 Viral Pneumonia and 125 Normal). In order to ensure that the model generalizes well, data augmentation was performed by setting the random image rotation to 15 degrees clockwise. Two experiments were performed where a fine-tuned VGG-16 CNN and a fine-tuned VGG-19 CNN with Deep Transfer Learning (DTL) were implemented in Jupyter Notebook using Python programming language. The system was trained with sample datasets for the model to detect coronavirus in chest X-ray images. The fine-tuned VGG-16 and VGG-19 DTL models were trained for 40 epochs with batch size of 10, using Adam optimizer for weight updates and categorical cross entropy loss function. A learning rate of 1e−2 was used in fine-tuned VGG-16 while 1e−1 was used in fine-tuned VGG-19, and was evaluated on the 25% of the X-ray images. It was discovered that the validation and training losses were significantly high in the earlier epochs and then noticeably decreases as the training occurs in more subsequent epochs. Result showed that the fine-tuned VGG-16 and VGG-19 models, in this work, produced a classification accuracy of 99.00% for binary classes, and 97.33% and 89.33% for multi-class cases respectively. Hence, it was discovered that the VGG-16 based DTL model classified COVID-19 better than the VGG-19 based DTL model. Using the best performing fine-tuned VGG-16 DTL model, tests were carried out on 75 unlabeled images that did not participate in the model training and validation processes. The proposed models, in this work, provided accurate diagnostics for binary classification (COVID-19 and Normal) and multi-class classification (COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia and Normal), as it outperformed other existing models in the literature in terms of accuracy. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fayemiwo, M.

Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEPs), visual evoked potential (VEPs), auditory brainstem response (ABR), and electroencephalography (EEG) were used selectively in all patients depending on the location of the malformation.

Two patients demonstrated changes in baseline SSEPs after embolization, despite normal IONM during provocative testing, correlating with postprocedural contralateral weakness. Six patients developed visual deficits after arterial occlusion despite unchanged VEPs and occipital EEG during provocative testing and embolization. We therefore conclude that the sensitivity of TcMEPs and SSEPs is preferable to EEG, and we strongly caution against relying on occipital recorded VEPs to predict visual deficits.","Deshaies, Eric M; Singla, Amit; Allott, Geoffrey; Villwock, Mark R; Li, Fenghua; Gorji, Reza",The Neurodiagnostic journal,887,29

It is known that HCWs who serve as front-liners during the COVID-19 pandemic experience stress and have the fear of contracting the infection. Little is known of how being a positive contact affects HCWs. OBJECTIVE We examined the experience of HCWs who were quarantined following a close unprotected contact with a COVID-19 positive colleague and explore the psychological impact especially as the timing of the quarantine coincided with the Eid (annual Muslim festival) celebration in Malaysia. METHODS This was a cross-sectional on-line questionnaire study, involving HCWs exposed to a COVID-19 positive colleague in Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, a teaching hospital. Data on demographics, levels of depression, anxiety and stress using a validated depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21) questionnaire, aspects of quarantine, wearing of masks, hand hygiene practice and swab experience were collected. RESULTS Twenty-two HCWs participated. Eighteen (81.8%) were between 30-39 years and 17 (77.3%) were women. Majority 19 (86.3%) were Malays. There were twelve (54.5%) medical officers, 5 (22.7%) specialists and 5(22.7%) allied health staff. Eighteen out of 22 (81.8%) felt they were able to do home quarantine adequately. All tested negative with a mean (Standard Deviation) hour of contact of 2.56±2.38 hours. Eighteen reported their biggest concern was infecting their families. CONCLUSION HCWs undergoing contact swabbing and quarantine are vulnerable to depression, anxiety and stress. The ability of the HCW to adequately home quarantine should not be taken for granted.

The amount of total sialic acid and Neu5Gc declined markedly in 2 weeks after birth. Although in subsequent developmental phases there were no positional differences in total sialic acid, a significant proximal-to-distal increase in Neu5Gc was detected. In all cases, a good correlation between the amount of Neu5Gc, the activity of the hydroxylase and the level of hydroxylase mRNA was observed. However, Western-blot analysis revealed considerable accumulation of less active enzyme in the post partum period, which persisted until adulthood. No evidence for cytosolic factors influencing the hydroxylase activity or for the formation of truncated enzyme was found, raising the possibility that other regulatory mechanisms are involved. The relevance of these results in the formation of Neu5Gc as a receptor for certain pig enteric pathogens is also discussed.","Malykh, Yanina N; King, Timothy P; Logan, Elizabeth; Kelly, Denise; Schauer, Roland; Shaw, Lee",The Biochemical journal,887,33

Six hundred and twenty-six samples were collected and rotaviruses were detected in 35 of them. A predominant electropherotype was found in all the samples, and there was no seasonal variation in the incidence of infection. The predominant electropherotype pattern in this study was different from the electropherotype patterns of strains isolated elsewhere in the country and also from the pattern of the strains isolated earlier from children with acute diarrhoea at the same hospital.","Desikan, P; Daniel, J D; Kamalarathnam, C N; Mathan, M M",Journal of diarrhoeal diseases research,887,1

Large volumes of porcine IL2 were prepared by PHA stimulation of irradiated mesenteric lymph node cells and, following purification by gel-filtration chromatography, the apparent molecular weight of IL2 was 15,000 Da. Purified human and porcine IL2 as well as recombinant human IL2 were found to increase markedly NK activity of lymphocytes derived from adult animals. However, although newborn piglets-derived lymphocytes are sensitive to crude porcine IL2 supernatants (and to Interferon alpha as previously shown) their low NK activity is unaffected by purified IL2. These data suggest therefore the existence of differences in the ontogenic development of the lymphokines responsiveness of porcine NK cells.","Charley, B; Fradelizi, D",Annales de recherches veterinaires.

After a diagnosis is established at any point within the urothelial tract, the patient remains at risk for developing a new lesion at a different or the same location and at a similar or more advanced stage. Continued monitoring for recurrence is an essential part of management, because most recurrences are superficial and can be managed endoscopically. Within each category of disease, more refined methods to determine prognosis and guide management, based on molecular staging, are under development with the goal of optimizing the individual patient's likelihood of cure and chance for organ preservation. For patients with more extensive disease, newer treatments typically involve combined-modality approaches, using recently developed surgical procedures, or three-dimensional treatment planning for more precise delivery of radiation therapy. Although these are not appropriate in all cases, they do offer the promise of an improved quality of life and prolonged survival. Finally, within the category of metastatic disease, a number of new agents have been identified that appear to be superior to those currently considered to be standard therapies. Experts believe, therefore, that the treatment of urothelial tumors will evolve rapidly over the next few years, with improved outcomes for patients at all stages of disease.","Montie, James E; Bahnson, Robert R; Cohen, Samuel M; Drucker, Beverly; Eisenberger, Mario A; El-Galley, Rizk; Herr, Harry W; Hudes, Gary R; Kuzel, Timothy M; Lange, Paul H; Patterson, Anthony; Pollack, Alan; Richie, Jerome P; Seigne, John; Shipley, William U; Small, Eric J; Trump, Donald L; Walther, Philip J; Wilson, Timothy G",Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,887,19

OBJECTIVES: Describe the implications of post-COVID syndrome due to neurological sequelae including treatment and the differences that may exist between this group of patients and those who present these events not associated with COVID-19. METHODS: A non-systematic review of the literature was carried out in PubMed and Science Direct databases, using the keywords “Post-acute COVID-19 syndrome”; “Neurological complications”; “Neurologic Manifestations” “COVID-19″ and ”Rehabilitation“, as well as synonyms, which were combined with the operators ”AND“ and ”OR“. RESULTS: The COVID-19 viral caustive agent, SARS-CoV-2, has a high affinity for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on type II pneumocytes. This receptor is also expressed in neurons and glial cells. Based on the foregoing and other not so clear mechanisms, it is stated that SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for the nervous system, being evident through the neurological manifestations observed in patients with mild, moderate and severe phenotype of the disease such as anosmia, ageusia, headache, cerebrovascular accidents, Guillain-Barré syndrome, seizures, and encephalopathy. This can generate severe sequelae and even fatal outcomes in those affected. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications caused by COVID-19 are frequent and represent a risk that compromises the functional capacity and the life of patients. The suspicion of these conditions, the strict control of metabolic alterations and cardiovascular risk factors, the effective and safe treatment of these entities, are a current challenge throughout the pandemic. The rehabilitation process in these patients is a challenge. This is due to the limitations generated by multi-organ damage, as well as risk of brain death.","Camargo-Martínez, William; Lozada-Martínez, Ivan; Escobar-Collazos, Angie; Navarro-Coronado, Aura; Moscote-Salazar, Luis; Pacheco-Hernández, Alfonso; Janjua, Tariq; Bosque-Varela, Pilar",J Clin Neurosci,887,5
