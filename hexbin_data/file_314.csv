4773,4773,4773,Relapse of SARS upon tapering corticosteroid,20.725586,11.334002,2004-05-01,"The demand for production of glycoproteins from mammalian cell culture continues with an increased number of approvals as biopharmaceuticals for the treatment of unmet medical needs. This is particularly the case for humanized monoclonal antibodies which are the largest and fastest growing class of therapeutic pharmaceuticals. This demand has fostered efforts to improve the efficiency of production as well as to address the quality of the final product. Chinese hamster ovary cells are the predominant hosts for stable transfection and high efficiency production on a large scale. Specific productivity of recombinant glycoproteins from these cells can be expected to be above 50 pg/cell/day giving rise to culture systems with titers of around 5 g/L if appropriate fed-batch systems are employed. Cell engineering can delay the onset of programmed cell death to ensure prolonged maintenance of productive viable cells. The clinical efficacy and quality of the final product can be improved by strategic metabolic engineering. The best example of this is the targeted production of afucosylated antibodies with enhanced antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, an important function for use in cancer therapies. The development of culture media from non-animal sources continues and is important to ensure products of consistent quality and without the potential danger of contamination. Process efficiencies may also be improved by employing disposable bioreactors with the associated minimization of downtime. Finally, advances in downstream processing are needed to handle the increased supply of product from the bioreactor but maintaining the high purity demanded of these biopharmaceuticals.","Butler, M.; Meneses-Acosta, A.",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,314,12

Here, we demonstrate that differentiated human astrocytic (T98G) and neuronal (SH-SY5Y) cells can be infected by avian H7N9 and pandemic H1N1 viruses. However, infectious progeny viruses can only be detected in H7N9 virus infected human neuronal cells. Neither of these viral strains can generate infectious progeny virus in human astrocytes despite replication of viral genome was observed. Furthermore, H7N9 virus triggered high pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, while pandemic H1N1 virus induced only low cytokine expression in either brain cell type. The experimental finding here is the first data to demonstrate that avian H7N9 virus can infect, transcribe, and replicate its viral genome; induce cytokine upregulation; and cause cytopathic effects in human brain cells, which may potentially lead to profound central nervous system injury. Observation for neurological problems due to H7N9 virus infection deserves further attention when managing these patients.","Ng, Y. P.; Yip, T. F.; Peiris, J. S. Malik; Ip, Nancy Y.; Lee, Suki M.

The theoretical ability of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) to improve the functions of both neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages provides a rationale for G-CSF therapy in non-neutropenic critically ill patients with infection or a high risk of nosocomial infection. The expression of the receptors that mediate G-CSF effects in neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages is regulated by bacterial products, cytokines and endogenous G-CSF levels, accounting for the variables effects of G-CSF on the neutrophil functions of critically ill patients. This variability should be taken into account when designing studies on the use of G-CSF in ICU-patients. Studies are still needed to identify the subset of patients who may benefit from G-CSF therapy.","Azoulay, Élie; Delclaux, Christophe",Intensive Care Med,314,12

It is characterized by serious lung inflammation or injury. Characterizing novel miRNAs implicated in ARDS pathogenesis may provide new therapeutic strategy for managing ARDS. METHODS: We employed LPS-induced lung injury model to profile miRNAs associated with ARDS. We isolated one miRNA candidate and characterized its role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine production in lung macrophages. We further evaluated its functional role in ARDS model by assessing histological change, neutrophil activation, tissue permeability and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) production. We also characterized its downstream target using luciferase assay, Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and cell inflammation assay. RESULTS: Microarray profiling revealed miR-802 was significantly downregulated in ARDS mouse model. LPS-induced miR-802 downregulation was confirmed in lung macrophages. Overexpression of miR-802 significantly suppressed LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and alleviates LPS-induced acute lung injury in vivo. Peli2 was identified as a downstream target of miR-802 and found upregulated in ARDS model. Overexpressing Peli2 abolished the antagonizing effect of miR-802 on LPS-mediated inflammatory response. CONCLUSION: MiR-802 carried a protective role against LPS-induced acute lung injury by downregulating Peli2. MiR-802/Peli2 axis may act as intervening targets to manage ARDS.","You, Qinghai; Wang, Jinmei; Jia, Dan; Jiang, Lijuan; Chang, Yuanmin; Li, Wenmei",Inflamm Res,314,12

Thus, inhibition of NF-κB signaling has potential for therapeutic applications in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We reported previously that Nei-like DNA glycosylase 2 (NEIL2), a mammalian DNA glycosylase, is involved in the preferential repair of oxidized DNA bases from the transcriptionally active sequences via the transcription-coupled base excision repair pathway. We have further shown that Neil2-null mice are highly sensitive to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)- and lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation. Both TNFα and lipopolysaccharide are potent activators of NF-κB. However, the underlying mechanism of NEIL2's role in the NF-κB–mediated inflammation remains elusive. Here, we have documented a noncanonical function of NEIL2 and demonstrated that the expression of genes, such as Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl10, Il6, and Tnfα, involved in inflammation and immune cell migration was significantly higher in both mock- and TNFα-treated Neil2-null mice compared with that in the WT mice. NEIL2 blocks NF-κB's binding to target gene promoters by directly interacting with the Rel homology region of RelA and represses proinflammatory gene expression as determined by co-immunoprecipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and electrophoretic mobility-shift assays. Remarkably, intrapulmonary administration of purified NEIL2 via a noninvasive nasal route significantly abrogated binding of NF-κB to cognate DNA, leading to decreased expression of proinflammatory genes and neutrophil recruitment in Neil2-null as well as WT mouse lungs. Our findings thus highlight the potential of NEIL2 as a biologic for inflammation-associated human diseases.","Tapryal, Nisha; Shahabi, Shandy; Chakraborty, Anirban; Hosoki, Koa; Wakamiya, Maki; Sarkar, Gobinda; Sharma, Gulshan; Cardenas, Victor J.; Boldogh, Istvan; Sur, Sanjiv; Ghosh, Gourisankar; Hazra, Tapas K.",J Biol Chem,314,8

Its diagnosis could be difficult in some cases due to atypical presentations especially when there is no medical history of asthma. Treatment of ABPA is frequently associated to side effects but cumulated drug toxicity due to different molecules is rarely reported. An accurate choice among the different available molecules and effective on ABPA is crucial. We report a case of ABPA in a woman without a known history of asthma. She presented an acute bronchitis with wheezing dyspnea leading to an acute respiratory failure. She was hospitalized in the intensive care unit. The bronchoscopy revealed a complete obstruction of the left primary bronchus by a sticky greenish material. The culture of this material isolated Aspergillus fumigatus and that of bronchial aspiration fluid isolated Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The diagnosis of ABPA was based on elevated eosinophil count, the presence of specific IgE and IgG against Aspergillus fumigatus and left segmental collapse on chest computed tomography. The patient received an inhaled treatment for her asthma and a high dose of oral corticosteroids for ABPA. Her symptoms improved but during the decrease of corticosteroids, the patient presented a relapse. She received itraconazole in addition to corticosteroids. Four months later, she presented a drug-induced hepatitis due to itraconazole which was immediately stopped. During the monitoring of her asthma which was partially controlled, the patient presented an aseptic osteonecrosis of both femoral heads that required surgery. Nine months after itraconazole discontinuation, she presented a second relapse of her ABPA. She received voriconazole for nine months associated with a low dose of systemic corticosteroid therapy with an improvement of her symptoms. After discontinuation of antifungal treatment, there was no relapse for one year follow-up.","Snen, Houda; Kallel, Aicha; Blibech, Hana; Jemel, Sana; Salah, Nozha Ben; Marouen, Sonia; Mehiri, Nadia; Belhaj, Slah; Louzir, Bechir; Kallel, Kalthoum",Front Immunol,314,12

Splenectomy and devascularization have become an efficacious surgical procedure for portal hypertension, and has been recommended in China as the first choice for the treatment of portal hypertension for a long time. As a result of advances in laparoscopic equipment and techniques, splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization have been carried out with laparoscope.From January 2012 to December 2017, 453 patients who were diagnosed with portal hypertension and serious gastroesophageal varices received surgical management in our institution. 250 patients chose laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization and 203 underwent open splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization.We retrospectively analyzed the perioperative data and follow-up data of these patients. The operation time of laparoscopic group was longer than open group (P ≤ .001). Intraoperative blood loss was less (P ≤ .001), the passing of flatus was earlier (P = .042), and postoperative hospital stay was shorter (P = .001) in the laparoscopic group. During postoperative follow-up of 4 to 75 months, the incidence of esophagogastric variceal rebleeding, encephalopathy, and secondary liver cancer showed no significant differences.Laparoscopic splenectomy and esophagogastric devascularization were safe and more effective than open surgery for portal hypertension and gastroesophageal varices.","Zheng, Shunzhen; Sun, Ping; Liu, Xihan; Li, Guangbing; Gong, Wei; Liu, Jun",Medicine,314,1

We used logistic regression to model finding risk for 4 clinical impact factor (CIF) categories: Safety Reporting, Data Integrity, Consent and Protecting Endpoints. Results - Resulting Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves were between 0.57 - 0.66 with calibrated predictive ranges of 27 - 41%. The combined and adjusted risk factors could be used to easily interpret risk estimates. Conclusion - Continuous surveillance of the identified risk factors and resulting risk estimates could be used to complement remote QA strategies and help to manage audit targets and audit focus also in post-pandemic times.","Koneswarakantha, B.; Menard, T.",,314,1

The credibility or reliability on social media platforms is also at stake. It is of utmost necessary to address this as a severe issue and act on it promptly. The extensive spread of counterfeit news has the potential for creating negative impacts on vast audience. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has become a very critical agenda in today’s world. This paper proposes a prototype to detect whether a news is fake or real using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm and its various architectures. Furthermore, the proposed prototype is capable of handling the unstructured data as the news can be in the form of images. In addition to this, the use of Django which is a high-level Python framework that allows the development of UI very easily with multiple designing options.

We have investigated innate immune responses to both viruses using primary human macrophages and respiratory epithelial cells as in vitro models. In contrast to human influenza A H1NI viruses, the H5N1 viruses hyper-induce cytokines (tumour necrosis factor [TNF]alpha, interferon beta) and chemokines (IP10, MIP1alpha, MCP) in in vitro cultures of primary human macrophages. A similar differential effect is observed in primary human bronchial epithelial cells and in type 2 pneumocytes although TNFalpha is not induced in respiratory epithelial cells. The cell signalling pathways responsible for this differential effect remain to be explored. Preliminary data suggest that such differential signalling involves p38 MAP kinase rather than NF-kappaB. SARS coronavirus infection of primary human macrophages is associated with a strong induction of chemokines without an associated type 1 interferon response. These observations may be relevant in disease pathogenesis.","Peiris, Malik",Novartis Foundation symposium,314,10

We conducted a retrospective review of patients with upper- and lower-extremity DVT managed with the Trellis thrombectomy system at our center. METHODS All patients with symptomatic DVT who presented to our center between April 2010 and April 2011 who underwent PMT by the Trellis device were included in this retrospective review. RESULTS Twenty-eight patients (mean age, 46.4 ± 21.2 years) presented with symptoms with a mean duration of 1.3 ± 1.8 months. Eighty-six percent had 100% occlusion on admission, while 14.3% had 70%-90% stenosis. The mean lytic dose used was tPA 20.7 ± 12 mg. The mean Trellis treatment time was 25.1 ± 11.5 minutes. Grade 3 lysis was achieved in 23 of 28 patients (85.8%), while grade 2 lysis was achieved in 14.2%. Mean total hospital stay was 2.6 ± 2.7 days. Postprocedure symptom resolution was 100%, and there was no reocclusion in 78.6% of patients at 1 year. At 12 months, the patency rate (primary or secondary) was 80% as determined by Doppler ultrasound. CONCLUSIONS In patients with DVT involving the ilio-femoral and the upper-extremity vessels, the use of the Trellis device was associated with a high technical success rate as well as a satisfactory 12-month patency rate. Moreover, this strategy was associated with reduced lytic dose, shorter treatment time and hospital stay, and no bleeding complications.","Chaudhry, Muhammad A; Pappy, Reji; Hennebry, Thomas A",The Journal of invasive cardiology,314,26
209788,209788,209788,Low total cholesterol blood level is correlated with pulmonary severity in COVID-19 critical ill patients,20.969572,11.022155,2020,"Seoul, the most populous city in South Korea, has been practicing social distancing to slow down the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and other air pollutants measured in Seoul over the two 30 day periods before and after the start of social distancing are analyzed to assess the change in air quality during the period of social distancing. The 30 day mean PM2.5 concentration decreased by 10.4% in 2020, which is contrasted with an average increase of 23.7% over the corresponding periods in the previous 5 years. The PM2.5 concentration decrease was city-wide and more prominent during daytime than at nighttime. The concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) decreased by 16.9% and 16.4%, respectively. These results show that social distancing, a weaker forcing toward reduced human activity than a strict lockdown, can help lower pollutant emissions. At the same time, synoptic conditions and the decrease in aerosol optical depth over the regions to the west of Seoul support that the change in Seoul's air quality during the COVID-19 social distancing can be interpreted as having been affected by reductions in the long-range transport of air pollutants as well as local emission reductions.","Han, Beom-Soon; Park, Kyeongjoo; Kwak, Kyung-Hwan; Park, Seung-Bu; Jin, Han-Gyul; Moon, Sungju; Kim, Jong-Won; Baik, Jong-Jin",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),314,16

Few prior studies have evaluated the well-being of or changes to training for American resident physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to study predictors of trainee well-being and changes to clinical practice using an anonymous survey of American urology residents. METHODS: An anonymous, voluntary, 47-question survey was sent to all ACGME-accredited urology programmes in the United States. We executed a cross-sectional analysis evaluating risk factors of perception of anxiety and depression both at work and home and educational outcomes. Multiple linear regressions models were used to estimate beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS: Among ~1800 urology residents in the USA, 356 (20%) responded. Among these respondents, 24 had missing data leaving a sample size of 332. Important risk factors of mental health outcomes included perception of access to PPE, local COVID-19 severity and perception of susceptible household members. Risk factors for declination of redeployment included current redeployment, having children and concerns regarding ability to reach case minimums. Risk factors for concern of achieving operative autonomy included cancellation of elective cases and higher level of training. CONCLUSIONS: Several potential actions, which could be taken by urology residency programme directors and hospital administration, may optimise urology resident well-being, morale, and education. These include advocating for adequate access to PPE, providing support at both the residency programme and institutional levels, instituting telehealth education programmes, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility of COVID-19 patients.","Khusid, Johnathan A; Weinstein, Corey S; Becerra, Adan Z; Kashani, Mahyar; Robins, Dennis J; Fink, Lauren E; Smith, Matthew T; Weiss, Jeffrey P",Int J Clin Pract,314,16

Considering that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, along with its associated sanitary regime, social distancing measures and nationwide quarantines, could itself induce public fears, including in children, it is of great interest to explore whether this situation and the necessity of reorganizing dental care could potentially affect the emotional state of pediatric patients facing a need for urgent dental intervention. The present study assessed the emotional state of children ≤ seven years old (n = 25) requiring dental healthcare during a nationwide quarantine in Poland, as well as the anxiety levels of their caregivers. The Faces Anxiety Scale was adopted, and the evaluation was independently performed by the dentist, caregivers and children themselves. The level of anxiety in caregivers was also measured. As demonstrated, children requiring dental intervention during the nationwide quarantine did not reveal a significantly higher anxiety level as compared to the age-and indication-matched pre-pandemic control group (n = 20), regardless of whether their emotional state was evaluated by the dentist, caregivers, or by themselves. However, the share of children scoring the lowest anxiety level in all assessments was smaller in the pandemic group. Boys in the pandemic group had a higher anxiety level, as indicated by a caregiver assessment, and displayed a negative correlation with age in all three types of evaluation. Moreover, caregiver anxiety levels were higher in the pandemic group as compared to the pre-pandemic subset and revealed stronger correlations with the dental anxiety in children. The results suggest that the reorganization of oral healthcare under the pandemic scenario did not have a profound effect on children’s dental anxiety. Nevertheless, findings in young boys highlight that they may be more vulnerable and require special care to mitigate their anxiety and decrease the risk of dentophobia in the future—these observations must be, however, treated with caution due to the small sample size and require further confirmation. Moreover, it is important to reassure caregivers of the safety of the dental visit during the pandemic to minimize the effect of their own anxiety on dental fears in children.","Olszewska, Aneta; Rzymski, Piotr",J.

Current evidence indicates that the risk of severe illness increases with age, male sex, and with certain chronic medical problems. Many people living with HIV have other conditions that increase their risk. CASE PRESENTATION: In the first 3 months of the pandemic, four patients with HIV were hospitalized in our clinic because of COVID-19. The disease severity was mild in two patients with normal CD4+ T count. However, one patient with a low CD4+T count died and the other developed retinal detachment one month after discharge. The deceased patient had a malignancy. CONCLUSION: In this study, the effect of the immunological status of the patients on the course of COVID-19 and the developing vascular complications were evaluated in 4 patients with HIV.","Turken, Melda; Altan, Hividar; Atalay, Sabri; Kose, Sukran",Current HIV research (Online),314,16

In this single-center study we prospectively acquired and evaluated 100 recorded ten-second cine-loops in confirmed COVID-19 intensive care unit (ICU) patients. All loops were rated by ten observers with different subspeciality backgrounds for four times by each observer (400 loops overall) in a random sequence using a web-based rating tool. We analyzed inter- and intraobserver variability for specific pathologies and a semiquantitative LUS score. Interobserver agreement for both, identification of specific pathologies and assignment of LUS scores was fair to moderate (e.g., LUS score 1 Fleiss' &#954; = 0.27; subpleural consolidations Fleiss' &#954; = 0.59). Intraobserver agreement was mostly moderate to substantial with generally higher agreement for more distinct findings (e.g., lowest LUS score 0 vs. highest LUS score 3 (median Fleiss' &#954; = 0.71 vs. 0.79) or air bronchograms (median Fleiss' &#954; = 0.72)). Intraobserver consistency was relatively low for intermediate LUS scores (e.g. LUS Score 1 median Fleiss' &#954; = 0.52). We therefore conclude that more distinct LUS findings (e.g., air bronchograms, subpleural consolidations) may be more suitable for disease monitoring, especially with more than one investigator and that training material used for LUS in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) should pay refined attention to areas such as B-line quantification and differentiation of intermediate LUS scores.","Lerchbaumer, Markus H; Lauryn, Jonathan H; Bachmann, Ulrike; Enghard, Philipp; Fischer, Thomas; Grune, Jana; Hegemann, Niklas; Khadzhynov, Dmytro; Kruse, Jan Matthias; Lehner, Lukas J; Lindner, Tobias; Oezkan, Timur; Zickler, Daniel; Kuebler, Wolfgang M; Hamm, Bernd; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Muench, Frédéric",Sci Rep,314,26

Using an epitope-tagged Cntd1 allele, we detect a short isoform of CNTD1 in vivo that lacks a predicted N-terminal cyclin domain and does not bind cyclin-dependent kinases. Instead, we find that the short-form CNTD1 variant associates with components of the replication factor C (RFC) machinery to facilitate crossover formation, and with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, CDC34, to regulate ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of the WEE1 kinase, thereby modulating cell-cycle progression. We propose that these interactions facilitate a role for CNTD1 as a stop-go regulator during prophase I, ensuring accurate and complete crossover formation before allowing metaphase progression and the first meiotic division.","Gray, Stephen; Santiago, Emerson R; Chappie, Joshua S; Cohen, Paula E",Cell Rep,314,23

In this perspective, we explore the possible factors that may contribute to mild inflammatory responses in some cases of COVID-19 by focusing on immune education, parasites, sex hormones and chronic diseases, as well as genetic tolerance. To build our perspective, evidence is also extracted from wild rodents due to their multi-tasking immune responses as a result of constant exposure to pathogens.","Munjita, Samuel Munalula; Samutela, Mulemba; Ndashe, Kunda; Munsaka, Sody Mweetwa",Pan Afr.

This clinical presentation has been referred as “long COVID” in the adult population, and an [(18)F]-FDG brain PET hypometabolic pattern has recently been suggested as a biomarker. Herein, we present a retrospective analysis of 7 paediatric patients with suspected long COVID who were explored by [(18)F]-FDG brain PET exam. Metabolic brain findings were confronted to those obtained in adult patients with long COVID, in comparison to their respective age-matched control groups. METHODS: Review of clinical examination and whole-brain voxel-based analysis of [(18)F]-FDG PET metabolism of the 7 children in comparison to 21 paediatric controls, 35 adult patients with long COVID and 44 healthy adult subjects. RESULTS: Despite lower initial severity at the acute stage of the infection, paediatric patients demonstrated on average 5 months later a similar brain hypometabolic pattern as that found in adult long COVID patients, involving bilateral medial temporal lobes, brainstem and cerebellum (p-voxel < 0.001, p-cluster < 0.05 FWE-corrected), and also the right olfactory gyrus after small volume correction (p-voxel = 0.010 FWE-corrected), with partial PET recovery in two children at follow-up. CONCLUSION: These results provide arguments in favour of possible long COVID in children, with a similar functional brain involvement to those found in adults, regardless of age and initial severity.

Since October 2020 the second wave of the pandemic has been observed around the world, as pathogen specific herd immunity has not been built yet. Moreover, the current, more contagious pathogen carrying the D614G mutation has become the globally dominant form of SARS-CoV-2. In this article we present the current state of knowledge on the impact of ACE2 and the reninangiotensin system (RAS) and the innate immune system on different outcomes of COVID-19. Especially, we point out the dual role of the immune system and ACE2 in pathogenesis of the disease. Namely, at the initial stage of the infection anti-viral activity of innate immunity is responsible for inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 replication. On the other hand, a dysregulated immune response may cause the detrimental hyperinflammation (“cytokine storm”) responsible for the severe course of the disease. Concomitantly, we analyse the roles of ACE2 in both facilitation of infection and abrogation of its effects, as the major cellular entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and an important enzyme responsible for tissue protection, respectively. Finally, we discuss the dominant impact of aging on the fatal outcome of COVID-19.","Marcinkiewicz, Janusz; Witkowski, Jacek M.; Olszanecki, Rafał",Cent Eur J Immunol,314,9

Antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein are frequently encoded by IGHV3-53/3-66 with a short complementarity-determining region (CDR) H3. Germline-encoded sequence motifs in heavy chain CDRs H1 and H2 have a major function, but whether any common motifs are present in CDR H3, which is often critical for binding specificity, is not clear. Here, we identify two public clonotypes of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a 9-residue CDR H3 that pair with different light chains. Distinct sequence motifs on CDR H3 are present in the two public clonotypes that seem to be related to differential light chain pairing. Additionally, we show that Y58F is a common somatic hypermutation that results in increased binding affinity of IGHV3-53/3-66 RBD antibodies with a short CDR H3. These results advance understanding of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2.","Tan, Timothy J.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of specimens from the upper and/or lower respiratory tract is the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Radiology and especially high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) are important for diagnosis and follow-up. This narrative review provides an overview of clinical signs and the complex and unique pathophysiology of COVID-19 pneumonia. Radiological features are addressed.

This poses a serious threat that needs to be addressed immediately. Genome analysis of SARS-CoV-2 has revealed its close relation to SARS-coronavirus along with few changes in its spike protein. The spike protein aids in receptor binding and viral entry within the host and therefore represents a potential target for vaccine and therapeutic development. In the current study, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 was explored for potential immunogenic epitopes to design multi-epitope vaccine constructs. The S1 and S2 domains of spike proteins were analyzed, and two vaccine constructs were prioritized with T-cell and B-cell epitopes. We adapted a comprehensive predictive framework to provide novel insights into immunogenic epitopes of spike proteins, which can further be evaluated as potential vaccine candidates against COVID-19. Prioritized epitopes were then modeled using linkers and adjuvants, and respective 3D models were constructed to evaluate their physiochemical properties and their possible interactions with ACE2, HLA Superfamily alleles, TLR2, and TLR4.","Naz, Anam; Shahid, Fatima; Butt, Tariq Tahir; Awan, Faryal Mehwish; Ali, Amjad; Malik, Arif",Front Immunol,314,16

Despite an initial reluctance to perform autopsies due to concerns for aerosolization of viral particles, a large number of autopsy studies published since May 2020 have shed light on the pathophysiology of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This review summarizes the histopathologic findings and clinicopathologic correlations from autopsies and biopsies performed in patients with COVID-19. PubMed and Medline (EBSCO and Ovid) were queried from June 4, 2020 to September 30, 2020 and histopathologic data from autopsy and biopsy studies were collected based on 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 58 studies reporting 662 patients were included. Demographic data, comorbidities at presentation, histopathologic findings, and virus detection strategies by organ system were collected. Diffuse alveolar damage, thromboembolism, and nonspecific shock injury in multiple organs were the main findings in this review. The pathologic findings emerging from autopsy and biopsy studies reviewed herein suggest that in addition to a direct viral effect in some organs, a unifying pathogenic mechanism for COVID-19 is ARDS with its known and characteristic inflammatory response, cytokine release, fever, inflammation, and generalized endothelial disturbance. This study supports the notion that autopsy studies are of utmost importance to our understanding of disease features and treatment effect to increase our knowledge of COVID-19 pathophysiology and contribute to more effective treatment strategies.","Caramaschi, Stefania; Kapp, Meghan E.; Miller, Sara E.; Eisenberg, Rosana; Johnson, Joyce; Epperly, Garretson; Maiorana, Antonino; Silvestri, Guido; Giannico, Giovanna A.",Mod Pathol,314,10

OBJECTIVES: We created a Pandemic Vulnerability Index (PVI) to support counties and municipalities by integrating baseline data on relevant community vulnerabilities with dynamic data on local infection rates and interventions. The PVI visually synthesizes county-level vulnerability indicators, enabling their comparison in regional, state, and nationwide contexts. METHODS: We describe the data streams used and how these are combined to calculate the PVI, detail the supporting epidemiological modeling and machine-learning forecasts, and outline the deployment of an interactive web Dashboard. Finally, we describe the practical application of the PVI for real-world decision-making. RESULTS: Considering an outlook horizon from 1 to 28 days, the overall PVI scores are significantly associated with key vulnerability-related outcome metrics of cumulative deaths, population adjusted cumulative deaths, and the proportion of deaths from cases. The modeling results indicate the most significant predictors of case counts are population size, proportion of black residents, and mean PM(2.5). The machine learning forecast results were strongly predictive of observed cases and deaths up to 14 days ahead. The modeling reinforces an integrated concept of vulnerability that accounts for both dynamic and static data streams and highlights the drivers of inequities in COVID-19 cases and deaths. These results also indicate that local areas with a highly ranked PVI should take near-term action to mitigate vulnerability. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 PVI Dashboard monitors multiple data streams to communicate county-level trends and vulnerabilities and facilitates decision-making and communication among government officials, scientists, community leaders, and the public to enable effective and coordinated action to combat the pandemic.","Marvel, Skylar W.; House, John S.; Wheeler, Matthew; Song, Kuncheng; Zhou, Yihui; Wright, Fred A.; Chiu, Weihsueh A.; Rusyn, Ivan; Motsinger-Reif, Alison; Reif, David M.",medRxiv,314,12

Available genetic diversity constituting the foundation of breeding is essential in plant improvement. Elite varieties, land races, and crop wild species are important resources of useful variation and are available from existing genepools or genebanks. Conservation of diversity in genepools, genebanks, and even the wild is crucial in preventing the loss of variation for future breeding efforts. In addition, the identification of suitable parental lines and alleles is critical in ensuring the development of resilient Brassica crops. During the past two decades, an increasing number of high-quality nuclear and organellar Brassica genomes have been assembled. Whole-genome re-sequencing and the development of pan-genomes are overcoming the limitations of the single reference genome and provide the basis for further exploration. Genomic and complementary omic tools such as microarrays, transcriptomics, epigenetics, and reverse genetics facilitate the study of crop evolution, breeding histories, and the discovery of loci associated with highly sought-after agronomic traits. Furthermore, in genomic selection, predicted breeding values based on phenotype and genome-wide marker scores allow the preselection of promising genotypes, enhancing genetic gains and substantially quickening the breeding cycle. It is clear that genomics, armed with diversity, is set to lead the way in Brassica improvement; however, a multidisciplinary plant breeding approach that includes phenotype = genotype × environment × management interaction will ultimately ensure the selection of resilient Brassica varieties ready for climate change.","Mohd Saad, Nur Shuhadah; Severn-Ellis, Anita A.; Pradhan, Aneeta; Edwards, David; Batley, Jacqueline",Front Genet,314,1
662715,662715,662715,Just a little bit more patience…,20.896896,11.164576,2020-05-13,"BACKGROUND: Opinion polls on vaccination intentions suggest that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is increasing worldwide; however, the usefulness of opinion polls to prepare mass vaccination campaigns for specific new vaccines and to estimate acceptance in a country's population is limited. We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18–64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18–64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10 000 or 1 in 100 000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (28·8%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (71·2%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 29·4% (95% CI 28·6–30·2) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10 000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 27·4% [26·8–28·0]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100 000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 61·3% [60·5–62·1]). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance depends on the characteristics of new vaccines and the national vaccination strategy, among various other factors, in the working-age population in France.
