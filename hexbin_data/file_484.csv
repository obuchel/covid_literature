Neutralizing antibodies reduce the severity of RSV-associated disease, but are not sufficient for preventing reinfection. In contrast, the role of memory CD8 T cells in protecting against a secondary RSV infection is less established. We recently demonstrated that high-magnitude memory CD8 T cells efficiently reduced lung viral titers following RSV infection, but induced fatal immunopathology that was mediated by IFN-γ. To evaluate the ability of RSV-specific neutralizing antibodies to prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology, mice with high-magnitude memory CD8 T cell responses were treated with neutralizing antibodies prior to RSV challenge. Neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduced morbidity and prevented mortality following RSV challenge compared with IgG-treated controls. Neutralizing antibody treatment restricted early virus replication, which caused a substantial reduction in memory CD8 T cell activation and IFN-γ production, directly resulting in survival. In contrast, therapeutic neutralizing antibody administration did not impact morbidity, mortality, or IFN-γ levels, despite significantly reducing lung viral titers. Therefore, only pre-existing neutralizing antibodies prevent memory CD8 T cell-mediated immunopathology following RSV infection. Overall, our results have important implications for the development of future RSV vaccines.","Schmidt, Megan E.; Meyerholz, David K.; Varga, Steven M.",Mucosal Immunol,484,1

We describe perioperative management for innominate artery transection in a case with TIF. CASE PRESENTATION: A 4-year-old Japanese female with Marshal-Smith syndrome presented for management of TIF. She underwent tracheostomy at the age of 3 months and an uncuffed tracheostomy tube was inserted. One month before admission to our hospital, intermittent tracheal bleeding, suggesting TIF, occurred. Although we considered to change to a cuffed endotracheal tube, craniofacial abnormality suggested difficult oral intubation, and there was a possibility of rebleeding. Finally, innominate artery transection was performed under total intravenous anesthesia without changing the tracheostomy tube. Surgery completed uneventfully and she received mechanical ventilation under sedation for a day, followed by weaning without complications. CONCLUSIONS: A cuffed tracheostomy tube should have been inserted before surgery for effective hemostasis against sudden bleeding from TIF even though conversion to oral intubation was difficult.","Noguchi, Satoko; Saito, Junichi; Kawaguchi, Jun; Kushikata, Tetsuya; Hirota, Kazuyoshi",JA Clin Rep,484,1

The present study assessed vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) carriage rates in patients admitted to our tertiary care hospital. Stool samples sent for routine culturing were screened with vancomycin containing solid or broth enrichment media. VRE isolates were identified with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry and antibiotic susceptibilities were tested by E-test. Vancomycin resistance genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction. Medical records of carriers were examined for suspected risk factors for colonization. Altogether 3025 stool specimens were analyzed. Solid media identified a VRE carriage rate of 2.2% while broth enrichment detected 5.8%. Seventy percent of the isolates were Enterococcus faecium. VanB genotype was detected in 38.2%, VanA in 37.3%, VanC1 in 22.6%, and VanC2 in 1.9%. All VRE were sensitive to linezolid, daptomycin, and tigecycline. Collective risk factors for carriage were diabetes, normal flora absence, Clostridioides difficile positivity, longer hospital stay, and advanced age. 78.5% of the carriers received antibiotic therapy which was metronidazole in most cases (47.3%). We recommend regular screening of risk groups such as patients with diabetes, history of recent hospitalization, or former C. difficile infection as an imperative step for preventing VRE dissemination.","Franyó, Dorottya; Kocsi, Balázs; Bukta, Evelin Erzsébet; Szabó, Judit; Dombrádi, Zsuzsanna",Folia Microbiol (Praha),484,1

Here, we describe a cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids. By using chiral cobalt catalyst bearing electron-donating diphosphine ligand, high activity (up to 1860 TON) and excellent enantioselectivity (up to >99% ee) are observed. Furthermore, the cobalt-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation is successfully applied to a broad spectrum of α,β-unsaturated carboxylic acids, such as various α-aryl and α-alkyl cinnamic acid derivatives, α-oxy-functionalized α,β-unsaturated acids, α-substituted acrylic acids and heterocyclic α,β-unsaturated acids (30 examples). The synthetic utility of the protocol is highlighted by the synthesis of key intermediates for chiral drugs (6 cases). Preliminary mechanistic studies reveal that the carboxy group may be involved in the control of the reactivity and enantioselectivity through an interaction with the metal centre.","Du, Xiaoyong; Xiao, Ye; Huang, Jia-Ming; Zhang, Yao; Duan, Ya-Nan; Wang, Heng; Shi, Chuan; Chen, Gen-Qiang; Zhang, Xumu",Nat Commun,484,1

Targeted temperature management (TTM) is the only strategy shown to reduce the risk of neurologic disability cardiac arrest patients. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of TTM with an emphasis on recent trials. RECENT FINDINGS: After early studies demonstrating the benefit of TTM in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to a shockable rhythm, newer studies have extended the benefit of TTM to patients with a nonshockable rhythm and in-hospital cardiac arrest. A target temperature of 33 °C was not superior to 36 °C, suggesting that a lenient targeted temperature may be appropriate especially for patients unable to tolerate lower temperatures. Although early initiation of TTM appears to be beneficial, the benefit of prehospital cooling has not been shown and use of intravenous cold saline in the prehospital setting may be harmful. SUMMARY: There is substantial risk of neurological injury in cardiac arrest survivors who remain comatose. TTM is an effective treatment that can lower the risk of neurological disability in such patients and ideally delivered as part of a comprehensive, goal-directed post-resuscitation management by a multidisciplinary team in a tertiary medical center.","Rasmussen, Tyler P.; Bullis, T.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective case-series performed at the Shiley Eye Institute, University of California San Diego, USA. Electronically pulled data of 2444 surgeries revealed 147 surgeries on 133 very elderly patients. Chart review was conducted for all very elderly and corresponding control patients (75–84 years old). The first operated eyes of patients with final best-corrected visual acuity ≥20/40, axial length (AL) 22–26 mm, and implanted SN60WF IOL were included. Patients with ocular comorbidities and/or intra- or post-operative complications were excluded. Prediction errors of refractive outcome and percentage of eyes within ±0.50D and ±1.00D were compared between the groups for the Holladay 1 and Barrett Universal II (Barrett) formulas. Logistic regression analysis for achievement of ±1.00D was conducted. RESULTS: Final analysis included 90 eyes (n = 44, very elderly, n = 46, control patients). Median absolute refractive error (MedAE) with Holladay 1, but not Barrett formula, was significantly higher in the older group (p = 0.02 and p = 0.07, respectively). The MedAE in the older group was lower using the Barrett compared to Holladay 1 (p = 0.02). Fewer older patients than younger patients achieved refraction within ±0.50D and ±1.00D from goal, using the Holladay 1 (p = 0.049 and p = 0.002 respectively). Logistic regression analysis supported the relationship between Holladay 1 predictive refractive error of >1.00D and patient’s age (p = 0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Very elderly patients undergoing cataract surgery may be prone to reduced refractive precision, particularly with utilization of the Holladay 1 formula.","Sella, Ruti; Chou, Linda; Schuster, Alexander K.; Gali, Helena E.; Weinreb, Robert N.; Afshari, Natalie A.",Eye (Lond),484,1

Tumors are heterogeneous, with different clusters of cells expressing different genes and exhibiting different behaviors. 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO) and arecoline were used to induce oral cancer in mice, and the main factors for gene expression influencing carcinogenesis were identified through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Male C57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups: a control group (receiving normal drinking water) and treatment group (receiving drinking water containing 4-NQO (200 mg/L) and arecoline (500 mg/L)) to induce the malignant development of oral cancer. Mice were sacrificed at 8, 16, 20, and 29 weeks. Except for mice sacrificed at 8 weeks, all mice were treated for 16 weeks and then either sacrificed or given normal drinking water for the remaining weeks. Tongue lesions were excised, and all cells obtained from mice in the 29- and 16-week treatment groups were clustered into 17 groups by using the Louvain algorithm. Cells in subtypes 7 (stem cells) and 9 (keratinocytes) were analyzed through gene set enrichment analysis. Results indicated that their genes were associated with the MYC_targets_v1 pathway, and this finding was confirmed by the presence of cisplatin-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell lines. These cell subtype biomarkers can be applied for the detection of patients with precancerous lesions, the identification of high-risk populations, and as a treatment target.","Huang, Ling-Yu; Hsieh, Yi-Ping; Wang, Yen-Yun; Hwang, Daw-Yang; Jiang, Shih Sheng; Huang, Wen-Tsung; Chiang, Wei-Fan; Liu, Ko-Jiunn; Huang, Tze-Ta",Int J Mol Sci,484,1

This situation is associated with a loss of food sovereignty and an increasing reliance on nutritionally poor food imports. A policy goal, therefore, is to improve local diets through improved local production of nutritious foods. Our aim in this study was to develop methods and collect preliminary data on the relationships between where people source their food, their socio-demographic characteristics and dietary quality in Fiji and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG) in order to inform further work towards this policy goal. We developed a toolkit of methods to collect individual-level data, including measures of dietary intake, food sources, socio-demographic and health indicators. Individuals aged ≥15 years were eligible to participate. From purposively sampled urban and rural areas, we recruited 186 individuals from 95 households in Fiji, and 147 individuals from 86 households in SVG. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used to investigate associations. The mean dietary diversity score, out of 10, was 3.7 (SD1.4) in Fiji and 3.8 (SD1.5) in SVG. In both settings, purchasing was the most common way of sourcing food. However, 68% (Fiji) and 45% (SVG) of participants regularly (>weekly) consumed their own produce, and 5% (Fiji) and 33% (SVG) regularly consumed borrowed/exchanged/bartered food. In regression models, independent positive associations with dietary diversity (DD) were: borrowing/exchanging/bartering food (β = 0.73 (0.21, 1.25)); age (0.01 (0.00, 0.03)); and greater than primary education (0.44 (0.06, 0.82)). DD was negatively associated with small shop purchasing (−0.52 (95% CIs −0.91, −0.12)) and rural residence (−0.46 (−0.92, 0.00)).

In vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities of the 70% ethanolic extract (Et-E) of the aerial parts of the plant were determined. The Dichloromethane Fraction (DCM-F) and the n-Butanol Fraction (Bu-F) were assessed using Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The DCM-F showed higher antiviral activities against Coxsackie B4 (CoxB4) viruses (IC(50) = 64.13 µg/mL) and adenoviruses (IC(50) = 54.88 µg/mL) than acyclovir (IC(50) = 72.79 µg/mL for CoxB4 viruses; IC(50) = 91.92 µg/mL for adenoviruses). The DCM-F showed higher anti-helicobacter pylori activity (MIC = 3.9 µg/mL) than clarithromycin (MIC = 1.95 µg/mL). The DCM-F inhibited Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) Type I (IC(50) = 29.85 µg/mL) and HSV Type II (IC(50) = 74.17 µg/mL). The Bu-F showed higher anti-mycobacterial activity (MIC = 7.81 µg/mL) than isoniazid (MIC = 0.24 µg/mL) and higher antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)(MIC = 7.81 µg/mL) than vancomycin (MIC = 3.9 µg/mL). Antioxidant assays included total antioxidant capacity (TAC), 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), and iron reducing power. The Bu-F showed the highest antioxidant activity. Chemical profiles were analyzed using HPLC-HR–ESI–MS to identify the metabolites responsible for these biological activities.

Spatial and temporal regulation of kinesin activity is essential for building these local environments via control of intracellular cargo distribution. Kinesin-binding protein (KBP) interacts with a subset of kinesins via their motor domains, inhibits their microtubule (MT) attachment, and blocks their cellular function. However, its mechanisms of inhibition and selectivity have been unclear. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal the structure of KBP and of a KBP–kinesin motor domain complex. KBP is a tetratricopeptide repeat-containing, right-handed α-solenoid that sequesters the kinesin motor domain’s tubulin-binding surface, structurally distorting the motor domain and sterically blocking its MT attachment. KBP uses its α-solenoid concave face and edge loops to bind the kinesin motor domain, and selected structure-guided mutations disrupt KBP inhibition of kinesin transport in cells. The KBP-interacting motor domain surface contains motifs exclusively conserved in KBP-interacting kinesins, suggesting a basis for kinesin selectivity.","Atherton, Joseph; Hummel, Jessica JA; Olieric, Natacha; Locke, Julia; Peña, Alejandro; Rosenfeld, Steven S; Steinmetz, Michel O; Hoogenraad, Casper C; Moores, Carolyn A",,484,1

The purpose of this investigation was to describe the effects of 4 weeks of explosive strength training cessation after an 8-week concurrent training protocol. Eight runners completed this study, which first included either plyometric (n = 4) or dynamic weight training (n = 4) in addition to the usual running regimen. Explosive strength training was thereafter interrupted for 4 weeks, during which running sessions were maintained. Participants were tested at baseline, after concurrent training and after concurrent training cessation. The results suggest that the energy cost of running improvements observed after the intervention (−5.75%; 95% CI = −8.47 to −3.03) were maintained once explosive strength training was interrupted (−6.31%; 95% CI = −10.30 to −2.32). The results also suggest that neuromuscular performances were maintained after 4 weeks of concurrent training cessation, especially when tests were specific to the training intervention. Furthermore, a 3000m time trial revealed a similar pattern, with improvements after the concurrent mesocycle (−2.40%; 95% CI = −4.65 to −0.16) and after concurrent training cessation (−4.43%; 95% CI = −6.83 to −2.03). Overall, only trivial changes were observed for aerobic endurance and [Formula: see text]. Together, these results suggest that short-term explosive strength training cessation might be beneficial and could be considered as a taper strategy for middle-distance runners.

More serious than is thought, corneal infection by herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) is a prevalent yet silent cause of blindness in both the paediatric and adult population, especially if immunodeficient. Globally, there are 1.5 million new cases and forty thousand visual impairment cases reported yearly. The Herpetic Eye Disease Study recommends topical antiviral as the front-line therapy for HSV keratitis. Ironically, topical eye solutions undergo rapid nasolacrimal clearance, which necessitates oral drugs but there is a catch of systemic toxicity. The hurdle of antiviral penetration to reach an effective concentration is further complicated by drugs’ poor permeability and complex layers of ocular barriers. In this current review, novel delivery approaches for ocular herpetic infection, including nanocarriers, prodrugs, and peptides are widely investigated, with special focus on advantages, challenges, and recent updates on in situ gelling systems of ocular HSV infections. In general congruence, the novel drug delivery systems play a vital role in prolonging the ocular drug residence time to achieve controlled release of therapeutic agents at the application site, thus allowing superior ocular bioavailability yet fewer systemic side effects. Moreover, in situ gel functions synergistically with nanocarriers, prodrugs, and peptides. The findings support that novel drug delivery systems have potential in ophthalmic drug delivery of antiviral agents, and improve patient convenience when prolonged and chronic topical ocular deliveries are intended.","Pandey, Manisha; Choudhury, Hira; Abdul-Aziz, Azila; Bhattamisra, Subrat Kumar; Gorain, Bapi; Su, Jocelyn Sziou Ting; Tan, Choo Leey; Chin, Woon Yee; Yip, Khar Yee",Pharmaceutics,484,1

Current studies concerning AMR have mainly focused on the diagnostic value of immunoglobulin G (IgG)-type donor-specific antihuman leukocyte antigen antibodies (DSAs), primarily because of their antigen specificity, whereas the clinical significance of immunoglobulin M (IgM)-type DSAs has not been thoroughly investigated in the context of organ transplantation because of their nonspecificity against antigens. Although consensus regarding the clinical significance and role of IgM antibodies is not clear, as discussed in this review, recent findings strongly suggest that they also have a huge potential in novel diagnostic as well as therapeutic application for the prevention of AMR. Most serum IgM antibodies are known to comprise natural antibodies with low affinity toward antigens, and this is derived from B-1 cells (innate B cells). However, some of the serum IgM-type antibodies reportedly also produced by B-2 cells (conventional B cells). The latter are known to have a high affinity for donor-specific antigens. In this review, we initially discuss how IgM-type antibodies of different origins participate in the pathology of various diseases, directly or through cell surface receptors, complement activation, or cytokine production. Then, we discuss the clinical applicability of B-1 and B-2 cell-derived IgM-type antibodies for controlling AMR with reference to the involvement of IgM antibodies in various pathological conditions.","Matsuda, Yoshiko; Hiramitsu, Takahisa; Li, Xiao-kang; Watanabe, Takeshi",Pathogens,484,1

Several studies have reported adverse clinical outcomes of influenza among obese individuals. Our aim was to examine the association between obesity and the clinical outcomes of hospitalized adult patients ill with seasonal influenza. Consecutive hospitalized adult patients between 10/2017 and 4/2018 with laboratory confirmed influenza A and B were divided into an obese group (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m(2)) and controls. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of 30-day all-cause mortality, vasopressor use, mechanical ventilation, ICU admission, and severe influenza complication (myocarditis and encephalitis). Secondary outcomes encompassed all the components of the primary outcome, 90-day all-cause mortality, occurrence of pneumonia, length of hospital stay, and 90-day readmission rates. The study comprised 512 hospitalized adults diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (195/512) and B (317/512). Within this group, 17% (86/512) were classified obese; the remaining 83% (426/512) were controls. Results of the composite outcome (7/85, 8% vs. 45/422, 11%; p=0.5) and the crude 30-day all-cause mortality rate (5/86, 6% vs. 34/426, 8%, p=0.5) were similar between the two groups. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that obesity was not a significant risk factor for influenza adverse events (OR=1.3, CI 95% 0.3–3.3; p=0.5), whereas advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and hypoalbuminemia were significant risk factors (OR=1.03, OR=2.7, and OR=5.4, respectively). Obesity was not associated with influenza-related morbidity and mortality among the hospitalized adults during the 2017–2018 influenza season. Further studies researching different influenza seasons are essential.","Atamna, Alaa; Daskal, Ron; Babich, Tanya; Ayada, Gida; Ben-Zvi, Haim; Elis, Avishay; Bishara, Jihad; Avni, Tomer",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,484,1

Faced with these opportunities, research on biostimulant properties of cyanobacteria has undergone a significant growth in recent years. However, research in this field is still scarce, especially as regards the number of investigated cyanobacterial species. Future research should focus on reducing the costs of cyanobacterial biomass production and plant treatment and on identifying the molecules that mediate the biostimulant effects in order to optimize their content and stability in the final product. Furthermore, the extension of agronomic trials to a wider number of plant species, different application doses, and environmental conditions would allow the development of tailored microbial biostimulants, thus facilitating the diffusion of these products among farmers.","Santini, Gaia; Biondi, Natascia; Rodolfi, Liliana; Tredici, Mario R.",Plants (Basel),484,1

Thus, a desirable neighborhood should ideally be green and walkable at the same time. Yet, limited research exists on the prevalence of such “sweet spot” neighborhoods. We sought to investigate this question in the context of a large metropolitan city (i.e., Sydney) in Australia. Methods: Using suburb level normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), percentage urban greenspace, Walk Score(®) (Walk Score, Seattle, WA, USA), and other data, we explored the global and local relationships of neighborhood-level greenness, urban green space (percent park area) with walkability applying both non-spatial and spatial modeling. Results: We found an overall negative relationship between walkability and greenness (measured as NDVI). Most neighborhoods (represented by suburbs) in Sydney are either walkable or green, but not both. Sweet spot neighborhoods that did exist were green but only somewhat walkable. In addition, many neighborhoods were both less green and somewhat walkable. Moreover, we observed a significant positive relationship between percentage park area and walkability. These results indicate walkability and greenness have inverse and, at best, mixed associations in the Sydney metropolitan area. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates an overall negative relationship between greenness and walkability, with significant local variability. With ongoing efforts towards greening Sydney and improving walkability, more neighborhoods may eventually be transformed into becoming greener and more walkable.","Shuvo, Faysal Kabir; Mazumdar, Soumya; Labib, S.

These rationally designed new treatment methods have the potential to change the therapeutic landscape in multiple myeloma and improve the long-term survival outcome. ABSTRACT: SeverFigurel cellular elements of the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in multiple myeloma (MM) patients contribute to the immune evasion, proliferation, and drug resistance of MM cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), tumor-associated M2-like, “alternatively activated” macrophages, CD38+ regulatory B-cells (Bregs), and regulatory T-cells (Tregs). These immunosuppressive elements in bidirectional and multi-directional crosstalk with each other inhibit both memory and cytotoxic effector T-cell populations as well as natural killer (NK) cells. Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs), protease inhibitors (PI), monoclonal antibodies (MoAb), adoptive T-cell/NK cell therapy, and inhibitors of anti-apoptotic signaling pathways have emerged as promising therapeutic platforms that can be employed in various combinations as part of a rationally designed immunomodulatory strategy against an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) in MM. These platforms provide the foundation for a new therapeutic paradigm for achieving improved survival of high-risk newly diagnosed as well as relapsed/refractory MM patients. Here we review the scientific rationale and clinical proof of concept for each of these platforms.","Uckun, Fatih M.",Cancers (Basel),484,1

The successful synthesis of designed compounds (intermediaries and finals) was proved by complete spectroscopic analyses. In order to study the in silico interaction of NO-IND-OXDs with cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, a molecular docking study, using AutoDock 4.2.6 software, was performed. Moreover, their biological characterization, based on in vitro assays, in terms of thermal denaturation of serum proteins, antioxidant effects and the NO releasing capacity, was also performed. Based on docking results, 8k, 8l and 8m proved to be the best interaction for the COX-2 (cyclooxygense-2) target site, with an improved docking score compared with celecoxib. Referring to the thermal denaturation of serum proteins and antioxidant effects, all the tested compounds were more active than IND and aspirin, used as references.

The present study aimed to examine the effect of physical health on quality of life among older individuals in the context of Chinese culture and explore the potential mediating roles of positive cognition and negative emotions in the association between physical health and quality of life. Data were from the wave of 2017–2018 of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Data on physical health, quality of life, positive cognition, and negative emotions of 15,874 older people were included in the present study. Pathway analysis was conducted by using IBM SPSS AMOS 21.0, and double verified using PROCESS Macro for SPSS 3.5.3. Results showed that physical health was positively associated with quality of life among older individuals in the context of Chinese culture. The effect size was small to moderate. Positive cognition and negative emotions independently and serially mediated the linkage of physical health and quality of life. These findings provided empirical evidence for the activating event-belief-consequence theory of emotion and hierarchy of needs theory and indicated that Chinese older people focused more on physical health rather than mental health.

Pollen and plant food allergens of the family 10 of pathogenesis‐related proteins bind a variety of small molecules such as glycosylated flavonoid derivatives, flavonoids, cytokinins, and steroids in vitro. However, their natural ligand binding was reported to be highly specific. Insect and mammalian lipocalins transport odorants, pheromones, catecholamines, and fatty acids with a similar level of specificity, while the food allergen β‐lactoglobulin from cow's milk is notably more promiscuous. Non‐specific lipid transfer proteins from pollen and plant foods bind a wide variety of lipids, from phospholipids to fatty acids, as well as sterols and prostaglandin B2, aided by the high plasticity and flexibility displayed by their lipid‐binding cavities. Ligands increase the stability of allergens to thermal and/or proteolytic degradation. They can also act as immunomodulatory agents that favor a Th2 polarization.

Two key aspects of this interface to be discussed are the encoding of the algebraic hierarchy as a class hierarchy and a mechanism to support the combination of algebraic types as a new type. Existing libraries, if encoding the algebraic hierarchy at all, use runtime value checks to determine if two elements belong to the same ring for an incorrect false sense of type safety in an otherwise statically-typed language. On the contrary, our template metaprogramming mechanism provides true compile-time type safety and compile-time code generation.

An important literature has accompanied this evolution. In this review, an international panel of experts assessed potential benefits of NHF in different areas of acute respiratory failure management. Analyses of the physiological effects of NHF indicate flow-dependent improvement in various respiratory function parameters. These beneficial effects allow some patients with severe acute hypoxemic respiratory failure to avoid intubation and improve their outcome. They require close monitoring to not delay intubation. Such a delay may worsen outcome. The ROX index may help clinicians decide when to intubate. In immunocompromised patients, NHF reduces the need for intubation but does not impact mortality. Beneficial physiological effects of NHF have also been reported in patients with chronic respiratory failure, suggesting a possible indication in acute hypercapnic respiratory failure. When intubation is required, NHF can be used to pre-oxygenate patients either alone or in combination with non-invasive ventilation (NIV). Similarly, NHF reduces reintubation alone in low-risk patients and in combination with NIV in high-risk patients. NHF may be used in the emergency department in patients who would not be offered intubation and can be better tolerated than NIV.

The renin angiotensin system (RAS) may mediate this inflammatory cascade after RT. Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor used to treat hypertension and has good blood-brain barrier penetration. By blocking RAS activation, ramipril reduces neuro-inflammation and preclinical data show that ramipril administration during RT can prevent RICD. METHODS: WF-1801 is an ongoing feasibility study that will enroll a total of 75 patients. Patients ≥ 18 with newly diagnosed and pathologically confirmed GBM who will receive chemoradiation are eligible. All participants take ramipril daily during RT and for 4 months thereafter. Ramipril is titrated from 1.25mg to 5mg daily over 3 weeks. A cognitive battery that includes the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Trail Making Test (TMT), and Controlled Oral Word Association test (COWA) is administered at baseline, end of RT, and 1-month and 4-months post-RT. The co-primary endpoints are retention rate (with retention defined as compliance with > 75% of drug therapy doses) and neurocognitive function at 1-month post-RT. To estimate the effect of ramipril on cognitive function, performance on the cognitive battery will be compared to a historical control (cognitive data from the control arm of RTOG 0825). ApoE genotyping is being performed as a correlative study. RESULTS: 31 of a planned 75 participants have been enrolled over 14 months. 20 of 31 (64.5%) are male. 21 (67.7%) are between the age of 40-64. 20 (95.6%) are white and 29 (93.6%) are not Hispanic or Latino. CONCLUSION: Despite a pause in accrual due to COVID-19, we are easily meeting planned accrual goals. Community oncology-based clinical trials of interventions to prevent cognitive toxicity appear to be feasible. GBM patients seem eager to enroll in studies seeking to prevent cognitive decline.

This project studied the impact of health emergency preparedness exercises (HEPEs) on the response to a mass casualty terrorist incident. The mixed methods study design was adopted comprising an on-line survey and follow up individual interviews. Participants were healthcare staff who took part in responses to three major terrorist incidents in the UK in 2017. Descriptive statistics and analysis of variance were undertaken with quantitative data. Content and thematic analysis methods were used for qualitative data analysis. The online survey generated 86 responses; 79 (92%) were from the responders to the Manchester Arena bombing. Twenty-one survey respondents shared their experiences in in-depth interviews. Healthcare staff who took part in HEPEs felt better prepared to respond than those who did not attend an exercise. The most commonly reported benefits from HEPEs were awareness of major incident plans and having the opportunity to practice responding to a similar scenario in the recent exercise. Specific benefits included: improved coordination of the response through adherence to recently practiced incident plans; confidence with response roles; real-time modifications of the response and support provided to staff who did not take part in exercises. Exercise recency was highlighted as an important facilitating factor. The study provides strong objective evidence that the response to a mass casualty terrorist incident was enhanced by training and service development achieved through HEPEs.,"Skryabina, Elena A.; Betts, Naomi; Reedy, Gabriel; Riley, Paul; Amlôt, Richard",Int J Disaster Risk Reduct,484,1

This infiltration may appear months in advance as an isolated sign of extramedullary relapse and considered as one of the significant clinical findings of central nervous system leukemia. AIM: To describe a case of rapidly progressive optic nerve infiltration in a girl with ALL in remission. CASE: A 13-year-old girl in full remission following treatment for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented with decreased vision and proptosis on the left eye. She completed the chemotherapy course two years before. On physical examination, we found the optic disc swelling in her left eyes. There were no signs of relapse from the hematological, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and bone marrow aspiration. The orbital CT found a mass on the left retrobulbar (size 29x48x32 mm), suspected of optic nerve glioma. The mass has grown rapidly in a month, and she lost her left sight. The involved eye was exenterated (60x55x40 mm). The histopathology and immunohistochemistry showed the B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma. Unfortunately, the patient could not come for further follow up due to the COVID-19 large-scale social distancing. Two months later, she came with pallor and pain in all of her body. The bone marrow aspiration showed leukemic relapse and she is undergoing chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Optic nerve infiltration by leukemia requires both diagnostic certainty and urgent management. A routine ophthalmic assessment is recommended in patients with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia to diagnose optic nerve involvement due to leukemic infiltration.","Rahmartani, Ludi Dhyani",Neuro Oncol,484,12

The result of RT-LAMP could also be visualized directly with the naked eye by adding the intercalating dye Picogreen. The RT-LAMP was identified to detect only the PRRSV in all viruses tested, which demonstrated the high specificity. By using various sample dilutions as templates, the sensitivity of RT-LAMP was found to be 100-fold higher than that of RT-PCR and could be comparable to the fluorescence quantitative RT-PCR. A comparison was obtained by the RT-LAMP and PCR assays using 20 clinical samples.

Method : We include all studies that reported the prevalence of PTSD during and after coronavirus pandemics and search databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar from first of November 2002 to May 18, 2020. Two authors independently use relevant checklists to quality assessment of the included studies and extract data. We use the graphical methods and fixed or random effect models to aggregate prevalence estimates. Also, we will assess heterogeneity between the included studies using the I2 heterogeneity statistic and use subgroup and sensitivity analysis to assess the sources of heterogeneity. Discussion: We infer that PTSD is a common experience during and after infectious disease pandemics, especially COVID-19.

Here, we characterized and quantified SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in patients with different clinical courses. Compared to individuals with a mild clinical presentation, CD4+ T-cell responses were qualitatively impaired in critically ill patients. Strikingly, however, in these patients the specific IgG antibody response was remarkably strong. Furthermore, in these critically ill patients, a massive influx of circulating T cells into the lungs was observed, overwhelming the local T-cell compartment, and indicative of vascular leakage.

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31 × 109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29 × 109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48 × 109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39 × 109/L. In the four studies (n = 1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Henry, Brandon Michael",Clin Chim Acta,484,16

Similarly, there has been strong interest in estimating the proportion of a population expected to hold a given characteristics (`having or having had the virus'). Taking the cue from the many related discussions on the media, in addition to those to which we took part, we analyze these questions from a probabilistic perspective (`Bayesian'), considering several effects that play a role in evaluating the probabilities of interest. The resulting paper, written with didactic intent, is rather general and not strictly related to pandemics: the basic ideas of Bayesian inference are introduced and the uncertainties on the performances of the tests are treated using the metrological concepts of `systematics', and are propagated into the quantities of interest following the rules of probability theory; the separation of `statistical' and `systematic' contributions to the uncertainty on the inferred proportion of infectees allows to optimize the sample size; the role of `priors', often overlooked, is stressed, however recommending the use of `flat priors', since the resulting posterior distribution can be `reshaped' by an `informative prior' in a later step; details on the calculations are given, also deriving useful approximated formulae, the tough work being however done with the help of direct Monte Carlo simulations and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, implemented in R and JAGS (relevant code provided in appendix).","D'Agostini, Giulio; Esposito, Alfredo",,484,1

METHODS: Patients requiring a minimum of 14 days' stay in the ICU with mechanical ventilation were included. Nutrition status was assessed at inclusion (ICU discharge) and follow-up (after 15, 30, and 60 days). All patients had standardized medical nutrition therapy with defined targets regarding energy (30 kcal/kg/d) and protein intake (1.5 g/kg/d). RESULTS: Fifteen patients were included (67% males); the median age was 60 (33-75) years old. Body mass index at ICU admission was 25.7 (IQR, 24-31) kg/m². After a median ICU stay of 33 (IQR, 26-39) days, malnutrition was present in all patients (11.3% median weight loss and/or low muscle mass based on handgrip strength measurement).

Here we explore data collected early in the pandemic to examine what factors might drive this relation. We focus on political affiliation. Given the functional account of boredom as a call to action, we hypothesized that this urge to act may drive individuals towards outlets replete with symbolic value (e.g., ideology, identity). In addition, given the politicization of some social distancing rules (e.g., mask wearing), we explored whether those who adhere to strong political ideologies-particularly conservative ideologies-would be more likely to rule-break. Moderation analyses indicated that boredom proneness and social (but not fiscal) conservatism were indeed predictive of rule-breaking. These results highlight the need for both clear messaging emphasizing the strength of communal identity and action (i.e., that ""We are all in this together"") and for interventions that emphasize shared collective values in contexts that appeal directly to social conservatives.","Brosowsky, Nicholaus P; Van Tilburg, Wijnand; Scholer, Abigail A; Boylan, James; Seli, Paul; Danckert, James",Motiv Emot,484,1

Recently it has also been identified as possible therapeutic option in combating COVID-19. However, the use of HCQ is known to induce cytotoxicity. In 2020, we developed a multiscale absorption and transit (MAT) toolkit to simulate the dissolution, transport, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of orally administered drugs in the human GIT at multiple levels. MAT was constructed by integrating the spatially accurate first-principles driven high-fidelity drug transport, dissolution, and absorption model in the human stomach and GIT using the recently published Quasi-3D framework. The computational results showed that MAT was able to match the experimental concentration results better than the traditional compartmental models. In this study, we adapted MAT, to predict the pharmacokinetics of orally delivered HCQ in healthy subjects. The computational results matched the experimental concentration results. The simulated stomach and intestinal fluid and enterocyte concentrations were compared with the in vitro CC50 values. While the peak enterocyte concentrations were several orders lower than the in vitro CC50 values, the peak stomach and the intestinal fluid concentrations were only one order smaller than the in vitro CC50 values. In particular, the peak stomach and the duodenum fluid concentrations were just 3× smaller than the in vitro CC50 values. This implies that the lumen walls are much more susceptible to cytotoxicity-based damage than the enterocyte layers. We envision that MAT can be used to optimize the dosing regimen of HCQ by maximizing its bioavailability, while simultaneously minimizing the cytotoxic damage.","Kannan, Ravishekar; Przekwas, Andrzej",Int J Numer Method Biomed Eng,484,16

MAIN TEXT: Having to make such decisions certainly entails substantial difficulties, and that has led many health care professional to seek ethical guidance. The Italian Society of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) has attempted to meet that growing need by a set of recommendations, applying ""clinical soundness"" as a beacon standard; that approach tends to prioritize patients with higher life expectancy, which could be characterized as a ""moderately utilitarian"" approach. Yet, such a selection has engendered daunting ethical quandaries. The authors believe it can only be warranted and acceptable if rooted in a transparent decision-making process and verifiable, reviewed criteria. Moreover, the authors have stressed how clinical experimentation in a pandemic setting is a subtext of great interest from an ethical perspective. In Italy, no drug therapy and trials were undertaken for COVID-19 patients for a rather long period of time. When the epidemic was already circulating, an intervention proved necessary on the system of administrative procedures, aimed at expediting the authorization and validation of protocols, then bogged down by bureaucracy. A new system has since been instituted by a government decree that was signed about one month after the first Covid-19 case was officially recorded in the country. Such a swift implementation, which took just a few weeks, is noteworthy and proves that clinical trials can be initiated in a timely fashion, even with a pandemic unfolding. The concerted, action of supportive care and RCTs is the only way to attain effective forms of treatments for COVID-19 and any other future outbreak. CONCLUSIONS: The authors have arrived at the conclusion that the most effective and ethically sound response on the part of any national health care system would be to adequately reconfigure its organizational mechanisms, by making clinical trials and all related administrative procedures consistent with the current state of emergency.","Marinelli, Enrico; Busardò, Francesco Paolo; Zaami, Simona",BMC Med Ethics,484,16

The variables most clearly associated with a greater hazard of death were age (3% HR increase per 1-year increase in age; 95%CI 1-6), diabetes mellitus (HR 2.42, 95%CI 1.43-4.09), SatO2/FiO2 ratio (43% HR reduction per 1-point increase; 95%CI 23-57), SOFA score (19% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 5-34) and CURB-65 score (76% HR increase per 1-point increase, 95%CI 23-143). CONCLUSIONS: The patients residing in retirement homes showed great vulnerability. The main baseline factors that were independently associated with mortality in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 were older age, diabetes mellitus, low SatO2/FiO2 ratio, and high SOFA and CURB-65 scores.","Rivera-Izquierdo, Mario; Del Carmen Valero-Ubierna, María; R-delAmo, Juan Luis; Fernández-García, Miguel Ángel; Martínez-Diz, Silvia; Tahery-Mahmoud, Arezu; Rodríguez-Camacho, Marta; Gámiz-Molina, Ana Belén; Barba-Gyengo, Nicolás; Gámez-Baeza, Pablo; Cabrero-Rodríguez, Celia; Guirado-Ruiz, Pedro Antonio; Martín-Romero, Divina Tatiana; Láinez-Ramos-Bossini, Antonio Jesús; Sánchez-Pérez, María Rosa; Mancera-Romero, José; García-Martín, Miguel; Martín-delosReyes, Luis Miguel; Martínez-Ruiz, Virginia; Lardelli-Claret, Pablo; Jiménez-Mejías, Eladio",PLoS One,484,22

This study included 31 adult patients who were virologically confirmed to have COVID-19 but were asymptomatic on admission. Among these 31 patients, 22 presented symptoms after admission and were defined as asymptomatic patients in the incubation period (APIs); the other nine patients remained asymptomatic during hospitalization and were defined as asymptomatic patients (APs). The median cycle threshold (Ct) value of APs (39.0, interquartile range (IQR) 37.5-39.5) was significantly higher than that of APIs (34.5, IQR 32.2-37.0), indicating a lower viral load in APs. However, the duration of viral shedding remained similar in the two groups (7 days, IQR 5-14 days vs. 8 days, IQR 5-16 days). The study findings demonstrated that although APs with COVID-19 have a lower viral load, they still have certain period of viral shedding, which suggests the possibility of transmission during their asymptomatic period. Further longitudinal surveillance of these asymptomatic cases via virus nucleic acid testing are warranted.","Zhou, Rui; Li, Furong; Chen, Fengjuan; Liu, Huamin; Zheng, Jiazhen; Lei, Chunliang; Wu, Xianbo",Int J Infect Dis,484,29

The possibility to compare data across different settings depends on the systematic and reproducible manner the scans are analyzed and reported. The COVID-19 Reporting and Data System (CO-RADS) and the corresponding CT severity score (CTSS) introduced by the Radiological Society of the Netherlands (NVvR) attempt to do so. However, this system has not been externally validated. RESEARCH QUESTION: We aimed to prospectively validate the CO-RADS as a COVID-19 diagnostic tool at the emergency department (ED), and evaluate if the CTSS is associated with prognosis. STUDY DESIGN METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study in two tertiary centers in The Netherlands, between March 19 and May 28, 2020. We consecutively included 741 adult patients at the ED with suspected COVID-19, who received a chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 PCR (PCR). Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. Logistic regression was performed for CTSS in relation to hospital admission, ICU admission and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: 741 patients were included. We found an AUC of 0.91 (CI 0.89-0.94) for CO-RADS using PCR as reference. The optimal CO-RADS cut-off was 4, with a sensitivity of 89.4% (CI 84.7-93.0) and specificity of 87.2% (CI 83.9-89.9). We found a significant association between CTSS and hospital admission, ICU admission, and 30-day mortality; adjusted odds ratios per point increase in CTSS were 1.19 (CI 1.09-1.28), 1.23 (1.15-1.32), 1.14 (1.07-1.22), respectively. Intra-class correlation coefficients for CO-RADS and CTSS were 0.94 (0.91-0.96) and 0.82 (CI 0.70-0.90). INTERPRETATION: Our findings support the use of CO-RADS and CTSS in triage, diagnosis and management decisions for patients presenting with possible COVID-19 at the ED.","Lieveld, Arthur W E; Azijli, Kaoutar; Teunissen, Bernd P; van Haaften, Rutger M; Kootte, Ruud S; van den Berk, Inge A H; van der Horst, Sabine F B; de Gans, Carlijn; van de Ven, Peter M; Nanayakkara, Prabath W B",Chest,484,22

METHODS: This is a prospective study, a total of 145 COVID-19 patients were treated and all discharged according to the guideline criteria by Mar 11th 2020. After discharge, clinical visits and viral RT-PCR tests by the second and fourth week follow-up were carried-out. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics and laboratory data on admission and discharge were retrieved, and predictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 re-positivity were analyzed. RESULTS: 13 out of 145 (9.0%) COVID-19 patients were confirmed re-positivity of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR test. The median interval between disease onset to recurrence was 38 days. SARS-CoV-2 re-positive cases were of significantly longer virus shedding duration, notably higher body temperature, heart rate and lower TNF-&#945; and IgG levels on admission. Covariate logistic regression analysis revealed virus shedding duration and IgG levels are independent risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 return positive after discharge.

Since then, the virus has caused severe morbidity and mortality worldwide and has put pressure on the global medical system. Still, there are limited data regarding the clinical impact of COVID-19 on people living with HIV (PLWH). The primary aim of this study is therefore to systematically review up-to-date studies reporting on the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 amongst HIV patients. Methods: A thorough literature search was carried out using Medline, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library Databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 22 studies were identified. Amongst 730 HIV/COVID-19 coinfected patients, 79.4% were males, median age was 51.5 and the number of reported patients receiving Antiretroviral drugs was 708 (97.2%). Most coinfected patients had mild to moderate symptoms including majorly cough 37.75%, fever 37.53% and Dyspnea 24.72%. Among pre-existing comorbidities, hypertension (26.3%) was the most prevalent in HIV/COVID-19 coinfected patients, and 87% of coinfected patients have recovered. Conclusion: Based on the existing data in this systematic literature review, HIV patients with pre-existing comorbidities, obesity and of older age should be considered as a high-risk group for COVID-19. Furthermore, coinfected patients appears to have a marginally comparable clinical outcomes with the general population. The study's findings highlight the need for further investigation to elucidate the impact of COVID-19 infection in HIV patients.","Massarvva, Thomas",Epidemiol Health,484,16

The objective is to help inform model design for future work. Following the PRISMA guidelines, we conduct a systematic search of studies that use neural networks to forecast Dengue in human populations. We summarize the relative performance of neural networks and comparator models, model architectures and hyper-parameters, as well as choices of input features. Nineteen papers were included. Most studies implement shallow neural networks using historical Dengue incidence and meteorological input features. Prediction horizons tend to be short. Building on the strengths of neural networks, most studies use granular observations at the city or sub-national level. Performance of neural networks relative to comparators such as Support Vector Machines varies across study contexts. The studies suggest that neural networks can provide good predictions of Dengue and should be included in the set of candidate models.

To efficiently deliver CRISPR-chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano-biohybrid complexes (F-TBIO) are constructed by one-step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF-TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF-TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid-ß, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg-AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg-AD mice are still significantly improved.

Conversion of non-clinical space into medical units designated for Covid-19 patients became necessary to accommodate this mandate. METHODS: Non-clinical space was converted into medical units at multiple campuses of a large academic hospital system over 1 week. The conversion required construction to deliver basic care including oxygen supplementation. Creation of provider workspaces, handwashing areas, and colour-coded infection control zones was prioritized. Selection criteria were created with a workflow to determine appropriate patients for transfer into converted space. Staffing of converted space shifted as hospitalizations surged. RESULTS: The unit was open for 18 days and accommodated 170 unique patients. Five patients (2.9%) required transfer to a higher level of care. There were no respiratory arrests, cardiac arrests, or deaths in the new unit. CONCLUSION: Converting non-clinical space to a medical unit was accomplished quickly with staffing, workflow for appropriate patients, few patients who returned to a higher level of care, and no respiratory or cardiac arrests or deaths on the unit.","Locke, Cameron J; Koo, Benjamin; Baron, Sarah W; Shapiro, Jared; Pacifico, Jessica",J. eval. clin. pract.

People who use opioids may be a vulnerable group disproportionately impacted by the current pandemic, however, the limited prior research in this area makes it unclear whether COVID-19 and opioid use outcomes may be related, and whether other environmental and socioeconomic factors might play a role in explaining COVID-19 mortality. The objective of this study is to evaluate the association between opioid-related mortality and COVID-19 mortality across U.S. counties. Methods Data from 3142 counties across the U.S. were used to model the cumulative count of deaths due to COVID-19 up to June 2, 2020. A multivariable negative-binomial regression model was employed to evaluate the adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate ratios (aMRR). Results After controlling for covariates, counties with higher rates of opioid-related mortality per 100,000 persons were found to be significantly associated with higher rates of COVID-19 mortality (aMRR: 1.0134;95% CI [1.0054, 1.0214];P = 0.001). Counties with higher average daily Particulate Matter (PM2.5) exposure also saw significantly higher rates of COVID-19 mortality. Analyses revealed rural counties, counties with higher percentages of non-Hispanic whites, and counties with increased average maximum temperatures are significantly associated with lower mortality rates from COVID-19. Conclusions This study indicates need for public health efforts in hard hit COVID-19 regions to also focus prevention efforts on overdose risk among people who use opioids.

The objectives of the screening program were to reduce the importation of COVID-19 cases into the United States and slow subsequent spread within states. Screening aimed to identify travelers with COVID-19-like illness or who had a known exposure to a person with COVID-19 and separate them from others. Screening also aimed to inform all screened travelers about self-monitoring and other recommendations to prevent disease spread and obtain their contact information to share with public health authorities in destination states. CDC delegated postarrival management of crew members to airline occupational health programs by issuing joint guidance with the Federal Aviation Administration.* During January 17-September 13, 2020, a total of 766,044 travelers were screened, 298 (0.04%) of whom met criteria for public health assessment; 35 (0.005%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and nine (0.001%) had a positive test result. CDC shared contact information with states for approximately 68% of screened travelers because of data collection challenges and some states' opting out of receiving data. The low case detection rate of this resource-intensive program highlighted the need for fundamental change in the U.S. border health strategy. Because SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission can occur in the absence of symptoms and because the symptoms of COVID-19 are nonspecific, symptom-based screening programs are ineffective for case detection. Since the screening program ended on September 14, 2020, efforts to reduce COVID-19 importation have focused on enhancing communications with travelers to promote recommended preventive measures, reinforcing mechanisms to refer overtly ill travelers to CDC, and enhancing public health response capacity at ports of entry. More efficient collection of contact information for international air passengers before arrival and real-time transfer of data to U.S. health departments would facilitate timely postarrival public health management, including contact tracing, when indicated. Incorporating health attestations, predeparture and postarrival testing, and a period of limited movement after higher-risk travel, might reduce risk for transmission during travel and translocation of SARS-CoV-2 between geographic areas and help guide more individualized postarrival recommendations.","Dollard, Philip; Griffin, Isabel; Berro, Andre; Cohen, Nicole J.; Singler, Kimberly; Haber, Yoni; de la Motte Hurst, Chris; Stolp, Amber; Atti, Sukhshant; Hausman, Leslie; Shockey, Caitlin E.; Roohi, Shahrokh; Brown, Clive M.; Rotz, Lisa D.; Cetron, Martin S.; Alvarado-Ramy, Francisco",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,484,1

We conducted a prospective multi-center cross-sectional study to compare induced sputum to throat swabs for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Confirmed COVID-19 patients from six hospitals in six cities across China who received one or more negative RT-PCR result for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled, and paired specimens (induced sputum and throat swabs; 56 cases) were assayed. In three paired samples, both the induced sputum and throat swabs were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The positive rate for induced sputum was significantly higher than for throat swabs both overall (28.6% vs 5.4%, respectively; p < 0.01). Patients were divided according to time span from onset of illness to sample collection into the more-than-30-day (n = 26) and less-than-30-day (n = 30) groups. The positive rate for induced sputum was also significantly higher than for throat swabs in the less-than-30-day group (53.3% vs 10.0%, respectively; p < 0.001). For the more-than-30-day group, all paired samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Blood oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and heart rate remained stable during sputum induction and no staff were infected. Because induced sputum is more reliable and has a lower false-negative rate than throat swabs, we believe induced sputum is more useful for the confirmation of COVID-19 and is safer as a criterion for release from quarantine.","Lai, Tianwen; Xiang, Fangfei; Zeng, Jianfeng; Huang, Yingzi; Jia, Liping; Chen, Hui; Wu, Jiayuan; Xie, Jianfeng; Liu, Shuna; Deng, Wei; Zheng, Weiqiang; Huang, Yang; Zhang, Qinfu; Luo, Qingfeng; Mo, Fan; Long, Lieming; Zhang, Wuying; Chen, Wenna; Han, Huanqin",Virulence,484,20

According to their available resources, developed and developing countries' public and private sectors are fighting against this pandemic. This paper examines how effective the Public–Private Partnership (PPP) strategies under the Chinese government response to control this COVID-19. The study takes the Chinese government and private sector's collective efforts for analysis and discussion from January 01 to October 31, 2020. Applying linear regression revealed that public governance strategies have worked to control this pandemic's severity and frequency. The results also show that despite the negative COVID-19 graph, the Chinese government has remained consistent in health and stringency measures. Furthermore, in cooperation with private sectors, China's emergency management has built two makeshift hospitals in 12 days and 5G technology implementation; Health Code application and volunteer works illustrate sharing governance by PPP. The study advises that by keeping in mind the strategy of PPP in China, other countries should also involve private sectors to mitigate emergency issues like COVID-19 for fast and effective outcomes and ask for assistance from the Chinese government and follow their quarantine and prudent policies to control this contagious disease. It further suggests that governments should engage private sectors before draft effective emergency preparedness policies to fight against future calamities.","Abbas, Hafiz Syed Mohsin; Xu, Xiaodong; Sun, Chunxia; Gillani, Samreen; Raza, Muhammad Ahsan Ali",J Manag Gov,484,32

Comparativism argues that dying does have impact on this individual, then it may alter our arguments on duties or rights to die, as well as on how and whether we should make end of life decisions for others. If Comparativism is correct, then there are large ramifications for ethics, medicine, and public health. Unfortunately for Comparativism, its incorporation of intuitions and possible worlds gives it the same undermining biased world problem encountered by Moore's isolation test for intrinsic value. Imagining/referring to a possible world whilst in this one merely creates the illusion that a decedent's death can benefit or injure her. When we select possible worlds or fill in their missing states of affairs, we can often impose our own biases into the thought experiment. Thinking about fictions is useful in figuring out what we should do and be, as well as evaluating what others did and were, but medical practice and policy affecting end of life issues in bioethics should always be based on reality and not subjective partiality.","R.

Several mechanisms, many of which still are poorly understood, are at the basis of this phenomenon. Vaccine development for lentivirus infections in general, and for HIV/AIDS in particular, has been little successful. Certain experimental lentiviral vaccines even proved to be counterproductive: they rendered vaccinated subjects more susceptible to infection rather than protecting them. For vaccine-induced enhanced susceptibility to infection with certain viruses like feline coronavirus, Dengue virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus, it has been shown that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) plays an important role. Other mechanisms may, either in the absence of or in combination with ADE, be involved. Consequently, vaccine-induced enhancement has been a major stumble block in the development of certain flavi-, corona-, paramyxo-, and lentivirus vaccines. Also recent failures in the development of a vaccine against HIV may at least in part be attributed to induction of enhanced susceptibility to infection. There may well be a delicate balance between the induction of protective immunity on the one hand and the induction of enhanced susceptibility on the other. The present paper reviews the currently known mechanisms of vaccine-induced enhancement of susceptibility to virus infection or of aberrant viral pathogenesis.","Huisman, W.; Martina, B.E.E.; Rimmelzwaan, G.F.; Gruters, R.A.; Osterhaus, A.D.M.E.",Vaccine,484,1

Although most patients with COVID-19 manifest fever and respiratory tract symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection may also involve other organs/systems and present with extra-respiratory manifestations, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, neurological, olfactory, gustatory, ocular, cutaneous and haematological symptoms. Occasionally, these extra-respiratory symptoms/signs represent the initial presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, prior to fever or respiratory manifestations. Therefore, this comprehensive review of the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19 is intended to help clinicians better understand the range of clinical presentations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, allowing the consideration of COVID-19 in differential diagnoses. A screening test for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed when patients have these extra-respiratory manifestations. In addition, clinicians should be alerted to the adverse effects of anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that can mimic the extra-respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Moreover, some extra-respiratory manifestations, such as ocular and gastrointestinal involvement, may be caused by direct invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, protective measures should be taken while managing the associated clinical specimens. Finally, several extra-respiratory manifestations, such as cardiac involvement, acute kidney injury, coagulation disorders and thrombotic complications, could be associated with a poor prognosis.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Ko, Wen-Chien; Lee, Ping-Ing; Jean, Shio-Shin; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Antimicrob Agents,484,16

We investigated the simultaneous presence of astroviruses, coronaviruses, and paramyxoviruses in bats from Madagascar, Mayotte, Mozambique, and Reunion Island. A total of 871 samples from 28 bat species representing 8 families were tested by polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase genes. Overall, 2.4% of bats tested positive for the presence of at least two viruses, only on Madagascar and in Mozambique. Significant variation in the proportion of co-infections was detected among bat species, and some combinations of co-infection were more common than others. Our findings support that co-infections of the three targeted viruses occur in bats in the western Indian Ocean region, although further studies are needed to assess their epidemiological consequences.

Information on the characteristics of children with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we recruited 10 children infected with SARS-COV-2 from January 27 to March 10, 2020, in Changsha, China. We report the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and high-resolution CT findings for these children. Qualitative descriptive analysis was used to describe the key results. RESULTS: Ten children were included. Three were male and seven were female. Three were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, and seven were from Changsha. All had a history of close contact with adults with COVID-19 before the onset of disease. Clinical manifestations included fever in four cases, respiratory symptoms in three cases, febrile convulsions in one case, vomiting in one case, abdominal pain in one case, and asymptomatic infection in two cases. All the children tested positive for nucleic acid in throat swabs at admission. Stool swabs of three cases were positive for nucleic acid after several days of fever. In nine children, blood routine results were normal, whereas in one case the white blood cell count was elevated. In four cases, CT findings of the lungs showed light ground-glass opacities, one case showed changes similar to bronchopneumonia, and the remaining cases were normal. All were treated with symptomatic support without complications. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that intrafamily transmission may be the main form of transmission of COVID-19 in children, and persistent intestinal excretion of virus is another characteristic among children. The results of stool swab tests should be considered for discharge and release from isolation.","Tan, Yu-pin; Tan, Bo-yu; Pan, Jia; Wu, Jing; Zeng, Sai-zhen; Wei, Hong-yan",J Clin Virol,484,10

Surface location of fusion protein was verified by ELISA, immunofluoresence microscopy. Oral and intranasal inoculations of recombinant L. casei into pregnant sow and mice resulted in high levels of serum immunoglobuline G (IgG) and mucosal IgA, as demonstrated by rnELISA(recombinant N protein ELISA) using recombinant N protein. Absorbance of IgG in pregnant sow sera highly increased duration of the experiment. More importantly, the level of IgA in colostrum were increased significantly higher than that of IgG. The IgG levels of the piglets were increased after suckling colostrum secreted from sows previously inoculated recombinant L. casei.
