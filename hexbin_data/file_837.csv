According to the diagnostic criteria used and the population studied, the prevalence rate of PCOS is between 6% and 21%. However, current conventional modern medicines for PCOS are only moderately effective at controlling the signs and symptoms, while they are not thoroughly able to prevent complications. Therefore, many patients have turned to complementary and alternative medical (CAM) treatments. CAM use is wide spread among patients with PCOS, and more than 70% of patients use CAM at one point during their diseases. The patients' primary motivations include dissatisfaction with available medications, perceive higher risk of drug side effects and crushing health burden and economic costs, desire for symptom relief, pursuit of shortening the course of disease, and the belief that CAM therapy is in accordance with the patients' values and beliefs. At present, several CAM methods have been used in women with PCOS, which has achieved obvious effects. However, biologically plausible mechanisms of the action of traditional Chinese medicine- (TCM-) associated CAM for PCOS have not been systematically reviewed. This review briefly summarizes the current progress of the impact of herbal medicine on the outcomes of PCOS and introduces the mechanisms.","Shen, Wenjuan; Jin, Bao; Pan, Yujia; Han, Yanhua; You, Tianjiao; Zhang, Zongyu; Qu, Yangfan; Liu, Sha; Zhang, Yang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,837,17

Despite this, clipping remains the preferred option for many aneurysms. The objective of this study is to describe the reported adverse events of open repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms and their impact on patient outcome. The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched between June 1999 and June 2019 to identify original studies of at least 100 patients undergoing surgical repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms and in which adverse event rates were reported. Thirty-six studies reporting adverse events in a total of 12,410 operations for repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms were included. Surgical adverse events were common with 36 event types reported including intraoperative rupture (median rate of 16.6%), arterial injury (median rate of 3.8%) and brain swelling (median rate 5.6%). Only 6 surgical events were statistically shown to associate with poor outcomes by any author and for intraoperative rupture (the most frequently analysed), there was an even split between authors finding a statistical association with poor outcome and those finding no association. Even with modern surgical techniques, the technical demands of surgical aneurysm repair continue to lead to a high rate of intraoperative adverse events. Despite this, it is not known which of these intraoperative events are the most important contributors to the poor outcomes often seen in these patients. More research directed towards identifying the events that most drive operative morbidity has the potential to improve outcomes for these patients.","Muirhead, William R; Grover, Patrick J; Toma, Ahmed K; Stoyanov, Danail; Marcus, Hani J; Murphy, Mary",Neurosurgical review,837,33

In this pilot study, we characterized the metabolic composition of human breath for an early diagnosis and differentiation of influenza viral infection, as well as other types of upper respiratory viral infections. We first studied the non-specific effects of planned seasonal influenza vaccines on breath metabolites in healthy subjects after receiving the immunization. We then investigated changes in breath content from hospitalized patients with flu-like symptoms and confirmed upper respiratory viral infection. The exhaled breath was sampled using a custom-made breath condenser, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples were analysed using liquid chromatography coupled to quadruplole-time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC-qTOF). All metabolomic data was analysed using both targeted and untargeted approaches to detect specific known biomarkers from inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, as well as new molecules associated with specific infections. We were able to find clear differences between breath samples collected before and after flu vaccine administration, together with potential biomarkers that are related to inflammatory processes and oxidative stress. Moreover, we were also able to discriminate samples from patients with flu-related symptoms that were diagnosed with confirmatory respiratory viral panels (RVP). RVP positive and negative differences were identified, as well as differences between specific viruses defined. These results provide very promising information for the further study of the effect of influenza A and other viruses in human systems by using a simple and non-invasive specimen like breath.","Borras, Eva; McCartney, Mitchell M; Thompson, Cai Hugo; Meagher, Robert J; Kenyon, Nicholas J; Schivo, Michael; Davis, Cristina E",Journal of breath research,837,7

A number of autonomic phenomena have been described in generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), the most common seizure type associated with SUDEP, including decreased heart rate variability, cardiac arrhythmias, and changes in skin conductance. Postictal generalized EEG suppression (PGES) has been identified as a potential risk marker of SUDEP, and PGES has been found to correlate with post-GTCS autonomic dysregulation in some patients. Herein, we describe a patient with a GTCS in whom polygraphic measurements were obtained, including continuous noninvasive blood pressure recordings. Significant postictal hypotension lasting >60 s was found, which closely correlated with PGES duration. Similar EEG changes are well described in hypotensive patients with vasovagal syncope and a similar vasodepressor phenomenon, and consequent cerebral hypoperfusion may account for the PGES observed in some patients after a GTCS. This further raises the possibility that profound, prolonged, and irrecoverable hypotension may comprise one potential SUDEP mechanism.","Bozorgi, Alireza; Chung, Stephanie; Kaffashi, Farhad; Loparo, Kenneth A; Sahoo, Satya; Zhang, G Q; Kaiboriboon, Kitti; Lhatoo, Samden D",Epilepsia,837,1

Exercise has the potential to improve overall health in several diseases, but evidence remains scant in c-TA. The main objective of this study was to investigate the safety and potential therapeutic effects of exercise in c-TA. Methods This was a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, to test the effects of a home-based, exercise intervention vs. standard of care in c-TA patients in remission. The primary outcomes were arterial inflammation, assessed by [18F] FDG- PET/MRI and systemic inflammatory markers. Secondary outcomes included, physical activity levels, functionality, body composition, disease-related parameters, and quality of life. Results Thirty-seven patients were assessed for eligibility, which represents the total number of c-TA patients being followed by the three specialized medical ambulatory services in Sao Paulo. After exclusions, fourteen c-TA patients (71.4% females) aged 12-25 years were randomly allocated into exercised (n=5) and non-exercised groups (n=9). Exercise did not exacerbate arterial inflammation. In fact, exercised patients had a reduction in the frequency of vessel segments with severe inflammation, whereas the non-exercised patients had an opposite response (P=0.007). Greater improvements in visceral fat, steps per day, functionality and physical component SF-36 were observed in the exercised patients (P ≤ 0.05). Conclusions Exercise is safe and may improve visceral fat, physical activity levels, functionality, and physical component SF-36 in c-TA patients. Thus, exercise arises as a novel, evidence-based intervention to improve general health in c-TA.

We describe the umbilical ring easy kannula access (UREKA) technique, evaluating safety and a decrease in complications related to port placement. METHODS UREKA is performed via a supra- or infraumbilical incision followed by circumferential dissection of the umbilical stalk. The umbilical skin is dissected free from the fascia, exposing the umbilical ring. Pneumoperitoneum is established either before or after placement of a dilating port through the open ring. We reviewed all laparoscopic procedures performed by one pediatric surgeon over 14 months using UREKA. RESULTS Ninety-four patients underwent laparoscopic surgery with initial port placement via UREKA. Appendectomy (n=57) was the most common procedure, followed by fundoplication (15) and cholecystectomy (10). No intestinal, solid organ, vascular, or bladder injuries related to port placement occurred. The only postoperative complication was a superficial wound infection in a 135-kg patient following cholecystectomy, treated successfully with oral antibiotics alone. CONCLUSION The umbilical ring persists to some degree in all pediatric patients and provides a safe portal of entry for laparoscopic surgery. UREKA has few complications and is a straightforward, reproducible technique for gaining initial laparoscopic access.","Carlson, Jared W; DeCou, James M",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,837,12

Here, by using the Michael addition strategy between 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT) and polydopamine (PD), a novel fluoro-functionalized stationary phase was synthesized for open-tubular capillary electrochromatography (OT-CEC). The PFDT@PD was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectrometer (XPS). The PFDT@PD@capillary exhibited outstanding separation performance towards neutral compounds (such as alkylbenzenes and chlorobenzenes) and organic fluorides (such as fluorobenzenes and perfluoroalkyl methacrylates etc.) with high resolution and high separation efficiency by hydrophobic interaction and fluorous-fluorous interaction. In addition, the column shows good stability and reproducibility. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) of the retention time for intra-day (n = 5) and inter-day (n = 3) runs and between columns (n = 3) are less than 0.39%, 1.22% and 3.87%, respectively.

P2Y11 is upregulated during differentiation of M2 macrophages, however, it is unclear, whether and how P2Y11 contributes to their anti-inflammatory properties. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Transcriptome and secretome profiling of ectopic P2Y11 was used to obtain clues for P2Y11 signalling and function. Findings were validated in human monocyte-derived M2 macrophages. The suramin analogue NF340 and P2RY11-knockout cells served to confirm that agonist-mediated responses were specific to P2Y11 stimulation. KEY RESULTS Temporal transcriptome profiling of P2Y11 stimulation revealed the signature of a strong and tightly controlled interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) response, including activation of the IL-1R target genes IL6 and IL8. Secretome profiling confirmed the presence of IL-6 and IL-8 proteins and additionally identified soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 and 2 (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) as P2Y11 targets. Raising the levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in M2 macrophages by inhibiting phosphodiesterases (PDE), especially PDE4, strongly increased the P2Y11 -induced release of sTNFR2 through ectodomain shedding mediated by TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17). Both, IL-1α and IL-1ß synergistically enhanced P2Y11 -induced IL-6 and IL-8 secretion as well as release of sTNFR2. During lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which shares the downstream signalling pathway with IL-1R, P2Y11 specifically prevented the secretion of TNF-α. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our data indicate that P2Y11 targeting activates IL-1R signalling to promote sTNFR2 release and suppresses TLR4 signalling to prevent TNF-α secretion, thus facilitating the resolution of inflammation.","Gruenbacher, Georg; Gander, Hubert; Dobler, Gabriele; Rahm, Andrea; Klaver, Dominik; Thurnher, Martin",British journal of pharmacology,837,7

This putative new antidepressant agent offers minimal systemic side effects and negligible risk of pharmacological interactions. We set out to examine the evidence for the use of onabotulinumtoxinA in major depression. METHODS A systematic search of the literature identified double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the use of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of major depression versus placebo. Data, reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), was combined in meta-analyses (PROSPERO registration ID: CRD42020183538). RESULTS The search identified five RCTs (four double-blind) comparing onabotulinumtoxinA to placebo. OnabotulinumtoxinA was more effective than placebo when administered within the 20-40 IU dose range in double-blind RCTs. The analysis was free of publication bias and significantly heterogeneous. Meta-regression analyses indicated that onabotulinumtoxinA was more efficacious in women and in higher doses in female patients and less effective with polypharmacy, especially when an increasing number of antidepressants were prescribed. The effectiveness of onabotulinumtoxinA was higher in more recently published double-blind RCTs. CONCLUSION The meta-analysis supports the efficacy of the intervention with the results being highly heterogeneous across studies. In view of the heterogeneity of the findings and the significant moderators of benefit (sex, year of study completion and the interaction between sex and dose), more research is required to better understand the role of onabotulinumtoxinA in the treatment of depression.","Arnone, Danilo; Galadari, Hassan; Rodgers, Carl J; Östlundh, Linda; Aziz, Karim Abdel; Stip, Emmanuel; Young, Allan H",Journal of psychopharmacology,837,17

Methods Using direct penetration of the catheter through the surface of ex vivo porcine lung, ablations (n=9) were performed at 70, 80, 90 W for 10 minutes. Temperatures of the catheter and 10, 15, 20 mm away from the tip were measured. Under bronchoscopy conditions in porcine lung, ablations (n=18, 6 in ex vivo and 12 in vivo) were performed at 80 W for 5 minutes. Computed tomography (CT) was acquired perioperative, 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post ablation. Ablation zones were excised at 24 hours and 4 weeks respectively. Long-axis diameter (Dl) and short-axis diameter (Ds) were measured and tissues were sectioned for pathological examination. Results In-ex vivo lung, the temperature at 20 mm removed was over 60 °C at 80 W for 288±26 seconds. The ablations under bronchoscopic conditions were successful in-ex vivo and in vivo lung. No complications occurred during the procedures. Coagulation necrosis was visible at 24 hours, and repaired fibrous tissue was seen at 4 weeks.

Methods: Data from the Veterans Health Administration were used to examine whether the number of visits for serious mental illness differed for January-September 2019 versus the same period in 2020. Mixed-effects regression analyses tested whether the post-COVID-19 rate of growth in virtual care differed for people with serious mental illnesses versus those with other diagnoses. Results: Fewer visits for serious mental illnesses occurred during the initial weeks of the pandemic but not subsequently. The rate of growth in video visits during 2020 was slower for serious mental illnesses than for other psychiatric diagnoses. Conclusions: Several months after the pandemic's start, the total number of visits for serious mental illnesses was similar to 2019; however, adoption of video care was slower than for other psychiatric diagnoses.","Raja, Pushpa V; Gabrielian, Sonya; Doran, Neal",Psychiatric services,837,1

CRC transcription factors create and engage super-enhancers by recruiting acetylation writers depositing permissive H3K27ac chromatin marks. These super-enhancers are largely associated with BET proteins, including BRD4, that influence higher-order chromatin structure. The orchestration of these events triggers accessibility of RNA polymerase machinery and the imposition of lineage-specific gene expression. In cancers, CRCs drive cell identity by superimposing developmental programmes on a background of genetic alterations. Further, the establishment and maintenance of oncogenic states are reliant on CRCs that drive factors involved in tumour development. Hence, the molecular dissection of CRC components driving cell identity and cancer state can contribute to elucidating mechanisms of diversion from pre-determined developmental programmes and highlight cancer dependencies. These insights can provide valuable opportunities for identifying and re-purposing drug targets. In this article, we review the current understanding of CRCs across solid and liquid malignancies and avenues of investigation for drug development efforts. We also review techniques used to understand CRCs and elaborate the indication of discussed CRC transcription factors in the wider context of cancer CRC models.","Jahangiri, Leila; Tsaprouni, Loukia; Trigg, Ricky M; Williams, John A; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Turner, Suzanne D; Pereira, Joao",Open biology,837,1

Despite the identification of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic agent of SARS, a thorough understanding of the underlying disease pathogenesis has been hampered by the lack of a suitable animal model that recapitulates the human disease. Intranasal (i.n.) infection of A/J mice with the CoV mouse hepatitis virus strain 1 (MHV-1) induces an acute respiratory disease with a high lethality rate that shares several pathological similarities with SARS-CoV infection in humans. In this study, we examined virus replication and the character of pulmonary inflammation induced by MHV-1 infection in susceptible (A/J, C3H/HeJ, and BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/6) strains of mice. Virus replication and distribution did not correlate with the relative susceptibilities of A/J, BALB/c, C3H/HeJ, and C57BL/6 mice. In order to further define the role of the host genetic background in influencing susceptibility to MHV-1-induced disease, we examined 14 different inbred mouse strains. BALB.B and BALB/c mice exhibited MHV-1-induced weight loss, whereas all other strains of H-2(b) and H-2(d) mice did not show any signs of disease following MHV-1 infection. H-2(k) mice demonstrated moderate susceptibility, with C3H/HeJ mice exhibiting the most severe disease. C3H/HeJ mice harbor a natural mutation in the gene that encodes Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) that disrupts TLR4 signaling. C3H/HeJ mice exhibit enhanced morbidity and mortality following i.n. MHV-1 infection compared to wild-type C3H/HeN mice.

Recently, dexmedetomidine has been used as an anesthesia adjunct because of its sedative and analgesic properties and minimal ventilatory depressive effects. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of sevoflurane and dexmedetomidine is non-inferior to sevoflurane alone as it refers to hemodynamic measurements during diagnostic cardiac catheterization in children with a transplanted heart, one ventricle (Fontan procedure), or normal cardiac physiology. Patients were anesthetized with inhalation of sevoflurane in nitrous oxide/oxygen and, after baseline hemodynamic measurements, successive boluses of dexmedetomidine followed by continuous infusion were administered. In this study, non-inferiority was shown when differences at steady-state (dexmedetomidine + sevoflurane) compared to baseline (sevoflurane alone) and its associated 95% confidence interval fell completely within the range of plus or minus 20%. Forty-one (26 normal physiology, 9 cardiac transplantation, and 6 Fontan) patients were enrolled. Non-inferiority of sevoflurane + dexmedetomidine compared with sevoflurane alone was shown for heart rate, but not for arterial blood pressure in patients with normal and cardiac transplant physiology. In patients with normal cardiac physiology, non-inferiority was demonstrated for bispectral index. Therefore, while the lack of depressive respiratory effects and non-inferiority for heart rate are desirable, the lack of non-inferiority of dexmedetomidine + sevoflurane combination for arterial blood pressure do not justify the routine use of this combination compared with sevoflurane alone for children with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac catheterization.","Deutsch, Nina; Finkel, Julia C; Gold, Karen; Cheng, Yao I; Slack, Michael C; Kanter, Joshua; Quezado, Zenaide M N",Pediatric cardiology,837,1

An example of the use of a convoluted neural network applied to visual detection of nerves on ultrasound images is described. New technologies that may impact on regional anaesthesia include robotics and artificial sensing. Robotics in anaesthesia falls into three categories. The first, used commonly, is pharmaceutical, typified by target-controlled anaesthesia using electroencephalography within a feedback loop. Other types include mechanical robots that provide precision and dexterity better than humans, and cognitive robots that act as decision support systems. It is likely that the latter technology will expand considerably over the next decades and provide an autopilot for anaesthesia. Technical robotics will focus on the development of accurate sensors for training that incorporate visual and motion metrics. These will be incorporated into augmented reality and visual reality environments that will provide training at home or the office on life-like simulators.

SETTING Tertiary referral center for treatment of endometriosis. PATIENTS Four hundred twenty women with advanced endometriosis. INTERVENTIONS Fertility-sparing surgery to treat advanced endometriosis, either via conventional or robotic-assisted laparoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Patient demographic data, operative time, estimated blood loss, complication rate, and length of hospital stay were compared between the 2 groups. Two hundred seventy-three patients underwent conventional laparoscopy and 147 patients underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopy for fertility-sparing treatment of advanced stage endometriosis. Patients in both groups had similar characteristics insofar as age, body mass index, and previous abdominal surgeries. There were no significant differences in blood loss or complication rate between the 2 groups. Mean operative time in the conventional laparoscopy group was 135 minutes (range, 115-156 minutes), and in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group was 196 minutes (range, 185-209 minutes), with a mean difference in operative time of 61 minutes (p < .001). Length of hospital stay was also significantly increased in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group. Most patients who underwent conventional laparoscopy were discharged to home on the day of surgery. Of 273 patients in the conventional laparoscopy group, only 63 remained in the hospital overnight, and all 147 patients in the robotic-assisted laparoscopy group were discharged on postoperative day 1. CONCLUSION Conventional laparoscopy and robotic-assisted laparoscopy are excellent methods for treatment of advanced stages of endometriosis.

Emerging technologies have the potential to help patients and caregivers to improve compliance with ERPs.Preoperative physical condition, a major determinant of postoperative outcome, could be optimized with the use of text messages (SMS) or digital applications (Apps) designed to facilitate smoking cessation, modify physical activity, and better manage hypertension and diabetes. Several non-invasive haemodynamic monitoring techniques and decision support tools are now available to individualize perioperative fluid management, a key component of ERPs. Objective nociceptive assessment may help to rationalize the use of pain medications, including opioids. Wearable sensors designed to monitor cardio-respiratory function may help in the early detection of clinical deterioration during the postoperative recovery and to address 'failure to rescue'. Activity trackers may be useful to monitor early mobilization, another major element of ERPs. Finally, electronic checklists have been developed to ensure that none of the above-mentioned ERP elements is omitted during the surgical journey.By optimizing compliance to the multiple components of ERPs, digital innovations, non-invasive techniques and wearable sensors have the potential to magnify the clinical and economic benefits of ERPs. Among the growing number of technical innovations, studies are needed to clarify which tools and solutions have real clinical value and are cost-effective.","Michard, F; Gan, T J; Kehlet, H",British journal of anaesthesia,837,12

Furthermore, the role of vitamin E in ameliorating potential OS caused by BDE-15, CDE-15, and HODE-15 was investigated. Three groups of mice were exposed to 1.20 mg/kg(body weight)/day of each of the three toxicants for 28 days. Results showed that none of the three toxicants altered growth rates of mice, but significantly increased (P<0.05) relative liver weights and decreased relative kidney weights. Pathological changes including cell swelling, inflammation and vacuolization, and hepatocellular hypertrophy in livers were observed. Significant decreases (P<0.05 and P<0.01) in superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity, and glutathione (GSH) levels, together with increases in malondialdehyde (MDA) content were recorded in all toxicant-treated groups. Hepatic copper levels increased in all toxicant-treated groups. Hepatic zinc levels decreased in the liver of BDE-15-treated mice, whereas they increased in the livers of CDE-15-treated and HODE-15-treated mice.

One cause for concern with such reviews is the possibility that results from unpublished trials are not represented in the review findings or data synthesis. This problem, known as publication bias, results when studies reporting statistically nonsignificant findings are left unpublished and, therefore, not included in meta-analyses when estimating a pooled treatment effect. In turn, publication bias may lead to skewed results with overestimated effect sizes. The primary objective of this study is to determine the extent to which evaluations for publication bias are conducted by systematic reviewers in highly ranked anesthesiology journals and which practices reviewers use to mitigate publication bias. The secondary objective of this study is to conduct publication bias analyses on the meta-analyses that did not perform these assessments and examine the adjusted pooled effect estimates after accounting for publication bias. METHODS This study considered meta-analyses and systematic reviews from 5 peer-reviewed anesthesia journals from 2007 through 2015. A PubMed search was conducted, and full-text systematic reviews that fit inclusion criteria were downloaded and coded independently by 2 authors. Coding was then validated, and disagreements were settled by consensus. In total, 207 systematic reviews were included for analysis. In addition, publication bias evaluation was performed for 25 systematic reviews that did not do so originally. We used Egger regression, Duval and Tweedie trim and fill, and funnel plots for these analyses. RESULTS Fifty-five percent (n = 114) of the reviews discussed publication bias, and 43% (n = 89) of the reviews evaluated publication bias. Funnel plots and Egger regression were the most common methods for evaluating publication bias. Publication bias was reported in 34 reviews (16%). Thirty-six of the 45 (80.0%) publication bias analyses indicated the presence of publication bias by trim and fill analysis, whereas Egger regression indicated publication bias in 23 of 45 (51.1%) analyses. The mean absolute percent difference between adjusted and observed point estimates was 15.5%, the median was 6.2%, and the range was 0% to 85.5%. CONCLUSIONS Many of these reviews reported following published guidelines such as PRISMA or MOOSE, yet only half appropriately addressed publication bias in their reviews. Compared with previous research, our study found fewer reviews assessing publication bias and greater likelihood of publication bias among reviews not performing these evaluations.","Hedin, Riley J; Umberham, Blake A; Detweiler, Byron N; Kollmorgen, Lauren; Vassar, Matt",Anesthesia and analgesia,837,14

Standard contrast agents have limited blood-pool residence times, motivating the development of highly protein-bound blood-pool agents with greater relaxivity and longer intravascular residence, affording improved image quality at lesser doses. This study represents the first comparison of blood-pool agents to standard agents in time-resolved cerebral MRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS One hundred datasets were acquired at 1.5 T by use of a standardized, time-resolved MRA protocol. Patients received either unit dosing of a standard extracellular agent at 0.1 mmol/kg or a blood-pool agent at 0.03 mmol/kg. Peak arterial and venous enhancement phases were identified and subsequently scored qualitatively by use of a 4-point Likert scale, with attention to 6 vascular segments: 1) intracranial ICA; 2) MCA M1; 3) MCA M2; 4) MCA M3; 5) deep cerebral veins; and 6) dural venous sinuses. RESULTS Fifty MR angiographies were acquired with each agent. No significant differences were found between agents in generation of uncontaminated arteriograms. Blood-pool agents, at 67% dose reduction, were of significantly greater quality across most vascular segments, including ICA (P = .019), M2 (P = .003), and M3 (P < .01). Superiority in the M1 segment approached significance (P = .059). Significantly better venographic quality was noted for deep venous structures (P = .016) with the use of blood-pool agents. CONCLUSIONS Blood-pool agents provide superior demonstration of most intracranial vessels in time-resolved MRA compared with standard agents, at reduced doses. The greater relaxation enhancement and more favorable dosing profile make blood-pool agents superior to standard agents for use in cerebral time-resolved MRA.","Dehkharghani, S; Kang, J; Saindane, A M",AJNR.

The overall objective of this study was to determine whether sleep-disordered breathing and its sequelae of intermittent hypoxemia and recurrent arousals are associated with mortality in a community sample of adults aged 40 years or older. METHODS AND FINDINGS We prospectively examined whether sleep-disordered breathing was associated with an increased risk of death from any cause in 6,441 men and women participating in the Sleep Heart Health Study. Sleep-disordered breathing was assessed with the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) based on an in-home polysomnogram. Survival analysis and proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios for mortality after adjusting for age, sex, race, smoking status, body mass index, and prevalent medical conditions. The average follow-up period for the cohort was 8.2 y during which 1,047 participants (587 men and 460 women) died. Compared to those without sleep-disordered breathing (AHI: <5 events/h), the fully adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in those with mild (AHI: 5.0-14.9 events/h), moderate (AHI: 15.0-29.9 events/h), and severe (AHI: >or=30.0 events/h) sleep-disordered breathing were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.80-1.08), 1.17 (95% CI: 0.97-1.42), and 1.46 (95% CI: 1.14-1.86), respectively. Stratified analyses by sex and age showed that the increased risk of death associated with severe sleep-disordered breathing was statistically significant in men aged 40-70 y (hazard ratio: 2.09; 95% CI: 1.31-3.33). Measures of sleep-related intermittent hypoxemia, but not sleep fragmentation, were independently associated with all-cause mortality. Coronary artery disease-related mortality associated with sleep-disordered breathing showed a pattern of association similar to all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS Sleep-disordered breathing is associated with all-cause mortality and specifically that due to coronary artery disease, particularly in men aged 40-70 y with severe sleep-disordered breathing.

We sought to identify the causative pathogen in individual cases of pediatric outpatient with RTIs and to determine whether particular clinical features of RTIs are associated with particular viruses. METHODS Over 3 years, we prospectively collected nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from individual pediatric outpatients with an RTI accompanied by persistent fever (>3 days, ≥38.0°C) and peak temperature ≥39.0°C. Two methods-(1) viral culture for respiratory viruses and (2) real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays identifying 9 different respiratory viruses and 2 respiratory bacteria-were used to test specimens. RESULTS For 495 specimens, viral culture and real-time PCR assays together identified at least 1 pathogen in 83.0% and ≥1 viruses alone in 79.4%. These 2 methods identified 138 children with respiratory syncytial virus, 66 with human metapneumovirus, 73 with parainfluenza viruses, 124 with adenovirus, 23 with rhinovirus, 38 with enterovirus, 11 with influenza type C virus, 15 with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and 3 with Chlamydophila pneumoniae; the coinfection rate was 19.7% among all infections. Among the patients with single-pathogen infections, the rate of lower RTI was 37.6% for respiratory syncytial virus, 40.7% for human metapneumovirus, 18.2% for parainfluenza viruses and 2.2% for adenovirus (P < 0.01).

DATA SOURCES Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: ""tissue oxygen monitoring,"" ""near-infrared tissue spectroscopy,"" and ""tissue oxygen saturation (StO2 )."" HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy. StO2 more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. CONCLUSION Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real-time, continuous, repeatable StO2 measurements. A decline in StO2 is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO2 values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.","Salcedo, Mallory C; Tart, Kelly; Hall, Kelly",Journal of veterinary emergency and critical care,837,1

Eligibility screening of title and abstract and then full-text papers was competed in duplicate, independently. The final included papers were assessed for quality, and outcome data extracted independently and in duplicate. Outcome data were synthesised by meta-analysis, where possible, or narratively. RESULTS Seven hundred and thirty-two articles were screened for eligibility yielding six studies for inclusion. All studies provided oral nutritional support that aimed to increase protein intake ranging from an additional 10 to 40 g/d, each with a unique formulation of amino acids and/or micronutrients; three studies combined nutritional intervention with an enhanced physical activity program. Five studies measured hand grip strength, the mean difference was 1.97 kg (95% CI 0.55-3.39, P = .006) greater in the intervention group (n = 166) compared with control group (n = 165).

Four devices were evaluated: Harmonic Ace (Ethicon, Cincinnati, Ohio), Thunderbeat (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), LigaSure (Covidien, Boulder, Colo), and Enseal (Ethicon; Cincinnati, Ohio). After anatomical lung resection, the PA branches were dissected in vitro. Sealing was then performed with 1 of the sealing devices, the vessel was slowly pressurized, and the bursting pressure was recorded. RESULTS Forty-nine PA branches were sealed in 14 patients. The mean PA branch diameter was 7.4 mm (1.8-14.5 mm). Ten patients had normal PA pressure and 3 had PA hypertension. The mean bursting pressure in each was as follows: Harmonic Ace group, 415.5 mm Hg (137.1-1388.4 mm Hg), Thunderbeat group, 875 mm Hg (237.1-2871.3 mm Hg); LigaSure group, 214.7 mm Hg (0-579.6 mm Hg); Enseal group, 133.7 mm Hg (0-315.38 mm Hg).

In multivariable analysis, the perception of ""very much greater risk"" was associated with greater belief that rheumatic disease medications were necessary, worse physical function, chronic pulmonary comorbidity, and more anxiety. In a separate model, the perception that medications ""definitely"" caused greater risk was associated with White race, not taking hydroxychloroquine, rheumatologists initiating change in medications, more anxiety, and taking biologics and corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS Patients' perceived increased risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 was associated with beliefs about their rheumatic disease, medications, comorbidity, and anxiety. Clinicians should be aware of patients' perceptions and foster self-management practices that will alleviate anxiety, minimize exposure to the virus, and optimize systemic rheumatic disease outcomes.","Duculan, Roland; Jannat-Khah, Deanna; Mehta, Bella; Mandl, Lisa A; Barbhaiya, Medha; Bass, Anne R; Mancuso, Carol A",Journal of clinical rheumatology : practical reports on rheumatic & musculoskeletal diseases,837,1

We report a single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial comparing the utility and outcomes of Harmonic Focus, an ultrasonic coagulating shear device (UCSD), versus Ligasure Small Jaw, an electrothermal bipolar vessel sealer (EBVS) in thyroidectomy (NCT01765686). METHODS Between December 2012 to January 2016, eligible patients were randomized to undergo hemithyroidectomy using either a UCSD or an EBVS. The primary outcome was duration of surgery. Secondary outcomes included blood loss, postoperative complications, ease of device use, ease of device set-up, vocal cord function, postoperative wound drainage, pain score, and adverse events. RESULTS Of 110 patients assessed for eligibility, 100 were randomly allocated (UCSD: 49 patients; EBVS: 51 patients) and analyzed by intention-to-treat. There were no differences in specimen delivery time, total duration of surgery, wound drainage, and adverse events between the two groups. The UCSD group had a greater proportion of patients with higher postoperative pain scores in the first 72 h (8.1% vs. 2.0%, p = 0.043). Surgeons reported greater ease of use for the UCSD (49% vs. 27%; p = 0.005), while operating room staff favored the EBVS (60% vs. 33%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Energy devices are equally effective in reducing thyroidectomy operative times, with no differences in the duration of surgery, drainage, or adverse events. Use of the UCSD was associated with higher postoperative pain scores, but was favored by the surgeons, likely due to the ability to perform fine dissection with the device itself.","Lee, Shen-Han; Nguyen, Thien Khanh; Ong, Whee-Sze; Haaland, Benjamin; Tay, Gerald Ci-An; Tan, Ngian Chye; Tan, Hiang Khoon; Ng, Jeremy Chung Fai; Iyer, N Gopalakrishna",Annals of surgical oncology,837,1

Rising rates of both depression and suicide, exacerbated by the current COVID19 pandemic, have only hastened our need for objective and reliable diagnostic biomarkers. These can aide clinicians treating depressive disorders in both diagnosing and developing treatment plans. While differential gene expression analysis has highlighted the serotonin signaling cascade among other critical neurotransmitter pathways to underly the pathology of depression and suicide, the biological mechanisms remain elusive. Here we propose a novel approach to better understand molecular underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders by examining patterns of differential RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs). We take advantage of publicly available RNA-seq datasets to map ADAR editing landscapes in a global gene-centric view. We use a unique combination of Guttman scaling and random forest classification modeling to create, describe and compare ADAR editing profiles focusing on both spatial and biological sex differences. We use a subset of experimentally confirmed ADAR editing sites located in known protein coding regions, the excitome, to map ADAR editing profiles in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and suicide. Using Guttman scaling, we were able to describe significant changes in editing profiles across brain regions in males and females with respect to cause of death (COD) and MDD diagnosis. The spatial distribution of editing sites may provide insight into biological mechanisms under-pinning clinical symptoms associated with MDD and suicidal behavior. Additionally, we use random forest modeling including these differential profiles among other markers of global editing patterns in order to highlight potential biomarkers that offer insights into molecular changes underlying synaptic plasticity. Together, these models identify potential prognostic, diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and/or suicide.","Plonski, Noel-Marie; Meindl, Richard; Piontkivska, Helen",bioRxiv,837,8

The authors collected data from the Chinese construction industry, and general contractor respondents were asked to answer a questionnaire about a contract violation by one of their subcontractors.FindingsControl provisions and competence trust are positively related to contractual enforcement, but goodwill trust is negatively related to contractual enforcement. Relational enforcement is influenced by goodwill trust and competence trust.Research limitations/implicationsThis study treats contract violations as a given variable, and it focuses on contract violations by subcontractors. The cross-sectional design makes it difficult to confirm the causality of the relationships.Practical implicationsOverly strict contractual enforcement can generate disputes and a vicious cycle of retaliation, and overly severe relational enforcement can damage a potentially profitable long-term relationship. In construction projects, the violating party will benefit from this study to avoid excessively contractual enforcement and relational enforcement, thus developing a more collaborative atmosphere on the current project and even establishing a solid long-term relationship.Originality/valueThis study extends the project management literature by investigating the antecedents of enforcement after contract violations, an area not yet fully researched.","Yao, Hongjiang Chen Yongqiang Zhang Yangbing Du Bo",International Journal of Managing Projects in Business,837,7

Consequently, the modern subject experiences time as an irreversible series of events occurring within an absolutised history. It is this subject that ‘makes’ that history. By extension, this time, and the history it valorises, cannot be transcended. This sets up the modern view against a premodern one where temporality is seen in multiple ways, allowing history to be transcended by archetypes. Eliade mourns the alternative ways of being and meaning cultivated by the premodern self that have been lost to hegemonic modernity and its associated, often precarious, subjectivity. He believes that these archetypal modes need to be recovered to counter the damage caused by modernity’s desire to ‘make history’. I reflect on this Eliadean thesis in the light of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, drawing on an example from the Islamic tradition to show what an archetypal, rather than event-centred, approach to the crisis might look like. Specifically, I examine the thoughts of British Muslim theologian, Abdal Hakim Murad, on COVID-19, who reflects on the phenomenon both in the light of the archetypal Islamic concept of the divine names and the event-centred capitalism of late modernity. Contribution: Through an examination of Eliade’s important text, the article continues the decolonial interrogation of modernity’s foundations and its implications for being and acting in the world as distinct from premodern approaches. By highlighting time in both approaches, Eliade shows modernity’s foundations to be just as ‘theological’ as those of religion.","Rafudeen, Auwais",Hervormde Teologiese Studies,837,28

MATERIALS AND METHODS In-house seasonal and pandemic influenza-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were introduced and/or developed at the Molecular Diagnosis Centre (MDC) at the National University Hospital (NUH), Singapore. These assays have been used to test all samples received from in-patients, out-patients, staff and visitors for suspected pandemic influenza A/H1N1/2009 infection. RESULTS Prior to the arrival of the pandemic A/H1N1/2009 virus in Singapore at the end of May 2009, seasonal influenza A/H3N2 predominated in this population, with very little seasonal influenza A/H1N1 and B viruses detected. Within about 1 month of its arrival in Singapore (mainly during June to July 2009), this pandemic virus rapidly displaced seasonal influenza A/H3N2 to become the predominant strain in the Singaporean population served by MDC/NUH. CONCLUSIONS Realtime molecular techniques have allowed the prompt detection of different influenza subtypes during this current pandemic, which has revealed the displacement/replacement of previously circulating seasonal subtypes with A/H1N1/2009. Although some of this may be explained by immunological cross-reactivity between influenza subtypes, more studies are required.","Tang, Julian W T; Lee, Chun Kiat; Lee, Hong Kai; Loh, Tze Ping; Chiu, Lily; Tambyah, Paul A; Koay, Evelyn S C","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",837,19

Single-port (SP) laparoscopic transumbilical surgery has emerged in clinical practice. The aim of this study is to describe SP laparoscopic transumbilical surgery procedure performed in three patients undergoing appendectomy. METHODS Three patients diagnosed with acute appendicitis were operated with SP laparoscopic transumbilical surgery technique. Patient's gender, age, BMI, operation time and length of hospital stay were recorded. RESULTS Three patients (2 female, 1 male) with a mean age of 38 (range 28-48) years underwent appendectomy. The mean postoperative length of stay was 1 day. The mean operative time was 35 minutes (range 30-45 minutes). No scar formation was observed and incisions were nearly invisible in the umbilicus in all patients. CONCLUSION SP laparoscopic transumbilical appendectomy is a safe, effective and reliable technique leading potentially scarless abdominal surgery. Even though SP laparoscopic transumbilical surgery cannot substitute laparoscopic appendectomy for the moment, it is assumed that this procedure will become widespread by putting novel instruments into practice.","Ekçi, Baki",Annali italiani di chirurgia,837,1

The goal of this work was to develop an efficient method for mining large databases in order to identify regions of conservation in the influenza virus genome. From these regions of conservation, capture and label sequences capable of discriminating between different viral types and subtypes were selected. The salient features of the method were the use of phylogenetic trees for data reduction and the selection of a relatively small number of capture and label sequences capable of identifying a broad spectrum of influenza viruses.

Experiments with point-mutated hemagglutinin (HA) of A/Aichi/51/92, one of these viruses, revealed that an amino acid change from Glu to Asp at position 190 (E190D) was responsible for the loss of ability to bind to CRBC.

OBJECTIVES To record the effect of natural ambulation on deep venous flow, providing a reference for evaluating the efficacy of mechanical compression systems, assuming that ambulation is the gold standard against which such systems should be compared; and to compare the hemodynamic effect of the A-V Impulse System CalfPad garment (A-VI) (Orthofix Vascular Novamedix, United Kingdom) with the SCD Express calf compression garment (SCD) (Covidien, USA). METHODS Twelve healthy volunteers were recruited and randomly assigned to either A-VI or SCD in a two-device, two-period crossover design. Peak femoral velocity (PFV) was calculated using custom ultrasound software and compared with baseline values. Ultrasound images were recorded. RESULTS A-VI augmented the mean (± SD) PFV to 59.79±29.07 cm/s compared with 22.86±5.73 cm/s for SCD. The actual percentage increase from baseline was approximately five times greater for A-VI (mean increase 385%±260%) than SCD (mean increase 81%±53%). Using an analysis of covariance model, with baseline fitted as a covariate, a highly statistically significant difference in favour of A-VI was detected (P=0.0002). Least square (adjusted) means (±95% CIs) were 37.24 cm/s (21.39 cm/s to 64.84 cm/s) for A-VI and 6.71 cm/s (3.86 cm/s to 11.69 cm/s) for SCD, representing more than fivefold greater improvement in PFV from rest with the A-VI device than with the SCD device. CONCLUSION Pulsatile impulse calf compression (A-VI) more closely mimics PFV of normal ambulation than slow-squeeze sequential compression (SCD).

Associated with increased cytokines and inflammation, anemia deepens and an increase in serum ferritin levels is also expected. There are no studies addressing the relationship between ferritin and splenomegaly or fibrosis. In this study, the relationship between serum ferritin level and splenomegaly and bone marrow fibrosis was examined. MATERIAL AND METHOD The study was performed retrospectively in 46 MF cases diagnosed between 2012 and 2020. MF was divided into 3 separate subgroups: Primary myelofibrosis, secondary myelofibrosis and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) with myelodsplastic syndrome. RESULTS Thirty (28.3%) of cases were PMF, 26 (56.5%) were SMF and 7 (15.2%) were MDS/MPN. There was no relation found between serum ferritin and splenomegaly in none of the cases or subgroup analysis (for PMF p: 0.564, for SMF p: 0.192, for MDS/MPN p: 0.364). There was a statistically significant relationship between serum ferritin and marrow fibrosis within the group of ages 60 years and older (p: 0.016). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Disruption of hematopoiesis and progressive splenomegaly causes an increase in iron stores associated with an increased need for transfusion. This causes iron-related organ toxicity and bone marrow hematopoiesis disruption, leading to an increase in morbidity. We see that a significant relationship between ferritin and fibrosis has been revealed in the group aged 60 years and older. It is an unprecedented study in the literature in terms of both examining the relationship ferritin and fibrosis or splenomegaly and its results.","Yokus, Osman; Yigit, Betul; Goze, Hasan; Serin, Istemi",American journal of blood research,837,0

Here we develop an immunization approach based on optimizing the susceptible size, which outperforms the best known strategy based on immunizing the highest-betweenness links or nodes. We find that the network's vulnerability can be significantly reduced, demonstrating this on three different real networks: the global flight network, a school friendship network, and the internet.

The main cause of MS is unknown. Nonetheless, the most probable theory is based on molecular mimicry, which suggests that some infections can activate T cells against brain auto-antigens like myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and initiate the disease cascade. This study is conducted to evaluate the activatory effects of PLP58-74 on T lymphocytes and humoral immunity. PLP58-74 was considered as an immunodominant epitope candidate of PLP using bioinformatics tools. Patients and healthy individuals' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with PLP58-74 and its proliferative effects were evaluated through assessing proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) gene expression changes by real time PCR and immunocytochemistry assay. Finally, the rate of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed by flowcytometry. ELISA was also performed to measure anti PLP58-74 antibody in patients' serum. PLP58-74 induced proliferation in patients' PBMCs while it did not influence PBMCs of healthy individuals. CD4+ T cells were the main activated cells in reaction to PLP58-74 which increased from 22% to 39.91%. In addition, immune assay showed threefold increase in specific anti PLP58-74 IgG in patients compared to healthy controls.

METHODS Data on epidemiological features, pathogens and measures for control were collected and analyzed. RESULTS Since Jan 2003, infectious atypical pneumonia (AP) has become epidemic in Guangzhou city. The first autochthonous case was identified on Jan 2nd. Number of cases started to increase since February and reached peak in the early 10 days of February. Hereafter the epidemic tended to decline in March and since early April, the average number of new cases began to decrease, less than 10 per day. Epidemiological studies revealed that the number of cases aged between 20 and 50 was higher than that below the age of 20. Of the total 966 cases, 429 were males versus 537 females. Geographically, the epidemics covered all 13 districts of Guangzhou, but 95% of the cases concentrated in 7 urban districts. As for professional distribution, health care workers accounted for 28.67% of the total cases. There were 36 deaths, aged from 5 to 89, with half of them older than 60. Out of the victims, 38.9% of them had complications as hypertension, diabetes, heart diseases and COPD etc. Data regarding the clustering features of cases showed that there were 42 families having 2 or more cases in one family, while 277 health workers suffered from SARS were concentrated in 28 hospitals. Only one outbreak took place in a public setting but no outbreak was reported in schools. Relevant research also indicated that SARS could be classified as an air-borne infectious disease, transmitted through aerosol and droplets, but close contact also played an important role in the mode of transmission. The disease was highly infectious, suggesting that people who had close contact with patients in the place with poor ventilation was in greater risk of getting infection. The incubation period ranged from 1 to 11 days (mainly from 3 to 8 days), with an average of 5 days. According to our observation, the following measures might be effective such as: early diagnosis, isolation and treatment provided to the patients, and suspected cases under medical observation should also be put in separate places. Improving ventilation and regular disinfection over air and stuff in hospital wards were also recommended. In order to prevent iatrogenic infection, sense on self-protection among health care workers must be strengthened. Patients were not allowed to be visited by any one other than hospital staff. CONCLUSION SARS is a preventable disease and can be under control. It is of great importance to prevent clustered SARS cases and the prevention of iatrogenic infection is essential.","Wang, Ming; Du, Lin; Zhou, Duan-hua; Di, Biao; Liu, Yu-fei; Qin, Peng-zhe; Wu, Xin-wei; Chen, Xiao-shuang; Qiu, Ji-chun; Li, Ze-rong",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,837,5

Current best therapies are all symptomatic. New pharmacological therapies are likely to be prescription-bound, and as most Common Cold infections are successfully treated without the intervention of a Physician, there is a need for effective non-prescription therapy options. Aim of this study is to propose a new type of approach, based on the concept of making a hostile biological environment for virus survival and spreading at the point of infection, the nasopharynx. The hypothesis was advanced that infections could be controlled using a physical biological approach to create an environment at the point of infection, that is inhibitory to the survival, and persistence of infecting virus, and of viruses newly released from infected mucosal epithelial cells. A nasal irrigation spray, designed to deliver a low pH gel to the nasal cavity, was developed and tested in this study. The study was a randomised, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of three formulations of irrigation nasal spray in 441 subjects. The objective was to test whether the formulations reduced Cold severity and Cold duration compared to a placebo nasal spray.

To qualify, subjects had to volunteer that they had at least one of the symptoms: sore/scratchy throat, runny nose or congested nose. The product was used 4 times daily, with at least 4 hours separating each dose, for a maximum of 7 days. Efficacy was assessed by an Interactive Voice Recall System whereby subjects were required to contact the investigation site, by telephone, twice daily when they were asked to assess the severity of their symptoms using a four point ordinal scale where 0 = ""absent"", and 3 = ""severe"". The symptoms assessed were sore throat, runny nose, blocked nose, cough and tired/run-down feeling. Two formulations demonstrated significant effects. A hydroxy methyl propyl cellulose based formulation reduced symptom severity compared with placebo by 17% and a Poloxamer based formulation reduced severity by 21%. Duration of illness was reduced with a hydroxy methyl propyl cellulose based formulation by 1.5 days to 2.4 days (according to the dose) and by a Poloxamer based formulation by 2.5 days. Results of this study suggest that the creation of a non virus-specific, inhibitory environment in the nasopharynx holds promise as an effective method of controlling the severity and duration of the Common Cold.","Hull, D; Rennie, P; Noronha, A; Poore, C; Harrington, N; Fearnley, V; Passàli, D",Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale,837,7

This study reports an association between time of symptom onset (TOS) and length of hospital stay (LOS) in COVID-19 infection without epidemiological link. METHODS: Generalized linear regression models were used to examine the association between symptom onset and primary outcome LOS. A group of patients with established epidemiological link in same medical facility during that period of time were used as controls. RESULTS: A total of 38 COVID-19 patients were admitted, 26 of which were found without travel history to infected area or direct contact with a case-patient. TOS was negatively associated with LOS in patients without epidemiological trace (IRR = 0.980; 95% CI = 0.967 to 0.993; P = 0.003).

A common denominator, hyperinsulinaemia, provides a plausible mechanism of action, underlying CVD, hypertension and strokes, all conditions typified with thrombi. The underlying science provides a theoretical management algorithm for the frontline practitioners.Vitamin D activation requires magnesium. Hyperinsulinaemia promotes: magnesium depletion via increased renal excretion, reduced intracellular levels, lowers vitamin D status via sequestration into adipocytes and hydroxylation activation inhibition. Hyperinsulinaemia mediates thrombi development via: fibrinolysis inhibition, anticoagulation production dysregulation, increasing reactive oxygen species, decreased antioxidant capacity via nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide depletion, haem oxidation and catabolism, producing carbon monoxide, increasing deep vein thrombosis risk and pulmonary emboli. Increased haem-synthesis demand upregulates carbon dioxide production, decreasing oxygen saturation capacity. Hyperinsulinaemia decreases cholesterol sulfurylation to cholesterol sulfate, as low vitamin D regulation due to magnesium depletion and/or vitamin D sequestration and/or diminished activation capacity decreases sulfotransferase enzyme SULT2B1b activity, consequently decreasing plasma membrane negative charge between red blood cells, platelets and endothelial cells, thus increasing agglutination and thrombosis.Patients with COVID-19 admitted with hyperglycaemia and/or hyperinsulinaemia should be placed on a restricted refined carbohydrate diet, with limited use of intravenous dextrose solutions. Degree/level of restriction is determined by serial testing of blood glucose, insulin and ketones. Supplemental magnesium, vitamin D and zinc should be administered.

In France, General Practitioners (GPs) were not involved in the care organization's decision-making process before and during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This omission could have generated stress for GPs. We aimed first to estimate the self-perception of stress as defined by the 10-item Perceived Stress Score (PSS-10), at the beginning of the pandemic in France, among GPs from the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes, a french administrative area severely impacted by COVID-19. Second, we aimed to identify factors associated with a self-perceived stress (PSS-10 &#8805; 27) among socio-demographic characteristics of GPs, their access to reliable information and to personal protective equipment during the pandemic, and their exposure to well established psychosocial risk at work. METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey between 8th April and 10th May 2020. The self-perception of stress was evaluated using the PSS-10, so to see the proportion of ""not stressed"" (&#8804;20), ""borderline"" (21 &#8804; PSS-10 &#8804; 26), and ""stressed"" (&#8805;27) GPs. The agreement to 31 positive assertions related to possible sources of stress identified by the scientific study committee was measured using a 10-point numeric scale. In complete cases, factors associated with stress (PSS-10 &#8805; 27) were investigated using logistic regression, adjusted on gender, age and practice location. A supplementary analysis of the verbatims was made. RESULTS: Overall, 898 individual answers were collected, of which 879 were complete. A total of 437 GPs (49%) were stressed (PSS-10 &#8805; 27), and 283 GPs (32%) had a very high level of stress (PSS-10 &#8805; 30). Self-perceived stress was associated with multiple components, and involved classic psychosocial risk factors such as emotional requirements. However, in this context of health crisis, the primary source of stress was the diversity and quantity of information from diverse sources (614 GPs (69%, OR = 2.21, 95%CI [1.40-3.50], p < 0.001). Analysis of verbatims revealed that GPs felt isolated in a hospital-based model. CONCLUSION: The first wave of the pandemic was a source of stress for GPs.

However, the detailed roles of coarse (>5m) and fine ([≤]5m) respiratory aerosols produced when breathing, talking, and singing are not well-understood. MethodsUsing a G-II exhaled breath collector, we measured viral RNA in coarse and fine respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients during 30 minutes of breathing, 15 minutes of talking, and 15 minutes of singing. ResultsAmong the 22 study participants, 13 (59%) emitted detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in respiratory aerosols, including 3 asymptomatic patients and 1 presymptomatic patient. Viral loads ranged from 63-5,821 N gene copies per expiratory activity per patient. Patients earlier in illness were more likely to emit detectable RNA, and loads differed significantly between breathing, talking, and singing. The largest proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies was emitted by singing (53%), followed by talking (41%) and breathing (6%). Overall, fine aerosols constituted 85% of the viral load detected in our study. Virus cultures were negative. ConclusionsFine aerosols produced by talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Exposure to fine aerosols should be mitigated, especially in indoor environments where airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to occur. Isolating viable SARS-CoV-2 from respiratory aerosol samples remains challenging, and whether this can be more easily accomplished for emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants is an important enquiry for future studies. Key PointsWe sampled respiratory aerosols emitted by COVID-19 patients and discovered that fine aerosols ([≤]5m) generated during talking and singing contain more SARS-CoV-2 copies than coarse aerosols (>5m) and may play a significant role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.","Coleman, Kristen K.; Tay, Douglas Jie Wen; Tan, Kai Sen; Ong, Sean Wei Xiang; Son, Than The; Koh, Ming Hui; Chin, Yi Qing; Nasir, Haziq; Mak, Tze Minn; Chu, Justin Jang Hann; Milton, Donald K.; Chow, Vincent T.K.; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Chen, Mark; Wai, Tham Kwok",,837,33

To achieve this, effective communication on breathing instructions for patients is crucial. During the COVID-19 pandemic, radiographers in Sengkang General Hospital (SKH) were challenged when performing CXR for the patients whose native language is not English. Most of these patients were foreign workers living in the same dormitory which had formed the largest COVID-19 cluster in Singapore. These dormitory residents found it difficult to understand and adhere to breathing instructions, resulting in a suboptimal degree of inspiration when the CXRs were taken. This may ultimately affect the diagnostic value of the radiographs. This paper aims to share and evaluate how radiographers tackled this issue and continued to acquire fully-inspired CXR for the dormitory residents despite the language barrier. METHODS: Using a combination of online survey and retrospective analysis of the rejection rates of CXR done over the period of early April to early June, a team of radiographers evaluated the effectiveness of using audio recordings in managing the issue of not achieving a fully inspired CXR for patients due to language barrier. RESULTS: The rejection rate for CXR due to suboptimal inspiration decreased from 26% to 9% upon implementation of the audio recordings. 92.3% of the CXRs taken within this period also fulfilled the criteria of a fully-inspired CXR, as evidenced by having at least 9 posterior ribs seen above the right hemi-diaphragm. Survey results found a fairly balanced number of radiographers who agreed and disagreed that a fully-inspired CXR was achieved for most of their patients after utilisation of translation manuals and audio recordings. CONCLUSION: After the implementation of audio recordings, the decrease in rejection rate of CXR and an audit which demonstrated that CXR quality was upheld had proven that the radiographers successfully achieved fully-inspired CXR for suspected COVID-19 patients. This confirmed that using pre-recorded audio instructions was an efficient intervention albeit being a one-way communication, leads to more accurate imaging results, aligning with existing literature on communication experiences between radiographers and patients. Moreover, the decreased rejection rate of CXRs had increased department efficiency consequently reducing departmental expenses in the long run. IMPLICATIONS OF PRACTICE: Given that we have an ageing population and the vast majority of the elderly converse in their various dialects, positive feedback from radiographers presented opportunities to expand the translation manual and audio recordings to include local dialects. These can be seamlessly integrated in CXR and other procedures in the hospital setting. To ensure that the translations are culturally sensitive, attention should be paid to the translation process of instructions into other languages and local dialects by enlisting the help of native speakers.","Choong, Y K E; Tay, J; Binte Abdul Razak, A N Y; Look, M A; Sng, L H",,837,1

AIM: The aim of the present study is to analyse the development of nurse practitioner students’ self-assessed clinical competence from the beginning of their education to after completion of their clinical studies. DESIGN: The study involved the application of a longitudinal survey design adhering to STROBE guidelines. METHODS: The participants consisted of 36 registered nurses from a nurse practitioner programme at a Norwegian university. The Professional Nurse Self-Assessment Scale II was used for data collection during the period August 2015 to May 2020. RESULTS: The students developed their clinical competence the most for direct clinical practice. Our findings are inconclusive in terms of whether the students developed clinical competence regarding consultation, coaching and guidance, and collaboration. However, they do indicate a lack of development in some aspects of clinical leadership. The students with the lowest level of clinical competence developed their clinical competence regarding direct clinical practice significantly more than the students with the highest level of clinical competence. The differences between students with high and low levels of clinical competence were levelled out during their education. Thus, the students as a whole became a more homogenous group after completion of their clinical studies. Previous work experience in primary healthcare was a statistically significant, yet minor, predictor of the development of clinical competence. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the students developed their clinical competence for direct clinical practice in accordance with the intended learning outcomes of the university’s Master’s programme and international standards for nurse practitioners. It is imperative that the clinical field supports nurse practitioners by facilitating extended work-task fits that are appropriate to their newly developed clinical competence. We refrain from concluding with a recommendation that prior clinical work experience should be an entry requirement for nurse practitioner programmes. However, we recommend an evaluation of the nurse practitioner education programme with the aim of investigating whether the curriculum meets the academic standards of clinical leadership expected in advanced level of nursing.","Taylor, I.; Bing-Jonsson, P.
