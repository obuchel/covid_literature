451,451,451,A comparison of methods for purification and concentration of norovirus GII-4 capsid virus-like particles,9.717429,7.478362,2010-08-19,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. NoV GII-4 VP1 protein was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system using Sf9 insect cells. Several methods for purification and concentration of virus-like particles (VLPs) were evaluated. Electron microscopy (EM) and histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding assays showed that repeated sucrose gradient purification followed by ultrafiltration resulted in intact VLPs with excellent binding to H type 3 antigens. VLPs were stable for at least 12 months at 4°C, and up to 7 days at ambient temperature. These findings indicate that this method yielded stable and high-quality VLPs.","Huhti, L.; Blazevic, V.; Nurminen, K.; Koho, T.; Hytönen, V. P.; Vesikari, T.",Arch Virol,186,28
558,558,558,Potent Host-Directed Small-Molecule Inhibitors of Myxovirus RNA-Dependent RNA-Polymerases,9.561442,7.507016,2011-05-16,"Therapeutic targeting of host cell factors required for virus replication rather than of pathogen components opens new perspectives to counteract virus infections. Anticipated advantages of this approach include a heightened barrier against the development of viral resistance and a broadened pathogen target spectrum. Myxoviruses are predominantly associated with acute disease and thus are particularly attractive for this approach since treatment time can be kept limited. To identify inhibitor candidates, we have analyzed hit compounds that emerged from a large-scale high-throughput screen for their ability to block replication of members of both the orthomyxovirus and paramyxovirus families. This has returned a compound class with broad anti-viral activity including potent inhibition of different influenza virus and paramyxovirus strains. After hit-to-lead chemistry, inhibitory concentrations are in the nanomolar range in the context of immortalized cell lines and human PBMCs. The compound shows high metabolic stability when exposed to human S-9 hepatocyte subcellular fractions. Antiviral activity is host-cell species specific and most pronounced in cells of higher mammalian origin, supporting a host-cell target. While the compound induces a temporary cell cycle arrest, host mRNA and protein biosynthesis are largely unaffected and treated cells maintain full metabolic activity. Viral replication is blocked at a post-entry step and resembles the inhibition profile of a known inhibitor of viral RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) activity. Direct assessment of RdRp activity in the presence of the reagent reveals strong inhibition both in the context of viral infection and in reporter-based minireplicon assays. In toto, we have identified a compound class with broad viral target range that blocks host factors required for viral RdRp activity. Viral adaptation attempts did not induce resistance after prolonged exposure, in contrast to rapid adaptation to a pathogen-directed inhibitor of RdRp activity.","Krumm, Stefanie A.; Ndungu, J.

900,900,900,Structural Origins for the Loss of Catalytic Activities of Bifunctional Human LTA4H Revealed through Molecular Dynamics Simulations,9.464025,7.6918163,2012-07-25,"Human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (hLTA4H), which is the final and rate-limiting enzyme of arachidonic acid pathway, converts the unstable epoxide LTA4 to a proinflammatory lipid mediator LTB4 through its hydrolase function. The LTA4H is a bi-functional enzyme that also exhibits aminopeptidase activity with a preference over arginyl tripeptides. Various mutations including E271Q, R563A, and K565A have completely or partially abolished both the functions of this enzyme. The crystal structures with these mutations have not shown any structural changes to address the loss of functions. Molecular dynamics simulations of LTA4 and tripeptide complex structures with functional mutations were performed to investigate the structural and conformation changes that scripts the observed differences in catalytic functions. The observed protein-ligand hydrogen bonds and distances between the important catalytic components have correlated well with the experimental results. This study also confirms based on the structural observation that E271 is very important for both the functions as it holds the catalytic metal ion at its location for the catalysis and it also acts as N-terminal recognition residue during peptide binding. The comparison of binding modes of substrates revealed the structural changes explaining the importance of R563 and K565 residues and the required alignment of substrate at the active site. The results of this study provide valuable information to be utilized in designing potent hLTA4H inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents.","Thangapandian, Sundarapandian; John, Shalini; Lazar, Prettina; Choi, Sun; Lee, Keun Woo",PLoS One,186,11
972,972,972,Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D virus,9.610608,7.531759,2012-11-13,"Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem. Individuals coinfected with its satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) have more severe disease. Cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins. The pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor(s) binding. However, the identity of the receptor(s) is unknown. Here, by using near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification, we revealed that the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart conferred its ability in supporting both viral infections. Our results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.

The strain, designated YN, was genetically and pathologically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that YN and most of the previously characterized IBV isolates found in China were phylogenetically classified into 2 main genetic clusters. The YN isolate caused severe lesions and resulted in deaths of 65% in experimental infections of 30-day-old specific-pathogen–free chickens. Tracheal and severe kidney lesions developed in all infected birds, confirming the ability of YN strain to induce both respiratory and renal disease. IBV antigens were detected by immunohistochemical analysis in the trachea, lung, kidney, and bursa, consistent with histopathologic observations, virus isolation, and reverse transcription PCR detection.

1117,1117,1117,Characterization of Rift Valley Fever Virus MP-12 Strain Encoding NSs of Punta Toro Virus or Sandfly Fever Sicilian Virus,9.368003,7.3218164,2013-04-18,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen which can cause hemorrhagic fever, neurological disorders or blindness in humans, and a high rate of abortion in ruminants. MP-12 strain, a live-attenuated candidate vaccine, is attenuated in the M- and L-segments, but the S-segment retains the virulent phenotype. MP-12 was manufactured as an Investigational New Drug vaccine by using MRC-5 cells and encodes a functional NSs gene, the major virulence factor of RVFV which 1) induces a shutoff of the host transcription, 2) inhibits interferon (IFN)-β promoter activation, and 3) promotes the degradation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). MP-12 lacks a marker for differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Although MP-12 lacking NSs works for DIVA, it does not replicate efficiently in type-I IFN-competent MRC-5 cells, while the use of type-I IFN-incompetent cells may negatively affect its genetic stability. To generate modified MP-12 vaccine candidates encoding a DIVA marker, while still replicating efficiently in MRC-5 cells, we generated recombinant MP-12 encoding Punta Toro virus Adames strain NSs (rMP12-PTNSs) or Sandfly fever Sicilian virus NSs (rMP12-SFSNSs) in place of MP-12 NSs. We have demonstrated that those recombinant MP-12 viruses inhibit IFN-β mRNA synthesis, yet do not promote the degradation of PKR. The rMP12-PTNSs, but not rMP12-SFSNSs, replicated more efficiently than recombinant MP-12 lacking NSs in MRC-5 cells. Mice vaccinated with rMP12-PTNSs or rMP12-SFSNSs induced neutralizing antibodies at a level equivalent to those vaccinated with MP-12, and were efficiently protected from wild-type RVFV challenge. The rMP12-PTNSs and rMP12-SFSNSs did not induce antibodies cross-reactive to anti-RVFV NSs antibody and are therefore applicable to DIVA. Thus, rMP12-PTNSs is highly efficacious, replicates efficiently in MRC-5 cells, and encodes a DIVA marker, all of which are important for vaccine development for Rift Valley fever.","Lihoradova, Olga A.; Indran, Sabarish V.; Kalveram, Birte; Lokugamage, Nandadeva; Head, Jennifer A.; Gong, Bin; Tigabu, Bersabeh; Juelich, Terry L.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Ikegami, Tetsuro",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,186,28

It has been demonstrated previously that HCV non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is involved in cell transformation. In this study, a yeast two-hybrid screening experiment was conducted to identify cellular proteins interacting with HCV NS3 protein. Cytosolic 5′(3′)-deoxyribonucleotidase (cdN, dNT-1) was found to interact with HCV NS3 protein. Binding domains of HCV NS3 and cellular cdN proteins were also determined using the yeast two-hybrid system. Interactions between HCV NS3 and cdN proteins were further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and confocal analysis in cultured cells. The cellular cdN activity was partially repressed by NS3 protein in both the transiently-transfected and the stably-transfected systems. Furthermore, HCV partially repressed the cdN activity while had no effect on its protein expression in the systems of HCV sub-genomic replicons and infectious HCV virions. Deoxyribonucleotidases are present in most mammalian cells and involve in the regulation of intracellular deoxyribonucleotides pools by substrate cycles. Control of DNA precursor concentration is essential for the maintenance of genetic stability. Reduction of cdN activity would result in the imbalance of DNA precursor concentrations. Thus, our results suggested that HCV partially reduced the cdN activity via its NS3 protein and this may in turn cause diseases.","Fang, Chiu-Ping; Li, Zhi-Cheng; Yang, Chee-Hing; Cheng, Ju-Chien; Yeh, Yung-Ju; Sun, Tsai-Hsia; Li, Hui-Chun; Juang, Yue-Li; Lo, Shih-Yen",PLoS One,186,28

Detailed studies of glial cell tropism of MHV are presented, demonstrating that direct MHV infection of oligodendrocytes differs between demyelinating (RSA59) and non-demyelinating (RSMHV2) viral strains both in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicate that direct injury of mature oligodendrocytes is an important mechanism of virus-induced demyelination. In vivo, RSA59 infection was identified in spinal cord gray and white matter, but infected oligodendrocytes were restricted to white matter. In contrast, RSMHV2 infection was restricted to gray matter neurons and was not localized to oligodendrocytes. In vitro, RSA59 can infect both oligodendrocyte precursors and differentiated oligodendrocytes, whereas RSMHV2 can infect oligodendrocyte precursors but not differentiated oligodendrocytes. Viral spreading through axonal means to white matter and release of the demyelinating strain MHV at the nerve end is critical for oligodendrocytes infection and subsequent demyelination. Understanding the mechanisms by which known viruses effect demyelination in this animal model has important therapeutic implications in the treatment of human demyelinating disease.","Kenyon, Lawrence C.; Biswas, Kaushiki; Shindler, Kenneth S.; Nabar, Manasi; Stout, Marjorie; Hingley, Susan T.; Grinspan, Judith B.; Das Sarma, Jayasri",Front Cell Neurosci,186,28
3056,3056,3056,Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus Enters Caprine Endometrial Epithelial Cells via the Caveolae-Mediated Endocytosis Pathway,9.693035,7.674571,2018-02-15,"Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes an acute and highly contagious disease of sheep and goats and has spread with alarming speed around the world. The pathology of Peste des petits ruminants is linked to retrogressive changes and necrotic lesions in lymphoid tissues and epithelial cells. However, the process of PPRV entry into host epithelial cells remains largely unknown. Here, we performed a comprehensive study of the entry mechanism of PPRV into caprine endometrial epithelial cells (EECs). We clearly demonstrated that PPRV internalization was inhibited by chloroquine and ammonium chloride, which elevate the pH of various organelles. However, PPRV entry was not affected by chlorpromazine and knockdown of the clathrin heavy chain in EECs. In addition, we found that the internalization of PPRV was dependent on dynamin and membrane cholesterol and was suppressed by silencing of caveolin-1. Macropinocytosis did not play a role, but phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) was required for PPRV internalization. Cell type and receptor-dependent differences indicated that PPRV entry into caprine fetal fibroblast cells (FFCs) occurred via a different route. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PPRV enters EECs through a cholesterol-dependent caveolae-mediated uptake mechanism that is pH-dependent and requires dynamin and PI3K but is independent of clathrin. This potentially provides insight into the entry mechanisms of other morbilliviruses.","Yang, Bo; Qi, Xuefeng; Guo, Hui; Jia, Peilong; Chen, Shuying; Chen, Zhijie; Wang, Ting; Wang, Jingyu; Xue, Qinghong",Front Microbiol,186,28

3297,3297,3297,Wobbling Forth and Drifting Back: The Evolutionary History and Impact of Bacterial tRNA Modifications,9.547804,7.4918346,2018-05-28,"Along with tRNAs, enzymes that modify anticodon bases are a key aspect of translation across the tree of life. tRNA modifications extend wobble pairing, allowing specific (“target”) tRNAs to recognize multiple codons and cover for other (“nontarget”) tRNAs, often improving translation efficiency and accuracy. However, the detailed evolutionary history and impact of tRNA modifying enzymes has not been analyzed. Using ancestral reconstruction of five tRNA modifications across 1093 bacteria, we show that most modifications were ancestral to eubacteria, but were repeatedly lost in many lineages. Most modification losses coincided with evolutionary shifts in nontarget tRNAs, often driven by increased bias in genomic GC and associated codon use, or by genome reduction. In turn, the loss of tRNA modifications stabilized otherwise highly dynamic tRNA gene repertoires. Our work thus traces the complex history of bacterial tRNA modifications, providing the first clear evidence for their role in the evolution of bacterial translation.","Diwan, Gaurav D; Agashe, Deepa",Mol Biol Evol,186,1
3550,3550,3550,Clara Cell 10 kDa Protein Alleviates Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain 3-Induced Fulminant Hepatitis by Inhibiting Fibrinogen-Like Protein 2 Expression,9.584236,7.404095,2018-12-13,"Background: Fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a serious threat to human life, accompanied by massive and rapid necroinflammation. Kupffer cells, the major immune cell population involved in innate immune responses, are considered to be central for FH. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is a pro-coagulant protein that is substantially induced in macrophages upon viral infection, and Fgl2 depletion represses murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection. Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein is a secretory protein with anti-inflammatory properties in allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, its mechanisms of action and pathogenic roles in other disease are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CC10 in FH and the regulation of Fgl2 by CC10. Methods: A mouse FH model was established by peritoneal injection of MHV-3. The mice received CC10 protein through tail vein injection before viral infection. Survival rate, liver function, liver histology, fibrin deposition, and necrosis were examined. The regulatory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression was investigated using THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Results: In the mouse FH model induced by MHV-3, the survival rate increased from 0 to 12.5% in the CC10 group compared to that in the saline-only control group. Meanwhile, the levels of ALT and AST in serum were significantly decreased and liver damage was reduced. Furthermore, hepatic Fgl2, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression was obviously downregulated together with fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced after administration of CC10 protein. In vitro, CC10 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of Fgl2 in IFN-γ-treated THP-1 cells and MHV-3-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR. However, there was no direct interaction between CC10 and Fgl2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Microarray investigations suggested that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was significantly low in CC10-treated and IFN-γ-primed THP-1 cells. HBP1-siRNA treatment abrogated the inhibitory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conclusion:CC10 protects against MHV-3-induced FH via suppression of Fgl2 expression in macrophages. Such effects may be mediated by the transcription factor HBP1.","Yu, Haijing; Liu, Yang; Wang, Hongwu; Wan, Xiaoyang; Huang, Jiaquan; Yan, Weiming; Xi, Dong; Luo, Xiaoping; Shen, Guanxin; Ning, Qin",Front Immunol,186,28

To clarify the evolution of both VP1 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) regions of GII.P17-GII.17, we analyzed both global and novel Japanese strains detected during 2013–2017. Time-scaled phylogenetic trees revealed that the ancestral GII.17 VP1 region diverged around 1949, while the ancestral GII.P17 RdRp region diverged around 2010. The evolutionary rates of the VP1 and RdRp regions were estimated at ~2.7 × 10(−3) and ~2.3 × 10(−3) substitutions/site/year, respectively. The phylogenetic distances of the VP1 region exhibited no overlaps between intra-cluster and inter-cluster peaks in the GII.17 strains, whereas those of the RdRp region exhibited a unimodal distribution in the GII.P17 strains. Conformational epitope positions in the VP1 protein of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were similar, although some substitutions, insertions and deletions had occurred. Strains belonging to the same cluster also harbored substitutions around the binding sites for the histo-blood group antigens of the VP1 protein. Moreover, some amino acid substitutions were estimated to be near the interface between monomers and the active site of the RdRp protein.

AT-527 is the hemi-sulfate salt of AT-511, a novel phosphoramidate prodrug of 2’-fluoro-2’-C-methylguanosine-5'-monophosphate that has potent in vitro activity against HCV. The EC(50) of AT-511, determined using HCV laboratory strains and clinical isolates with genotypes 1–5, ranged from 5–28 nM. The active 5'-triphosphate metabolite, AT-9010, specifically inhibited the HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. AT-511 did not inhibit the replication of other selected RNA or DNA viruses in vitro. AT-511 was approximately 10-fold more active than sofosbuvir (SOF) against a panel of laboratory strains and clinical isolates of HCV genotypes 1–5 and remained fully active against S282T resistance-associated variants, with up to 58-fold more potency than SOF. In vitro, AT-511 did not inhibit human DNA polymerases or elicit cytotoxicity or mitochondrial toxicity at concentrations up to 100 μM. Unlike the other potent guanosine analogs PSI-938 and PSI-661, no mutagenic O(6)-alkylguanine bases were formed when incubated with cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and AT-511 had IC(50) values ≥25 μM against a panel of CYP enzymes. In hepatocytes from multiple species, the active triphosphate was the predominant metabolite produced from the prodrug, with a half-life of 10 h in human hepatocytes. When given orally to rats and monkeys, AT-527 preferentially delivered high levels of AT-9010 in the liver in vivo. These favorable preclinical attributes support the ongoing clinical development of AT-527 and suggest that, when used in combination with an HCV DAA from a different class, AT-527 may increase SVR rates, especially for difficult-to-treat patient populations, and could potentially shorten treatment duration for all patients.","Good, Steven S.; Moussa, Adel; Zhou, Xiao-Jian; Pietropaolo, Keith; Sommadossi, Jean-Pierre",PLoS One,186,28

The treatment of ARDS to date is focused on the prevention of further iatrogenic damage of the lung rather than the treatment of the initial inflammatory process. Several preclinical studies have revealed a beneficial effect of iloprost on the control of pulmonary inflammation, and in a small number of patients with ARDS, iloprost treatment resulted in improved oxygenation. Therefore, we plan to conduct a large multicenter trial to evaluate the effect of iloprost on ARDS. METHODS: The Therapeutic Iloprost during ARDS trial (ThIlo trial) is a multicenter, randomized, single blinded, clinical phase II trial assessing the efficacy of inhaled iloprost for the prevention of the development and progression of ARDS in critically ill patients. One hundred fifty critically ill patients suffering from acute ARDS will be treated either by nebulized iloprost or NaCl 0.9% for 5 days. Blood samples will be drawn at defined time points to elucidate the serum levels of iloprost and inflammatory markers during treatment. Mechanical ventilation will be standardized. In follow-up visits at days 28 and 90 as well as 6 months after enrollment, functional status according to the Barthel Index and a health care-related questionnaire, and frailty (Vulnerable Elders Survey) will be evaluated. The primary endpoint is the improvement of oxygenation, defined as the ratio of PaO(2)/FiO(2). Secondary endpoints include 90-day all-cause mortality, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores during the study period up to day 90, the duration of mechanical ventilation, the length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, ventilator-associated pneumonia, delirium, ICU-acquired weakness, and discharge localization. The study will be conducted in three university ARDS centers in Germany. DISCUSSION: The results of the ThIlo trial will highlight the anti-inflammatory effect of iloprost on early inflammatory processes during ARDS, resulting in the improvement of outcome parameters in patients with ARDS.

The primary determinant of the pantropism is the enhanced proteolytic cleavability of the fusion (F) protein of F1-R, which allows the virus to undergo multiple rounds of replication in many different organs, whereas wild-type virus can only undergo multiple rounds of replication in the lungs. The enhanced cleavability of F1-R F was previously attributed to an amino acid change at F115 that is adjacent to the cleavage site at amino acid 116. Secondly, wild-type virus buds only from the apical domain of bronchial epithelium, releasing virus into the lumen of the respiratory tract, whereas F1-R buds from both apical and basolateral domains. Thus, virus is released into the basement membrane where it can easily gain access to the bloodstream for dissemination. The microtubule disruption is attributed to two amino acid differences in M protein. To confirm that the F and M gene mutations described above are solely responsible for the phenotypic differences seen in wld-type versus F1-R infections, reverse genetics was used to construct recombinant Sendai viruses with various combinations of the mutations found in the M and F genes of F1-R. Plaque assays were performed with or without trypsin addition. A recombinant virus containing all F1-R M and F mutations formed plaques in LLC-MK2 cells and underwent multiple cycles of replication without trypsin addition. To clarify which mutation(s) are necessary for plaque formation, plaque assays were done using other recombinant viruses. A virus with only the F115 change, which was previously thought to be the only change important for plaque formation of F 1-R F, did not confer upon the virus the ability to form plaques without the addition of trypsin. Another virus with the F115 and both M changes gave the same result. Therefore, more than one mutation in the F gene contributes to the ability of F1-R to form plaques without trypsin addition.","Hou, Xiaogang; Suquilanda, Edgar; Zeledon, Ana; Kacsinta, Apollo; Moore, Akila; Seto, Joseph; McQueen, Nancy",Med Microbiol Immunol,186,1

Virus particles entered the cells by viropexis and distinction could be made between engulfment by cell processes (phagocytosis) and entry by micropinocytosis in coated transport vesicles. Virus maturation occurred by budding into either the cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum or cytoplasmic vacuoles, and evidence was obtained to suggest that the viral surface projections could be attached during the budding process. Late in infection large numbers of virus particles were present, mainly in cytoplasmic vacuoles, and the majority were released by cell lysis. Release by fusion of vacuoles with the plasma membrane was also observed, and individual virions could be transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the surface within coated vesicles.","Chasey, D.; Alexander, D.

In fact, various species concepts have been used by biologists and some of them are applicable to asexual organisms. The rationale for applying the species concept in virology is that viruses are biological entities and not chemicals: they possess genes, replicate, specialize, evolve and occupy specific ecological niches. The following definition is proposed: a virus species is a polythetic class of viruses constituting a replicating lineage and occupying a particular ecological niche. Such a definition of the species category does not and cannot provide a list of diagnostic properties for recognizing members of a particular virus species. It should also be stressed that a single property such as an arbitrary level of genome homology or the extent of serological relationship always fails to establish membership in a polythetic class. A binomial system of nomenclature is advocated in which the vernacular English name of the plant virus is adopted as the species name and the group name is assimilated to the level of genus. Adoption of this system would ensure that a universal classification system based on the classical categories of species, genus, and family becomes possible for all viruses.","Van Regenmortel, M. H.

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retroviruses which have been integrated into germ-line cells and inherited from parents to offspring. Most ERVs are inactivated by deletions and mutations; however, certain ERVs maintain their infectivity and infect the same host and new hosts as exogenous retroviruses. All domestic cats have infectious ERVs, termed RD-114 virus. Several canine and feline attenuated vaccines are manufactured using RD-114 virus-producing cell lines such as Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells; therefore, it is possible that infectious RD-114 virus contaminates live attenuated vaccines. Recently, Japanese and UK research groups found that several feline and canine vaccines were indeed contaminated with infectious RD-114 virus. This was the first incidence of contamination of ‘infectious’ ERVs in live attenuated vaccines. RD-114 virus replicates efficiently in canine cell lines and primary cells. Therefore, it is possible that RD-114 virus infects dogs following inoculation with contaminated vaccines and induces proliferative diseases and immune suppression, if it adapts to grow efficiently in dogs. In this review, we summarize the incidence of contamination of RD-114 virus in live attenuated vaccines and potential risks of infection with RD-114 virus in dogs.

In a cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF) assay, three MAbs directed against peplomer protein (E 2) had perinuclear fluorescence and four unclassified MAbs showed cell membrane fluorescence. Six of these seven MAbs neutralized both attenuated and virulent TGEV, and the seventh (an unclassified MAb) neutralized only the latter virus. Two MAbs able to bind the cell membrane of infected cells had low neutralizing antibody titers (8 to 72) but were able to distinguish between virulent and attenuated TGEV (9- to 72-fold differences in neutralizing titers). Two E 2-specific MAbs had higher neutralizing antibody titers (782 to 34,117) and showed 4- to 13-fold differences in titers against the attenuated and virulent TGEV strains. Five MAbs which were specific for nucleocapsid (N) protein had cytoplasmic, particulate fluorescence in CCIF, and did not neutralize TGEV. Comparison of CCIF antibody titers of MAbs to the virulent and attenuated strains of TGEV indicated that differences existed in titers of most E 2 and all N-specific MAbs, with titers consistently higher against virulent TGEV (homologous strain). Hyperimmune antisera prepared in gnotobiotic pigs against the attenuated, virulent and a recent isolate of TGEV immunoprecipitated the 3 major structural proteins of both the attenuated and virulent TGEV strains.

The bulk of the FL progeny virus was released from the host cells. K 87 virus was largely cell-associated. Both virus strains were stable at 37° C in liquid medium.

Colostrum-deprived (CD) calves, or calves receiving one dose of pooled control colostrum (CC) or immune colostrum (IC), containing an IgG1 titer to bovine rotavirus (BRV) of 1:16,384 or 1:262,144, respectively, were orally inoculated with 10(5.5) FFU of IND (P[5]G6) BRV at 2 days of age. Calves were monitored daily for diarrhea, virus shedding and anti-BRV Abs in feces by ELISA. Anti-rotavirus Ab titers in serum were evaluated weekly by isotype-specific ELISA and virus neutralization (VN). At 21 days post-inoculation (dpi), all animals were euthanized and the number of anti-BRV antibody secreting cells (ASC) in intestinal and systemic lymphoid tissues were evaluated by ELISPOT. After colostrum intake, IC calves had significantly higher IgG1 serum titers (GMT=28,526) than CC (GMT=1195) or CD calves (GMT<4). After BRV inoculation, all animals became infected with a mean duration of virus shedding between 6 and 10 days. However, IC calves had significantly fewer days of diarrhea (0.8 days) compared to CD and CC calves (11 and 7 days, respectively). In both groups receiving colostrum there was a delay in the onset of diarrhea and virus shedding associated with IgG1 in feces. In serum and feces, CD and CC calves had peak anti-BRV IgM titers at 7 dpi, but IgA and IgG1 responses were significantly lower in CC calves. Antibody titers detected in serum and feces were associated with circulation of ASC of the same isotype in blood. The IC calves had only an IgM response in feces. At 21 dpi, anti-BRV ASC responses were observed in all analyzed tissues of the three groups, except bone marrow. The intestine was the main site of ASC response against BRV and highest IgA ASC numbers. There was an inverse relationship between passive IgG1 titers and magnitude of ASC responses, with fewer IgG1 ASC in CC calves and significantly lower ASC numbers of all isotypes in IC calves. Thus, passive anti-BRV IgG1 negatively affects active immune responses in a dose-dependent manner. In ileal Peyer’s patches, IgM ASC predominated in calves receiving colostrum; IgG1 ASC predominated in CD calves. The presence in IC calves of IgG1 in feces in the absence of an IgG1 ASC response is consistent with the transfer of serum IgG1 back into the gut contributing to the protection of the intestinal mucosa.","Parreño, V; Béjar, C; Vagnozzi, A; Barrandeguy, M; Costantini, V; Craig, M.I; Yuan, L; Hodgins, D; Saif, L; Fernández, F",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,186,11

This renewal occurs in discrete proliferative zones along the gastrointestinal tract. In the small intestine, this proliferative zone is restricted to the base of the crypts, whereas in the large intestine it is less restrictive, occurring in the basal two thirds of the crypt. A longitudinal section along the crypt-to-surface axis, cells in various degrees of differentiation is observed, providing a unique in vivo system in which to investigate differentiation-related glycosylation events. The glycoconjugate repertoire displayed by a given cell reflects its endogenous expression of glycosyltransferases. The role played by terminal oligosaccharide structures in cell–cell recognition phenomena and the expression of glycosyltransferases occupy a key position in the post-translational processing of glycoconjugates and thus influence cellular function.","Taatjes, Douglas J.; Roth†, Jürgen",Int Rev Cytol,186,33

It was found that 100% of the cells in the passaged cultures were positive for viral antigen throughout the course of the experiment. Additionally, supernatants collected upon passaging of the cells continuously contained high titers of infectious virus. In six separate cultures persistently infected with either the biological clones or the recombinant virus, a cytopathic effect occurred spontaneously between passage 8 and 94. The cytopathogenic agent in the supernatants of these cultures could be passaged repeatedly, suggesting the generation of a mutant virus. Analysis of RNA from such cultures revealed the presence of a subgenomic viral RNA of approximately 8 kilobases (kb). In all six cases, this RNA had an identical internal deletion of 4764 nucleotides, including the region coding for all structural proteins. The subgenomic RNA replicated and was packaged in the presence of wild-type virus. Cells infected with cytopathogenic virus contained increased amounts of the viral protein NS3 thought to be involved in pestivirus cytopathogenicity.","Mittelholzer, Christian; Moser, Christian; Tratschin, Jon-Duri; Hofmann, Martin A",Virus Res,186,3

Suckling mice born to unimmunized dams rapidly succumb to an acute encephalomyelitis. MHV-JHM can be isolated from the brains and spinal cords of maternal antibody-protected mice when the late onset disease becomes clinically apparent, showing that the virus must be present in these mice when they are still asymptomatic. To determine which cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were potential reservoirs for the virus during the asymptomatic period, tissue sections were assayed simultaneously by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of viral antigen and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes.(2) The results indicate that 20% (range 0–52%) of the MHV-JHM infected cells in asymptomatic mice were astrocytes. In mice symptomatic with late onset hindlimb paralysis, a higher percentage of infected cells were astrocytes. These results indicate that astrocytes are a target cell in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mice persistently infected with MHV-JHM, and suggest that the astrocyte is a potential cellular reservoir for MHV-JHM in asymptomatic mice.","Perlmans, Stanley; Ries, Dana",Microb Pathog,186,28

Depending on the species, parasites can disrupt intestinal bacterial microbiota affecting essential vitamin biosynthesis. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from 37 asymptomatic children from a previous cross-sectional Argentinian study. A multi-parallel real-time quantitative PCR was implemented for Ascaris lumbricoides, Ancylostoma duodenale, Necator americanus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia duodenalis. In addition, whole-genome sequencing analysis was conducted for bacterial microbiota on all samples and analyzed using Livermore Metagenomic Analysis Toolkit and DIAMOND software. Separate analyses were carried out for uninfected, Giardia-only, Giardia + helminth co-infections, and helminth-only groups. RESULTS: For Giardia-only infected children compared to uninfected children, DNA sequencing data showed a decrease in microbiota biodiversity that correlated with increasing Giardia burden and was statistically significant using Shannonʼs alpha diversity (Giardia-only > 1 fg/µl 2.346; non-infected group 3.253, P = 0.0317). An increase in diversity was observed for helminth-only infections with a decrease in diversity for Giardia + helminth co-infections (P = 0.00178). In Giardia-only infections, microbiome taxonomy changed from Firmicutes towards increasing proportions of Prevotella, with the degree of change related to the intensity of infection compared to uninfected (P = 0.0317). The abundance of Prevotella bacteria was decreased in the helminths-only group but increased for Giardia + helminth co-infections (P = 0.0262). Metagenomic analysis determined cobalamin synthesis was decreased in the Giardia > 1 fg/µl group compared to both the Giardia < 1 fg/µl and the uninfected group (P = 0.0369). Giardia + helminth group also had a decrease in cobalamin CbiM genes from helminth-only infections (P = 0.000754). CONCLUSION: The study results may provide evidence for an effect of parasitic infections enabling the permissive growth of anaerobic bacteria such as Prevotella, suggesting an altered capacity of vitamin B12 (cobalamin) biosynthesis and potential impact on growth and development in children [Image: see text].","Mejia, Rojelio; Damania, Ashish; Jeun, Rebecca; Bryan, Patricia E.; Vargas, Paola; Juarez, Marisa; Cajal, Pamela S.; Nasser, Julio; Krolewiecki, Alejandro; Lefoulon, Emilie; Long, Courtney; Drake, Evan; Cimino, Rubén O.; Slatko, Barton",Parasit Vectors,186,28

This chapter examines in more detail the structure and properties of the important human viruses in this group, namely measles, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), mumps and parainfluenza viruses I-V. They are all enveloped, negative-stranded, riboviruses of helical symmetry. It is suggested that susceptible children, adolescents, and adults should be vaccinated against mumps, unless vaccination is contraindicated. Mumps vaccine can be of particular value to children approaching puberty and for adolescents and adults, especially males who have not had mumps in childhood. Ribavirin therapy may be particularly beneficial for children at risk for severe and often fatal RSV infection, such as infants with congenital heart disease. Attenuated measles vaccines have been developed empirically by selection of host range mutants, and are widely and successfully used throughout the world. Using the vaccine, some countries may soon eliminate measles as an endogenous virus but continued problems are anticipated, particularly in adults with viruses re-introduced by visitors from abroad. Basic studies on new antivirals are continuing (particularly with oligopeptides) but antiviral compounds are unlikely to have extended use in the clinic, except perhaps in tropical areas where the disease may be life threatening.

In real societies, it is expected that these two processes depend on and affect each other. However, little is known about the effects of opinion dynamics over disease dynamics and vice versa, since most studies treat them separately. In this work we study the dynamics of the voter model for opinion formation intertwined with that of the contact process for disease spreading, in a population of agents that interact via two types of connections, social and contact. These two interacting dynamics take place on two layers of networks, coupled through a fraction [Formula: see text] of links present in both networks. The probability that an agent updates its state depends on both the opinion and disease states of the interacting partner. We find that the opinion dynamics has striking consequences on the statistical properties of disease spreading. The most important is that the smooth (continuous) transition from a healthy to an endemic phase observed in the contact process, as the infection probability increases beyond a threshold, becomes abrupt (discontinuous) in the two-layer system. Therefore, disregarding the effects of social dynamics on epidemics propagation may lead to a misestimation of the real magnitude of the spreading. Also, an endemic-healthy discontinuous transition is found when the coupling [Formula: see text] overcomes a threshold value. Furthermore, we show that the disease dynamics delays the opinion consensus, leading to a consensus time that varies nonmonotonically with [Formula: see text] in a large range of the model's parameters. A mean-field approach reveals that the coupled dynamics of opinions and disease can be approximately described by the dynamics of the voter model decoupled from that of the contact process, with effective probabilities of opinion and disease transmission.","Velásquez-Rojas, Fátima; Vazquez, Federico",Phys Rev E,186,1

Despite their potential benefits, there are no summative data examining the cost-effectiveness of probiotics in hospitalized patients. This systematic review summarized studies evaluating the economic impact of using probiotics in hospitalized adult patients. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ACP Journal Club, and other EBM reviews (inception to January 31, 2019) for health economics evaluations examining the use of probiotics in hospitalized adults. Independently and in duplicate, we extracted data study characteristics, risk of bias, effectiveness and total costs (medications, diagnostics/procedures, devices, personnel, hospital) associated with healthcare-associated infections (ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea and antibiotic-associated diarrhea). We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methods to assess certainty in the overall cost-effectiveness evidence. RESULTS: Of 721 citations identified, we included seven studies. For the clinical outcomes of interest, there was one randomized-controlled trial (RCT)-based health economic evaluation, and six model-based health economic evaluations. Probiotics showed favourable cost-effectiveness in six of seven (86%) economic evaluations. Three of the seven studies were manufacturer-supported, all which suggested cost-effectiveness. Certainty of cost-effectiveness evidence was very low because of risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may be an economically attractive intervention for preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia, Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea in hospitalized adult patients. Nevertheless, certainty about their cost-effectiveness evidence is very low. Future RCTs examining probiotics should incorporate cost data to inform bedside practice, clinical guidelines, and healthcare policy.

STUDY DESIGN: Human milk samples were collected from 152 healthy women. B. cereus, S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) were enumerated using selective agar culture media. The detection of B. cereus spores and SEs were determined using ELISA. RESULTS: CNS and B. cereus concentrations in milk from non-vaccinated mothers were higher than that from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy, but S. aureus did not differ. Prematurity did not affect B. cereus or staphylococci in human milk. S. aureus and CNS concentrations in human milk with the presence of B. cereus were higher than that with the absence of B. cereus. Viable B. cereus was present in 9.2% of raw human milk samples whereas SEs were not detected in any samples. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination during pregnancy and low concentration of staphylococci could reduce the risk of B. cereus in raw human milk.

METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on neurocritically ill patients at a 413-bed level 1 trauma and stroke center who received three or more days of mechanical ventilation to describe rates of VAE, describe characteristics of patients with VAE, and examine the association of VAE on ventilator days, mortality, length of stay, and discharge to home. RESULTS: Over a 5-year period from 2014 through 2018, 855 neurocritically ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation were identified. A total of 147 VAEs occurred in 130 (15.2%) patients with an overall VAE rate of 13 per 1000 ventilator days and occurred across age, sex, BMI, and admission Glasgow Coma Scores. The average time from the start of ventilation to a VAE was 5 (range 3–48) days after initiation of mechanical ventilation. Using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definitions, VAEs met criteria for a ventilator-associated condition in 58% of events (n = 85), infection-related VAE in 22% of events (n = 33), and possible ventilator-associated pneumonia in 20% of events (n = 29). A most common trigger for VAE was an increase in positive end-expiratory pressure (84%). Presence of a VAE was associated with an increase in duration of mechanical ventilation (17.4[IQR 20.5] vs. 7.9[8.9] days, p < 0.001, 95% CI 7.86–13.92), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (20.2[1.1] vs. 12.5[0.4] days, p < 0.001 95% CI 5.3–10.02), but not associated with in-patient mortality (34.1 vs. 31.3%. 95% CI 0.76–1.69) or discharge to home (12.7% vs. 16.3%, 95% 0.47–1.29).

METHODS: A literature review provided the theoretical framework for developing the Nursing Students’ Readiness for Flipped Classroom (NSR-FC) questionnaire. Five content experts evaluated the NSR-FC, and content validity indices (CVI) were calculated. Cross-sectional surveys among 355 undergraduate nursing students from 3 state universities in Sri Lanka were carried out to assess the psychometric properties of the NSR-FC. Principal component analysis (PCA, n=265), internal consistency (using the Cronbach α coefficient, n=265), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA, n=90) were done to test construct validity and reliability. RESULTS: Thirty-seven items were included in the NSR-FC for content validation, resulting in an average scale CVI of 0.94. Two items received item level CVI of less than 0.78. The factor structures of the 35 items were explored through PCA with orthogonal factor rotation, culminating in the identification of 5 factors. These factors were classified as technological readiness, environmental readiness, personal readiness, pedagogical readiness, and interpersonal readiness. The NSR-FC also showed an overall acceptable level of internal consistency (Cronbach α=0.9). CFA verified a 4-factor model (excluding the interpersonal readiness factor) and 20 items that achieved acceptable fit (standardized root mean square residual=0.08, root mean square error of approximation=0.08, comparative fit index=0.87, and χ(2)/degrees of freedom=1.57).

Over the course of four seasons, this study conducted a mobile sampling scheme to collect time-resolved measures of UFP, CO(2), and black carbon (BC) concentrations, as well as UFP size distributions. Primary findings were that UFPs were associated with both roadway traffic and aircraft sources, with the highest UFP counts found on the major roadway (I-5). Total concentrations of UFPs alone (10–1000 nm) did not distinguish roadway and aircraft features.

On the contrary, extracellular vesicles have only recently gained a massive increase in interest and, concomitantly, knowledge in the field has drastically risen. Viral infections and extracellular vesicle biology overlap in many ways, both with pro- and antiviral outcomes. In this review, we take a closer look at these interactions for the most prominent groups of viral vectors (Adenoviral, Adeno-associated and Retro/Lentiviral vectors) and the possible implications of these overlaps for viral vector technology and its biomedical applications.","Metzner, Christoph; Zaruba, Marianne",Viruses,186,1

For example, researchers not only look for an ‘average effect’ of a drug on a typical patient, but also seek to understand individual variability. The presence of variability impacts significantly on the success of clinical trials and failure to identify this variability can result in the clinical trial being under-powdered to detect a treatment effect. For clinicians, failure to recognize variability can result in unintended toxicity or excessive harm in certain patients. Hence, understanding variability is critically important in both research and clinical practice.","Tang, B. M.; Huang, S. J.; McLean, A. S.",Yearbook of Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine,186,1

In this regard, it makes sense for us to divide antigenicity into immunogenicity and allergenicity. This distinction allows for the characterization of all types of modern antigens, i.e., to evaluate and modify a priori the allergenicity of an antigen before it is applied to humans. In this chapter, we also formulated the hypothesis that “Balanced Stimulation by Whole Antigens” is essential for immune development. This hypothesis revives the practicality of the “Hygiene Hypothesis” and can provide a fundamental solution to curb the increasing prevalence of allergic disease, namely, early exposure, at 0–1 year old or earlier, in utero, of representative allergens/protein antigens with immunogenicity retained or improved and allergenicity attenuated or eliminated.","Zhang, Jianguo; Tao, Ailin",Allergy Bioinformatics,186,1

The focus was on infectious diseases which could be transmitted to the finishing units with delivered growers, and which might have some influence on partial carcass condemnations (PCC) in meat inspection. Farm visits were done by a veterinarian (senior author) assisted by a technician. Colostrum samples (average 22 per herd) were taken in 100 herds, and analyzed for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (A. pleur) and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M.hyo) antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Only nine of 114 herds were judged to be free of mange. It was concluded that all finishing units received mange-infected feeder pigs each time the unit was filled. One or more acute erysipelas outbreaks had occurred in every fifth herd during the previous year. The risk of a finishing unit receiving feeder pigs carrying erysipelas was considered to be high. Swine dysentery (Serpulina hyodysenteriae) was not found to be a problem in the LSO area. Clostridium perfringens type C enteritis was found in eight (7%) herds. Seven of these herds were located in those supply areas where the PCC percentage of feeder pigs was high. In spite of statistical connection no causality between this disease and PCC was presumed. There were no previous diagnoses of respiratory diseases but spontaneous coughing was observed in 5% of the herds. Provocation testing induced coughing in 22% of herds but not serious coughing in any herd. Managers had observed coughing in 15% of herds. Ninety-one herds were positive in a colostrum ELISA for A. pleur antibodies, and eight herds were positive for M.hyo antibodies. A.pleur-positive herds had several positive or samples suspected of being positive in each herd bu M.hyo-positive herds had only one or two positive or suspected samples per herd. Six of the M.hyo herds were located in the high PCC area, two in the average PCC area and none in the low PCC area. M.hyo was suggested to be one of the possible explanations for geographical variation of PCC. Atrophic rhinitis was not considered to be of importance in LSO.","Tuovinen, Veikko K.; Levonen, Katri H.; Gröhn, YrjöT.; Straw, Barbara E.",Prev Vet Med,186,3

Recently, a terrestrial isopod species was found to be infected by an unusual strain of supergroup F Wolbachia. However, only Wolbachia of supergroup B is typically found in isopods. One possibility is that these isopods acquired the infection because of their recurrent contact with termites—a group with strong evidence of infection by supergroup F Wolbachia. Thus, our goals were: (1) check if the infection was an isolated case in isopods, or if it revealed a broader pattern; (2) search for Wolbachia infection in the termites within Brazil; and (3) look for evidence consistent with horizontal transmission between isopods and termites. We collected Neotroponiscus terrestrial isopods and termites along the Brazilian coastal Atlantic forest. We sequenced and identified the Wolbachia strains found in these groups using coxA, dnaA, and fpbA genes. We constructed phylogenies for both bacteria and host taxa and tested for coevolution. We found the supergroup F Wolbachia in other species and populations of Neotroponiscus, and also in Nasutitermes and Procornitermes termites. The phylogenies showed that, despite the phylogenetic distance between isopods and termites, the Wolbachia strains clustered together. Furthermore, cophylogenetic analyses showed significant jumps of Wolbachia between terrestrial isopods and termites. Thus, our study suggests that the horizontal transmission of supergroup F Wolbachia between termites and terrestrial isopods is likely. Our study also helps understanding the success and worldwide distribution of this symbiont.

The results highlight a single break in return predictability and price volatility of both S&P 500 and DJIA. The timing of the break is consistent with the COVID-19 outbreak, or more specifically the stock selling-offs by the U.S. senate committee members before COVID-19 crashed the market. Furthermore, return predictability and price volatility significantly increased following the derived break. The findings suggest that the pandemic crisis was associated with market inefficiency, creating profitable opportunities for traders and speculators. Furthermore, it also induced income and wealth inequality between market participants with plenty of liquidity at hand and those short of funds.","Hong, Hui; Bian, Zhicun; Lee, Chien-Chiang",Financ Innov,186,16

The effect of a strategy of HD with cohort isolation-separate dialysis sessions for close contacts of patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-on the prevention of secondary transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in HD units is unknown. METHODS Our multicenter cohort study of an HD with cohort isolation strategy enrolled close contacts of patients with confirmed COVID-19, including patients on HD and health care workers in HD units. Close contacts had been identified by epidemiologic investigation and tested negative on an immediate screening test for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS As of March 14, 11 patients on HD and 7 health care workers from 11 HD centers were diagnosed as having COVID-19. The immediate screening test was performed in 306 people, and among them, 302 close contacts with negative test results were enrolled. HD with cohort isolation was performed among all close contacts for a median of 14 days in seven centers. During cohort isolation, nine patients showed symptoms but tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Two health care workers in the HD units (0.66% of the total group) were diagnosed at the termination test for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS The transmission of COVID-19 can be controlled without closure of HD centers by implementing preemptive activities, including early detection with rapid testing, cohort isolation, collaboration between institutions, and continuous monitoring of infection. Our strategy and experience may provide helpful guidance for circumstances involving the rapid spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19.","Cho, Jang-Hee; Kang, Seok Hui; Park, Hayne Cho; Kim, Dong Ki; Lee, Sang-Ho; Do, Jun Young; Park, Jong Won; Kim, Seong Nam; Kim, Myeong Seong; Jin, Kyubok; Kang, Gun Woo; Park, Sun-Hee; Kim, Yong-Lim; Lee, Young-Ki",Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,186,1

In this article, we outline the risks, benefits, and uncertainties surrounding endovascular DVT therapies, describe clinical situations in which endovascular treatment options should reasonably be considered, and update the reader on new outcome data that pertains to catheter-based DVT interventions. Endovascular thrombolytic therapy is reasonable to perform for selected patients with DVT causing acute limb-threatening circulatory compromise, acute inferior vena cava occlusion, or acute iliofemoral DVT for the purposes of limb salvage and relief of presenting DVT symptoms, and appears likely to prevent post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) in patients with proximal DVT.

Selected patients with established moderate-to-severe PTS in association with an occluded iliac vein or a refluxing saphenous vein may also be amenable to endovascular intervention to reduce venous hypertension, alleviate symptoms, and improve limb function and quality of life. Pending the results of further studies, an individualized approach to patient selection for interventional DVT therapies is recommended.","Vedantham, Suresh",American journal of hematology,186,16

Hybrid NOSE and NOTES are emerging as an alternative approach to conventional laparoscopy. We believe that UC patients could benefit from this new hybrid approach in three ways: by easing the proctectomy as performed down to up, avoiding additional incisions and decreasing surgical times. We present the short-term outcomes of our series. METHODS All patients with UC who required IPAA were enrolled in a single-arm prospective study (July 2011 to March 2014). A three-step procedure was performed. The first step: laparoscopic colectomy (with transanal removal of the colon) and temporary ileostomy. The second step: ""down-to-up"" proctectomy (with transanal removal of the rectum) and IPAA with a covering ileostomy. We combined simultaneously transanal and laparoscopic approach. The third step: ileostomy closure. Functional outcomes were assessed 3 months after third step. RESULTS Eighteen patients were enrolled. Two patients are waiting to complete the second stage, and 16 underwent all surgical steps. Twelve have been evaluated with functional scores. For the first step, the mean operative time was 162.2 min (SD 40.5) and 170 min (SD 50.1) for the second one. The median hospital stay was 6 days (IQR 5-14.75) for the first step and 5.5 (IQR 5-9.75) for the second one. No major complications occurred. Twenty-four-hour defecation frequency was 5.5 per day (SD 1.7), 0.5 per night. Seventy-five percentage of patients may retain stools for more than 30 min; the mean value of Oresland score was 4.7 and Wexner score 1.4. CONCLUSIONS This is a safe and feasible technique to treat UC patients with good short-term outcomes. Long-term outcomes and controlled trials are needed.","Tasende, Marta M; Delgado, Salvadora; Jimenez, Marta; Del Gobbo, Gabriel Diaz; Fernández-Hevia, María; DeLacy, Borja; Balust, Jaume; Lacy, Antonio M",Surgical endoscopy,186,1

Underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with severe COVID-19 infection and adverse clinical outcomes. While COVID-19 predominantly causes respiratory symptoms, a substantial number of patients eventually develop an acute cardiovascular syndrome associated with an excessive risk of mortality. While the exact mechanisms remain uncertain, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 plays a pivotal role as a link between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. As there is no evidence that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system is harmful in COVID-19, therapy should be continued as indicated in hypertension or heart failure patients. As multiple drugs are being investigated in ongoing clinical trials, potential cardiotoxicity remains an important issue. In times of rigorous public health measures such as social distancing, efforts should be undertaken to ensure timely treatment of acute CVD and continuation of guideline-directed treatment in order to avoid an increase in morbidity and mortality. In addition to its acute complications, COVID-19 is likely to be associated with long-term cardiovascular damage.

Moreover, we report that chloroquine does not block SARS-CoV-2 infection of the TMPRSS2-positive lung cell line Calu-3.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted 3 experiments using 30 rats. In experiment 1, we administered either ferucarbotran (n = 6) or saline (n = 4), acquired T2*-weighted images (T2*-WIs) of the liver by using a 3-T magnetic resonance scanner, and subsequently performed RFA of healthy liver lobes. We acquired follow-up T2*-WIs up to day 7 and histologically analyzed the liver specimens. In another 4 rats, we performed sham operation, instead of RFA, in ferucarbotran-accumulated liver lobes, followed by the same image acquisition and histological analysis. In experiment 2, we administered 59Fe-labeled ferucarbotran, subsequently performed either RFA (n = 4) or sham operation (n = 4) in the liver, and acquired autoradiograms of the liver specimens on day 7. In experiment 3, we conducted RFA treatment for 8 rats bearing orthotopic hepatic tumors after ferucarbotran administration and monitored tumor growth by using serial T2*-WIs. RESULTS On days 4 and 7 of the experiment 1, T2*-WIs of 6 rats with systemic ferucarbotran administration and subsequent hepatic RFA showed low-signal regions indicative of ablated liver tissues, whereas high-signal areas were seen in 4 saline-administered rats. Neither high nor low signal areas were detected in 4 sham-operated rats. Histologically, larger amounts of iron were observed in the RFA-induced necrotic liver tissues in the ferucarbotran-administered rats than in the saline-administered-rats. The 59Fe autoradiography of the rats in experiment 2 revealed accumulation of ferucarbotran-derived iron in necrotic liver tissues. Among 6 hepatic tumors grown in 6 rats of the experiment 3, a total of 4 tumors were stable in size, but the other 2 increased markedly on day 7. Retrospectively, T2*-WIs showed the former tumor sites surrounded completely by low-signal areas on day 4. CONCLUSIONS The RFA of ferucarbotran-accumulated healthy liver tissues in the rats caused excess iron deposition in the ablated liver tissues and produced sustained T2*-weighted hypointense regions. Similar hypointense regions surrounding hepatic tumors were indicative of ablative margins.","Nagai, Michiko; Yamaguchi, Masayuki; Mori, Kensaku; Furuta, Toshihiro; Ashino, Hiroki; Kurosawa, Hiroyuki; Kasahara, Hiroyuki; Minami, Manabu; Fujii, Hirofumi",Investigative radiology,186,31

We find that the sensitivity to these couplings at the ongoing MINER and various other reactor based neutrino experiments, e.g., CONNIE, CONUS, ν-cleus, etc., exceeds existing limits set by laboratory experiments and, for the ALP-electron coupling, we forecast the world's best laboratory-based constraints over a large portion of the sub-MeV ALP mass range.","Dent, James B; Dutta, Bhaskar; Kim, Doojin; Liao, Shu; Mahapatra, Rupak; Sinha, Kuver; Thompson, Adrian",Physical review letters,186,31

METHODOLOGY Clermont's phylogenetic classification; presence of genes for curli, cellulose, fimbriae (F4, F5, F6, F18, F41); and antimicrobial susceptibility were used to characterize the isolates. Disk diffusion technique and PCR were used as methodologies. RESULTS E. coli isolates from calves with diarrhea were phylogenetically classified as B1 (70%, 21/30), B2 (3.33%, 1/30), C (3.33%, 1/30), D (3.33%, 1/30), E (13.33%, 4/30) and unknown (6.7 %; 2/30), whereas E. coli isolates from the control group were classified only as B1 (83.3%, 25/30), E (10 %; 3/30) and unknown (6,7 %; 2/30). E. coli isolates from calves with diarrhea showed a much higher resistance profile with 16 (53.3%) multiresistant isolates. Only isolates (30%-9/30) from diarrheic calves were also positive for fimbriae, specifically 16.7% (5/30) for F5 and 13.3% (4/30) for F18. CONCLUSION To sum up, E. coli isolates from calves with diarrhea showed differences in relation to the control group, confirming changes in commensal E. coli during virus intestinal infection. It can be emphasized that some care should be taken to manage diarrheic calves: the pathological agent must be diagnosed prior to treatment; antibacterial treatment should be with antimicrobials with a different mechanism of action; and finally, treated animals should be maintained separately from others because they can carry micro-organisms with a resistant profile.","Maciel, Jonas Fernandes; Matter, Letícia Beatriz; Tasca, Caiane; Scheid, Daniela Alessandra Rambo; Gressler, Letícia Trevisan; Ziech, Rosângela Estel; Vargas, Agueda Castagna de",Journal of medical microbiology,186,1

Our aim was to investigate differences in clinical and procedural outcomes related to stenting extracranial lesions in a registry of patients undergoing thrombectomy for acute stroke. Methods- Data were analyzed from the STRATIS registry (Systematic Evaluation of Patients Treated With Neurothrombectomy Devices for Acute Ischemic Stroke)-a prospective, nonrandomized study of patients undergoing neurothrombectomy with the Solitaire device. A total of 984 patients treated at 55 sites were analyzed. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression was used to assess relationship between outcome and procedural technique. Results- Of 147 (14.9%) patients with tandem lesions treated, stenting of the extracranial lesion during thrombectomy was performed in 80 patients and withheld in 67 patients. There were no differences between groups with respect to age, ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score), or intravenous-tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator) use. However, the patients in the stenting group had lower baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (16 versus 17.9; P=0.07), shorter onset to arterial puncture time (133.6 versus 163.4 minutes; P=0.04), and lower rates of atrial fibrillation (6.3% versus 25.4%) as compared to the nonstenting group. Good outcomes (modified Rankin Scale, 0-2 at 90 days) were higher in the stenting group (68.5% versus 42.2%; P=0.003) with no difference in mortality or symptomatic hemorrhage. After adjustment for covariates, stenting continued to be associated with superior outcomes. Conclusions- Acute stenting of an extracranial carotid stenosis during neurothrombectomy can be achieved with equal safety compared with no stenting. Carotid stenting in the acute phase may lead to better outcomes; this should ideally be confirmed by randomized trials.","Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Zaidat, Osama O; Liebeskind, David S; Yavagal, Dileep R; Haussen, Diogo C; Hellinger, Frank R; Jahan, Reza; Jumaa, Mouhammad A; Szeder, Viktor; Nogueira, Raul G; Jovin, Tudor G",Stroke,186,17

Especially, involvement of the upper aspect of the lower lobe is unknown. The primary aim was to quantitatively determine regional distribution of emphysema in anatomically (lung lobes) and non-anatomically defined lung regions (upper/lower lung halves as well as core and rind regions) in a cohort covering equally all COPD severity stages using CT. MATERIAL AND METHODS Basically 100 CT data sets were quantitatively evaluated for regional distribution of emphysema. Emphysema characteristics (emphysema index, mean lung density and 15th percentile of the attenuation values of lung voxels) were compared (t-test) in: upper lobes vs. upper halves, lower lobes vs. lower halves, core vs. rind region. RESULTS In patients with ≤ GOLD II, a significantly higher emphysema burden was found in the upper lobes as compared to upper halves. In subjects with GOLD III/IV the differences were not significant for all emphysema characteristics. A high difference between lobes and halves in subjects with ≤ GOLD II was found, in contrast to low difference in higher GOLD stages. CONCLUSIONS Lobar segmentation provides improved characterization of cranio-caudal emphysema distribution compared to a non-anatomic approach in subjects up to GOLD stage II.","Owsijewitsch, Michael; Ley-Zaporozhan, Julia; Kuhnigk, Jan-Martin; Kopp-Schneider, Annette; Eberhardt, Ralf; Eichinger, Monika; Heussel, Claus Peter; Kauczor, Hans-Ulrich; Ley, Sebastian",COPD,186,1

We know that the elderly and people with chronic diseases contract the infection more easily and they develop clinically more serious and often lethal forms. To date, the reasons for this have been generically attributed to old age and underlying diseases. Most Covid-19 deaths occurred in long-term care facilities because the residents are elderly people with chronic illness living in close contact. Therefore, facilities have become epidemic outbreaks. Forensic knowledge is very limited because an autopsy is rarely performed. Post-mortem investigations can help increase knowledge about Covid-19 and identify any undiagnosed pathologies in life. Therefore, forensic investigations play a role in protecting a frail population.

In this study, we developed Bo-TSA-NP, a novel tanshinone IIA (TSA) loaded nanoparticles modified by borneol, which has long been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs' transport across the BBB. The Bo-TSA-NP, with a particle size of about 160 nm, drug loading of 3.6%, showed sustained release and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition property. It demonstrated a significantly higher uptake by 16HBE cells in vitro through the clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis. Following intranasal (IN) administration, Bo-TSA-NP significantly improved the preventive effect on a rat model of CIRI with improved neurological scores, decreased cerebral infarction areas and a reduced content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat brain. In conclusion, these results indicate that Bo-TSA-NP is a promising nose-to-brain delivery system that can enhance the prevention effect of TSA on CIRI.","Wang, Luting; Xu, Lin; Du, Junfeng; Zhao, Xiao; Liu, Mei; Feng, Jianfang; Hu, Kaili",Drug delivery,186,19

The virulence mechanisms associated with Staphylococcus aureus biofilms are becoming better understood. Human neutrophils are critical for the innate immune response to S. aureus infection. Here we describe two virulence strategies that converge to promote the ability of S. aureus biofilms to evade killing by neutrophils. Specifically, we show that while neutrophils exposed to S. aureus biofilms produce extracellular traps (NETs) and phagocytose bacteria, both mechanisms are inefficient in clearance of the biofilm biomass. This is attributed to the leukocidin LukAB, which promotes S. aureus survival during phagocytosis. We also show that the persistence of biofilm bacteria trapped in NETs is facilitated by S. aureus nuclease (Nuc)-mediated degradation of NET DNA. This study describes key aspects of the interaction between primary human neutrophils and S. aureus biofilms and provides insight for how S. aureus evades the neutrophil response to cause persistent infections.","Bhattacharya, Mohini; Berends, Evelien T M; Zheng, Xuhui; Hill, Preston J; Chan, Rita; Torres, Victor J; Wozniak, Daniel J",Infection and immunity,186,2

Trauma victims with clear indications for surgery, should undergo immediate operative intervention without any delay or additional imaging. However, the optimal time for surgery remains unclear. There are some significant advantages in preoperative abdominal CT, including gathering essential information regarding a few difficult to reach anatomical areas, avoiding unnecessary explorations associated with increased morbidity and assessing the existence of extra-abdominal injuries that may have non-expectable impact on initial therapeutic plan. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of ""time-to-surgery"" on final medical outcomes in patients with penetrating abdominal trauma with normal blood pressure on admission. METHODS A retrospective cohort study using the Israeli National Trauma Registry was conducted from 2000- 2018. This study included trauma patients with penetrating injuries and a systolic blood pressure of 90mmHg or above on admission. All patients included in the study were divided into three groups according to the time that lapsed from their admission to surgery: half an hour, an hour, and two hours. We assessed the outcome for each patient, including length of hospital stay, need for intensive care and mortality. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square test, ANOVA test. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS The study included 1,136 penetrating trauma patients. Among these, 78.0% (886) had sustained low-energy penetrating injury (SWPI) and 22.0% (250) had sustained high-energy penetrating injury (FAPI). Males accounted for 93.5% (1,062) of the patients. Mean age was 30.4. About 29% (327) of all the patients underwent surgery within 30 minutes from admission, 42% (475) within 30-60 min, and 29% (334) patients were operated within one to two hours. Patients who underwent surgery within 30 minutes, had worse ISS and GCS scores and were, therefore, more likely to have worse clinical outcomes. No other differences in outcomes were found in patients who were operated upon within 2 hours. CONCLUSIONS Time to surgery within two hours from admission has no impact on final outcomes in trauma patients with penetrating injury and normal blood pressure on admission.","Hershkovitz, Y; Bodas, M; Givon, A; Kessel, B",Injury,186,5

This study evaluated whether measurement of the electrocardiographic R-wave and the arrival time of the pulses at the toe pulse transit time (E-T PTT) can be an early predictor of pain response and success of CPB in patients with chronic intractable visceral pain. METHODS Twelve patients aged between 20 and 80 years who underwent CPB for treatment of chronic intractable cancer-related abdominal pain were included. A successful CPB was determined as a >50% decrease on the numerical rating scale measured 24 hours after the procedure. The E-T PTT at baseline and at 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes after the injection of local anesthetic was measured as the time between the R-wave on the electrocardiogram and the peak point of the corresponding plethysmogram wave from the ipsilateral great toe. The change in the E-T PTT that was predictive of a successful CPB was analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS A CPB was successful in 9 of 12 cases; the dE-T PTT5/E-T PTT0 of the success group was 6.84%±5.04% versus 0.72%±0.78% in the failure group (P=0.021). The mean E-T PTTx differed significantly between timepoints (F=9.313, P=0.014) and between the success and failure groups (P<0.01). The best value of dE-T PTT5/E-T PTT0 indicating a successful CPB, estimated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, was 2.30% (sensitivity 88.9%, specificity 100%). The area under the curve was 96% (95% confidence interval, 85.7%-100%). CONCLUSIONS Prolongation of E-T PTT at 5 minutes after CPB correlates closely with a significant analgesic effect.","Kim, Young Uk; Kim, Doo Hwan; Cheong, Yuseon; Kong, Yu-Gyeong; Lee, Jonghyuk; Park, Soo Kyoung; Karm, Myong-Hwan; Suh, Jeong Hun",The Clinical journal of pain,186,11

The prognosis is poor if early recanalization is not achieved. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of self-expanding retrievable stents in the endovascular treatment of acute basilar artery occlusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS Twenty-four patients with acute basilar artery occlusion were treated with Solitaire FR or Revive SE devices between December 2009 and May 2012. Additional treatment included intravenous and/or intra-arterial thrombolysis (21/24) and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty/permanent stent placement (7/24). Recanalization was assessed by means of the TICI score. Clinical outcome was determined at discharge (NIHSS), and at 3 months (mRS). RESULTS Median NIHSS score on admission was 24; median duration of symptoms was 254 minutes. Successful recanalization (TICI 2b +3) by thrombectomy only was achieved in 18 patients (75%). Intracranial stent deployment after thrombectomy caused by underlying atherosclerotic stenosis was performed in 7 patients. If these patients with intracranial stent placement are included, successful recanalization was achieved in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%). NIHSS improvement ≥10 points was reached in 54% of patients (n = 13/24). Mortality during the first 3 months was 29% (7/24). After 3 months, 8 patients (33%) had a favorable clinical outcome (mRS 0-2). CONCLUSIONS In our series, application of self-expanding retrievable stents in acute basilar artery occlusion resulted in a high recanalization rate without procedural complications and good clinical outcome in one-third of patients.","Möhlenbruch, M; Stampfl, S; Behrens, L; Herweh, C; Rohde, S; Bendszus, M; Hametner, C; Nagel, S; Ringleb, P A; Pham, M",AJNR.

Methods This is an ecological study, whose units of analysis were the 26 state capitals and the Federal District of Brazil. Prevalence was estimated by the results of the Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para Doenças Crônicas por Inquérito Telefônico 2019 (VIGITEL). The general mortality rates due to COVID-19 were collected on the official website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (MH) and stratified by the same Brazilian capitals evaluated in the VIGITEL survey. The rates included the period between the 1st and 29th Epidemiological Weeks of 2020. The Partial Correlation Test (r) was used, controlled for confounding factors, to evaluate the correlation between the prevalence of overweight/obesity and the overall mortality rates due to COVID-19. Results The mean mortality rate for COVID-19 in the period was 65.1 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants. Regarding the prevalence of obesity and overweight, 20.2% and 54.7% were the mean values observed in the state capitals, respectively. The prevalence of obesity was positively correlated with the overall mortality rate due to COVID-19, with mean positive correlation (r=0.380) and statistically significant correlation (p=0.034). Conclusion This study pointed out that, at the aggregate level, there is a concomitant and correlated increase in mortality rates due to COVID-19 and prevalence of obesity in Brazilian capitals. The data found may contribute to actions to cope with the pandemic aimed at this population.","Carneiro, Raquel Alencastro Veiga Domingues; Hillesheim, Danúbia; Hallal, Ana Luiza Curi",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,186,1

The mean (± SD) interval between onset of symptoms and admission to the fever observation department was 4.40 ± 2.00 and 5.52 ± 4.00 days for patients with positive and negative RT-PCR test results, respectively. The frequency of opacifications in patients with positive results and patients with negative results, respectively, was as follows: ground-glass opacities (GGOs), 100.0% versus 90.9%; mixed GGO, 63.6% versus 72.7%; and consolidation, 54.5% versus 77.3%. In patients with positive RT-PCR results, GGOs were the most commonly observed opacification (seen in 100.0% of patients) and were predominantly located in the peripheral zone (100.0% of patients), compared with patients with negative results (31.8%) (p = 0.05). The median number of affected lung lobes and segments was higher in patients with positive RT-PCR results than in those with negative RT-PCR results (five vs 3.5 affected lobes and 15 vs nine affected segments; p < 0.05). Although the air bronchogram reticular pattern was more frequently seen in patients with positive results, centrilobular nodules were less frequently seen in patients with positive results. CONCLUSION. At the point during the COVID-19 outbreak when this study was performed, imaging patterns of multifocal, peripheral, pure GGO, mixed GGO, or consolidation with slight predominance in the lower lung and findings of more extensive GGO than consolidation on chest CT scans obtained during the first week of illness were considered findings highly suspicious of COVID-19.","Cheng, Zenghui; Lu, Yong; Cao, Qiqi; Qin, Le; Pan, Zilai; Yan, Fuhua; Yang, Wenjie",AJR.

METHODS Consecutive patients diagnosed with PFis and asymptomatic subjects were enrolled in the present study. Both groups underwent clinical, ultrasound (US), and SWE evaluation. A plantar fascia thickness > 4 mm was considered pathognomonic of PFis. SWE stiffness elasticity (Young's modulus in kPa and shear wave velocity in m/s) was measured 1 cm distally from the calcaneal insertion. Correlations with VAS and the 17-Italian Foot Function Index (17-FFI) were determined. RESULTS A total of 19 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria for the patient group and were enrolled in the study, and 21 healthy subjects were used as a control group. Statistically significant differences were found for shear wave velocity between the patient and the control group, with SWE findings of 3.8 (5.1; 1.5) m/s and 4.7 (4.07; 7.04) m/s, respectively (p = 0.006). Strong positive correlations were found between the SWE findings and both the pain and the functional scale (VAS: p = 0.001; FFI: p = 0.012). CONCLUSION SWE allows quantitative assessment of the stiffness of the plantar fascia and can show PFis alterations, increasing the diagnostic performance of B-mode US. In addition, SWE shows a strong correlation with clinical scores, improving patient assessment and follow-up.","Schillizzi, Giuseppe; Alviti, Federica; D'Ercole, Chiara; Elia, Daniela; Agostini, Francesco; Mangone, Massimiliano; Paoloni, Marco; Bernetti, Andrea; Pacini, Patrizia; Polti, Giorgia; Minafra, Paolo; Cantisani, Vito",Journal of ultrasound,186,9

Effective prognostic markers and prediction models are needed. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) provides a comprehensive assessment of the physiological changes in the respiratory, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems in a controlled laboratory environment. It has shown promise as a prognostic factor for other chronic respiratory conditions. We sought to evaluate the prognostic value of CPET in predicting outcomes in longitudinal studies of ILD. MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were used to identify studies reporting the prognostic value of CPET in predicting outcomes in longitudinal studies of ILD. Study quality was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Study risk of bias tool. Thirteen studies were included that reported the prognostic value of CPET in ILD. All studies reported at least one CPET parameter predicting clinical outcomes in ILD, with survival being the principal outcome assessed. Maximum oxygen consumption, reduced ventilatory efficiency and exercise-induced hypoxaemia were all reported to have prognostic value in ILD. Issues with study design (primarily due to inherent problems of retrospective studies, patient selection and presentation of numerous CPET parameters), insufficient adjustment for important confounders and inadequate statistical analyses limit the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn at this stage. There is insufficient evidence to confirm the value of CPET in facilitating ""real-world"" clinical decisions in ILD.

Furthermore, several cases have been reported as asymptomatic across the globe. Since there are no conclusive clinical manifestations, clinicians have to rely more on laboratory diagnostic methods for confirmation of coronavirus disease. Hematological and biochemical tests are found to be of more prognostic value. Genetic assays by means of rRT-PCR technique is time-consuming but seems to be a more sensitive and specific test among the available testing methods for diagnosis of the coronavirus disease. Radiological imaging of the CT chest of the confirmed positive patients taken during the initial few days doesn't show any significant changes. However, from the second week onward a ground glass lesion pattern is observed. The immunological tests which are being used as a rapid testing method are found to be more false test negative. Hence, based on the effectiveness of various testing methods, it can be concluded that either rRT-PCR or mass antibody testing has to be done, and it has to be compared with CT chest in order to avoid false negatives across the globe which may help in the prevention of community spread of the disease.","Abdul Bari, Ahamed Basha; Samuel, Prince Johnson",Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,186,1

These challenges have had mental health consequences, and concerning reports of burnout have emerged globally. We conducted a cross-sectional survey at a designated COVID-19 hospital in Shanghai at the peak of the pandemic, i.e. about 2 months after the onset of the outbreak from February to April 2020. Findings revealed burnout in 6.85% of nurses. Of 336 respondents, 87 (25.89%) had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 61 (18.15%) had a high level of depersonalization, and 100 (29.76%) had a low level of personal accomplishment. Burnout can be prevented by offering more support from families and supervisors, paying attention to health monitoring and personal protection, and creating a rational human resource allocation and shift management system. Specific training on infection control and self-protection, mental health guidance, and stress coping techniques must be implemented. As the current health crisis ultimately abates, moving the focus from mental health issues to public health issues, more attention and support at the national and organizational levels are needed to reduce occupational discrimination, nurse autonomy and status need to be promoted, and public health emergency teams need to be created.

This is a retrospective observational cohort study of 196 PMBT patients admitted to two ICUs over a 19-year period. Acute respiratory failure was the main reason for ICU admission (45%) followed by seizures (25%) and non-epileptic coma (14%). Seizures were more common in patients with glial lesions (84 vs. 67%), whereas patients with primary brain lymphoma were more frequently admitted for shock (42 vs. 18%). Overall ICU and 90-day mortality rates were 23 and 50%, respectively. Admission for seizures was independently associated with lower ICU mortality [odds ratio (OR) 0.06], whereas the need for mechanical ventilation (OR 6.85), cancer progression (OR 7.84), respiratory rate (OR 1.11) and Glasgow coma scale (OR 0.85) were associated with higher ICU mortality. Among the 95 patients who received invasive mechanical ventilation, ICU mortality was 37% (n = 35). For these patients, admission for seizures was associated with lower ICU mortality (OR 0.050) whereas cancer progression (OR 7.49) and respiratory rate (OR 1.08) were associated with higher ICU mortality. The prognosis of PMBT patients admitted to the ICU appears relatively favorable compared to that of hematologic malignancies or solid tumors, especially when the patient is admitted for seizures. The presence of a PMBT, therefore, does not appear to be sufficient for refusal of ICU admission. Predictive factors of mortality may help clinicians make optimal triage decisions.","Decavèle, Maxens; Weiss, Nicolas; Rivals, Isabelle; Prodanovic, Hélène; Idbaih, Ahmed; Mayaux, Julien; Similowski, Thomas; Demoule, Alexandre",Journal of neurology,186,28

Sometimes, a high proportion of the litter was found dead, and dystocia with death or preterminal euthanasia of the dam occurred. Microscopic findings in the uterus consisted of necrohemorrhagic and suppurative periplacentitis associated with the presence of bacterial colonies identified as Escherichia coli. In the vagina, similar findings were observed that were associated with mucus accumulation and the presence of a transverse occlusive or partially occlusive thin membrane identified as a vaginal septum. Microscopically, this septum consisted of a thin band of connective tissue covered on both sides by a mucous epithelium that was continuous with vaginal epithelium. In some cases, there was only mucus accumulation retained by a septum in the vagina without evidence of bacterial infection. Serological and histological examinations did not reveal any specific pathogenic agent. The presence of these septa in the vagina most likely favored mucus accumulation, nonspecific ascending bacterial infection, and dystocia. This colony of rats presented with an unusually high incidence of vaginal septa as it was described in different strains of mice and rats in the past. We hypothesized that the use of an impedance meter by the breeder--to determine the phase of the estrous cycle by introducing a probe in the vagina--likely facilitated gestation by perforating the vaginal septum in some cases.","Lezmi, S; Thibault-Duprey, K; Bidaut, A; Hardy, P; Pino, M; Macary, G Saint; Barbellion, S; Brunel, P; Dorchies, O; Clifford, C; Leconte, I",Veterinary pathology,186,4

We studied ischemic and bleeding events after SVG PCI and their association with HPR. METHODS AND RESULTS Subjects in the prospective, multicenter ADAPT-DES study (Assessment of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy With Drug-Eluting Stents) were stratified according to whether they had PCI of an SVG or a non-SVG lesion. Two-year outcomes were compared between groups using univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. HPR was defined as on-clopidogrel P2Y12 platelet reaction units >208 as measured by the VerifyNow assay; major adverse cardiac events were defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or stent thrombosis. Among 8582 subjects in ADAPT-DES, 405 (4.7%) had SVG PCI. SVG PCI was independently associated with a higher 2-year risk of major adverse cardiac events (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-3.23; P<0.0001), ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-2.42; P<0.0001), and stent thrombosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-3.59; P=0.0006), but not of bleeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.46; P=0.97). There was no statistical interaction between HPR and SVG PCI in regard to major adverse cardiac events (adjusted Pinteraction=0.99). CONCLUSIONS SVG PCI is associated with a considerably higher risk of 2-year adverse ischemic events, with HPR conferring similar risk in SVG and non-SVG PCI. More potent and longer antiplatelet therapy may be beneficial for patients undergoing SVG PCI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

This change in the reading frame occurs at a so-called slippery sequence that is followed by a specific secondary structure, the frameshift stimulatory signal. This signal controls the frameshift efficiency. The synthesis of HIV-1 enzymes is critical for virus replication and therefore, the –1 ribosomal frameshift could be the target of novel antiviral drugs. AREAS COVERED Various approaches were used to select drugs interfering with the –1 frameshift of HIV-1. These include the selection and modification of chemical compounds that specifically bind to the frameshift stimulatory signal, the use of antisense oligonucleotides targeting this signal and the selection of compounds that modulate HIV-1 frameshift, by using bicistronic reporters where the expression of the second cistron depends upon HIV-1 frameshift. EXPERT OPINION The most promising approach is the selection and modification of compounds specifically targeting the HIV-1 frameshift stimulatory signal. The use of antisense oligonucleotides binding to the frameshift stimulatory signal is still questionable. The use of bicistronic reporters preferentially selects compounds that modulate the frameshift by targeting the ribosomes, which is less promising.","Brakier-Gingras, Léa; Charbonneau, Johanie; Butcher, Samuel E",Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,186,1

Among them, one of the most invalidating is Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by motor- and non-motor dysfunctions which strongly impair the quality of life of affected individuals. PD is characterized by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, with consequent dopamine depletion, and the accumulation of misfolded α-synuclein aggregates. Although 150 years have passed since PD first description, no effective therapies are currently available, but only palliative treatments. Importantly, PD is often diagnosed when the neuronal loss is elevated, making difficult any therapeutic intervention. In this context, two key challenges remain unanswered: (i) the early diagnosis to avoid the insurgence of irreversible symptoms; and (ii) the reliable monitoring of therapy efficacy. Research strives to identify novel biomarkers for PD diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic follow-up. One of the most promising sources of biomarkers is represented by extracellular vesicles (EVs), a heterogeneous population of nanoparticles, released by all cells in the microenvironment. Brain-derived EVs are able to cross the blood-brain barrier, protecting their payload from enzymatic degradation, and are easily recovered from biofluids. Interestingly, EV content is strongly influenced by the specific pathophysiological status of the donor cell. In this manuscript, the role of EVs as source of novel PD biomarkers is discussed, providing all recent findings concerning relevant proteins and miRNAs carried by PD patient-derived EVs, from several biological specimens. Moreover, the contribution of mitochondria-derived EVs will be dissected. Finally, the promising possibility to use EVs as source of markers to monitor PD therapy efficacy will be also examined. In the future, larger cohort studies will help to validate these EV-associated candidates, that might be effectively used as non-invasive and robust source of biomarkers for PD.","Leggio, Loredana; Paternò, Greta; Vivarelli, Silvia; Falzone, Giovanna G; Giachino, Carmela; Marchetti, Bianca; Iraci, Nunzio",Aging and disease,186,16

By fusing single-chain variable fragments (scFv) with the same or different specificity to both N- and C-terminus of the trimerizing scaffold domain, we produced monospecific or bispecific hexavalent molecules that were efficiently secreted as soluble proteins by transfected mammalian cells.

Human genetic polymorphisms in Ide have been linked to increased risk for T2DM. In mice, hepatic Ide ablation causes glucose intolerance and insulin resistance when mice are fed a regular diet. OBJECTIVE These studies were undertaken to further investigate its regulatory role in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obesity. METHODS To this end, we have compared the metabolic effects of loss versus gain of IDE function in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). RESULTS We demonstrate that loss of IDE function in liver (L-IDE-KO mouse) exacerbates hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance without changes in insulin clearance but in parallel to an increase in pancreatic β-cell function. Insulin resistance was associated with increased FoxO1 activation and a ~2-fold increase of GLUT2 protein levels in the liver of HFD-fed mice in response to an intraperitoneal injection of insulin. Conversely, gain of IDE function (adenoviral delivery) improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, in parallel to a reciprocal ~2-fold reduction in hepatic GLUT2 protein levels. Furthermore, in response to insulin, IDE co-immunoprecipitates with the insulin receptor in liver lysates of mice with adenoviral-mediated liver overexpression of IDE. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that IDE regulates hepatic insulin action and whole-body glucose metabolism in diet-induced obesity via insulin receptor levels.","Merino, Beatriz; Fernández-Díaz, Cristina M; Parrado-Fernández, Cristina; González-Casimiro, Carlos M; Postigo-Casado, Tamara; Lobatón, Carmen D; Leissring, Malcolm A; Cózar-Castellano, Irene; Perdomo, Germán",Metabolism: clinical and experimental,186,12

METHODS This open-label, multicenter study enrolled 117 patients with post-herpetic neuralgia, HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy, or painful diabetic neuropathy. Patients received pretreatment with one of three lidocaine 4%-based topical anesthetics (L.M.X.4(®) [Ferndale Laboratories Inc, Ferndale, MI], Topicaine(®) Gel [Estela Basso, Jupiter, FL], or Betacaine Enhanced Gel 4 [Tiberius Inc, Tampa, FL]) for 60 minutes followed by a single 60- or 90-minute NGX-4010 application, and were followed for 12 weeks. Tolerability and safety measures included ""pain now"" Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) scores, dermal assessments, medication use for treatment-related pain, adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory parameters, physical examinations, and vital signs. The primary efficacy variable was the percentage change in mean NPRS scores for ""average pain for the past 24 hours"" from baseline to weeks 2 through 12. RESULTS Treatment with NGX-4010 following pretreatment with any of the three topical anesthetics was generally safe and well tolerated. Nearly all patients completed ≥90% of the planned NGX-4010 application duration. The most common treatment-related AEs, application-site burning and application-site pain, were transient, mostly mild or moderate, and could be adequately managed by local cooling or short-acting oral opioid analgesics. Although slightly more patients used medication for treatment-related discomfort following pretreatment with Topicaine compared with L.M.X.4 or Betacaine, there were no statistical differences between the topical anesthetics. Neuropathic pain reduction from baseline to weeks 2 through 12 was approximately 30% and was similar among the topical anesthetics; the proportion of responders ranged from 45% to 50%. CONCLUSION Treatment with NGX-4010 following pretreatment with any of the three topical anesthetics was generally safe and well tolerated; no significant differences in the parameters measured were noted between the pretreatment groups.","Webster, Lynn R; Peppin, John F; Murphy, Frederick T; Tobias, Jeffrey K; Vanhove, Geertrui F",Journal of pain research,186,16

The aim of the study was to determine normal values of 3D HRAM in children. METHODS Children without any symptoms arising from the lower gastrointestinal tract were prospectively enrolled in the study. Manometry procedures were performed using a rigid probe (Covidien/Medtronic, Ireland) without premedication. Pressure within the anal canal and 3D images of sphincters were measured. If possible, defecation dynamics and thresholds of sensation were evaluated. Data were expressed as the mean (±SD). RESULTS A total of 61 children (34 males; age: 2-17 years, mean: 8.28 years) were studied. The mean resting and squeeze sphincter pressures were 83.43 (±23.23) mmHg and 191 (±64.21) mmHg, respectively. The mean length of the anal canal was 2.62 (±0.68) cm and correlated with age (r = 0.49, p < 0.0001). The mean rectal balloon volume to elicit recto-anal inhibitory reflex was 15.66 (±10.9) cc. The first sensation, urge and discomfort were observed at 24.42 (±23.98) cc, 45.91 (±34.55) cc and 91.58 (±50.17) cc of the balloon volume, respectively. The mean resting pressure of the puborectalis muscle was 71.54 (±14.58) mmHg while the mean squeeze pressure was 134.10 (±35.2) mmHg. A positive correlation between age and balloon volume needed to elicit discomfort was determined (r = 0.49, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Normative data of 3D HRAM in children without symptoms arising from the lower gastrointestinal tract were established. There were no significant differences in pressure results between males and females.","Banasiuk, Marcin; Banaszkiewicz, Aleksandra; Albrecht, Piotr",Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,186,16

Although there has been a myriad of published articles in which researchers describe the severity and complexity of these disparities, they persist into present day relatively unchanged. We believe this lack of progress can be explained, in part, by a failure to acknowledge that racism is at the root of these racial disparities. Many children's health advocates believe more should be done to address our country's systemic racial inequities, but few of us feel able to create meaningful change, and even fewer feel that it is our responsibility. As a result, many opt to pursue programmatic fixes and Band-Aid solutions over addressing the underlying systemic, interpersonal, and historical racism. We hope to empower children's health advocates by introducing a solutions-centered framework for addressing racism as a root cause.

The situation of SARS-CoV-2 infection in France after the first epidemic wave in spring 2020 approximatively indicates more than 30,000 deaths, 3 to 4 millions people infected, 50% asymptomatic infections. These data encourage us to modify the initial perception of this infection, which was imagined to be benign, with massive, homogeneous and rapid distribution (""tsunamic""), and comprising a large majority of asymptomatic forms. This invites us to reassess the hypothesis of a major role of superspreaders in the spread of the infection, which would be more limited and discontinuous (""saltatory"") than expected, as for SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. The role of viral load in the transmission and clinical expression of infection also needs to be assessed. To fight against the spread of the epidemic, generalized confinement a posteriori appears to have a disproportionate cost compared to its effectiveness, whereas the application of barrier gestures (breathing mask, hand hygiene, social distancing) should be promoted without any restriction, along with the diagnosis and temporary isolation of infected persons. While the Covid-19 epidemic is a medical challenge for human societies, it is also a moral challenge that they may not ignore.","Agut, Henri",Virologie,186,5

The purpose of this systematic review is to describe the characteristics and efficacy of behavioural interventions that have targeted CVD risk factors in this high-risk group. METHODS Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we searched seven databases to find interventions focused on changing the following: blood pressure, cholesterol, diet, physical activity, smoking or weight. Eligible studies tested a behavioural intervention (not exclusively policy, environmental, or pharmaceutical), in individuals working in blue-collar occupations using a randomised study design. Study quality was evaluated using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's study quality assessment tool. RESULTS 22 studies evaluating 31 interventions were included: 11 were rated as 'good' or 'fair' quality. Intervention intensity ranged from a single contact via a mailed letter to studies that included individual-level contacts at multiple time points between staff and participants. Studies that included at least some individual contact generally yielded the greatest effects. Interventions had the greatest observed effects on self-report changes in diet, regardless of intervention intensity. Four of the five higher quality studies that explicitly tailored the intervention to the occupational group were successful at reducing at least one risk factor. CONCLUSIONS Interventions that used individual contact and tailored the intervention to the occupational setting yielded the greatest effects on CVD risk-factor reduction in individuals working in blue-collar occupations. Generally, studies were low quality but showed promising effects for reaching this high-risk population. Future work should incorporate these promising findings in higher quality studies.

This study aimed to examine public interest on alternative medicine during the COVID-19 pandemic using Google Trends in Indonesia. Methods: Employing a quantitative study, the Spearman rank test was used to analyze the correlation between Google Relative Search Volume (RSV) of various search terms, within the categories of alternative medicine, herbal medicine and practical activity, with COVID-19 cases. In addition, time lag correlation was also investigated. Results: Public interest toward alternative medicine during COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia is dramatically escalating. All search term categories (alternative medicine, medical herbal, and alternative medicine activities) were positively associated with COVID-19 cases (p<0.05). The terms ' ginger' (r=0.6376), ' curcumin' (r=0.6550) and ' planting ginger' (0.6713) had the strongest correlation. Furthermore, time lag correlation between COVID-19 and Google RSV was also positively significant (p<0.05). Conclusion: Public interest concerning alternative medicine related terms dramatically increased after the first COVID-19 confirmed case was reported in Indonesia.

METHODS A total of 180 healthy infants were enrolled from birth and monitored for occurrences of URI, LRI and acute otitis media complications until the first acute otitis media episode or between 6 and 12 months of age. Nasopharyngeal specimens collected during acute respiratory illnesses were tested for 18 viruses. RESULTS Between October 2008 and April 2011, 373 URI episodes, including 20 with LRI, in 139 infants were documented. Viral studies were performed on 189 URI episodes; 87% were positive. Throughout the 31-month period (1386 patient-months), rhinovirus was the predominant virus causing URI (55%); respiratory syncytial virus was the major cause of LRI (64%). Although there was a significant increase in parent-initiated visit rate during the 15-month influenza pandemic as compared with prepandemic and postpandemic periods, only 4 cases of influenza were detected (2 cases during and 2 cases prepandemic and postpandemic). CONCLUSIONS The 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic had no impact on the overall viral epidemiology of respiratory infections in healthy infants in the first year of life but resulted in increased parent-initiated visits due to respiratory symptoms. Maternal antibody and absence of comorbidity may explain the low influenza burden whereas parental anxiety may explain the increased healthcare visit rate during the pandemic.","Ede, Linda C; Loeffelholz, Michael J; Alvarez-Fernandez, Pedro; Pong, Dan L; Patel, Janak A; McCormick, David P; Chonmaitree, Tasnee",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,186,17

Here, we study how the temporal connectivity of communication networks changes through the day, focusing on sequences of communication events that follow one another within a limited time. Such sequences can be thought to be characteristic of information transfer in the network. We find that temporal connectivity also follows a circadian rhythm, where at night a larger fraction of contacts is associated with such sequences and where contacts appear more independent at daytime. This result points out that temporal networks show richer variation in time than what has been known thus far.","Alakörkkö, T; Saramäki, J",Chaos,186,1

As existing evidence is insufficient to validly assess the impact of different laryngoscopy techniques on the incidence of dental trauma, the force exerted onto dental structures during tracheal intubation was investigated. An intubation manikin was equipped with hidden force sensors in all maxillary incisors. Dental force was measured while 104 anaesthetists performed a series of tracheal intubations using direct laryngoscopy with a Macintosh blade, and videolaryngoscopy with a C-MAC® , or the hyperangulated GlideScope® or KingVision® laryngoscopes in both normal and difficult airway conditions. A total of 624 tracheal intubations were analysed. The median (IQR [range]) peak force of direct laryngoscopy in normal airways was 21.1 (14.0-32.8 [2.3-127.6]) N and 29.3 (17.7-44.8 [3.3-97.2]) N in difficult airways. In normal airways, these were lower with the GlideScope and KingVision hyperangulated laryngoscopes, with a reduction of 4.6 N (p = 0.006) and 10.9 N (p < 0.001) compared with direct laryngoscopy, respectively. In difficult airways, these were lower with the GlideScope and KingVision hyperangulated laryngoscopes, with a reduction of 9.8 N (p < 0.001) and 17.6 N (p < 0.001) compared with direct laryngoscopy, respectively. The use of the C-MAC did not have an impact on the median peak force. Although sex of anaesthetists did not affect peak force, more experienced anaesthetists generated a higher peak force than less experienced providers. We conclude that hyperangulated videolaryngoscopy was associated with a significantly decreased force exerted on maxillary incisors and might reduce the risk for dental injury in clinical settings.","Schieren, M; Kleinschmidt, J; Schmutz, A; Loop, T; Staat, M; Gatzweiler, K-H; Wappler, F; Defosse, J",Anaesthesia,186,7

BACKGROUND In the lymph node transfer method, lymphatic anastomoses are expected to form spontaneously. However, lymphangiogenic growth factor therapies have shown promising results in preclinical models of lymphedema. METHODS The inguinal lymphatic vasculature of pigs was surgically destroyed around the inguinal lymph node. To enhance the regrowth of the lymphatic network in the defected area, adenoviral vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) was administered intranodally or perinodally. Control animals received injections of saline or control vector. The lymphangiogenic effect of the growth factor therapy and any potential adverse effects associated with the 2 alternative delivery routes were examined 2 months postoperatively. RESULTS Both routes of growth factor administration induced robust growth of lymphatic vessels and helped to preserve the structure of the transferred lymph nodes in comparison with the controls. The lymph nodes of the control treated animals regressed in size and their nodal structure was partly replaced by fibro-fatty scar tissue. Intranodally injected adenoviral VEGF-C and adenoviral vector encoding control gene LacZ induced macrophage accumulation inside the node, whereas perinodal administration of VEGF-C did not have this adverse effect. CONCLUSIONS Lymphangiogenic growth factors improve lymphatic vessel regeneration and lymph node function after lymph node transfer. The perinodal route of delivery provides a basis for future clinical trials in lymphedema patients.","Honkonen, Krista M; Visuri, Mikko T; Tervala, Tomi V; Halonen, Paavo J; Koivisto, Mari; Lähteenvuo, Markku T; Alitalo, Kari K; Ylä-Herttuala, Seppo; Saaristo, Anne M",Annals of surgery,186,19

However, PH values often do not align with health systems values, making it challenging for PH practitioners to promote health equity. In spite of a growing range of PH ethics frameworks and theories, little is known about ethical concerns related to promotion of health equity in PH practice. The purpose of this paper is to examine the ethical concerns of PH practitioners in promoting health equity in the context of mental health promotion and prevention of harms of substance use. METHODS As part of a broader program of public health systems and services research, we interviewed 32 PH practitioners. RESULTS Using constant comparative analysis, we identified four systemic ethical tensions: [1] biomedical versus social determinants of health agenda; [2] systems driven agendas versus situational care; [3] stigma and discrimination versus respect for persons; and [4] trust and autonomy versus surveillance and social control.

Materials and Methods: Mental health clinicians were surveyed with 27 Likert questions, using previously validated measures, on satisfaction and implementation experience with video telehealth visits between March and June 2020. Results: A total of 112 of 193 clinicians completed the survey (58.0%), including psychiatrists, psychologists, trainees (i.e., residents and fellows), advanced practice providers, and licensed mental health counselors. Clinicians reported high levels of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of video telehealth; they also reported high levels of satisfaction with video telehealth visits. Seventy-nine and a half (79.5%) reported that their patients seemed highly satisfied with video telehealth visits, and 107 (95.5%) of clinicians responded that they would like video telehealth visits to represent at least 25% of their practice in the future. Discussion: Mental health clinicians showed positive attitudes toward the implementation of video telehealth visits, high levels of satisfaction with this care, and indicated strong interest in continuing this modality as a significant portion of clinical practice. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the ability of mental health clinicians to embrace new technology to expand access to care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicate that telemental health is likely to be an integral part of clinic practice in the future.","Gentry, Melanie T; Puspitasari, Ajeng J; McKean, Alastair J; Williams, Mark D; Breitinger, Scott; Geske, Jennifer R; Clark, Matthew M; Moore, Katherine M; Frye, Mark A; Hilty, Donald M",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,186,1

Prophylactic mesh-augmented reinforcement during laparotomy closure has been proposed in patients at high risk of incisional hernia. METHODS A multicenter randomized trial was conducted on patients undergoing elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair through a midline laparotomy (Clinical.Trials.gov: NCT00757133). In the study group, retromuscular mesh-augmented reinforcement was performed with a large-pore polypropylene mesh (Ultrapro, width 7.5 cm). The primary endpoint was the incidence of incisional hernias at 2-year follow-up. RESULTS Between February 2009 and January 2013, 120 patients were recruited at 8 Belgian centers. Patients' characteristics at baseline were similar between groups. Operative and postoperative characteristics showed no difference in morbidity or mortality. The cumulative incidence of incisional hernias at 2-year follow-up after conventional closure was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17%-41%) versus 0% (95% CI, 0%-6%) after mesh-augmented reinforcement (P < 0.0001; Fisher exact test). The estimated ""freedom of incisional hernia"" curves (Kaplan-Meier estimate) were significantly different across study arms (χ = 19.5, P < 0.0001; Mantel-Cox test). No adverse effect related to mesh-augmented reinforcement was observed, apart from an increased mean time to close the abdominal wall for mesh-augmented reinforcement compared with the control group: 46 minutes (SD, 18.6) versus 30 minutes (SD, 18.5), respectively (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test). CONCLUSIONS Prophylactic retromuscular mesh-augmented reinforcement of a midline laparotomy in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm is safe and effectively prevents the development of incisional hernia during 2 years, with an additional mean operative time of 16 minutes.","Muysoms, Filip E; Detry, Olivier; Vierendeels, Tijl; Huyghe, Marc; Miserez, Marc; Ruppert, Martin; Tollens, Tim; Defraigne, Jean-Olivier; Berrevoet, Frederik",Annals of surgery,186,1

This study aims to update our previous systematic review (2014) and conduct a meta-analysis on the efficacy of Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for improving physical symptoms in PwMS. METHODS In November 2017 we carried out systematic searches for eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in seven major databases, updating our search in July 2018. We used medical subject headings and key words. Two independent reviewers used pre-defined criteria to screen, data extract, quality appraise, and analyse studies. The Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool was used to determine study quality. Physical wellbeing was the main outcome of interest. We used the random effects model for meta-analysis, reporting effect sizes as Standardised Mean Difference (SMD). This study is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42018093171. RESULTS We identified 10 RCTs as eligible for inclusion in the systematic review (including 678 PwMS), whilst seven RCTs (555 PwMS) had data that could be used in our meta-analyses. In general, comorbidity, disability, ethnicity and socio-economic status were poorly reported. MBIs included manualised and tailored interventions, treatment duration 6-9 weeks, delivered face-to-face and online in groups and also individually. For fatigue, against any comparator SMD was 0.24 (0.08 - 0.41), I2=0%; against active comparators only, SMD was 0.10 (-0.14 - 0.34), I2=0%. For pain SMD was 0.16 (-0.46 - 0.79), I2=77%. Three adverse events occurred across all studies. CONCLUSIONS MBIs appear to be an effective treatment for fatigue in PwMS. The optimal MBI in this context remains unclear.

This study aimed to evaluate thrombus composition and its association with clinical, laboratory, and neurointerventional findings in patients treated by mechanical thrombectomy due to acute large vessel occlusion. METHODS At our institution, 79 patients were treated by mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever and/or aspiration catheter between August 2015 and August 2016. The retrieved thrombi were quantitatively analyzed to quantify red blood cells, white blood cells, and fibrin by area. We divided the patients into two groups - a fibrin-rich group and an erythrocyte-rich group - based on the predominant composition in the thrombus. The groups were compared for imaging, clinical, and neurointerventional data. RESULTS The retrieved thrombi from 43 patients with acute stroke from internal carotid artery, middle cerebral artery, or basilar artery occlusion were histologically analyzed. Erythrocyte-rich thrombi were present in 18 cases, while fibrin-rich thrombi were present in 25 cases. A cardioembolic etiology was significantly more prevalent among the patients with fibrin-rich thrombi than among those with erythrocyte-rich thrombi. Attenuation of thrombus density as shown on computed tomography images was greater in patients with erythrocyte-rich thrombi than in those with fibrin-rich thrombi. All other clinical and laboratory characteristics remained the same. Patients with erythrocyte-rich thrombi had a smaller number of recanalization maneuvers, shorter procedure times, a shorter time interval between arrival and recanalization, and a higher percentage of stent retrievers in the final recanalization procedure. The occluded vessels did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS In this study, erythrocyte-rich thrombus was associated with noncardioembolic etiology, higher thrombus density, and reduced procedure time.","Maekawa, Kota; Shibata, Masunari; Nakajima, Hideki; Mizutani, Akane; Kitano, Yotaro; Seguchi, Masaru; Yamasaki, Masayoshi; Kobayashi, Kazuto; Sano, Takanori; Mori, Genshin; Yabana, Tadashi; Naito, Yutaka; Shimizu, Shigetoshi; Miya, Fumitaka",Cerebrovascular diseases extra,186,32

Cervical anastomosis by a circular stapler (CS) has been widely accepted as a simple and convenient method, but anastomotic strictures are likely to occur. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between CS size and the incidence of anastomotic stricture after cervical esophagogastric anastomosis performed by a CS. METHODS Between April 2011 and March 2016, 236 consecutive patients underwent cervical esophagogastric anastomosis by a CS via a retrosternal route after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. These patients were divided into according to CS size for the procedure as follows: small-sized (25 mm) CS group (SG, n = 116) and large-sized (28 or 29 mm) CS group (LG, n = 120). The clinical data of patients were analyzed retrospectively to compare the two groups. RESULTS Overall, anastomotic strictures were observed in 90 patients (38%). The incidence of anastomotic stricture was significantly lower in the LG than the SG (23% vs. 53%, p < 0.001) (Table 3). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD: FEV1.0% <70%) (OR 2.35, 95% CI = 1.09-5.14; p = 0.029), anastomotic leakage (OR 8.97, 95% CI = 2.69-41.30; p < 0.001), and a small-sized CS (OR 3.42, 95% CI = 1.82-6.62; p < 0.001) were independent risk factors for anastomotic stricture in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS If possible, a large-sized CS should be used to prevent cervical anastomotic strictures when performing cervical anastomoses by CS.","Hosoi, Takahiro; Abe, Tetsuya; Uemura, Norihisa; Higaki, Eiji; Kawai, Ryosuke; Kawakami, Jiro; An, Byonggu; Nagino, Masato; Shimizu, Yasuhiro",World journal of surgery,186,22

However, comprehensive studies on analgesics use in this age group from Germany are scarce. This study aims to give a comprehensive overview on the use of the most common therapeutic groups of analgesics in community-dwelling older adults from Germany. METHODS A cross-sectional study was carried out using data from a German cohort of 2038 community-dwelling adults aged 63-89 years. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression models were applied to assess the utilization of analgesics by age, sex, pain severity, pain duration, and locations. RESULTS One out of four study participants was suffering from high-intensity or disabling pain. Approximately half of those taking analgesics still reported to suffer from high-intensity or disabling pain. Among analgesics users, occasional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use was the most frequent pain therapy (in 43.6% of users), followed by metamizole (dipyrone) use (16.1%), regular NSAIDs use (12.9%), strong opioids use (12.7%), and weak opioids use (12.0%). In multivariate logistic regression models, higher age, higher pain severity, longer pain duration, abdominal pain, and back pain were statistically significantly associated with opioids use. Metamizole use was also statistically significantly associated with higher pain severity but inversely associated with pain duration. CONCLUSIONS A significant number of older German adults are affected by high-intensity and disabling chronic pain despite receiving analgesics. Long-term studies are needed to compare the effectiveness and safety of different treatments for chronic pain in older adults.","Nguyen, Thi Ngoc Mai; Laetsch, Dana Clarissa; Chen, Li-Ju; Haefeli, Walter Emil; Meid, Andreas D; Brenner, Hermann; Schöttker, Ben",European journal of clinical pharmacology,186,27

In the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, due the lack of knowledge of this disease, only the strict necessary services were working, directly affecting the medical workforce, cleaning services and others related, as well the social relationship between the people. The infected 'places', e.g., Hospital and places where people tested positive for COVID-19, were physically isolated, with limited communication and restrict access. Considering the intrinsic challenges by this situational hazard scenario, three Drone model were developed, the Medical Drone System (MDS). The first system is called by Cargo Drone, it was developed to carrier medical equipment and/or medicines between two points, the second development was the Aerial Eye Drone, to remotely check the people temperature on the ground using thermal cameras. The third system, is called by Sterilizer Drone. It is employed for spraying/disinfect the environment, e.g., urban region (train, metro, bus stations or indoor big places). During the pandemic scenario, we had a lack of resources to develop our equipment, employees, logistics and money. For this reason, the manufacture process was changed to use COTS equipment, 3D printers and other machines that allowed us to increase the automatization of the manufacture process.

The pandemic has further accelerated the growth of omni-channel shopping. This study aimed to explore the effects of channel integration in six aspects (i.e., promotion, product and price, transaction information, information access, order fulfillment, and customer service) on the U.S. consumers’ intentions to use three omni-channel shopping methods: buy online pick-up in-store (BOPI), buy online curbside pickup (BOCP), and buy in-store home delivery (BIHD). We proposed a mediation model to test the effects through consumer perceived values (hedonic value, utilitarian value), perceived risk, and perceived behavioral control. Furthermore, this study explored the moderating effect of perceived COVID-19 vulnerability on the relationships between consumers’ internal evaluations of channel integration and their shopping method selection intentions. A total of 516 eligible responses were gathered through a survey of U.S. consumers. Multiple regressions were applied to test the hypotheses. Six types of channel integration showed significant effects on the U.S. consumers’ internal evaluations, which in turn influence their intentions to use certain types of omni-channel shopping methods.

In this context, educators faced the challenge to modify their teaching (planning, design and implementation) in order to answer the need for Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT), which arose during the past months. However, were they ready - or appropriately trained - to teach online at such short notice? What is more, did they manage to integrate the principles of online learning into their teaching practices according to the results of research from the field of educational neuroscience? In order to answer these questions, a qualitative small-scale research was conducted, using interviews with eight educators from private secondary schools in Greece. The research findings lead to the conclusion that the educators lack the theoretical knowledge of relevant learning theories for distance learning and, at the same time, seem to ignore the results of research in educational neuroscience, which clearly suggest the need to integrate multiple representational models into the learning process to activate different areas of the trainee's brain to facilitate the learning of the latter. Moreover, important factors for effective learning, such as collaboration, interaction and time, are neglected during their teaching planning and design. Hence, it is proposed that educators should be trained according to the Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework in the principles of distance learning and educational neuroscience, in order to be more effective in the planning, design, and implementation of teaching. © 2021 IEEE.","Doukakis, S.; Sfyris, P.; Niari, M.; Alexopoulos, E.","2021 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference, EDUCON 2021",186,28

Accurate and timely diagnosis, as well as prognosis-prediction, is difficult. It is hard to predict which patients with a bacterial infection will develop sepsis. Aside from antibiotics-based treatment of the causative infection and circulation-supportive measures, treatment options remain very limited. Better understanding of the immuno-pathophysiology of sepsis may lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic solutions. Functional activity of the innate (inflammatory) and adaptive immune response is controlled by a dedicated set of cellular signal transduction pathways in the various immune cell types. To develop an immune response-based assay for sepsis for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes, signaling pathway activities were analyzed in whole blood samples from patients with sepsis. Methods A prevalidated and previously published set of signal transduction pathway (STP) assays was used to analyze public Affymetrix expression microarray data from multiple clinical studies with pediatric and adult patients with sepsis. STP activity measurement is based on computational interpretation of a preselected set of target gene mRNA expression levels. STP assays were used to calculate androgen receptor, estrogen receptor, JAK-STAT1/2, JAK-STAT3, Notch, Hedgehog, TGF{beta}, FOXO-PI3K, MAPK-AP1, and NF{kappa}B signal transduction pathway activity scores for individual patient samples. Results Activity of both AR and TGF{beta} pathways was increased in both children and adults with sepsis. Using the upper threshold of normal pathway activity range as threshold diagnostic assay parameters were determined. For pediatric sepsis diagnosis, the AR pathway assay showed high sensitivity (77%) and specificity (97%), with a PPV of 99% and NPV of 50%. For prediction of favorable prognosis (survival), PPV was 95%, NPV was 21%. The TGF{beta} pathway activity assay performed slightly less for diagnosing sepsis, with a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 98% (PPV 99%, NPV 39%) Conclusion We have demonstrated potential clinical use of measuring AR and TGF{beta} pathway activity in sepsis patients. Both androgen receptor and TGF{beta} pathways have been described as immunosuppressive pathways, and increased activity in patients with sepsis suggests a causal relation with the immunopathology in sepsis. The AR pathway assay has been converted to a qPCR test for further testing of clinical utility for sepsis diagnosis and prediction of prognosis, as well as for prediction of risk at developing sepsis in patients with a bacterial infection. In view of their putative role in sepsis pathophysiology, both the AR and TGF{beta} pathways may present novel drug targets in sepsis.","Bouwman, W.; Verhaegh, W.; van de Stolpe, A.",,186,1

Following the near-absence of historical examples of the long-time evolution of infectious diseases under similar circumstances, models are crucial to exemplify possible scenarios. Accordingly, in the present work we systematically generalize the popular susceptible-infected-recovered model to account for mutations leading to repeatedly occurring new strains, which we coarse grain based on tools from statistical mechanics to derive a model predicting the most likely outcomes. The model predicts that mutations can induce a super-exponential growth of infection numbers at early times, which can self-amplify to giant infection waves which are caused by a positive feedback loop between infection numbers and mutations and lead to a simultaneous infection of the majority of the population. At later stages - if vaccination progresses too slowly - mutations can interrupt an ongoing decrease of infection numbers and can cause infection revivals which can occur as single waves or even as whole wave trains featuring alternative periods of decreasing and increasing infection numbers. Our results might be useful for discussions regarding the importance of a release of vaccine-patents to reduce the risk of mutation-induced infection revivals but also to coordinate the release of measures following a downwards trend of infection numbers.","Schwarzendahl, F.

BPDCN occurs at least three times more frequently in men than women, but the reasons for this sex bias are unknown. Here, studying genomics of primary BPDCN and modeling disease-associated mutations, we link acquired alterations in RNA splicing to abnormal pDC development and inflammatory response through Toll-like receptors. Loss-of-function mutations in ZRSR2, an X chromosome gene encoding a splicing factor, are enriched in BPDCN and nearly all mutations occur in males. ZRSR2 mutation impairs pDC activation and apoptosis after inflammatory stimuli, associated with intron retention and inability to upregulate the transcription factor IRF7. In vivo, BPDCN-associated mutations promote pDC expansion and signatures of decreased activation. These data support a model in which male-biased mutations in hematopoietic progenitors alter pDC function and confer protection from apoptosis, which may impair immunity and predispose to leukemic transformation. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Sex bias in cancer is well recognized but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely defined. We connect X chromosome mutations in ZRSR2 to an extremely male-predominant leukemia. Aberrant RNA splicing induced by ZRSR2 mutation impairs dendritic cell inflammatory signaling, interferon production, and apoptosis, revealing a sex- and lineage-related tumor suppressor pathway.","Togami, Katsuhiro; Chung, Sun Sook; Madan, Vikas; Kenyon, Christopher M.; Cabal-Hierro, Lucia; Taylor, Justin; Kim, Sunhee S.; Griffin, Gabriel K.; Ghandi, Mahmoud; Li, Jia; Li, Yvonne Y.; Angelot-Delettre, Fanny; Biichle, Sabeha; Seiler, Michael; Buonamici, Silvia; Lovitch, Scott B.; Louissaint, Abner; Morgan, Elizabeth A.; Jardin, Fabrice; Piccaluga, Pier Paolo; Weinstock, David M.; Hammerman, Peter S.; Yang, Henry; Konopleva, Marina; Pemmaraju, Naveen; Garnache-Ottou, Francine; Abdel-Wahab, Omar; Koeffler, H.

Results Of the 218 new diagnoses, 217 had a resistance test attempted (1 stored due to COVID-19). 212/217 had an available genotype (5 failed to amplify).. 191/212(90%) were MSM, 12/212(6%) cis-female, 80/212(38%) non-UK born and the median age was 36 years (IQR=29-46). The overall prevalence of TDR was 17/212(8%;95%CI=5.0-12.4), seven (3%) had a NRTI mutation, six (3%) had at least one nNRTI mutation and 4(2%) had a PI mutation. There were no dual/triple class/INI mutations. There was no significant change in the prevalence of TDR over the study period. The overall prevalence of non-B subtype was 53/212(25%;95% CI=19.6-31.2), and was not more frequently seen in non- UK born individuals (OR=1.24;CI=0.66-2.33,p=0.51). Patients with TDR were older [45.v.36 years, p=0.006] and have non-B subtype (OR=2.96;CI=1.08-8.13,p=0.03). Although overall rates of bacterial STIs was high (34%), having a bacterial STI was not associated with TDR (OR=1.77;95%CI=0.66-4.82,p=0.26). Conclusion TDR is associated with age and non-B subtype in our population. HIV TDR is not decreasing locally and remains a small but significant concern despite effective HIV prevention strategies, which may not reach hidden populations affected by HIV. Continued efforts to reduce HIV transmission must target hidden populations and we must maintain adequate surveillance of TDR.","Richardson, D.; Fitzpatrick, C.; Parkes, L.; Roberts, J.; Mulka, L.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,186,33

Here, we report on another risk: the accelerated infectious disease risk associated with the number and geographic spread of human infectious disease outbreaks. Using the most complete, reliable, and up-to-date database on human infectious disease outbreaks (GIDEON), we show that the number of disease outbreaks, the number of diseases involved in these outbreaks, and the number of countries affected have increased during the entire Anthropocene. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of these outbreaks is becoming more globalized in the sense that the overall modularity of the disease networks across the globe has decreased, meaning disease outbreaks have become increasingly pandemic in their nature. This decrease in modularity is correlated with the increase in air traffic. We finally show that those countries and regions which are most central within these disease networks tend to be countries with higher GDPs. Therefore, one cost of increased global mobility and greater economic growth is the increased risk of disease outbreaks and their faster and wider spread. We briefly discuss three different scenarios which decision-makers might follow in light of our results.","Morand, Serge; Walther, Bruno A.",bioRxiv,186,22

Given that the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita is one indicator of economic growth, the goal of this study is to investigate the differences in perceived stress and trust in institutions between European countries categorized into below-average, average and above-average GDP per capita levels during the coronavirus pandemic. The analyses of N = 84,080 participants from 29 countries gathered via an online survey showed that citizens of higher-level GDP per capita countries experienced less stress and had more trust in institutions. Compared to the average level, Croatian citizens experienced somewhat higher stress and had somewhat higher trust in the government's measures. These results imply that economic growth is one of the country-level factors associated with the quality of managing the coronavirus pandemic.","Uzelac, E.; Cepulic, D.

The qualitative research focuses on the experiences of Lithuanian schools in organizing distance education during COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 – October 2020, searching for ways to ensure the quality of teaching and learning. The 8 school activity areas need changes during transition to distance teaching and learning: strategy, management and administration;infrastructure of information technologies;digital learning content;digital competencies and continuous professional development;teaching, learning and assessment in the digital environment;a support system for pupils and teachers;partnership, cooperation and networking;and quality assurance. Changes in all the indicated areas lead to the quality of distance teaching and learning. The qualitative research data (expert interviews and focus groups) revealed the importance of school community agreements regarding the choice of technologies and environments, and the need for a national digital curriculum to be created.

Pandemic seems to make repeated appearance in some places which is often attributed to human neglect and seasonal change. However, difference could arise from different distributions of inherent susceptibility ({sigma}_{inh}) and external infectivity ({iota}_{ext}) from one population to another. These are often ignored in the theoretical treatments of an infectious disease progression. While the former is determined by the immunity of an individual towards a disease, the latter depends on the duration of exposure to the infection. Here we model the spatio-temporal propagation of a pandemic using a generalized SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model by introducing the susceptibility and infectivity distributions to comprehend their combined effects. These aspects have remained inadequately addressed till date. We consider the coupling between {sigma}_{inh} and {iota}_{ext} through a new critical infection parameter ({gamma}_{c}). We find that the neglect of these distributions, as in the naive SIR model, results in an overestimation in the estimate of the herd immunity threshold. That is, the presence of the distributions could dramatically reduce the rate of spread. Additionally, we include the effects of long-range migration by seeding new infections in a region. We solve the resulting master equations by performing Kinetic Monte Carlo Cellular Automata (KMC-CA) simulations. Importantly, our simulations can reproduce the multiple infection peak scenario of a pandemic. The latent interactions between disease migration and the distributions of susceptibility and infectivity can render the progression a character vastly different from the naive SIR model. In particular, inclusion of these additional features renders the problem a character of a living percolating system where the disease cluster can survive by spatial migration.","Mukherjee, S.; Mondal, S.; Bagchi, B.",,186,24

Objective: We aim to compare the severity and mortality between male and female patients with both COVID-19 and SARS, to explore the most useful prognostic factors for individualized assessment. Design, Setting, and Participants: We extracted the data from a case series of 43 hospitalized patients we treated, a public data set of the first 37 cases died of COVID-19 in Wuhan city and 1019 survived patients from six cities in China. We also analyzed the data of 524 patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing city in early 2003. Main Outcomes and Measures: Severity and mortality. Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. The percentages of older age (≥65 years) were much higher in the deceased group than in the survived group in patients with both COVID-19 (83.8 vs. 13.2, P<0.001) and SARS (37.4 vs. 4.9, P<0.001). In the case series, men tend to be more serious than women (P=0.035), although age was comparable between men and women. In the public data set, age was also comparable between men and women in the deceased group or the survived group in patients with COVID-19. Meanwhile, gender distribution was exactly symmetrical in the 1019 survivors of COVID-19. However, the percentage of male were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (70.3 vs. 50.0, P=0.015). The gender role in mortality was also observed in SARS patients. Survival analysis showed that men (hazard ratio [95% CI] 1.47 [1.05-2.06, P= 0.025) had a significantly higher mortality rate than women in patients with SARS. Conclusions and Relevance: Older age and male gender are risk factors for worse outcome in patients with COVID. While men and women have the same susceptibility to both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, men may be more prone to have higher severity and mortality independent of age and susceptibility.","Jin, Jian-Min; Bai, Peng; He, Wei; Wu, Fei; Liu, Xiao-Fang; Han, De-Min; Liu, Shi; Yang, Jin-Kui",,186,28

Thermal-mechanical AFM-based nanomachining process lower the normal forces to few hundreds of nanonewtons, but it requires special thermal probes. Vibration-assisted nanomachining process increases the tip lifetime but forces are still in the range of few hundreds of nanonewtons. We have innovated a system with both vibration and heated sample to achieve nanomachining process with lower normal forces. To provide cantilever selection guidance for this novel nanomachining system and to understand the effect of cantilever stiffness and sample temperature on feature dimensions, we used both soft and stiff probes for the nanomachining processes in this paper. We fabricated nanostructures with controllable shape dimensions were fabricated on 200 nm depth polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films by using both soft and stiff AFM probes with a few tens of nanonewtons normal forces in this novel AFM-based nanomachining system. Besides, we analyzed the effects of different machining parameters on the lithography performance, which helps to understand the machining parameters for fabricating nanopatterns of different dimensions. We also found that other than the setpoint force, the probe category and sample heating temperature significantly affect the dimensions of fabricated nanopatterns. And there is a statistically significant interaction effect between the spring constants of probes and the sample temperatures.","Zhou, Huimin; Deng, Jia",Procedia Manufacturing,186,28

Two pigs from each group were necropsied at 3, 5, 10, and 15 days postinoculation (DPI). There was moderate multifocal to coalescing reddish tan consolidation of 60% of the lung by 10 DPI. Microscopic examination revealed a necrotizing and proliferative bronchointerstitial pneumonia characterized by necrosis, squamous metaplasia, dysplasia, proliferation of airway epithelium, mononuclear cell infiltration of alveolar septa, mild type II pneumocyte proliferation, and lymphohistiocytic alveolar exudation. The microscopic lesions were mild by 3 DPI, moderate by 5 DPI, severe by 10 DPI, and mostly resolved by 15 DPI. No lesions were observed in the intestines of these pigs. There was no clinical respiratory disease. Control pigs remained normal and had no lesions. PRCV was isolated from the lungs but not from the intestines of inoculated pigs. PRCV was not isolated from the lungs or intestines of control pigs. PRCV was also isolated from the nasal and rectal swabs of inoculated but not of control pigs.","Halbur, P G; Paul, P S; Vaughn, E M; Andrews, J J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",186,28
188306,188306,188306,Role of the coronavirus E viroporin protein transmembrane domain in virus assembly.,9.692972,7.4703836,2007,"The start of the post-genomic era provides a useful juncture for reflection on the state of antibody engineering, which will be a critical technology for relating function and pathology to genomic sequence in biology and medicine. The phenomenal progress in deciphering the human genome has given significant impetus to the application of engineered antibodies in proteomics. Thus, advances in phage display antibody libraries can now help to define novel gene function and the measurement of abnormal protein expression in pathological states. Furthermore, intrabody and antibody engineering provide vehicles for the development of molecular medicines of the future. In addition to these new directions, antibody engineering has begun to show concrete success in its long-term efforts to develop targeted immunotherapies for cancer and other diseases. The cornerstones of clinical development are the detailed academic clinical trials that continue to push the boundaries of engineered antibodies into the real world. The field displays a healthy impatience for practical results, as research accelerates with concerted efforts to transfer preclinical insights into clinical trials. Growing private and governmental expenditures will lead to the rapid expansion of life-saving immunotherapeutic agents. The present review developed from our effort to report on the 11th Annual International Conference on Antibody Engineering (3-6 December 2000). This annual meeting is a forum for discussions on the latest advances in antibody engineering groups from around the world, and now includes the broader agenda of engineering in molecular immunology. In bringing scientists together to exchange ideas at this open forum, new collaborations and the threads of new discoveries are woven. For example, Professors Gerhard Wagner (Harvard Medical School), Dennis Burton (Scripps Research Institute), and Peter Hudson (CSIRO, Melbourne, Australia) gave exciting insights on structural immunobiology that had implications across many disciplines. The growth in antibody engineering was highlighted by the attendance of some 600 participants at the meeting, doubling that of the 1999 meeting. Dramatic clinical acceptance of monoclonal antibodies during the past two years has fostered this growth, with sales in 2000 of 1.8 billion dollars and projections for 2001 of 3 billion dollars. However, economic measures cannot begin to convey the medical revolution that is being effected by these first humanized and chimerized monoclonal antibodies. At this juncture, the 10 monoclonal antibody therapeutics in clinical use are of murine origin, of which 3 are entirely murine (OKT3, Mylotarg, 90Y-labeled Bexxar), 4 have been chimerized (human constant domains replacing murine) (ReoPro, Rituxan and its 131I-labeled analogue (Zevalin), Simulect, Remicade) and 3 were chimerized and humanized (human residues being substituted for at least some mouse-specific framework residues in VH and VL) (Zenapax, Herceptin, Synagis). Fully humanized anti-CD52 (CAMPATH-1H) has also been approved by the FDA for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and should become available in late 2001. Humanization was initially developed by Dr. Greg Winter at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK), who presented the meeting's keynote address, ""Antibodies as a Paradigm for Molecular Evolution"". His pioneering work in antibody phage display libraries has been reformulated into a daring approach to develop truly novel proteins with genetically paired structural elements. He described studies in combinatorial protein engineering with enormous implications for both industrial and therapeutic applications of macromolecules.","Huston, J S; George, A J",Human antibodies,186,1

CD8(+) T cells inhibit acute viral replication via cell type-specific effector mechanisms. Perforin-mediated cytolysis controls virus in microglia/macrophages and astrocytes, whereas interferon (IFN)-gamma regulates viral replication in oligodendroglia. JHMV infection of antibody-deficient mice confirmed a primary role of cellular immunity and a redundant role for humoral immunity during acute infection. However, infectious virus reactivates in antibody-deficient mice following viral clearance. This observation suggests that virus-specific T cells in the central nervous system are unable to control viral persistence. Reactivation in antibody-deficient mice is not associated with increased T-cell infiltration, but is prevented via transfer of neutralizing antibody. A vital role for humoral immunity during persistence is supported by the accumulation and retention of virus-specific antibody secreting cells following clearance of infectious virus. Thus, cell-mediated immune responses control acute infection, whereas humoral immunity maintains viral persistence. Therefore, although the central nervous system provides an environment for prolonged retention of both T cells and plasma cells, plasma cells are critical in maintaining persistent virus at undetectable levels. The low turnover of virus, T cells, and B cells constitute a unifying feature of persistent infection, illustrating the dichotomy between distinct immune effectors in regulating acute and persistent central nervous system infection.","Stohlman, Stephen A; Ramakrishna, Chandran; Tschen, Shuen-Ing; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of neurovirology,186,1

We reported that the soluble form of MHV receptor (soMHVR) transformed a nonfusogenic S protein into a fusogenic one (F. Taguchi and S. Matsuyama, J. Virol. 76:950-958, 2002). In the present study, we demonstrate that soMHVR induces the conformational changes of the S protein, as shown by the proteinase digestion test. A cl-2 mutant, srr7, of the MHV JHM virus (JHMV) was digested with proteinase K after treatment with soMHVR, and the resultant S protein was analyzed by Western blotting using monoclonal antibody (MAb) 10G, specific for the membrane-anchored S2 subunit. A 58-kDa fragment, encompassing the two heptad repeats in S2, was detected when srr7 was digested after soMHVR treatment, while no band was seen when the virus was untreated. The appearance of the proteinase-resistant fragment was dependent on the temperature and time of srr7 incubation with soMHVR and also on the concentration of soMHVR. Coimmunoprecipitation indicated that the direct binding of soMHVR to srr7 S protein induced these conformational changes; this was also suggested by the inhibition of the changes following pretreatment of soMHVR with anti-MHVR MAb CC1. soMHVR induced conformational changes of the S proteins of wild-type (wt) JHMV cl-2, as well as revertants from srr7, srr7A and srr7B; however, a major proportion of these S proteins were resistant to proteinase K even without soMHVR treatment. The implications of this proteinase-resistant fraction are discussed. This is the first report on receptor-induced conformational changes of the membrane-anchored fragment of the coronavirus S protein.","Matsuyama, Shutoku; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Journal of virology,186,1

The CC50 of 1,8-cineole was above 10 mM. And the maximum noncytotoxic concentration (TD0) of 1,8-cineole was determined to be 3.90 ± 0.22 mM, which was much higher than that of ribavirin (0.78 ± 0.15 mM). 1,8-cineole could inhibit IBV with an IC(50) of 0.61 mM. MTT assay showed that the inhibition of IBV by 1, 8-cineole appears to occur moderately before entering the cell but much strongly after penetration of the virus into the cell. In silico simulations indicated that the binding site of 1,8-cineole was located at the N terminus of phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, with interaction energy equaling -40.33 kcal mol(-1). The residues TyrA92, ProA134, PheA137, AspA138 and TyrA140 had important roles during the binding process and are fully or partially conserved in various IBV strains. Based on spatial and energetic criteria, 1,8-cineole interfered with the binding between RNA and IBV N-protein. Results presented here may suggest that 1,8-cineole possesses anti-IBV properties, and therefore is a potential source of anti-IBV ingredients for the pharmaceutical industry.","Yang, Zhiwei; Wu, Nan; Fu, Yujie; Yang, Gang; Wang, Wei; Zu, Yuangang; Efferth, Thomas",Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,186,1

METHODS Serum antibody against SARS-CoV IgG was determined cross-sectionally and symptoms of respiratory infection were investigated retrospectively for part of traders of three wholesale markets for wild animals in Guangzhou. RESULTS Overall rate of infection with SARS-CoV in 635 traders was 16.69%, varying in three different markets. Infection rate in market A mainly engaging in wild animals ranked the highest of 25.61%, significantly higher than that in markets B and C engaging in domestic fowls and snakes. Infection rate in traders only engaging in civet cats was 58.54%, significantly higher than that in traders engaging in snakes only (9.46%). In market A, infection rate varied in different persons, 59.34%, 20.59%, 16.00%, 15.22%, 10.40% and 9.68% in traders engaging in wild animals, managers, children of the traders, traders engaging in domestic fowls, traders engaging in snakes, and traders engaging in frozen food, respectively, in a decreasing pattern as their contact opportunities. During the period of SARS epidemic, detection rate of SARS-CoV antibody in people with symptoms of acute respiratory infection was higher (30.70%) than that in those without such symptoms (20.08%). Prevalence of symptoms of acute upper respiratory infection in people with positive antibody against SARS-CoV was higher (49.28%) than that in those with negative antibody (30.35%). CONCLUSIONS Infection with SARS-CoV in traders of animal markets possibly related to their direct exposure to wild animals, particularly to civet cats. During the period of SARS epidemic, some of the traders did infect with SARS-CoV, but they were neglected due to clinically inapparent manifestations.","Xu, Hui-fang; Wang, Ming; Zhang, Zhou-bin; Zou, Xiao-zhong; Gao, Yang; Liu, Xiao-ning; Lu, En-jie; Pan, Bing-ying; Wu, Shi-jun; Yu, Shou-yi",Zhonghua yu fang yi xue za zhi [Chinese journal of preventive medicine],186,30

It is widely assumed that the generation of dsRNA during genome replication is a trait shared by all viruses. However, to our knowledge, no study exists in which the production of dsRNA by different viruses is systematically investigated. Here, we investigated the presence and localization of dsRNA in cells infected with a range of viruses, employing a dsRNA-specific antibody for immunofluorescence analysis. Our data revealed that, as predicted, significant amounts of dsRNA can be detected for viruses with a genome consisting of positive-strand RNA, dsRNA, or DNA. Surprisingly, however, no dsRNA signals were detected for negative-strand RNA viruses. Thus, dsRNA is indeed a general feature of most virus groups, but negative-strand RNA viruses appear to be an exception to that rule.","Weber, Friedemann; Wagner, Valentina; Rasmussen, Simon B; Hartmann, Rune; Paludan, Søren R",Journal of virology,186,16

These conversations have spread various conspiracies about vaccines against COVID-19. It is, therefore, necessary to develop communication strategies, led by official accounts, that offer accessible information on vaccination as a preventive public health strategy. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of public institutions on Twitter campaign #yomevacuno to deal with misinformation about vaccination against COVID-19. METHODS This paper performs a social network analysis and content analysis of Twitter data, using NodeXL software, from December 8th to 23rd, 2020. Tweets included content #yomevacuno hashtag. RESULTS A total of 6,080 interactions were collected, 82% were tweets. Data shows that public institutions generate 53.36% of traffic information, the most important was the Ministerio de Sanidad from Spain. Content analysis revealed that 48% of a sample of 50 Tweets the message was focused on vaccination as a social responsibility to defeat COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS The communication strategy of #yomevacuno hashtag, has been led by the Ministerio de Sanidad of Spain, by comparison to other campaigns in which there was no large presence of public institutions. This case represents the importance of social media as a way to spread information and prevention, even in public health and the need for them to be led by public organizations rather than by individual users.","Herrera-Peco, Iván; Ruiz Núñez, Carlos; Jiménez-Gómez, Beatriz; Romero-Magdalena, Carlos Santiago; Benítez De Gracia, Elvira",Revista espanola de salud publica,186,19

Gene exchange between virulent and avirulent viruses has shown that the nsP3 gene, which has essential 5' conserved domains and a non-essential hypervariable 3' domain, is one of the virulence determinants. This protein plays a role in subgenomic 26S and negative-strand RNA synthesis and is thought to function with nsP1 to anchor replication complexes to cell membrane structures. Studies to date have focused on analysing the effect of mutational changes spread over the whole gene on virulence of the virus. The virulent SFV4 virus, derived from an infectious clone, was utilized to analyse the effect on virulence of large deletions in the hypervariable domain of nsP3. Two viruses with different in-frame deletions that spanned this domain showed reduced rates of RNA synthesis and multiplication in cell culture. In adult BALB/c mice, these viruses were avirulent after intramuscular and intraperitoneal inoculation, and brains sampled from infected mice showed minimal or no evidence of pathology. These deleted viruses had greatly reduced virulence when administered by the intranasal route and brains from infected mice showed lesions that were much less severe than those seen in SFV4 infection. Mice surviving infection with the deleted viruses resisted challenge with the virulent L10 strain, indicating induction of protective immunity. This work establishes that deletions in the nsP3 hypervariable domain attenuate virulence after peripheral inoculation and also reduce virulence after intranasal inoculation.","Galbraith, Sareen E; Sheahan, Brian J; Atkins, Gregory J",The Journal of general virology,186,1

These RNAs contain a 3'-coterminal nested sequence set and were assumed to be viral mRNAs. The seven major IBV virion proteins are all produced by processing of three polypeptides of ca. 23, 51, and 115 kilodaltons. These are the core polypeptides of the small membrane proteins, the nucleocapsid protein, and the 155-kilodalton precursor to the large membrane proteins GP90 and GP84, respectively. To determine which mRNAs specify these polypeptides, we isolated RNA from infected cells and translated it in a messenger-dependent rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Proteins of 23, 51, and 110 kilodaltons were produced. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping demonstrated that these proteins were closely related to the major virion proteins. Fractionation of the RNA before cell-free translation permitted the correlation of messenger activities for synthesis of the proteins with the presence of specific mRNAs. We found that the smallest RNA, RNA A, directs the synthesis of P51, the nucleocapsid protein. RNA C, which contains the sequences of RNA A, directs the synthesis of the small membrane protein P23. RNA E directs the synthesis of the large virion glycoproteins. These results supported a model in which only the unique 5'-terminal domain of each IBV mRNA is active in translation and enabled us to localize genes for virion proteins on the IBV genome.","Stern, D F; Sefton, B M",Journal of virology,186,1

DESIGN Neonatal pigs were exposed to PRCV when they were 2, 4, or 6 days old and challenge-exposed to virulent TGEV at 10 days of age. ANIMALS 34 hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived pigs. PROCEDURE After challenge exposure, clinical signs were observed, body weight, antibody response, and virus shedding were measured, and mortality was determined. RESULTS After exposure to PRCV, principals had a slightly slower rate of weight gain than did controls; with 1 exception (a PRCV-exposed pig that was dyspneic for 1 day), principals and controls remained clinically normal until shortly after challenge exposure, when all pigs became listless and anorectic and developed watery diarrhea. However, by day 3, most of the pigs that had been exposed to PRCV when they were either 2 or 4 days old began to recover and most (15/18) survived. Conversely, the clinical condition of most of the other pigs worsened and most (14/16) died. Pigs exposed to PRCV when they were 2 or 4 days old also differed from all other pigs in that they had serum virus-neutralizing antibodies for PRCV and TGEV at the time of challenge exposure. CONCLUSIONS The PRCV can induce protective immunity to TGEV in neonatal pigs and such immunity develops at or about 6 days after exposure to PRCV. Moreover, protective immunity may be coincident with the appearance of virus-neutralizing antibody. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Exposure to PRCV should enhance a TGE herd vaccination program.","Wesley, R D; Woods, R D",American journal of veterinary research,186,17

All cases were women between 42 and 67 years-old. Cases were diagnosed by serology and PCR of respiratory samples. Appropriate treatment was immediately administered to the eight hospitalised individuals after exposure to birds had been discovered. In the chicken flocks, mainly C. gallinacea was detected, a new member of the family Chlamydiaceae, whereas the ducks were found to harbour predominantly C. psittaci, the classical agent of psittacosis. In addition, C. psittaci was found in the same flock as the chickens that the patients had slaughtered. Both human and C. psittaci-positive avian samples carried the same ompA genotype E/B of C. psittaci, which is widespread among French duck flocks. Repeated grassland rotations between duck and chicken flocks on the farm may explain the presence of C. psittaci in the chickens. Inspection by the veterinary service led to temporary closure of the farm. All birds had to be euthanised on site as no slaughterhouses accepted processing them. Farm buildings and grasslands were cleaned and/or disinfected before the introduction of new poultry birds.","Laroucau, K; Aaziz, R; Meurice, L; Servas, V; Chossat, I; Royer, H; de Barbeyrac, B; Vaillant, V; Moyen, J L; Meziani, F; Sachse, K; Rolland, P",Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin,186,17

It rapidly spread, at first in China, then resulting in an epidemic in other countries throughout the world. One of such controversial topics is the issue of diagnostics and interpretation of test for COVID-19. According to Polish and global guidelines, the basis for diagnosis is molecular testing - real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Taking all these data into consideration, the aim of the study was to compare RT-PCR with serological test in our employees post-exposure. According to Polish and global guidelines, the basis for diagnosis is molecular testing, real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The aim: To compare RT-PCR with serological test in our employees post-exposure. PATIENTS AND METHODS Material and methods: 79 employees of the Clinic, 19 men and 60 women in the age range 27-69 years were evaluated. Tests were begun four days after information about the positive test in our ""Employee 0"" and lasted for 7 days. At first, we made RT-PCR tests on the specimen from nasopharyngeal swab. Then, we accomplished rapid antibodies tests. This test is based on the qualitative assessment of the presence of IgM and IgG antibodies by immunochromatography using a sample of capillary blood from the fingertip. RESULTS Results: All the tests were negative. No employee developed symptoms during the 7-day follow-up after the end of the tests. CONCLUSION Conclusions: As routine tests for patients have been implemented widely, but similar solutions for employees have not gained popularity. Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) e.g. facemask and shields, transparent screens, disposable medical uniforms, minimalization the contact time, increasing distance from both colleagues and patients (if possible), and strictly follow sanitary procedures largely contributed to the absence of illness in the surveyed group of employees.","Kwiatkowska, Marlena; Chomicka, Inga; Malyszko, Jolanta",Wiadomosci lekarskie,186,28

We therefore used ultrasound biomicroscopy to assess left ventricular (LV) cardiac structure and function during development in Fgl2 KO and wild-type (WT) mice. The only deaths observed between embryonic day (E)8.5 (onset of heart beating) and postnatal day (P)28 (weaning) were within 3 days after birth, when 33% of Fgl2 KO pups died. Histopathology and Doppler assessments suggested that death was due to acute congestive cardiac failure without evidence of valvular or other obvious cardiac structural abnormalities. Heart rates in Fgl2 KO embryos were significantly reduced at E8.5 and E17.5, and irregular heart rhythms were significantly more common in Fgl2 KO (21/26) than WT (2/21) embryos at E13.5. Indexes of systolic and/or diastolic cardiac function were also abnormal in KO mice at E13.5 and E17.5, in postnatal mice studied at P1, and in KO mice surviving to P28. M-mode analysis showed no difference in LV diastolic chamber dimension, although posterior wall thickness was thinner at P7 and P28 in Fgl2 KO mice. We conclude that Fgl2 deficiency is not associated with obvious structural cardiac defects but is associated with a high incidence of neonatal death as well as contractile dysfunction and rhythm abnormalities during embryonic and postnatal development in mice.","Mu, Junwu; Qu, Dawei; Bartczak, Agata; Phillips, M James; Manuel, Justin; He, Wei; Koscik, Cheryl; Mendicino, Michael; Zhang, Li; Clark, David A; Grant, David R; Backx, Peter H; Levy, Gary A; Adamson, S Lee",Physiological genomics,186,24

Antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes coverage for both typical and atypical organisms. Doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone with enhanced activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, or a macrolide is appropriate for outpatient treatment of immunocompetent adult patients. Hospitalized adults should be treated with cefotaxime or ceftriaxone plus a macrolide, or with a fluoroquinolone alone. The same agents can be used in adult patients in intensive care units, although fluoroquinolone monotherapy is not recommended; ampicillin-sulbactam or piperacillin-tazobactam can be used instead of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. Outpatient treatment of children two months to five years of age consists of high-dose amoxicillin given for seven to 10 days. A single dose of ceftriaxone can be used in infants when the first dose of antibiotic is likely to be delayed or not absorbed. Older children can be treated with a macrolide.

We investigated the expression of neutral GSLs in the brain, thymus, spleen, and lungs of mice lacking the gene for the beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)M), an important component of the MHC class I molecule. Determination of GSL fractions in the tissues of mice homozygous (beta(2)M-/-) or heterozygous (beta(2)M+/-) for beta(2)M gene knockout was performed by high performance thin layer chromatography, followed by immunostaining with specific antibodies. RESULTS Immunochemical analyses revealed abundant expression of globotetraosylceramide (Gb 4), in the brain of beta(2)M-/- mice, compared with undetectable expression in the control beta(2)M+/- mice. The brain of both groups of animals was negative for Gg 3, Gg 4 and Gb 3 immunostaining. Abundant expression of Gg 3, Gg 4, and Gb 3 was found in the lungs of control beta(2)M+/- mice, whereas beta(2)M-/- mice lacked these structures. Immunostaining of Gb 4 in the lungs was similar in both groups of animals. The thymus and spleen neutral GSL profiles did not significantly differ between beta(2)M-/- and control animals. CONCLUSION This study provides in vivo-evidence that globo- and ganglio-series neutral GSL expression in the brain and lungs may be related to the presence of beta(2)M or functional MHC class I molecule, and implicates different modulation of biosynthesis of globo- and ganglio-series neutral GSLs in these tissues.","Markotić, Anita; Marusić, Ana; Muthing, Johannes",Neuroimmunomodulation,186,5

It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid beta peptide, forming compact fibrillar plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles. Another major and much more prevalent cause of morbidity and mortality in world is diabetes especially type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is caused by a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate compensatory insulin secretory response. Chronic wounds caused by antibiotic resistant bacterial infections that fail to heal are a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the most frequent reason for nontraumatic lower limb amputation. Holistically, these two diseases are linked at molecular level but the exact mechanism is a topic of debate. Bacteriophages are viruses infecting bacteria and lack ability to infect mammalian cells. They are neither causative agent for Alzheimer's disease or type 2 diabetes mellitus nor involved in their pathogenicity but promises for a novel divergent therapeutic approach. The great versatility of the phage system has led to the development of improved phage delivery vectors, as well as immunomodulation of anti-amyloid beta peptide response. Phages could also constitute valuable prophylaxis against bacterial infections, especially in immunocompromised patients like in the case of diabetes. Patients having diabetes have a high risk of developing foot ulcers which are difficult to be treated by antibiotics alone due to ever increasing antibiotic resistance strains. Combination therapy based on multiple phage and broad spectrum antibiotics holds great promise. The potential therapeutic phage therapy arises from its lack of natural tropism for mammalian cells, resulting in no adverse effects.","Sohrab, Sayed S; Karim, Sajjad; Kamal, Mohammad A; Abuzenadah, Adel M; Chaudhary, Adeel G; Al-Qahtani, Mohammed H; Mirza, Zeenat",CNS & neurological disorders drug targets,186,28

Aim is to report our experience in the surgical treatment of gastric cancer in a European center. MATERIAL AND METHODS A prospectively maintained database identified 515 patients. Staging laparoscopy was performed to rule out peritoneal carcinomatosis in suspicious cases. Type of surgery and lymphadenectomy were determined according to the Japanese guidelines and pathological staging according to the TNM classification. Survival was analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Staging laparoscopy avoided 150 (29.1%) unnecessary laparotomies. A total of 356 patients underwent surgery with curative intent. Overall postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 16.8% and 5.9%, respectively. Two hundred-fifty-one patients (70%) were T3-T4. Negative lymph-nodes were observed in 71 patients (19.9%). One-hundred- seventy-nine were at least stage III. At a mean follow-up of 80.6 months, the overall and disease-free survival rates were 54.4% and 50.6%, respectively. The survival stratification based on the type of lymphadenectomy showed an overall survival rate of 43% and 65.5% in case of D1 and D2 lymphadenectomy, respectively. Based on the tumor stage the overall survival rate was 90%, 62.7%, 36.4% and the disease-free survival was 90%, 54.3%, 31.3%, for stage I, II and III, respectively.

The present trends indicate that the pandemic will have an enormous clinical and economic impact on population health. Infections are initiated by the transmembrane spike (S) glycoproteins of human coronavirus (hCoV) binding to host receptors. Ongoing research and therapeutic product development are of vital importance for the successful treatment of CoViD-19. To contribute somewhat to the overall effort, herein, single point mutations (SPMs) of the binding site residues in hCoV-OC43 S that recognizes cellular surface components containing 9-O-acetylated sialic acid (9-O-Ac-Sia) are explored using an in silico protein engineering approach, while their effects on the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hidroxychloroquine (Hcq) are evaluated using molecular docking simulations. Thr31Met and Val84Arg are predicted to be the critical - most likely SPMs in hCoV-OC43 S for the binding of 9-O-Ac-Sia and Hcq, respectively, even though Thr31Met is a very likely SPM in the case of Hcq too. The corresponding modes of interaction indicate a comparable strength of the Thr31Met/9-O-Ac-Sia and Val84Arg/Hcq (or Thr31Met/Hcq) complexes. Given that the binding site is conserved in all CoV S glycoproteins that associate with 9-O-acetyl-sialoglycans, the high hydrophobic affinity of Hcq to hCoV-OC43 S speaks in favor of its ability to competitively inhibit rapid S-mediated virion attachment in high-density receptor environments, but its considerably low specificity to hCoV-OC43 S may be one of the key obstacles in considering the potential of Hcq to become a drug candidate.","Mitrasinovic, Petar M",Acta chimica Slovenica,186,1

The strongest evidence favoring a virus is based primarily on epidemiologic considerations. Less convincing evidence comes from pathologic studies, serology, lymphocyte reactivity to viral antigens, and reports of identification of virus in MS tissues. Animal models of viral demyelination exist, which may provide insight into possible etiologic agents and pathogenetic mechanisms. Considering all the data, it is clear that no agent can be convincingly linked to MS at the present time. If a single virus causes the majority of cases of MS, then a morbilliform virus--canine distemper--is a leading contender, because this agent is consistent with the epidemiologic and serologic findings and is highly neurovirulent for animals ranging from mice to primates. Since no virus fulfills the usual criteria for linking an infectious agent to a disease, other possibilities must be considered. If MS is caused by a single virus, it may be a common virus not presently considered as being associated with MS, or an agent as yet unidentified. It is also conceivable that multiple agents, acting alone or in concert, initiate the MS process, perhaps through a common immune-mediated pathway. In this regard, another human demyelinating disease--the Guillain-Barré syndrome--which may in some instances become a chronic remitting and relapsing disorder, is thought to be initiated by multiple infectious agents but to have an immunologic pathogenesis.","Cook, S D; Dowling, P C",Neurology,186,16

However, the clinical spectrum of disease and the epidemiology of CoV-HKU1 infections in relation to infections with other respiratory viruses are unknown. In this 12-month prospective study, 4,181 nasopharyngeal aspirates from patients with acute respiratory tract infections were subjected to reverse transcription-PCRs specific for CoV-HKU1 and human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63), OC43 (HCoV-OC43), and 229E (HCoV-229E). Coronaviruses were detected in 87 (2.1%) patients, with 13 (0.3%) positive for CoV-HKU1, 17 (0.4%) positive for HCoV-NL63, 53 (1.3%) positive for HCoV-OC43, and 4 (0.1%) positive for HCoV-229E. Of the 13 patients with CoV-HKU1 infections, 11 were children and 8 had underlying diseases. Similar to the case for other coronaviruses, upper respiratory infection was the most common presentation of CoV-HKU1 infections, although pneumonia, acute bronchiolitis, and asthmatic exacerbation also occurred. Despite a shorter duration of fever (mean, 1.7 days) and no difference in maximum temperature in children with CoV-HKU1 infections compared to patients with most other respiratory virus infections, a high incidence of febrile seizures (50%) was noted, which was significantly higher than those for HCoV-OC43 (14%), adenovirus (9%), human parainfluenza virus 1 (0%), and respiratory syncytial virus (8%) infections. CoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 infections peaked in winter, although cases of the former also occurred in spring to early summer. This is in contrast to HCoV-NL63 infections, which mainly occurred in early summer and autumn but were absent in winter. Two genotypes of CoV-HKU1 cocirculated during the study period. Continuous studies over a longer period are warranted to ascertain the seasonal variation and relative importance of the different coronaviruses. Similar studies in other countries are required to better determine the epidemiology and genetic diversity of CoV-HKU1.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yip, Cyril C Y; Tse, Herman; Tsoi, Hoi-wah; Cheng, Vincent C C; Lee, Paul; Tang, Bone S F; Cheung, Chris H Y; Lee, Rodney A; So, Lok-yee; Lau, Yu-lung; Chan, Kwok-hung; Yuen, Kwok-yung",Journal of clinical microbiology,186,1

We assessed this hypothesis in patients with autism and in those with mixed connective tissue diseases. Associated with antigliadin and anti-HSP antibodies, children with autism and patients with autoimmune disease developed anti-dipeptidylpeptidase I (DPP I), anti-dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV [or CD26]) and anti-aminopeptidase N (CD13) autoantibodies. A significant percentage of autoimmune and autistic sera were associated with elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM, or IgA antibodies against three peptidases, gliadin, and HSP-60. These antibodies are specific, since immune absorption demonstrated that only specific antigens (e.g., DPP IV absorption of anti-DPP IV), significantly reduced IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody levels. For direct demonstration of SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptide binding to DPP IV, microtiter wells coated with DPP IV were reacted with SK, HSP-60, and gliadin. They were then reacted with anti-DPP IV or anti-SK, anti-HSP, and antigliadin antibodies. Adding SK, HSP-60, and gliadin peptides to DPP IV resulted in 27 to 43% inhibition of the DPP IV-anti-DPP IV reaction, but DPP IV-positive peptides caused 18 to 20% enhancement of antigen-antibody reactions. We propose that (i) superantigens (e.g., SK and HSP-60) and dietary proteins (e.g., gliadin peptides) in individuals with predisposing HLA molecules bind to aminopeptidases and (ii) they induce autoantibodies to peptides and tissue antigens. Dysfunctional membrane peptidases and autoantibody production may result in neuroimmune dysregulation and autoimmunity.","Vojdani, Aristo; Bazargan, Mohsen; Vojdani, Elroy; Samadi, John; Nourian, Alen A; Eghbalieh, Navid; Cooper, Edwin L",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,186,19

Among the OR nurses/ technicians 41.9% reported that causes of their stress included inadequate teamwork, ineffective communication, and especially surgeons' negative attitudes. SUBJECTS AND METHODS The stuudie has been held in Clinical Hospital Centre Split, the sample consists of a total of 62 out of 109 possible respondents participated in the study. A total of 23 (37%) anesthesiology technicians and 39 (63%) ICU nurses / technicians participated in the survey. In the empirical part of this research, the importance of selected stressors was tested using quantitative methods in biomedicine. The existence of stress was tested by the Wilcoxon test. Stress level in the ICU was tested by T-test The analysis was elaborated in the statistical software STATISTICA 12. Conclusions were made at a significance level of 5%. The research was conducted through the questionnaire taken from the paper Milan Milošević entitled: ""Development of a measuring instrument of stress in the workplace hospital health professionals and an assessment of its use value"" (2010). RESULTS Based on the empirical t value of 3.42 at 59 degrees of freedom the conclusion is that there was found a statistically significant difference in the level of stressors in the workplace between nurses / technicians in the ICU and anesthesiology technicians. The conclusion was reached at an empirical level of significance <0.001. CONCLUSION The highest level of stress among medical staff is caused by the factor of insufficient number of employees, followed by work overload, inadequate material resources for work (financial constraints), poor organization at work, and the factor of poor communication with superiors.","Russo, Andrea; Paštar, Anđela; Slišković, Ana; Urlić, Ivan; Škare, Zorana; Mulić, Rosanda",Psychiatria Danubina,186,1

In man, CV are generally associated with upper respiratory tract infections. The two prototype strains that are the best studied human CV isolates and which are thought to be responsible for most of the respiratory infections caused by CV are called 229E and OC43. Humoral responses consisting of neutralizing antibodies to CV are present in most individuals by six years of age. Although the cellular immune response to CV in man has not been characterized at all, it is known that the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins elicit the major cell mediated immune responses in the mouse. This report describes the production and characterization of eleven independently isolated T cell clones that are specific for the human CV(HCV) 229E. The T cell clones are CD4+ and presumably recognize a processed viral peptide presented by class II molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Of six 229E-specific T cell clones tested against purified viral proteins, three recognize the 180 kD spike glycoprotein while the other three recognize the 55 kD nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. Analysis of the human T cell mediated response to HCV will provide information regarding which viral proteins elicit the immunodominant response, what the fine specificity of these T cell clones are (immuno-dominant peptides), and what the T cell receptor (TCR) and cytokine usage is of these virus specific clones.","Spencer, J S; Cabirac, G F; Best, C; McLaughlin, L; Murray, R S",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,186,16

It has previously been shown that the N-terminal portion of this gene product is cleaved into a protein of 28 kilodaltons (p28). To identify possible functional domains of gene 1 and further understand the mechanism of synthesis of the p28 protein, cDNA clones representing the 5'-most 5.3 kilobases of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHM were subcloned into pT7 vectors from which RNAs were transcribed and translated in vitro. Although p28 is encoded from the first 1 kilobase at the 5'-end of the genome, translation of in vitro transcribed RNAs indicated that this protein was not detected unless the product of the entire 5.3 kilobase region was synthesized. This result suggests that the region close to 5.3 kilobases from the 5'-end of the genomic RNA is essential for the proteolytic cleavage and may contain an autoproteolytic activity. Addition of the protease inhibitor ZnCl2 blocked cleavage of the p28 protein. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys residue 1137 significantly reduced the cleavage of the p28 protein, indicating that this residue, probably in conjunction with a downstream domain, plays an essential role in the cleavage of p28. This Cys residue may be part of a papain-like autoprotease encoded by gene 1.","Baker, S C; La Monica, N; Shieh, C K; Lai, M M",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,186,17

Despite benefits including reduced trauma and recovery time, EIGIs have their own challenges. Remote catheter actuation and challenging anatomical morphology may lead to erroneous endovascular device selections, delays or even complications such as vessel injury. EIGI planning using 3D phantoms would allow interventionists to become familiarized with the patient vessel anatomy by first performing the planned treatment on a phantom under standard operating protocols. In this study the optimal workflow to obtain such phantoms from 3D data for interventionist to practice on prior to an actual procedure was investigated. Patient-specific phantoms and phantoms presenting a wide range of challenging geometries were created. Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA) data was uploaded into a Vitrea 3D station which allows segmentation and resulting stereo-lithographic files to be exported. The files were uploaded using processing software where preloaded vessel structures were included to create a closed-flow vasculature having structural support. The final file was printed, cleaned, connected to a flow loop and placed in an angiographic room for EIGI practice. Various Circle of Willis and cardiac arterial geometries were used. The phantoms were tested for ischemic stroke treatment, distal catheter navigation, aneurysm stenting and cardiac imaging under angiographic guidance. This method should allow for adjustments to treatment plans to be made before the patient is actually in the procedure room and enabling reduced risk of peri-operative complications or delays.","Russ, M; O'Hara, R; Setlur Nagesh, S V; Mokin, M; Jimenez, C; Siddiqui, A; Bednarek, D; Rudin, S; Ionita, C",Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering,186,19

Three year cycles of this infection were established. The periods of coronaviruses activation were accompanied by their detection in patient material by electron-microscopy, a sharp increase of immune response of patients as well as in the number of nosocomial infections and the proportion of the monoinfection of the coronavirus nature. Coronaviruses played the leading role among other viruses in the etiology of hospital respiratory infections.

Ingestion of masticated seeds results in high morbidity, with vomiting and watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea. The prognosis varies with the number of seeds ingested, the degree of mastication, individual susceptibility, and the delay in treatment. Low mortality restricts assessment of histologic lesions, and the literature on toxicologic analysis for ricin is limited. This report describes a fatal case of castor bean ingestion in a 12-week-old Mastiff puppy, with confirmation of ricin exposure through detection of the biomarker ricinine by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS).

Tracheas were transported in normal saline to the laboratory at Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Evidence of bacteria adherent to the tracheal epithelium was found in specimens from 20/24 of these tracheas. The epithelium from each of five tracheas was placed in glutaraldehyde fixative for transmission electron microscopic examination. Epithelium from each of 12 other tracheas was placed in formaldehyde fixative for light microscopic examination. Microscopically, 13 of these 17 bovine tracheal epithelia were observed to contain bacteria located longitudinally parallel to and between cilia and microvilli of ciliated cells. Preparations of ciliary axonemes isolated from the epithelium of seven additional bovine tracheas also contained these bacteria in sections viewed by a transmission electron microscope. These bacteria had two different ultrastructural morphologies: filamentous with a trilaminar-structured cell wall and short with a thick, homogeneously stained cell wall beneath a regularly arrayed surface layer. The short bacillus had surface carbohydrates, including mannose, galactose, and N-acetylgalactosamine, identified by lectin binding. The filamentous bacillus was apparently externally deficient in these carbohydrates. Immunogold staining revealed that the filamentous bacillus was antigenically related to cilia-associated respiratory (CAR) bacillus, which has been identified in rabbit and rodent species.

OBJECTIVE To analyze the angiographic characteristics of pseudo-occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) before and after carotid artery stenting (CAS). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the angiographic characteristics of 56 patients with pseudo-occlusion of the ICA treated with CAS. Angiographic changes were evaluated from digital subtraction angiography in terms of lesion characteristics of the stenosis and the diameter changes in the distal ICA before and after CAS. RESULTS Fifty-six patients were successfully treated. Based on angiographic findings of ICA stenosis, 33 and 23 patients were classified into the single-channel and multiple-channel group, respectively. Regarding the diameter changes in the distal ICA after CAS, 31 cases were classified as immediate dilatation and the other 25 as restricted dilatation. Immediate dilatation of the distal ICA beyond the stent and that at a follow-up examination were observed significantly less frequently in the multiple-channel group than in the single-channel group. The use of multiple stents and stent occlusion at a follow-up examination were significantly more prevalent in the multiple-channel group than in the single-channel group. CONCLUSION Stenotic lesions of pseudo-occlusion of the ICA were classified as single channel and multiple channel. Restricted dilatation of the distal ICA after CAS was more prevalent in the multiple-channel group. Because adverse events tended to be more frequent in the multiple-channel group than in the single-channel group, the indications for CAS should be determined carefully in multiple-channel patients.

In total, 481 free-ranging individuals of five mustelid species (including the European mink) were tested. Sympatric mustelids can serve as sentinels to determine the presence of antibodies to viruses in the study area that could potentially infect mink. Antibodies to Canine distemper virus (CDV) were detected in all species; 9% of 127 European mink, 20% of 210 polecats (Mustela putorius), 5% of 112 American mink (Mustela vison), 33% of 21 stone marten (Martes foina) and 5% of 20 pine marten (Martes martes). Antibody prevalence was significantly higher in stone marten and polecats, possibly because their ranges overlap more closely with that of domestic species than that of the other species tested. Antibodies to Canine adenovirus were detected in all species but the pine marten; antibody prevalence estimates ranging from 2% to 10%. Antibodies to canine parainfluenza virus were detected in 1% of European mink, 1% of American mink and 5% of tested polecats but were not detected in Martes species. Antibodies to Rabies virus (RV) were detected in three animals, possibly because of interspecies transmission of bat lyssaviruses as the sampling area is considered to be free of RV, or to a lack of test specificity, as antibody titers were low. The high antibody prevalence to potentially lethal CDV suggests that this pathogen could have significant effects on the free-ranging populations and has implications for the conservation efforts for the endangered European mink.","Philippa, Joost; Fournier-Chambrillon, Christine; Fournier, Pascal; Schaftenaar, Willem; van de Bildt, Marco; van Herweijnen, Rob; Kuiken, Thijs; Liabeuf, Marie; Ditcharry, Sébastien; Joubert, Laurent; Bégnier, Michel; Osterhaus, Ab",Journal of wildlife diseases,186,20

COVID-19 patients develop severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time. Small fibrinous thrombi in pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in the autopsies of fatal COVID-19 cases. Studies showed that the viral infection induces a vascular process in the lung, which included vasodilation and endothelial dysfunction. Further, the proportions of CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes were strongly reduced in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Estradiol is connected with CD4+ T cell numbers and increases T-reg cell populations, affecting immune responses to infection. It is known that estradiol exerts a protective effect on endothelial function, activating the generation of nitric oxide (NO) via endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia. It exerts a variety of rapid actions, which are initiated after its coupling with membrane receptors, which in turn, may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow. Direct and indirect mechanisms underlying the effects of estradiol were investigated, and the results point to a possible protective effect of estradiol against COVID-19, indicating that it may be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic element for the treatment of patients affected by the novel coronavirus.","Breithaupt-Faloppa, Ana Cristina; Correia, Cristiano de Jesus; Prado, Carla Máximo; Stilhano, Roberta Sessa; Ureshino, Rodrigo Portes; Moreira, Luiz Felipe Pinho",Clinics,186,20

A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of ""mismatched"" data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations.","Choe, Ann S; Tang, Bohao; Smith, Kimberly R; Honari, Hamed; Lindquist, Martin A; Caffo, Brian S; Pekar, James J",PLoS One,186,0

Methods: A survey was offered on the crowdsourcing platform, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during April 2020 (the early days of strict, social distancing restrictions). The study included 1,521 adults ages 18 years and older who resided in the US and were enrolled as MTurk workers, i.e., workers who are qualified by Amazon to complete a range of human interaction tasks, including surveys through the MTurk worker platform. Main predictors included measures of heavy drinking, marijuana, and polysubstance use. The dependent measures were measures of social distancing and personal hygiene, based on guidelines recommended at the time of the survey by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Results: We found consistent negative associations between heavy drinking and drug use and adherence to social distancing and personal hygiene. Additionally, three control variables, age, gender, and race/ethnicity, were significant correlates of adherence to these measures. Conclusions: The findings here are consistent with previous research exploring links between substance use and other adverse health behaviors. Further, the negative association between heavy drinking (five or more drinks in one sitting) and adherence underscore the public health risks entailed with the unrestricted reopening of public drinking establishments.","Fendrich, Michael; Becker, Jessica; Park, Crystal; Russell, Beth; Finkelstein-Fox, Lucy; Hutchison, Morica",Subst Abus,186,3

The oral cavity is referred to as a target of SARS-CoV-2. The aim of this study was to review oral symptoms specific to COVID-19 patients from the point of view of symptom prevalence and pathogenesis and to speculate the pathogenic mechanisms underlying them. Scientific articles were retrieved by searching PubMed/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from 3 February 2020 to 31 December 2020, and they were reviewed by title, abstract, and text for relevance. The literature search indicated that COVID-19 patients frequently present with gustatory dysfunction, xerostomia, and oral mucosal lesions, while their prevalence is likely to vary by country, age, gender, and disease severity. Gustatory dysfunction and xerostomia appear at an early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection and last relatively long. One of possible pathogenic mechanisms of both symptoms is attributed to the expression of viral cellular entry-relevant receptors in taste cells and salivary glands. Dental professionals who can first become aware of oral symptoms associated with COVID-19 will play a more active role in and make a greater contribution to diagnosis and prevention of COVID-19.","Tsuchiya, Hironori",,186,1

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, the use of AI in the healthcare sector has been largely evident. This chapter provides a detailed analysis regarding the use of AI technology in the healthcare sector and identifies its contributions in the fighting against the deadly pandemic, i.e. COVID-19. Discussion regarding the challenges in the AI technology is further provided. Following the analysis, it has been revealed that AI is effective and contributes under six areas;including the production of early warnings and alerts, tracking and prediction, data bash boards, diagnosis and prognosis, information related to treatment and cures resulting in controlling the widespread of the disease. In broader terms, AI is effective and can be used to identify and analyze patterns in complex and large data sets in a more precise time and high speed which was never done before. It is further useful in providing a thorough search related to the literary studies conducted previously regarding the development of different drugs. Furthermore, manufacturing of drugs is held through robots designed by the infusion of the AI technology for fast and quick delivery of services. Contributions of AI when used in the healthcare industry is further important to search out patients that are suitable for the clinical studies. AI due to its fast-tracking systems is further effective in reducing the workload of radiologists, since it is capable of reading the radiological reports through deep learning and machine learning systems. These scans can be stored for some time and are available when required in order to train the AI systems. AI through its fast-tracking quality, allows cost and time effective functions by quickly analyzing a number of scans resulting in providing better treatment to patients. In the healthcare sector, AI has shown promising results by detecting conditions such as;pneumonia, skin cancer, eye diseases etc. Also, most hospitals used AI technologies to analyze echocardiography scans, ultra sound system, neurological conditions, speech patterns or to predict the psychotic episodes. Many surgical robotics are being designed to assist clinical experts in surgical processes. In the prevailing diseases like pandemic, AI technology-based robots are used by various countries for medication and routine checkup purposes in order to reduce the chances of doctors being affected by the disease contact. However, in the existing crisis the role of AI has been limited since only limited countries were able to install the AI technology which has limited its impact in controlling the virus. Besides, the lack of data in providing the accurate predictions regarding the spread of disease was another major gap in reducing the overall impact of the disease. Overcoming these barriers and limitations are effective in developing the right balance between public health and data privacy leading towards the development of human based AI interactions. These gaps will likely to address the issues faced in the time of the present pandemic situation, as by gathering extensive data related to the infected population countries will be able to save thousands of lives, through prior preparations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Al-Hashimi, M.; Hamdan, A.",Lect.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between the COVID-19 lockdown and the risk of adverse birth outcomes in Botswana. STUDY DESIGN: In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, Botswana enforced a lockdown that restricted movement within the country. We used data from an ongoing nationwide birth outcomes surveillance study to evaluate adverse outcomes (stillbirth, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age fetuses, and neonatal death) and severe adverse outcomes (stillbirth, very preterm birth, very-small-for-gestational-age fetuses, and neonatal death) recorded prelockdown (January 1, 2020-April 2, 2020), during lockdown (April 3, 2020-May 7, 2020), and postlockdown (May 8, 2020-July 20, 2020). Using difference-in-differences analyses, we compared the net change in each outcome from the prelockdown to lockdown periods in 2020 relative to the same 2 periods in 2017-2019 with the net change in each outcome from the prelockdown to postlockdown periods in 2020 relative to the same 2 periods in 2017-2019. RESULTS: In this study, 68,448 women delivered a singleton infant in 2017-2020 between January 1 and July 20 and were included in our analysis (mean [interquartile range] age of mothers, 26 [22-32] years). Across the included calendar years and periods, the risk of any adverse outcome ranged from 27.92% to 31.70%, and the risk of any severe adverse outcome ranged from 8.40% to 11.38%. The lockdown period was associated with a 0.81 percentage point reduction (95% confidence interval, -2.95% to 1.30%) in the risk of any adverse outcome (3% relative reduction) and a 0.02 percentage point reduction (95% confidence interval, -0.79% to 0.75%) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (0% relative reduction). The postlockdown period was associated with a 1.72 percentage point reduction (95% confidence, -3.42% to 0.02%) in the risk of any adverse outcome (5% relative reduction) and a 1.62 percentage point reduction (95% confidence interval, -2.69% to -0.55%) in the risk of any severe adverse outcome (14% relative reduction). Reductions in adverse outcomes were largest among women with human immunodeficiency virus and among women delivering at urban delivery sites, driven primarily by reductions in preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age fetuses. CONCLUSION: Adverse birth outcomes decreased from the prelockdown to postlockdown periods in 2020, relative to the change during the same periods in 2017-2019. Our findings may provide insights into associations between mobility and birth outcomes in Botswana and other low- and middle-income countries.","Caniglia, Ellen C; Magosi, Lerato E; Zash, Rebecca; Diseko, Modiegi; Mayondi, Gloria; Mabuta, Judith; Powis, Kathleen; Dryden-Peterson, Scott; Mosepele, Mosepele; Luckett, Rebecca; Makhema, Joseph; Mmalane, Mompati; Lockman, Shahin; Shapiro, Roger",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,186,20

Circulating biomarkers that can evaluate inflammation and immune status are potentially useful in diagnosing and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. Even more so when they are a part of the routine evaluation, chest CT could have even higher diagnostic accuracy than RT-PCT alone in a suggestive clinical context. This study aims to evaluate the correlation between inflammatory markers such as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelets-to-lymphocytes ratio (PLR), and eosinophils with the severity of CT lesions in patients with COVID-19. The second objective was to seek a statically significant cut-off value for NLR and PLR that could suggest COVID-19. Correlation of both NLR and PLR with already established inflammatory markers such as CRP, ESR, and those specific for COVID-19 (ferritin, D-dimers, and eosinophils) were also evaluated. One hundred forty-nine patients with confirmed COVID-19 disease and 149 age-matched control were evaluated through blood tests, and COVID-19 patients had thorax CT performed. Both NLR and PLR correlated positive chest CT scan severity. Both NLR and PLR correlated positive chest CT scan severity. When NLR value is below 5.04, CT score is lower than 3 with a probability of 94%, while when NLR is higher than 5.04, the probability of severe CT changes is only 50%. For eosinophils, a value of 0.35% corresponds to chest CT severity of 2 (Se = 0.88, Sp = 0.43, AUC = 0.661, 95% CI (0.544; 0.779), p = 0.021. NLR and PLR had significantly higher values in COVID-19 patients. In our study a NLR = 2.90 and PLR = 186 have a good specificity (0.89, p = 0.001, respectively 0.92, p<0.001). Higher levels in NLR, PLR should prompt the clinician to prescribe a thorax CT as it could reveal important lesions that could influence the patient's future management.","Man, Milena Adina; Rajnoveanu, Ruxandra-Mioara; Motoc, Nicoleta Stefania; Bondor, Cosmina Ioana; Chis, Ana Florica; Lesan, Andrei; Puiu, Ruxandra; Lucaciu, Sergiu-Remus; Dantes, Elena; Gergely-Domokos, Bianca; Fira-Mladinescu, Ovidiu",PLoS One,186,17

In this study, we investigated the associations of SES with self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status in the general population. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were 49 474 men and women (46±12 years) residing in the Northern Netherlands from the Lifelines cohort study. SES indicators and lifestyle factors (i.e., smoking status, physical activity, alcohol intake, diet quality, sleep time and TV watching time) were assessed by questionnaire from the Lifelines Biobank. Self-reported, tested and diagnosed COVID-19 status was obtained from the Lifelines COVID-19 questionnaire. RESULTS: There were 4711 participants who self-reported having had a COVID-19 infection, 2883 participants tested for COVID-19, and 123 positive cases were diagnosed in this study population. After adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle factors, body mass index and ethnicity, we found that participants with low education or low income were less likely to self-report a COVID-19 infection (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.78 [0.71 to 0.86]; low income 0.86 [0.79 to 0.93]) and be tested for COVID-19 (OR [95% CI]: low education 0.58 [0.52 to 0.66]; low income 0.86 [0.78 to 0.95]) compared with high education or high income groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the low SES group was the most vulnerable population to self-reported and tested COVID-19 status in the general population.","Zhu, Yinjie; Duan, Ming-Jie; Dijk, Hermien H; Freriks, Roel D; Dekker, Louise H; Mierau, Jochen O",BMJ Open,186,20

We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyze how changes in intergenerational contacts differed by socioeconomic factors and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in face-to-face contacts. Finally, the change in digital devices' use has been explored as a consequence of both decreased physical intergenerational contacts (PIC) and increased non-physical intergenerational contacts (NPIC). We found that about 50% of older people have increased their NPIC during the first lockdown. Younger individuals, those with medium level of education, and those economically better off displayed higher probabilities of increased NPIC as compared to their counterparts. NPIC increased especially for individuals whose face-to-face contacts decreased, particularly so if this happened with respect to contacts with children. A large share of older people has increased their use of video calls and instant messages, while only some increased the use of social media. These findings are relevant to understand how intergenerational contacts changed during the pandemic and may be central to better plan future outbreak responses.

This study aims to explore the perceptions of physicians about the use of TC with respect to process of implementation; challenges and limitations; lessons learned and the way forward. METHOD: This was a qualitative study using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Physicians who were actively conducting TC in PHC were purposively selected and individually interviewed until no new responses were obtained. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were interviewed. Participants were predominantly females (98%) and qualified family physicians (77.3%). Overall, all participants accepted this initiative as a possible method to continue health services during COVID-19. Perceptions about the process of implementing TC in PHC were themed to; inconsistent implementation of the guideline, variability in roles and responsibilities, and Semi-supportive infrastructure. Five themes were identified as challenges and limitations: limited staff training on TC, suboptimal patient-physician interaction, insufficient technical support, ensuring privacy, and confidentiality of the communication, and different ways to document the TC. Physicians expressed that TC worked better in following COVID-19 cases, chronic conditions, and, in general, simple cases. They also expressed a reduction in the crowdedness in PHC facilities and the risk of acquiring COVID-19 and other types of infections. Tailoring the existing structural clinical setting, capacity building activities on the use of TC, and improving the quality of the TC are viewed as essential steps for the future sustainability of TC in PHC. CONCLUSION: Given the exceptional situation of COVID-19, the current evidence suggests that the use of TC in PHC, especially in chronic cases, is promising. However, measures including training of staff, improving the structural setting, and selecting suitable cases for TC are the main elements for high quality and sustainable TC services in PHC from physician's perspective.","Hasani, Said Al; Ghafri, Thamra Al; Al Lawati, Hussain; Mohammed, Jamshid; Al Mukhainai, Ameena; Al Ajmi, Fatma; Anwar, Huda",J Prim Care Community Health,186,24

Polymer macromolecules can be an alternative to the accepted forms of treatment. Polymeric substances can be used as drugs or as adjuvants in vaccines. The most important feature of polymers is their advanced structure and the ability to construct the molecule from scratch, giving it the desired properties. Antiviral properties are influenced by, among other things, electrical charge, form and structure, and composition with other polymers or heavy metals. Depending on the expected properties, molecules can be built from scratch to be capable of transporting drugs or improve the effectiveness of the right drug. They can also be antiviral drugs in themselves. Polymeric compounds allow to reduce the frequency of adverse effects and improve the effect of the drug. They can have a direct antiviral effect by upsetting the lipid membrane of the surrounding viruses. Antiviral action of polymers occurs because of the properties of the polymers alone or in combination with other molecules. Viral epidemics are a motivation for research that can help stop a global pandemic in the future.","Stojanowski, Jakub; Golebiowski, Tomasz",Polim Med,186,16

We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47-0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47-2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27-1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77-6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.","Zhu, Zhou; Xu, Shabei; Wang, Hui; Liu, Zheng; Wu, Jianhong; Li, Guo; Miao, Jinfeng; Zhang, Chenyan; Yang, Yuan; Sun, Wenzhe; Zhu, Suiqiang; Fan, Yebin; Chen, Yuxi; Hu, Junbo; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Wei",EClinicalMedicine,186,29

Five patients with severe acute hepatitis B (prothrombin activity &#8804;60%) were treated for immunosuppression by abatacept. Four patients received abatacept concurrently with methylprednisolone, and another patient was treated with abatacept alone. Rapid decrease in serum alanine aminotransferase levels, increase in prothrombin activity, and improvement of general condition were obtained in four out of five patients. The patient with the most severe hepatitis underwent liver transplantation due to exacerbation of hepatitis in spite of treatment with both abatacept and methylprednisolone. None of the patients developed significant adverse events associated with the use of abatacept. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) became negative in all five patients.

The virus employs the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor for entry into human cells. ACE2 is expressed on different organs, which is raising concern as to whether these organs can be infected by the virus or not. The testis appears to be an organ enriched with levels of ACE2, while the possible mechanisms of involvement of the male reproductive system by SARS-CoV-2 are not fully elucidated. The major focus of the present studies is on the short-term complications of the coronavirus and gains importance on studying the long-term effects, including the possible effects of the virus on the male reproductive system. The aim of this review was to provide new insights into different possible mechanisms of involvement of male gonads with SARS-CoV-2 including investigating the ACE2 axis in testis, hormonal alterations in patients with COVID-19, possible formation of anti-sperm antibodies (ASA) and subsequently immunological infertility as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Finally, we suggest measuring the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) as a determiner of male fertility impairment in patients with COVID-19 along with other options such as sex-related hormones and semen analysis. Invasion of SARS-CoV-2 to the spermatogonia, Leydig cells and Sertoli cells can lead to sex hormonal alteration and impaired gonadal function. Once infected, changes in ACE2 signalling pathways followed by oxidative stress and inflammation could cause spermatogenesis failure, abnormal sperm motility, DNA fragmentation and male infertility.","Haghpanah, Abdolreza; Masjedi, Fatemeh; Alborzi, Saeed; Hosseinpour, Alireza; Dehghani, Anahita; Malekmakan, Leila; Roozbeh, Jamshid",Andrologia,186,14

Slum-dwellers' knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are currently poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the KAP toward COVID-19 among slum dwellers resided in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. METHODS: A cross-sectional offline survey was carried out enrolling 406 slum dwellers (53.2% male; mean age = 44.9 years [SD = 12.1]; age range = 18-85 years) between August and September, 2020. The face to face interview was conducted to collect data from six selected slum areas in Dhaka City using convenience sampling. The questionnaire consisted of informed consent along with questions concerning observational checklists, socio-demographics and KAP. RESULTS: A sizeable minority were observed without wearing face masks during the survey periods (18.2%) and a vast portion (97.5%) without any hand protection. The mean scores of KAP were 6.1 ± 2.6 (out of 17), 12.3 ± 1.7 (out of 14) and 9.8 ± 1.6 (out of 12), respectively. Moreover, the KAP were strongly and positively correlated with each other. CONCLUSIONS: The findings revealed that the majority of slum dwellers in Bangladesh have limited knowledge of COVID-19. Poor practices (i.e. face mask and hand protection) were directly observed during the survey. The findings suggest the immediate implementation of health education programs and adequate interventions.","Islam, Saiful; Emran, Galib Ishraq; Rahman, Estiar; Banik, Rajon; Sikder, Tajuddin; Smith, Lee; Hossain, Sahadat",J. public health (Oxf),186,26

This study aims to discover the naturally occurring SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors from herbal constituents, as well as to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the newly identified efficacious SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors. Following screening of the inhibitory potentials of eighty herbal products against SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro, Ginkgo biloba leaves extract (GBLE) was found with the most potent SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activity (IC50 = 6.68 µg/mL). Inhibition assays demonstrated that the ginkgolic acids (GAs) and the bioflavones isolated from GBLE displayed relatively strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities (IC50 < 10 µM). Among all tested constituents, GA C15:0, GA C17:1 and sciadopitysin displayed potent 3CLpro inhibition activities, with IC50 values of less than 2 µM. Further inhibition kinetic studies and docking simulations clearly demonstrated that two GAs and sciadopitysin strongly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 3CLprovia a reversible and mixed inhibition manner. Collectively, this study found that both GBLE and the major constituents in this herbal product exhibit strong SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibition activities, which offer several promising leading compounds for developing novel anti-COVID-19 medications via targeting on 3CLpro.","Xiong, Yuan; Zhu, Guang-Hao; Wang, Hao-Nan; Hu, Qing; Chen, Li-Li; Guan, Xiao-Qing; Li, Hui-Liang; Chen, Hong-Zhuan; Tang, Hui; Ge, Guang-Bo",Fitoterapia,186,20

Methods: We analyzed all patients undergoing PPCI <24 hours STEMI included in the prospective France PCI registry. The 2 groups were compared on mean monthly number of patients, delays in the pathway care, and in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE: death, stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, unplanned coronary revascularization, stroke, and major bleeding). Results: From January 15, 2019 to April 14, 2020, 2064 STEMI patients undergoing PPCI were included: 1942 in the prelockdown group and 122 in the lockdown group. Only 2 cases in the lockdown group were positive for COVID-19. A significant drop (12%) in mean number of STEMI/month was observed in the lockdown group compared with prelockdown (139 vs 122, P < 0.04). A significant increase in ""symptom onset to first medical contact"" delay was found for patients who presented directly to the emergency department (ED) (238 minutes vs 450 minutes; P = 0.04). There were higher rates of in-hospital MACE (7.7% vs 12.3%; P = 0.06) and mortality (4.9% vs 8.2%; P = 0.11) in the lockdown group but the differences were not significant. Conclusion: According to the multicenter France PCI registry, the COVID-19 outbreak in France was associated with a significant decline in STEMI undergoing PPCI and longer transfer time for patients who presented directly to the ED.

However, investigation of COVID-19 severity indicators across the population might help to design more precise strategies, balancing the need to keep people safe and to reduce the socio-economic burden of generalized restriction precedures. Here, we propose a method for age-sex population-adjusted analysis of disease severity in epidemics that has the advantage to use simple and repeatable variables, which are daily or weekly available. This allows to monitor the effect of public health policies in short term, and to repeat these calculations over time to surveille epidemic dynamics and impact. Our method can help to define a risk-categorization of likeliness to develop a severe COVID-19 disease which requires intensive care or is indicative of a higher risk of dying. Indeed, analysis of suitable open-access COVID-19 data in three European countries indicates that individuals in the 0-40 age interval and females under 60 are significantly less likely to develop a severe condition and die, whereas males equal or above 60 are more likely at risk of severe disease and death.

For that reason, we conducted a study using a phenomenographic approach in order to understand how university students perceive COVID-19 and the associated lockdown. Data were collected from 25 students in Pakistan. They were asked to demonstrate the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in illustrations. In addition, in-depth interviews were conducted with these students, to gain further insights into their perspectives on the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis revealed four interlinked directions for understanding students' experiences. These themes were: 1) escape into peace, 2) hope for personal freedom, 3) fear of becoming a victim of COVID-19, and 4) concerns regarding education, future career, and opportunities. All four themes were analyzed and condensed into an outcome space, which further gathers the perceptions of students under one theme as ""Hope for life while paradoxically living with fear"". Studying the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on students not only highlighted their concerns, but also emphasized the importance of starting regular psychological evaluations and stress-releasing sessions, along with online education to overcome growing depression.","Shahbaz, Sumbal; Ashraf, Muhammad Zeshan; Zakar, Rubeena; Fischer, Florian; Zakar, Muhammad Zakria",PLoS One,186,15

It is caused by a new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is imperative for relapsing current antiviral therapeutics owing to randomized genetic drift in global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A molecular mechanism behind the emerging genomic variants is not yet understood for the prioritization of selective antivirals. The present computational study was aimed to repurpose existing antivirals for Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by uncovering a hijack mechanism based on structural and functional characteristics of protein variants. Forty-one protein mutations were identified in 12 Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by analysis of genome variations across 460 genome sequences obtained from 30 geographic sites in India. Two unique mutations such as W6152R and N5928H found in exonuclease of Surat (GBRC275b) and Gandhinagar (GBRC239) isolates. We report for the first time the impact of folding rate on stabilizing/retaining a sequence-structure-function-virulence link of emerging protein variants leading to accommodate hijack ability from current antivirals. Binding affinity analysis revealed the effect of point mutations on virus infectivity and the drug-escaping efficiency of Indian isolates. Emodin and artinemol suggested herein as repurposable antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients infected with Indian isolates. Our study concludes that a protein folding rate is a key structural and evolutionary determinant to enhance the receptor-binding specificity and ensure hijack ability from the prevalent antiviral therapeutics.,"Prathiviraj, R; Saranya, S; Bharathi, M; Chellapandi, P",Comput Biol Med,186,20

B.1.1.7 has been detected in over 30 countries, including the United States. As of January 13, 2021, approximately 76 cases of B.1.1.7 have been detected in 12 U.S. states. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that B.1.1.7 is more efficiently transmitted than are other SARS-CoV-2 variants (1-3). The modeled trajectory of this variant in the U.S. exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March. Increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission might threaten strained health care resources, require extended and more rigorous implementation of public health strategies (4), and increase the percentage of population immunity required for pandemic control. Taking measures to reduce transmission now can lessen the potential impact of B.1.1.7 and allow critical time to increase vaccination coverage. Collectively, enhanced genomic surveillance combined with continued compliance with effective public health measures, including vaccination, physical distancing, use of masks, hand hygiene, and isolation and quarantine, will be essential to limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Strategic testing of persons without symptoms but at higher risk of infection, such as those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 or who have frequent unavoidable contact with the public, provides another opportunity to limit ongoing spread.","Galloway, Summer E; Paul, Prabasaj; MacCannell, Duncan R; Johansson, Michael A; Brooks, John T; MacNeil, Adam; Slayton, Rachel B; Tong, Suxiang; Silk, Benjamin J; Armstrong, Gregory L; Biggerstaff, Matthew; Dugan, Vivien G",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,186,4

Knowledge about people's lived experiences regarding COVID-19 vaccination can enhance vaccine promotion and increase uptake. AIM: To use COVID-19 vaccine trial participants' experiences to identify key themes in the lived experience of vaccination early in the vaccine approval and distribution process. METHODS: We interviewed 31 participants in the Iowa City, Iowa US site of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine phase 3 clinical trial. While trial participation differs from clinical receipt of an approved vaccine in key ways, it offers the first view of people's lived experiences of potentially receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. The trial context is also useful since decision-making about vaccination and medical research participation often involve similar hopes and concerns, and because the public appears to view even approved COVID-19 vaccines as experimental given their novelty. Semi-structured interviews addressed subjects' experiences, including decision-making and telling others about their trial participation. We analyzed verbatim transcripts of these interviews thematically and identified common themes relevant for vaccination decision-making. RESULTS: Participants across demographic groups, including age, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation, described largely similar experiences. Key motivations for participation included ending the pandemic/restoring normalcy, protecting oneself and others, doing one's duty, promoting/modeling vaccination, and expressing aspects of identity like being a helper, career-related motivations, and support of science/vaccines. Participants often felt uniquely qualified to help via trial participation due to personal attributes like health, sex/gender or race/ethnicity. They reported hearing concerns about side effects and the speed and politicization of vaccine development. Participants responded by normalizing and contextualizing side effects, de-politicizing vaccine development, and explaining how the rapid development process was nevertheless safe. CONCLUSION: These findings regarding participants' reported motivations for trial participation and interactions with concerned others can be incorporated into COVID-19 vaccine promotion messaging aimed at similar populations.","Wentzell, Emily; Racila, Ana-Monica",Vaccine,186,9

One of the biggest unanswered questions is why some develop severe disease, whilst others do not. Insight on the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the immune system and the contribution of dysfunctional immune responses to disease progression will be instrumental to the understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis, risk factors for worst outcome, and rational design of effective therapies and vaccines. In this review we have gathered the knowledge available thus far on the epidemiology of SARS-COV-2 infection, focusing on the susceptibility of older individuals, SARS-CoV-2-host cell interaction during infection and the immune response directed at SARS-CoV-2. Dendritic cells act as crucial messengers linking innate and adaptative immunity against viral infections. Thus, this review also brings a focused discussion on the role of dendritic cells and their immune functions during SARS-CoV-2 infection and how immune evasion strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and advancing age mediate dendritic cell dysfunctions that contribute to COVID-19 pathogenesis and increased susceptibility to worst outcomes. This review brings to light the hypothesis that concomitant occurrence of dendritic cell dysfunction/cytopathic effects induced by SARS-CoV-2 and/or aging may influence disease outcome in the elderly. Lastly, a detailed discussion on the effects and mechanisms of action of drugs currently being tested for COVID-19 on the function of dendritic cells is also provided.","Borges, Rodrigo Cerqueira; Hohmann, Miriam Sayuri; Borghi, Sergio Marques",Int Rev Immunol,186,26

This study aims to assess the spread and frequency of protective behaviors, emotional and anxiety status among the Turkish population using a rapid survey during the COVID-19 outbreak. An online questionnaire was administered to 3,040 respondents between the ages of 18–30. This cross-sectional study was conducted from Apr 2 to Apr 8, 2020. While questions related to the outbreak were created by members of our neuroscience department, the Turkish version of the Abbreviated Beck Anxiety Inventory was included in our survey to measure anxiety status. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for statistical analysis. We found that 90% of respondents report washing hands more frequently since the outbreak while %50 wear protective gloves. Respondents were more fearful of their relatives catching the coronavirus disease than they were of themselves catching it. In response to the question, “What are your emotions about the coronavirus?”, 38% responded with “worried”. There was a significant correlation between anxiety status and consumption information from the media about COVID-19. Individual early protection behaviors might slow transmission of the outbreak. Our results showed that the behavior of the participants has changed in predictable ways during the COVID-19 outbreak. Understanding how emotional responses such as fear and anxiety status vary and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of outbreak control strategies.","Akdeniz, Gulsum; Kavakci, Mariam; Gozugok, Muharrem; Yalcinkaya, Semiha; Kucukay, Alper; Sahutogullari, Bilal",Front.

In order to identify such cleavages within the ORF1 polyprotein mediated by 3CLpro, the proteinase was expressed in bacteria, purified and used in trans cleavage assays with polyprotein fragments lacking the 3CLP domain as targets. The proteinase was expressed as a polyprotein fragment which was able to process during expression in bacterial cells, releasing mature 3CLpro. A histidine (His(6)) tag was introduced close to the C-terminus of the proteinase to aid purification. Processing demonstrated by the tagged proteinase was indistinguishable from that of the wild-type enzyme indicating that the site chosen for the tag was permissive. From these studies we were able to demonstrate trans cleavages consistent with the use of most of the previously predicted or identified sites within the open reading frame of gene 1.

Analysis by hybridization kinetics of the annealing between A59 [32P]cDNA and infected cell RNA from the other four MHV strains demonstrated 70–80% homology. By gel transfer analysis, the A59 [32P]cDNA was able to detect subgenomic-size virus-specific RNAs in cells infected with all of the five MHV strains. A similar pattern of seven viral RNAs was detected in cells infected with A59, MHV-1, MHV-3, and JHM. In contrast, cells infected with MHV-S contained seven virus-specific RNAs, of which only the two smallest species comigrated with RNAs from the other four strains.

Although the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively controlled in China and many areas have gradually resumed work and classes, orthodontic participants are still under high risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This is due to the asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 or patients in the incubation period may cause the cross infection between orthodontic practitioners and patients. The close proximity between the practitioners and the patients, and the generation of droplets and aerosols that contain saliva and blood during treatment further increase the risks of transmission.

METHODS: Caregiver proxies (n = 200) participated in a cross-sectional, online survey investigating the impact of COVID-19 on reported food and eating behaviors of children, ages 2–17 y. Logistic regression models were used to assess the magnitude of association of a change in the child's eating behaviors and in food availability, overall and by household income and food security status. RESULTS: A majority of respondents reported a moderate-to-large impact on their child's eating behaviors (57%) since the onset of COVID-19, and 65% reported unavailability of their child's preferred foods. Increased risk of a moderate-to-large impact on children's eating behaviors was associated with shelter regulations compared with no regulations (OR: 2.30; 95% CI: 1.12, 4.72), food insecurity compared with security status (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.45, 4.67), and household income of <$50,000 compared with ≥$100,000 (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.02, 5.29). The pandemic also amplified the risk of food unavailability by household food security status (food insecure vs. secure; OR: 4.13; 95% CI: 2.12, 7.69) and across income levels (<$50,000 vs. ≥$100,000; OR: 3.48; 95% CI: 1.42, 8.55; and $50,000 to <$100,000 vs. ≥$100,000; OR: 4.00; 95% CI: 1.71, 9.34). Reported frequencies of consumption of meat, seafood, vegetables, and 100% fruit juice significantly decreased among the children post-onset of COVID-19, while frequency of consumption of sweets increased. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of caregivers reported substantial COVID-19 impacts on food availability and eating behaviors of children with ASD, especially among low-resource dyads. This study highlights the added burden of existing disparities due to the pandemic on children living with ASD.","Panjwani, Anita A; Bailey, Regan L; Kelleher, Bridgette L",Curr Dev Nutr,186,26

Emerging evidence shows that COVID-19 leads to a prothrombotic state and its association with pulmonary thromboembolism is well established. However, clinicians and the vascular community, in particular, should watch out for the nonpulmonary targets of this lethal virus as the failure to do so could give rise to disastrous consequences. The significance of raised D-dimer levels, whether it translates into thrombotic events for all patients and the need for universal oral anticoagulation postdischarge are issues that need urgent answers.

Some studies have suggested. It is hypothesized that estrogen hormone may decrease susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2.) OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the gender differences in SARS CoV-2 outcomes and to analyze if there are any differences in outcomes in premenopausal females compared to postmenopausal females. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients tested positive for SARS CoV-2 through real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction by Thermo Fischer Taqpath assay approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research were included in the study. The data obtained was analyzed for the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics from their medical records. RESULTS: The mortality rate in females was 12.6%, whereas mortality in males was 19.4%. In between-group analysis, 8.6% (16/185) of females died in premenopausal age group versus 12.8% (27/211) in postmenopausal group. The proportion of females who expired due to COVID significantly differ by age and postmenopausal status X2 (1, n = 293) = 7.2, the P value is 0.007. The difference is statistically significant at P < 0.05. Postmenopausal women were more likely to expire due to COVID-19 infection compared to premenopausal women. CONCLUSION: The mortality rate in postmenopausal age group was greater than mortality in premenopausal females emphasizing the protection provided by estrogens hormone in them. Postmenopausal women are also at higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection than premenopausal women. Mortality is greater in males compared to females, further strengthening the role of estrogens.","Garg, Ruchika; Agrawal, Prabhat; Gautam, Ashish; Pursnani, Nikhil; Agarwal, Mohita; Agarwal, Arti; Parihar, Avantika; Pandey, Anjana",J Midlife Health,186,26

It is important to know how members of the general public think about this issue. For one, knowledge about the public's standpoint can help resolve important questions where ethical considerations are by themselves not sufficient, for instance whether the patient's age should matter. It can also help identify if more communication with the public about medical ethics is needed. We study how members of the Swiss public would allocate intensive medical care among COVID-19 patients using data from two original conjoint survey experiments conducted in Switzerland in the context of the first and second pandemic waves in 2020 (N = 1457 & N = 1450). We find that our participants would not base triage decisions on the patient's age. However, they do give much importance to the patient's behavior prior and during illness, discriminate against non-nationals, and assign only a relatively small and inconsistent role to medical considerations. Our findings suggest that there is a need for more communication with the public about the ethics of medical triage.","Knotz, Carlo Michael; Gandenberger, Mia Katharina; Fossati, Flavia; Bonoli, Giuliano",Soc Sci Med,186,16

Germany is currently facing the so-called third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is exacerbated by emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) mutants with increased virus transmission and severe courses of disease. Rising numbers of SARS-CoV‑2 infections translate into an increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care, which interacts with limited structural and personnel resources for COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 critically ill patients. Therefore, prioritization and triage for critically ill patients with allocation of intensive care capacities becomes necessary, as with all situations with higher strain on capacities. Both strategies are meaningful forms of organization and are not to be equated with a collapse of medical care. Cardiovascular comorbidities and cardiac involvement in COVID-19 are of particular importance for disease severity and the clinical course. In addition to the medical care of patients with SARS-CoV‑2 infections due to the pandemic, other patients with acute sometimes life-threatening diseases must also continue to receive high-quality treatment. This article provides a current overview of proposed restructuring measures in German hospitals as well as the accompanying triage and prioritization algorithms. Moreover, it is necessary to adapt existing treatment algorithms to the pandemic situation. Due their special importance this is sketched using cardiovascular diseases as an example.","Velichkov, Marija; Schulze, P. Christian; Otto, Sylvia",Internist (Berl),186,21

METHODS: All patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from Jan to Apr 2020were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory test results were obtained from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into three groups based on antibody production, and compared for laboratory test results. RESULTS: Of 73 patients aged11–82 years, 12 (16.4%), 28 (38.4%), 25 (34.2%) and 8 (11.0%)were ≤ 30, 31–50, 51–70,and ≥ 71 years old, respectively. Thirty-four (46.6%) patients were male. Most individuals had mild symptoms, and no patient died during treatment. All patients were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in sputum and nasopharyngeal samples, and 40 (54.8%) were also tested positive in stool. Nine(12.3%) patients were re-positivefor SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) after discharge. Sixty-five (89.0%) patients had IgM or IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.Among the four age groups, there was no difference in IgG antibody production (P = 0.664).CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 cell counts between the antibody producing and non-producing groups showed no significant differences (all P > 0.05).The antibodies disappeared within two months in four patients. Lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, IL-6, lactate dehydrogenase, alanine aminotransferase, creatinine and D-Dimer levels were similar in the three groups (all P > 0.05).

The spike glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus mediates its entry into host cells and is the target of all current antibody design efforts to neutralize the virus. The glycan shield of the spike helps the virus to evade the human immune response by providing a thick sugar-coated barrier against any antibody. To study the dynamic motion of glycans in the spike protein, we performed microsecond-long MD simulation in two different states that correspond to the receptor binding domain in open or closed conformations. Analysis of this microsecond-long simulation revealed a scissoring motion on the N-terminal domain of neighboring monomers in the spike trimer. Role of multiple glycans in shielding of spike protein in different regions were uncovered by a network analysis, where the high betweenness centrality of glycans at the apex revealed their importance and function in the glycan shield. Microdomains of glycans were identified featuring a high degree of intra-communication in these microdomains. An antibody overlap analysis revealed the glycan microdomains as well as individual glycans that inhibit access to the antibody epitopes on the spike protein. Overall, the results of this study provide detailed understanding of the spike glycan shield, which may be utilized for therapeutic efforts against this crisis.","Ghorbani, Mahdi; Brooks, Bernard R.; Klauda, Jeffery B.",Biophys J,186,16

This mandated further search and exploration of more possible anti-TB drug candidates against M. tuberculosis strains. As an extension of our previous work on the homology modeled cytochrome b subunit of the bc1 complex (QcrB) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, an in-silico design was carried out in order to further explore more newly potential anti-TB compounds. Ligand 26 was selected as the lead template (scaffold A) based on our previous docking results and its less bulky structure. Successively, eight (8) new ligands (A1–A8) were designed with better binding affinities in comparison to the scaffold template (−6.8 kcal/mol) and isoniazid standard drug (−6.00 kcal/mol) respectively. In addition, three (3) designed ligands namely, A6, A2, and A7 with higher binding affinities were validated via ADME and toxicity prediction analysis, and the results showed zero violations of Lipinski rules with similar bioavailability, and high rate in gastrointestinal absorption, while toxicity parameters such as carcinogenicity and cytotoxicity were all predicted as non-toxic (inactiveness). The designed IPA compounds in the present study could serve as a promising gateway that could help the medicinal and synthetic chemist in the exploration of a new set of derivatives as anti-TB agents.

We investigated the NAD(H) redox status of AM from SP-A2 and SP-A knockout (KO) mice in response to O(3) or filtered air (control) exposure using optical redox imaging technique. We found: (i) In SP-A2 mice, the redox alteration of AM in response to O(3) showed sex-dependence with AM from males being significantly more oxidized and having a higher level of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species than females; (ii) AM from KO mice were more oxidized after O(3) exposure and showed no sex differences; (iii) AM from female KO mice were more oxidized than female SP-A2 mice; and (iv) Two distinct subpopulations characterized by size and redox status were observed in a mouse AM sample. In conclusions, the NAD(H) redox balance in AM responds to O(3) in a sex-dependent manner and the innate immune molecule, SP-A2, contributes to this observed sex-specific redox response.","Xu, He N.; Lin, Zhenwu; Gandhi, Chintan K.; Amatya, Shaili; Wang, Yunhua; Li, Lin Z.; Floros, Joanna",Antioxidants (Basel),186,26

Reports suggested that near 1–3% of COVID‐19 cases have a fatal outcome. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in hypertension, heart failure and chronic kidney disease. These drugs have been reported to upregulate angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which produces Ang (1–7), the main counter-regulatory mediator of angiotensin II.

The present study aimed to systematically review the relationship between ACEI/ARB administration and ACE2 expression in experimental models. After a comprehensive search and selection, 27 animal studies investigating ACE2 expression in the context of ACEI and ARB were identified. The majority of these papers reported increased ACE2 levels in response to ACEI/ARB treatment. This result should be interpreted in the light of the dual role of ACE2 being a promoter of viral entry to cells and a protective factor against oxidative damage in the lungs.","Kriszta, Gábor; Kriszta, Zsófia; Váncsa, Szilárd; Hegyi, Péter Jenő; Frim, Levente; Erőss, Bálint; Hegyi, Péter; Pethő, Gábor; Pintér, Erika",Front Pharmacol,186,28

The purpose of this article is to evaluate psychological and sociodemographic characteristics associated with compliance or noncompliance of individuals with these practices in two different phases of the pandemic experience in Brazil: in the first month and after three months. Participants for the first phase of the study were recruited through advertisements in the media and social networks. 1,914 individuals aged between 14 and 81 years agreed to participate, 78.2% of these were women, from 25 Federative Units in Brazil. In the second phase, 761 individuals who participated in the first phase, were reassessed. The authors used the following instruments for data collection: a standardized questionnaire collecting information of sociodemographic characteristics and dynamics of social isolation; the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; the Life Satisfaction Scale; the Positive and Negative Affections Scale; and the Reduced Personality Markers and Stress Mindset Scale. All instruments used presented evidence of validity and adequate reliability indexes. The comparison of categorical exploratory variables with motives for following social isolation protocols was performed using Pearson’s Chi-square, and the comparison of continuous exploratory variables was performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Covariance Analysis was performed using as covariates those that showed significance/effect on isolation in previous analyses. The results showed that respondents practicing social isolation to comply with governmental recommendations had lower scores on the scales of neuroticism and conscientiousness. They reported also less stress, anxiety, and depression, and less general distress. Overall, these respondents also displayed more positive affect, and tended to reframe stress in a more positive way than others. These preliminary results describe the psychological characteristics of individuals and their associations with social behaviors in a period of collective stress and high social risk.","Zanini, Daniela Sacramento; Peixoto, Evandro Morais; de Andrade, Josemberg Moura; Tramonte, Lucia",Front Sociol,186,14

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A total of 914 university students, ranged in age between 18 and 40 years old (M = 23.04, SD = 2.60), participated in an online survey. The study was performed between 30 March and 30 April 2020, during the general coronavirus quarantine. Participants completed a standard psychological questionnaire, including General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), General Self-Rated Health (GSRH), Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS). RESULTS: The majority of students (65%) showed mild to severe GAD and a high level of perceived stress (56%). Those students who had the worst evaluated current GSRH, in comparison to the situation before the COVID-19 outbreak, also demonstrated higher levels of anxiety, perceived stress, and emotion-oriented coping styles. The study indicates that the variance of anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak may be explained for about 60% by such variables, like high stress, low general self-rated health, female gender, and frequent use of both emotion-oriented and task-oriented coping styles. CONCLUSION: University students experience extremely high stress and anxiety during quarantine period and they need professional help to cope with COVID-19 pandemic. The results of this study may help prepare appropriate future intervention and effective prevention programs at universities.","Rogowska, Aleksandra M; Kuśnierz, Cezary; Bokszczanin, Anna",Psychol Res Behav Manag,186,33

As a result, TPCs are emerging as important drug targets. However, their pharmacology is ill-defined. There are no approved drugs to target them. And their mechanism of ligand activation is largely unknown. Here, we identify a number of FDA-approved drugs as TPC pore blockers. Using a model of the pore of human TPC2 based on recent structures of mammalian TPCs, we virtually screened a database of ~1500 approved drugs. Because TPCs have recently emerged as novel host factors for Ebola virus entry, we reasoned that Ebola virus entry inhibitors may exert their effects through inhibition of TPCs. Cross-referencing hits from the TPC virtual screen with two recent high throughput anti-Ebola screens yielded approved drugs targeting dopamine and estrogen receptors as common hits. These compounds inhibited endogenous NAADP-evoked Ca(2+) release from sea urchin egg homogenates, NAADP-mediated channel activity of TPC2 re-routed to the plasma membrane, and PI(3,5)P(2)-mediated channel activity of TPC2 expressed in enlarged lysosomes. Mechanistically, single channel analyses showed that the drugs reduced mean open time consistent with a direct action on the pore. Functionally, drug potency in blocking TPC2 activity correlated with inhibition of Ebola virus-like particle entry. Our results expand TPC pharmacology through the identification of approved drugs as novel blockers, support a role for TPCs in Ebola virus entry, and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying channel regulation.

Science explains the mechanisms of such transport and there is evidence that this is a significant route of infection in indoor environments. Despite this, no countries or authorities consider airborne spread of COVID-19 in their regulations to prevent infections transmission indoors. It is therefore extremely important, that the national authorities acknowledge the reality that the virus spreads through air, and recommend that adequate control measures be implemented to prevent further spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, in particularly removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation.","Morawska, Lidia; Cao, Junji",Environ Int,186,8

The feedback loop between COVID-19-associated coagulopathy and vitamin D also involves platelets (PLTs), since vitamin D deficiency stimulates PLT activation and aggregation and increases fibrinolysis and thrombosis. Vitamin D and PLTs share and play specific roles not only in coagulation and thrombosis but also during inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and immune response. Additionally, another ‘fil rouge’ between vitamin D and PLTs is represented by their role in mineral metabolism and bone health, since vitamin D deficiency, low PLT count, and altered PLT-related parameters are linked to abnormal bone remodeling in certain pathological conditions, such as osteoporosis (OP). Hence, it is possible to speculate that severe COVID-19 patients are characterized by the presence of several predisposing factors to bone fragility and OP that may be monitored to avoid potential complications. Here, we hypothesize different pervasive actions of vitamin D and PLT association in COVID-19, also allowing for potential preliminary information on bone health status during COVID-19 infection.","Salamanna, Francesca; Maglio, Melania; Sartori, Maria; Landini, Maria Paola; Fini, Milena",Int J Mol Sci,186,16

We found, based on the adjusted data, the highest value in infected people according to official and theoretical data. Furthermore, using a geographical analysis based on geostatistical measures related to density of demographic and economic data, traffic level and geolocation, raster files were generated to estimate probability of coronavirus cases occurrence using the areas where the contagion may occur. We also distributed the maximum contagion obtained by the epidemic model, using these raster files, and a regression model to weight factors according their importance.

However, there has been relatively limited electrophysiology data to contextualize these specific concerns and to understand their associated clinical factors. Our objective was to identify EEG abnormalities present in patients with SARS-CoV-2, and to determine whether they reflect new or preexisting brain pathology. Methods We studied a consecutive series of hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 who received an EEG, obtained using tailored safety protocols. Data from EEG reports and clinical records were analyzed to identify EEG abnormalities and possible clinical associations, including neurologic symptoms, new or preexisting brain pathology, and sedation practices. Results We identified 37 patients with SARS-CoV-2 who underwent EEG, of whom 14 had epileptiform findings (38%). Patients with epileptiform findings were more likely to have preexisting brain pathology (6/14, 43%) than patients without epileptiform findings (2/23, 9%; p=0.042). There were no clear differences in rates of acute brain pathology. One case of nonconvulsive status epilepticus was captured, but was not clearly a direct consequence of SARS-CoV-2. Abnormalities of background rhythms were common, and patients recently sedated were more likely to lack a posterior dominant rhythm (p=0.022). Conclusions Epileptiform abnormalities were common in patients with SARS-CoV-2 referred for EEG, but particularly in the context of preexisting brain pathology and sedation. These findings suggest that neurologic manifestations during SARS-CoV-2 infection may not solely relate to the infection itself, but rather may also reflect patients' broader, preexisting neurologic vulnerabilities.","Ayub, N.; Cohen, J.; Jing, J.; Jain, A.; Tesh, R.; Mukerji, S.

The objective of this study was to examine the effect of atopy on the course of disease in children hospitalised with viral pneumonia. METHODS: Children between the ages of 1 and 6 years hospitalised due to viral pneumonia between the years of 2013 and 2016 were included to this multicentre study. Patients were classified into two groups as mild–moderate and severe according to the course of pneumonia. Presence of atopy was evaluated with skin prick tests. Groups were compared to evaluate the risk factors associated with severe viral pneumonia. RESULTS: A total of 280 patients from nine centres were included in the study. Of these patients, 163 (58.2%) were male. Respiratory syncytial virus (29.7%), Influenza A (20.5%), rhinovirus (18.9%), adenovirus (10%), human metapneumovirus (8%), parainfluenza (5.2%), coronavirus (6%), and bocavirus (1.6%) were isolated from respiratory samples.

We describe the change in neurosurgical workload at a tertiary neurosciences center in the United Kingdom after the first pandemic wave in comparison with the months before and during the first wave. METHODS: A retrospective review of theatre records and electronic referrals—between December 1, 2019, and August 31, 2020—was performed. The months of December 2019–February 2020 were designated as pre-COVID months and March–May 2020 were designated as COVID months. The time period from June to August 2020 was designated as post-wave months. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v22 (IBM). RESULTS: Referrals declined from 572 in January to a nadir of 352 in April before a steady rise to August. Referral volumes for degenerative spinal disease and traumatic brain injuries showed a statistically significant change during the year. On average, 212 procedures per month were performed in the pre-COVID months, 167 procedures per month during COVID months, and 232 procedures per month in the post-wave months. The number of patients on the waiting list for scheduled operations rose from March (785 patients) onward to a peak of 997 patients in July. CONCLUSIONS: In the aftermath of COVID-19, higher referral volumes and operative procedures were apparent in the post-wave months as services returned to normal.

DESIGN: Surveillance study. SETTING: Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)/WHO epidemiology reports on confirmed and suspected Zika virus infection and cases of CZS. PARTICIPANTS: Populations of 47 countries in the South and Central Americas, Mexico and the Caribbean. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of CZS cases per 1000 births (using 2016–2017 births as a denominator) and the number of CZS cases per 1000 births in women with Zika virus infection during pregnancy. RESULTS: By 4 January 2018, 548623 suspected and 239063 confirmed Zika virus infections had been reported to PAHO/WHO from 47 countries. In 25 countries, over 80% of infections were reported as suspected. There were 3617 confirmed CZS cases in 25 countries; 2952 (82%) had occurred in Brazil. The number of CZS cases per 1000 births varied considerably with Brazil and several Caribbean island communities (Puerto Rico, St Martin, Martinique, Guadeloupe and Grenada) having the highest CZS prevalence above 0.5 per 1000 births. Analysing the number of CZS cases per 1000 births in women infected with Zika virus during their pregnancy highlighted the inaccuracies of the data, with Venezuela likely to have had severe under-reporting of CZS. CONCLUSIONS: Expressing data on CZS in relation to total births, rather than as absolute numbers, better illustrates the burden of disease, providing that under-reporting of CZS is not too severe. Data on infections in pregnant women enable potential under-reporting of CZS to be identified. Both measures are recommended for future PAHO/WHO publications. Evidence of severe under-reporting of Zika virus infections and CZS makes interpretation of the data and comparisons between countries challenging.","Morris, Joan K; Dolk, Helen; Durán, Pablo; Orioli, Ieda Maria",BMJ Open,186,24

An understanding of the infectious processes affecting this area and how to diagnose them accurately is important.(17) Visits to physicians for symptomatic complaints related to possible infections of the oral cavity are a common occurrence. Not only is it important to accurately determine the entity causing an infectious syndrome so that appropriate therapy may be given, it is also important because these interactions with the healthcare system likely result in a large amount of unnecessary antibiotic prescribing. For example, a recent report by Mainous et al(41) found that 60% of over 2000 patients seeking medical care were given at least one of 19 different antimicrobial agents for acute nasopharyngitis (the common cold). Less than 2% had an accompanying bacterial sinusitis or otitis. Because the symptomatic complaints the authors described are nearly all secondary to viral infections, such antibiotic prescribing is not beneficial. Similarly, although chronic cough is often treated with antimicrobial agents, 90% is caused by smoking, postnasal drip, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and chronic bronchitis.(50) None of these latter conditions are usually responsive to antimicrobial therapy. Data collected in the United States between 1980 and 1994 for persons presenting with a complaint of cough found that antibiotic prescription rose from 59% of visits in 1980 to 70% in 1994.(44) Interestingly, clinical characteristics did not appear to be the major influence in such prescriptions.(44) Infections related to the oral cavity are important from two very different perspectives. First, when they occur within the oral cavity, the result frequently is significant morbidity (pain), such as with pharyngitis, stomatitis, and even dental caries. The intraoral infectious syndromes and their management are diverse. For example, dental caries is a major medical and economic problem, typically associated with infection by Streptococcus mutans(17); however, specific microbiologic evaluation is rarely done or needed for caries. Pharyngitis is also common, but only a very few inciting microbes require specific treatment. Other local infections, such as candidiasis (thrush), actinomycosis, and sexually transmitted diseases, occur less frequently, but all require therapy. Second, an infectious disease from mouth origin can present at a distant site, resulting in both morbidity and mortality. These range from sinusitis, where the connection to the oral cavity is direct, to infections like endocarditis, where oral microbes travel through the vascular system to reach their final site of infection. The infectious diseases associated with the oral cavity have their own unique, often mixed, microbiology, making culture detection of a specific organism linked to a given episode of infection frequently complicated. Because infections in this area most often arise from normally resident flora, it is important to first understand what microbes are often found here. Nonhemolytic streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, micrococci, Corynebacterium spp (aerobic diphtheroids), Neisseria spp (other than N. meningitidis or N. gonorrhoeae), spirochetes, Lactobacillus, and Veillonella spp are nonpathogenic organisms frequently present. Additionally, β-hemolytic streptococci, viridans streptococci, Peptostreptococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, N. meningitidis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Mycoplasma spp, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Fusobacterium spp, Mycobacterium spp other than tuberculosis (MOTT), Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter spp, Pseudomonas spp, Klebsiella ozaenae, Eikenella corrodens, Bacteroides spp, Actinomyces spp, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Candida albicans, filamentous fungi, and even Cryptococcus neoformans may be recovered from the oral cavity as pathogens or commensals. The best diagnostic approach is to begin with a careful history and physical examination, followed by specific laboratory testing, to detect the suspected pathogens.

We present recent methodology development on addressing these issues and illustrate design and analysis approaches that might be enhanced to provide robust inference from platform trials. We also discuss the implication of changing the control arm, how patient eligibility for different arms may complicate the trial design and analysis, and how operational bias may arise when revealing some results of the trials. Lastly, we comment on the appropriateness and the application of platform trials in phase II and phase III settings, as well as publicly versus industry-funded trials.

Among the therapeutic options available, long-acting corticosteroids are frequently used due to their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Although they may improve the clinical symptoms, they can lead to a progressive form of the disease that becomes refractory to treatment. Furthermore, their direct relationship with type II diabetes mellitus (DM) is well known. Consequently, these drugs are controversial and not recommended for routine management of FCGS. Recombinant feline interferon-omega (rFeIFN-ω) is an immunomodulatory compound. Recently, its daily oral administration has been shown to be successful in treating refractory cases of FCGS. This case study describes two clinical cases of type II DM complicated by FCGS. Both animals were calicivirus positive and they had been previously treated with long-acting corticosteroids, which may have been the major cause of DM. The two cats were treated with glargine insulin (Lantus, starting dose 1 IU/cat twice daily (BID)), achieving remission 10 and 18 weeks later respectively. Considering the difficulty with control of FCGS in these animals, an oral daily dose of rFeIFN-ω was started as an alternative to long-acting corticosteroids. In both cats oral clinical signs gradually improved and 60 days after the start of therapy the owners reported a significant relief of pain during mastication. According to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case report that describes the successful use of rFeIFN-ω in the management of FCGS in type II diabetic cats, in which long-acting corticosteroids are contraindicated.","Leal, Rodolfo O; Gil, Solange; Brito, Maria TV; McGahie, David; Niza, Maria MRE; Tavares, Luís",Ir Vet J,186,11

For this faeces and/or ascites samples from 19 cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) as well as from 20 FECV-infected healthy cats were used. Sequence comparisons revealed that 3c genes of animals with FIP were heavily affected by nucleotide deletions and point mutations compared to animals infected with FECV; these alterations resulted either in early termination or destruction of the translation initiation codon. Two ascites-derived samples of cats with FIP which displayed no alterations of ORF3c harboured mutations in the S2 domain of the S protein gene which resulted in amino acid exchanges or deletions. Moreover, changes in 3c were often accompanied by mutations in S2. In contrast, in samples obtained from faeces of healthy cats, the ORF3c was never affected by such mutations. Similarly ORF3c from faecal samples of the cats with FIP was mostly intact and showed only in a few cases the same mutations found in the respective ascites samples. The genes encoding 3a, 3b, 7a and 7b displayed no mutations linked to the feline coronavirus (FCoV) biotype. The M protein gene was found to be conserved between FECV and FIPV samples. Our findings suggest that mutations of 3c and spike protein genes correlate with the occurrence of FIP.","Bank-Wolf, Barbara Regina; Stallkamp, Iris; Wiese, Svenja; Moritz, Andreas; Tekes, Gergely; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen",Vet Microbiol,186,1

Effects of lockdown time and rate on the progression of an epidemic incidence curve in a virtual closed population of 10 thousand subjects. Predictor variables were R0 values established in the most recent literature (2.7 and 5.7), without lockdown and with coverages of 25%, 50%, and 90% for 21, 35, 70, and 140 days in 13 different scenarios for each R0, where individuals remained infected and transmitters for 14 days. We estimated model validity by applying an exponential model on the incidence curve with no lockdown, with growth rate coefficient observed in realistic scenarios. Pairwise comparisons were performed using Wilcoxon test with Bonferroni correction between peak amplitude, peak latency, and total number of cases for each R0 used. For R0=5.7, the flattening of the curve occurs only with long lockdown periods (70 and 140 days) with a 90% coverage. For R0=2.7, coverages of 25 and 50% also result in curve flattening and reduction of total cases, provided they occur for a long period (70 days or more). Short and soft lockdowns had no relevant effect on incidence or casuistry. These data corroborate the importance of lockdown duration regardless of virus transmission.","Abramov, D. M.; Gomes, S.

Acute liver failure (ALF) is a lethal clinical syndrome that occurs due to severe damage of the liver function. In the present study, the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of kaempferol in ALF were evaluated. An ALF mouse model was established using D-galactosamine (D-GalN; 700 mg/kg)/lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 µg/kg). A total of 2 h before the administration of D-GalN/LPS, mice were pretreated with different doses of kaempferol (2.5, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), and 6 h after injection of D-GalN/LPS, mice were euthanized. The survival rate, liver function and levels of inflammatory cytokines were assessed. The results demonstrated that kaempferol pretreatment protected hepatocytes from ALF induced by D-GalN/LPS via regulation of the autophagy pathway, both in vivo and in vitro. Pretreatment with a high dose of kaempferol significantly decreased the survival rates and increased severe liver damage; however, pretreatment with a low dose of kaempferol had the opposite effect. Furthermore, pretreatment with a high dose of kaempferol enhanced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines [TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-1β, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)-2, CXCL-10] and markers of the MAPK signaling pathway [phosphorylated (p)-JNK, p-ERK, p-p38], whereas pretreatment with a low dose of kaempferol had the opposite effect. Pretreatment with a high dose of kaempferol decreased autophagy, whereas pretreatment with a low dose of kaempferol increased autophagy in vivo and in vitro. It was also shown that pretreatment with 3-methyadenine or autophagy related 7 small interfering RNA, to inhibit autophagy, partially abrogated the hepatoprotective effects of pretreatment with 5 mg/kg kaempferol in the ALF mouse model. These results demonstrate that the effects of different doses of kaempferol on D-GalN/LPS-induced ALF varies based on the dose, and that kaempferol exerted its effects via regulation of the autophagy pathway.","Tian, Yuan; Ren, Feng; Xu, Ling; Zhang, Xiangying",Mol Med Rep,186,21

We performed a head-to-head assessment of enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and point-of-care lateral flow assays (POCTs) to detect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies. Demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, treatment, and mortality of patients whose sera were used were also reviewed. Six EIAs (Abbott, Affinity, Bio-Rad, DiaSorin, Euroimmun, and Roche) and six POCTs (BTNX, Biolidics, Deep Blue, Genrui, Getein BioTech, and Innovita) were evaluated for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in known COVID-19-infected individuals. Sensitivity of EIAs ranged from 50 to 100%, with only four assays having overall sensitivities of >95% after 21 days after symptom onset. Notably, cross-reactivity with other respiratory viruses (parainfluenza virus [PIV-4] [n = 5], human metapneumovirus [hMPV] [n = 3], rhinovirus/enterovirus [n = 1], CoV-229E [n = 2], CoV-NL63 [n = 2], and CoV-OC43 [n = 2]) was observed; however, overall specificity of EIAs was good (92 to 100%; all but one assay had specificity above 95%). POCTs were 0 to 100% sensitive >21 days after onset, with specificity ranging from 96 to 100%. However, many POCTs had faint banding and were often difficult to interpret. Serology assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 antibodies as early as 10 days after symptom onset. Serology assays vary in their sensitivity based on the marker (IgA/IgM versus IgG versus total) and by manufacturer; however, overall only 4 EIAs and 4 POCTs had sensitivities of >95% >21 days after symptom onset. Cross-reactivity with other seasonal coronaviruses is of concern.

We aimed to examine the impact of face mask and other NPIs use with a gradual roll out of vaccines in NYC on the epidemic trajectory. A SEIR mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission was developed for New York City (NYC), which accounted for decreased mobility for lockdown, testing and tracing. Varied mask’s usage and efficacy were tested, along with a gradual increase in vaccine uptake over five months. The model has been calibrated using notification data in NYC from March first to June 29. Masks and other NPIs result in immediate impact on the epidemic, while vaccination has a delayed impact, especially when implemented over a long period of time. A pre-emptive, early mandate for masks is more effective than late mask use, but even late mask mandates will reduce cases and deaths by over 20%. The epidemic curve is suppressed by at least 50% of people wearing a mask from the start of the outbreak but surges when mask wearing drops to 30% or less. With a slow roll out of vaccines over five months at uptake levels of 20–70%, NPIs use will still be needed and has a greater impact on epidemic control. When vaccine roll out is slow or partial in cities experiencing local transmission of COVID-19, masks and other NPIs will be necessary to mitigate transmission until vaccine coverage is high and complete. Vaccine alone cannot rapidly control an epidemic because of the time lag to two-dose immunity. Even after high coverage, the ongoing need for NPIs is unknown and will depend on long-term duration of vaccine efficacy, the use of boosters and optimized dosage scheduling and variants of concern.","Raina MacIntyre, C.; Costantino, Valentina; Chanmugam, Arjun",Vaccine,186,20

Meanwhile, there is an urgent need to identify alternative means of antiviral defense. Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine that has been recognized for its off-target beneficial effects on the immune system can be exploited to boast immunity and protect from emerging novel viruses. METHODS: We developed and employed a systems biology workflow capable of identifying small-molecule antiviral drugs and vaccines that can boast immunity and affect a wide variety of viral disease pathways to protect from the fatal consequences of emerging viruses. RESULTS: Our analysis demonstrates that BCG vaccine affects the production and maturation of naïve T cells resulting in enhanced, long-lasting trained innate immune responses that can provide protection against novel viruses. We have identified small-molecule BCG mimics, including antiviral drugs such as raltegravir and lopinavir as high confidence hits. Strikingly, our top hits emetine and lopinavir were independently validated by recent experimental findings that these compounds inhibit the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide systems biology support for using BCG and small-molecule BCG mimics as putative vaccine and drug candidates against emergent viruses including SARS-CoV-2.

Here we aimed to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a candidate COVID-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, containing inactivated SARS-CoV-2, in children and adolescents aged 3–17 years. METHODS: We did a double-blind, randomised, controlled, phase 1/2 clinical trial of CoronaVac in healthy children and adolescents aged 3–17 years old at Hebei Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Zanhuang (Hebei, China). Individuals with SARS-CoV-2 exposure or infection history were excluded. Vaccine (in 0·5 mL aluminum hydroxide adjuvant) or aluminum hydroxide only (alum only, control) was given by intramuscular injection in two doses (day 0 and day 28). We did a phase 1 trial in 72 participants with an age de-escalation in three groups and dose-escalation in two blocks (1·5 μg or 3·0 μg per injection). Within each block, participants were randomly assigned (3:1) by means of block randomisation to receive CoronaVac or alum only. In phase 2, participants were randomly assigned (2:2:1) by means of block randomisation to receive either CoronaVac at 1·5 μg or 3·0 μg per dose, or alum only. All participants, investigators, and laboratory staff were masked to group allocation. The primary safety endpoint was adverse reactions within 28 days after each injection in all participants who received at least one dose. The primary immunogenicity endpoint assessed in the per-protocol population was seroconversion rate of neutralising antibody to live SARS-CoV-2 at 28 days after the second injection.

FINDINGS: Between Oct 31, 2020, and Dec 2, 2020, 72 participants were enrolled in phase 1, and between Dec 12, 2020, and Dec 30, 2020, 480 participants were enrolled in phase 2. 550 participants received at least one dose of vaccine or alum only (n=71 for phase 1 and n=479 for phase 2; safety population). In the combined safety profile of phase 1 and phase 2, any adverse reactions within 28 days after injection occurred in 56 (26%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 63 (29%) of 217 in the 3·0 μg group, and 27 (24%) of 114 in the alum-only group, without significant difference (p=0·55). Most adverse reactions were mild and moderate in severity. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported event (73 [13%] of 550 participants), occurring in 36 (16%) of 219 participants in the 1·5 μg group, 35 (16%) of 217 in the 3·0 μg group, and two (2%) in the alum-only group. As of June 12, 2021, only one serious adverse event of pneumonia has been reported in the alum-only group, which was considered unrelated to vaccination. In phase 1, seroconversion of neutralising antibody after the second dose was observed in 27 of 27 participants (100·0% [95% CI 87·2–100·0]) in the 1·5 μg group and 26 of 26 participants (100·0% [86·8-100·0]) in the 3·0 μg group, with the geometric mean titres of 55·0 (95% CI 38·9–77·9) and 117·4 (87·8–157·0). In phase 2, seroconversion was seen in 180 of 186 participants (96·8% [93·1–98·8]) in the 1·5 μg group and 180 of 180 participants (100·0% [98·0–100·0]) in the 3·0 μg group, with the geometric mean titres of 86·4 (73·9–101·0) and 142·2 (124·7–162·1). There were no detectable antibody responses in the alum-only groups. INTERPRETATION: CoronaVac was well tolerated and safe and induced humoral responses in children and adolescents aged 3–17 years. Neutralising antibody titres induced by the 3·0 μg dose were higher than those of the 1·5 μg dose. The results support the use of 3·0 μg dose with a two-immunisation schedule for further studies in children and adolescents.

We examine individual socio-economic factors that potentially predict mitigation compliance using public data. We hypothesize that health risk factors, presence of symptoms, and psychological wellbeing predict mitigation behavior. Understanding what factors are associated with mitigation behavior will be important for policy makers in their efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic prompted strong mitigation behavior by adults, especially among females, non-whites, urban dwellers, and the psychological unwell. Other positive predictors were post-secondary education and higher income. Health symptoms and clinical risk factors did not predict increased mitigation practices, nor did age 65+ and proximity to infected persons. Our study findings are congruent with a report that pointed to a lack of increased pandemic mitigation practices in households with confirmed infections and health risks. Our results also point to lower levels of psychological resilience, lower socio-economic status, and non-urban location as potential explanatory factors for lack of mitigation behavior.","Lemke, D.; Lemke, K.",,186,30

With a larger population of tuberculosis patients anticipated to be co-infected with COVID-19 infection, an ongoing pandemic, identifying, preventing and managing drug–drug interactions is inevitable for maximizing patient benefits for the current repurposed COVID-19 and antitubercular drugs. METHODS: We assessed the potential drug–drug interactions between repurposed COVID-19 drugs and antitubercular drugs using the drug interaction checker of IBM Micromedex®. Extensive computational studies were performed at a molecular level to validate and understand the drug–drug interactions found from the Micromedex drug interaction checker database at a molecular level. The integrated knowledge derived from Micromedex and computational data was collated and curated for predicting potential drug–drug interactions between repurposed COVID-19 and antitubercular drugs. RESULTS: A total of 91 potential drug–drug interactions along with their severity and level of documentation were identified from Micromedex between repurposed COVID-19 drugs and antitubercular drugs. We identified 47 pharmacodynamic, 42 pharmacokinetic and 2 unknown DDIs. The majority of our molecular modelling results were in line with drug–drug interaction data obtained from the drug information software. QT prolongation was identified as the most common type of pharmacodynamic drug–drug interaction, whereas drug–drug interactions associated with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition and induction were identified as the frequent pharmacokinetic drug–drug interactions. The results suggest antitubercular drugs, particularly rifampin and second-line agents, warrant high alert and monitoring while prescribing with the repurposed COVID-19 drugs. CONCLUSION: Predicting these potential drug–drug interactions, particularly related to CYP3A4, P-gp and the human Ether-à-go-go-Related Gene proteins, could be used in clinical settings for screening and management of drug–drug interactions for delivering safer chemotherapeutic tuberculosis and COVID-19 care. The current study provides an initial propulsion for further well-designed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-based drug–drug interaction studies. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: INTRODUCTION: Tuberculosis is a major respiratory disease globally with a higher prevalence in Asian and African countries than rest of the world. With a larger population of tuberculosis patients predicted to be infected with COVID-19 during this period, there is a higher risk for the occurrence of medication interactions between the medicines used for COVID-19 and tuberculosis. Hence, identifying and managing these interactions is vital to ensure the safety of patients undergoing COVID-19 and tuberculosis treatment simultaneously. METHODS: We studied the major medication interactions that could likely happen between the various medicines that are currently given for COVID-19 and tuberculosis treatment using the medication interaction checker of a drug information software (Micromedex®). In addition, thorough molecular modelling was done to confirm and understand the interactions found from the medication interaction checker database using specific docking software. Molecular docking is a method that predicts the preferred orientation of one medicine molecule to a second molecule, when bound to each other to form a stable complex. Knowledge of the preferred orientation may be used to determine the strength of association or binding affinity between two medicines using scoring functions to determine the extent of the interactions between medicines. The combined knowledge from Micromedex and molecular modelling data was used to properly predict the potential medicine interactions between currently used COVID-19 and antitubercular medicines. RESULTS: We found a total of 91 medication interactions from Micromedex. Majority of our molecular modelling findings matched with the interaction information obtained from the drug information software. QT prolongation, an abnormal heartbeat, was identified as one of the most common interactions. Our findings suggest that antitubercular medicines, mainly rifampin and second-line agents, suggest high alert and scrutiny while prescribing with the repurposed COVID-19 medicines. CONCLUSION: Our current study highlights the need for further well-designed studies confirming the current information for recommending safe prescribing in patients with both infections.","Thomas, Levin; Birangal, Sumit Raosaheb; Ray, Rajdeep; Sekhar Miraj, Sonal; Munisamy, Murali; Varma, Muralidhar; S.V., Chidananda Sanju; Banerjee, Mithu; Shenoy, Gautham G.; Rao, Mahadev",Ther Adv Drug Saf,186,13

Each controversy raises principles that support claims by traditional wielders of authority in “federal” countries, like federal and state governments, and less traditional entities, like cities and sub-state nations. No existing principle divides “healthcare and public law and policy” into units that can be allocated in intuitively compelling ways. This leads to puzzles concerning (a) the principles for justifiably allocating “powers” in these domains and (b) whether and how they change during “emergencies.” This work motivates the puzzles, explains why resolving them should be part of long-term responses to COVID-19, and outlines some initial COVID-19-related findings that shed light on justifiable authority allocation, emergencies, emergency powers, and the relationships between them.","DA SILVA, MICHAEL",Cambridge quarterly of healthcare ethics : CQ : the international journal of healthcare ethics committees,186,24

In December 2019, an outbreak of a respiratory disease occurred in China, and later, it involved different countries. Acute neurological insults are more likely to occur in severely infected patients. METHODS: We tried to evaluate patients with selective criteria including, the age of participants 18 and older with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, and developed neurological complications post COVID-19 infection. An overall data of 1500 patients were collected from neurological and primary health care departments. About 970 of them had neurological problems. Patients-related data were gathered and assembled from the patients’ records at participating hospitals from the Ministry of Health and university hospitals. RESULTS: We presented the results according to several variables including, regional distribution, reasons of presentation, neurological complications, follow-ups, and survival outcome. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, we conducted the first retrospective analysis for neurological problems related to COVID-19 infection in Egypt. COVID-19 patients present with a variety of central and peripheral neurological symptoms, the pathogenic mechanisms of which have not been explained. Robust investigations of the neurological presentations of COVID-19 infection should be recruited for better understanding of the possible association. Moreover, further explaining the pathophysiologic mechanisms will help in designing proper treatment plans.","Azab, Mohammed A.; Azzam, Ahmed Y.; Salem, Ahmed E.; Reda, Ahmed; Hassanein, Sherif F.; Sabra, Mohamed; Gadelmoula, Islam S.",Interdiscip Neurosurg,186,16

The high transmission and mortality rates of this virus, and the unavailability of a vaccine or treatment, resulted in the decision of multiple governments to enact measures of social distancing. Such measures can reduce the exposure to bioaerosols, which can result in pathogen deposition in the respiratory tract of the host causing disease and an immunological response. Thus, it is important to consider the validity of the proposal for keeping a distance of at least 2 m from other persons to avoid the spread of COVID‐19. This work reviews the effect of aerodynamic diameter (size) of particles carrying RNA copies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2). A SARS‐CoV‐2 carrier person talking, sneezing or coughing at distance of 2 m can still provide a pathogenic bioaerosol load with submicron particles that remain viable in air for up to 3 h for exposure of healthy persons near and far from the source in a stagnant environment. The deposited bioaerosol creates contaminated surfaces, which if touched can act as a path to introduce the pathogen by mouth, nose or eyes and cause disease.","Guzman, Marcelo I.",Int J Health Plann Manage,186,24

BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated physical, psychological, and social stressors that may create a uniquely difficult recovery and reintegration environment for injured patients. METHODS Adult (≥18 years) survivors of moderate-to-severe injury completed a survey 6-14 months post-injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey queried individuals about the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury recovery and assessed post-injury functional and mental health outcomes. Regression models were built to identify factors associated with a perceived negative impact of the pandemic on injury recovery, and to define the relationship between these perceptions and long-term outcomes. RESULTS Of 597 eligible trauma survivors who were contacted, 403 (67.5%) completed the survey. Twenty-nine percent reported that the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted their recovery and 24% reported difficulty accessing needed healthcare. Younger age, lower perceived-socioeconomic status (SES), extremity injury, and prior psychiatric illness were independently associated with negative perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on injury recovery. In adjusted analyses, patients who reported a negative impact of the pandemic on their recovery were more likely to have new functional limitations, daily pain, lower physical and mental component scores of the SF-12 and to screen positive for PTSD and depression. CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting the recovery of trauma survivors. It is essential that we recognize the impact of the pandemic on injured patients while focusing on directed efforts to improve the long-term outcomes of this already at-risk population.","Herrera-Escobar, Juan P; Wang, Joyce; Lamarre, Taylor; Patel, Nikita; Orlas, Claudia P; Moheb, Mohamad El; Levy-Carrick, Nomi C; Sanchez, Sabrina E; Velmahos, George; Kaafarani, Haytham Ma; Salim, Ali; Nehra, Deepika",Annals of surgery,186,14

We discuss the effect of nationwide lockdown implemented in India on March 25, 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model is used to forecast active COVID-19 cases in India considering the effect of nationwide lockdown and possible inflation in the active cases after its removal on May 3, 2020. Our model predicts that with the ongoing lockdown, the peak of active infected cases around 43,000 will occur in the mid of May, 2020. We also predict a 7 to 21% increase in the peak value of active infected cases for a variety of hypothetical scenarios reflecting a relative relaxation in the control strategies implemented by the government in the post-lockdown period. For India, it is an important decision to come up with a non-pharmaceutical control strategy such as nationwide lockdown for 40 days to prolong the higher phases of COVID-19 and to avoid severe load on its public health-care system. As the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak remains a global threat, it is a challenge for all the countries to come up with effective public health and administrative strategies to battle against COVID-19 and sustain their economies.","Pai, Chintamani; Bhaskar, Ankush; Rawoot, Vaibhav",Chaos Solitons Fractals,186,1

To investigate drivers of virus spillover, we evaluated the number of viruses mammalian species have shared with humans. We discovered that the number of zoonotic viruses detected in mammalian species scales positively with global species abundance, suggesting that virus transmission risk has been highest from animal species that have increased in abundance and even expanded their range by adapting to human-dominated landscapes. Domesticated species, primates and bats were identified as having more zoonotic viruses than other species. Among threatened wildlife species, those with population reductions owing to exploitation and loss of habitat shared more viruses with humans. Exploitation of wildlife through hunting and trade facilitates close contact between wildlife and humans, and our findings provide further evidence that exploitation, as well as anthropogenic activities that have caused losses in wildlife habitat quality, have increased opportunities for animal–human interactions and facilitated zoonotic disease transmission. Our study provides new evidence for assessing spillover risk from mammalian species and highlights convergent processes whereby the causes of wildlife population declines have facilitated the transmission of animal viruses to humans.","Johnson, Christine K.; Hitchens, Peta L.; Pandit, Pranav S.; Rushmore, Julie; Evans, Tierra Smiley; Young, Cristin C.

Little education exists for preclinical students, and guidance for faculty to facilitate such education is minimal. To address these gaps, we designed and delivered a single session for incoming first-year medical students and developed a facilitator training program. METHODS: One faculty member delivered a 1-hour, multimedia, interactive lecture to all first-year medical students. Students subsequently met in small groups with trained facilitators. Activities included reflection, guided debriefing, and strategy identification to become aware of when they might be making an assumption causing them to jump to a conclusion about someone. The program evaluation consisted of aggregated student strategies and facilitator feedback during postsession debriefs, both analyzed through thematic analysis. RESULTS: We delivered instruction to 1,098 students. Student strategies resulted in three themes: (1) humility, (2) reflection, and (3) partnering. The postsession debriefs uncovered opportunities to enhance the session. Lessons learned included presenting material to an entire class at once, allowing students to engage in dynamic discussion in the small groups, eliminating anonymous polling in the small groups, and highlighting management of implicit bias as essential to professional development. DISCUSSION: Our instructional design enabled first-year medical students to identify at least one strategy to use when implicit biases are activated. The large-group session was deliverable by one faculty member, and volunteers successfully facilitated small-group sessions after only one training session, making this model a feasible innovation to reach an entire medical school class at the same time.","Gonzalez, Cristina M.; Nava, Stephanie; List, Julie; Liguori, Alyssa; Marantz, Paul R.",MedEdPORTAL : the journal of teaching and learning resources,186,16

Research data is needed to develop scientific evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse mental health effects. The aims of this study are to evaluate the anxiety reaction of Chinese people and the related determinants during the earliest phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Evidence from this survey will contribute to a targeted reference on how to deliver psychological counseling service in the face of outbreaks. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based online survey was conducted from 28 January to 5 February 2020 using an open online questionnaire for people aged 18 years or above, residing in China and abroad. The socio-demographic information of the respondents was collected, and anxiety scores were calculated. A direct standardization method was used to standardize anxiety scores and a general linear model was used to identify associations between some factors (e.g., sex, age, education, etc.) and anxiety scores. (3) Results: A total of 10,946 eligible participants were recruited in this study, with a completion rate of 98.16% (10,946/11,151). The average anxiety score was 6.46 ± 4.12 (total score = 15); women (6.86 ± 4.11) scored higher than men (5.67 ± 4.04). The age variable was inversely and significantly associated with the anxiety score (β = −2.12, 95% CI: −2.47–−1.78). People possessing higher education (β = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.88–1.41) or a higher awareness of cognitive risk (β = 4.89, 95% CI: 4.33–5.46) reported higher levels of anxiety. There was a close association between poor subjective health and anxiety status (β = 2.83, 95% CI: 2.58–3.09). With the increase of confidence, the anxiety of the population exhibited a gradual decline (β = −2.45, 95% CI: −2.77–−2.13). (4) Conclusion: Most people were vulnerable to anxiety during the earliest phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Younger women, individuals with high education, people with high cognitive risk and subjective poor health were vulnerable to anxiety during the epidemic. In addition, increasing confidence in resisting this pandemic is a protective determinant for individuals to develop anxiety. The findings suggest that policymakers adopt psychosocial interventions to reduce anxiety during the pandemic.","Liu, Bei; Han, Bingfeng; Zheng, Hui; Liu, Hanyu; Zhao, Tianshuo; Wan, Yongmei; Cui, Fuqiang",Healthcare (Basel),186,4

National healthcare services have to manage unexpected shortage of healthcare resources that have to be reallocated according to the principles of fair and ethical prioritisation, in order to maintain the highest levels of care to all patients, ensure the safety of patients and healthcare workers and save as many lives as possible. Beyond that, cancer care services have to pursue restructuring, following the same evidence-based dispositions. In this article, we propose guidance to the management of colorectal cancer during the pandemic, prioritised according to a three-tiered framework, based on expert clinical judgement and magnitude of benefit expected from specific interventions. Since the availability of resources for diagnostic procedures, surgery and postoperative care, systemic therapy and radiotherapy may differ, authors did separate prioritisation analyses. The impact of postponing or abrogating cancer interventions on outcomes according to a high, medium or low priority scale, is outlined and discussed. The implementation of healthcare services using telemedicine is explored: it reveals itself as functional and effective for limiting patients’ need to travel to centres and thereby has the potential to reduce diffusion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

To understand the immunological signature of SARS-CoV-2 infections and aid the search and evaluation of new treatment modalities and vaccines, comprehensive characterization of adaptive immune responses towards SARS-CoV-2 is needed. METHODS: We included 203 recovered SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Denmark between April 3(rd) and July 9(th) 2020, at least 14 days after COVID-19 symptom recovery. The participants had experienced a range of disease severities from asymptomatic to severe. We collected plasma, serum and PBMC's for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody response by Meso Scale analysis including other coronavirus strains, ACE2 competition, IgA ELISA, pseudovirus neutralization capacity, and dextramer flow cytometry analysis of CD8(+) T cells. The immunological outcomes were compared amongst severity groups within the cohort, and 10 pre-pandemic SARS-CoV-2 negative controls. FINDINGS: We report broad serological profiles within the cohort, detecting antibody binding to other human coronaviruses. 202(>99%) participants had SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies, with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization and spike-ACE2 receptor interaction blocking observed in 193(95%) individuals. A significant positive correlation (r=0.7804) between spike-ACE2 blocking antibody titers and neutralization potency was observed. Further, SARS-CoV-2 specific CD8(+) T-cell responses were clear and quantifiable in 95 of 106(90%) HLA-A2(+) individuals. INTERPRETATION: The viral surface spike protein was identified as the dominant target for both neutralizing antibodies and CD8(+) T-cell responses. Overall, the majority of patients had robust adaptive immune responses, regardless of their disease severity.

METHODS: We conducted an online cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of American adults (n = 1010), aged 18–94, running from April 10–20, 2020. We assessed depressive symptoms (CES-D-10 scale), loneliness (UCLA 3-Item Loneliness scale), and frequency of in-person and remote social connections (4 items, e.g., hugging family member, video chats) and sexual connections (4 items, e.g., partnered sexual activity, dating app use). RESULTS: One-third of participants (32%) reported depressive symptoms, and loneliness was high [mean (SD): 4.4 (1.7)]. Those with depressive symptoms were more likely to be women, aged 20–29, unmarried, and low-income. Very frequent in-person connections were generally associated with lower depression and loneliness; frequent remote connections were not. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and loneliness were elevated during the early US COVID-19 response. Those who maintained very frequent in-person, but not remote, social and sexual connections had better mental health outcomes. While COVID-19 social restrictions remain necessary, it will be critical to expand mental health services to serve those most at-risk and identify effective ways of maintaining social and sexual connections from a distance.

Acute aortic conditions have also been described, followed by interesting observations on cases, hypothesis, raised since the emergence of the pandemics. METHODS: a review of cases in literature of aortic pathology in patients with clinically suspected/microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection has been carried out to analyze anagraphic data, clinical presentation, treatment options and outcome. RESULTS: 17 cases have been included. Mean age of patients was 58.6±15.2years, with a male to female ratio of 12:15 (70.5% vs 29.5%). Comorbidities were reported in 11 cases (64.7%), but in 5 cases (29.4%) no previous pathology was signaled in history. Hypertension was the most frequently reported comorbidity, in 8 cases, (47%), followed by renal pathology (17.6%), coronary artery disease (17.6%), previous aortic surgery (11.7%) and arrhythmia (11.7%); but also cerebrovascular disease, diabetes, autoimmune conditions, previous neoplasia and arrhythmia were reported once each. Fever and thoracic pain were the most frequently reported findings at presentation (8 cases, 47% each), followed by respiratory symptoms (6, 35.2%), low lymphocyte count (17.6%), features related to aneurysm rupture, ischemic stroke, abdominal pain and acute renal insufficiency. Reported aortic pathology included: type A aortic dissection (11 cases; 64.7%); new pathology of previous aortic graft (2 cases, 11.7%); 2 aortitis, one associated with type A aortic dissection; 1 thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm, 1 ruptured aortic aneurysm and 1 aortic embolizing thrombosis. Open surgery was carried out in 10 cases (58.8%), endovascular treatment in 3 (17.6%). Three patients (17.6%) died before surgery. Exitus was reported in 4 cases, with a total mortality of 23.5%. CONCLUSIONS: Acute aortic events have occurred during pandemic in patients with clinically suspected/microbiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection. Confounding clinical features at presentation, the importance of anamnestic details (as previous vascular graft implant), the observed surgical and post-operatory challenges may suggest the need to consider the implications of the possible link between acute aortic events and SARS-CoV-2 infection, in order to promptly correctly diagnose the patient and respond to specific needs.","Silvestri, Valeria; Recchia, Gregorio Egidio",Ann Vasc Surg,186,16

Methods Data from Colombian official case information were collated for a period of five months. Dynamical parameters of the disease spread were then estimated from the data. Probability distribution models were identified that represent the time from symptom onset to hospitalization, to ICU admission and to death. Kaplan Meier estimates were also computed for the probability of eventually requiring hospitalization, needing ICU attention and of dying from the disease (the CFR). Results Probability distributions of the times and probabilities were computed for the population and for groups based on age and sex. Our results show that for the times that characterize the course of the disease for a given patient (to hospitalization, to ICU or death), the variation from an age group to another is very small (around of 10% of fixed effect intercept) and the effect of sex is even weaker (around 1%). The course of the disease appears to be very similar for all patients. The probability that a patient advances from one stage of the disease to another (to hospitalization, to ICU, to death), on the other hand, is heavily influenced by sex and age. Relative risk of death for males (based on 22924 dead) is 1.7. Conclusions The times from one stage of the disease to another are almost independent of the major patient’s variables (sex, age). This is in stark contrast to the probabilities of going from one stage to another which show a strong dependence on age and sex. Data also show that the length of hospital and ICU stays are almost independent of sex and age. The only factor that affects this length was the eventual outcome (survival or death) of the disease. The time is significantly longer for surviving patients.","Diaz, Hernando; España, Guido; Castañeda, Nelson; Rodriguez, Laura; de la Hoz-Restrepo, Fernando",Int J Infect Dis,186,29

Different vaccination programs using imported vaccines have failed to protect the flocks from field challenge. Recent studies confirmed a successful protection using homologous strains as live attenuated vaccines. In this study, a newly developed live attenuated IB-VAR2 vaccine representing the GI-23 Middle East IBV lineage was evaluated in day-old commercial broilers in an IBV-endemic area. A commercial broiler flock was vaccinated with the IB-VAR2 vaccine at day-old age followed by IB-H120 at day 16. The vaccinated flock was monitored on a weekly basis till the slaughter age. The health status and growth performance were monitored, and selected viral pathogen real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) detection was conducted on a weekly basis. Finally, the flock was compared to a nearby farm with only the classical IB-H120 vaccination program. Results showed that the IB-VAR2 vaccine was tolerable in day-old broiler chicks. The IBV virus rRT-PCR detection was limited to the trachea as compared to its nephropathogenic parent virus. Respiratory disease problems and high mortalities were reported in the IB-H120-only vaccinated flock. An exposure to a wild-type Egy/VarII strain was confirmed in both flocks as indicated by partial IBV S1 gene sequence. Even though the IB-VAR2-vaccinated flock performance was better than the flock that received only IB-H120, the IBV ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and log2 Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody mean titers remained high (3128 ± 2713 and ≥9 log2, respectively) until the 28th day of age. The current study demonstrates the safety and effectiveness of IB-VAR2 as a live attenuated vaccine in day-old commercial broilers. Also, the combination of IB-VAR2 and classical IBV vaccines confers a broader protective immune response against IBV in endemic areas.","Elhady, Mohamed A.; Ali, Ahmed; Kilany, Walid H.; Elfeil, Wael K.; Ibrahim, Hytham; Nabil, Ahmed; Samir, Ahmed; El Sayed, Magdy",Vet Sci,186,24

DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Optum de-identified electronic health records including over 700 hospitals and 7000 clinics in the USA. PARTICIPANTS: There were 891 754 patients who had a COVID-19 test identified in their electronic health record between 20 February 2020 and 10 July 2020. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Per cent of viral and antibody tests positive for COVID-19 (‘positivity rate’); adjusted ORs for factors associated with COVID-19 viral and antibody test positivity; and per cent concordance between positive viral and subsequent antibody test results. RESULTS: Overall positivity rate was 9% (70 472 of 771 278) and 12% (11 094 of 91 741) for viral and antibody tests, respectively. Positivity rate was inversely associated with the number of individuals tested and decreased over time across regions and race/ethnicities. Antibody test concordance among patients with an initial positive viral test was 91% (71%–95% depending on time between tests). Among tests separated by at least 2 weeks, discordant results occurred in 7% of patients and 9% of immunocompromised patients. Factors associated with increased odds of viral and antibody positivity in multivariable models included: male sex, Hispanic or non-Hispanic black or Asian race/ethnicity, uninsured or Medicaid insurance and Northeast residence. We identified a negative dose effect between the number of comorbidities and viral and antibody test positivity. Paediatric patients had reduced odds (OR=0.60, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.64) of a positive viral test but increased odds (OR=1.90, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.23) of a positive antibody test compared with those aged 18–34 years old.

Currently there is no vaccine, effective therapeutic or prophylactic. Like other betacoronaviruses, attachment and entry of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the spike glycoprotein (SGP). In addition to its well-documented interaction with its receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), SGP has been found to bind to glycosaminoglycans like heparan sulfate, which is found on the surface of virtually all mammalian cells. Here, we pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 SGP on a third generation lentiviral (pLV) vector and tested the impact of various sulfated polysaccharides on transduction efficiency in mammalian cells. The pLV vector pseudotyped SGP efficiently and produced high titers on HEK293T cells. Various sulfated polysaccharides potently neutralized pLV-S pseudotyped virus with clear structure-based differences in anti-viral activity and affinity to SGP. Concentration-response curves showed that pLV-S particles were efficiently neutralized by a range of concentrations of unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, 6-O-desulfated UFH and 6-O-desulfated enoxaparin with an IC(50) of 599 ng/L, 108 μg/L, 177 ng/L, and 586 μg/L respectively. The low serum bioavailability of intranasally administered UFH, along with data suggesting that the nasal epithelium is a portal for initial infection and transmission, suggest that intranasal administration of UFH may be an effective and safe prophylactic treatment.","Tandon, Ritesh; Sharp, Joshua S.; Zhang, Fuming; Pomin, Vitor H.; Ashpole, Nicole M.; Mitra, Dipanwita; Jin, Weihua; Liu, Hao; Sharma, Poonam; Linhardt, Robert J.",bioRxiv,186,32

Lebanon is a country facing frequent uncertainty with recent economic and social difficulties. Its popular cuisine may play a key role in its development and that of its rural space. In fact, that cuisine incorporates a traditional cultural practice called “Mouneh” which consists of preserved pantry foods, historically used to ensure household nutrition. Today, rural food cooperatives are engaging in that practice using agricultural produce from local farmers and are employing women. Despite strong internal and external challenges, they remain attractive actors as their principles of collective benefit, participation and democracy form a strong link with sustainable development goals. This study transversally analyzes the status of food cooperatives in a major agricultural region in Lebanon, the Bekaa valley. Findings mainly quantified size and production and provided a mapped representation of the spatial dependencies on local farmers versus urban markets for trade. With 75% women members and firm reputation in authenticity, food cooperatives in the Bekaa specifically and Lebanon generally are also extensively supported by donors but are being labeled as donor-dependent. Yet, cooperatives are localized in a largely agricultural territory with sufficient evidence of differentiation that could potentially be valorized. Hence, with optimal framing, regulation and networking of cooperatives, one can assume a protection of culinary heritage is possible with scalable contribution to food security and needed local development given major recent setbacks.","Jalkh, Rita; Dedeire, Marc; Requier Desjardins, Melanie",Food Ethics,186,32

Patients who underwent chest CT for suspected Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia at the emergency department admission in the first phase of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients with both negative chest CT and absence of the novel coronavirus in nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swabs were excluded from the study. A total of 462 patients with positive CT scans for interstitial pneumonia were included in the study (250 males and 212 females, mean age 57 ± 17 years, range 18–89). Of these, 344 were positive to RT-PCR test, 118 were negative to double RT-PCR tests. CTs were analyzed for quantification of affected lung volume visually and by dedicated software. Statistical analysis to evaluate the relationship between laboratory analyses and CT patterns and amount of damaged lung related with COVID-19 pneumonia was performed in 2 groups of patients: positive RT-PCR COVID-19 group and negative RT-PCR COVID-19 group, but both with positive CT scans for interstitial pneumonia. Lymphocytopenia, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), d-dimer, and fibrinogen increased levels occurred in most patients without statistically significant differences between the 2 groups with CT scans suggestive for COVID-19. In fact, in both groups the volume of lung damage was strongly associated with altered laboratory test results, even for patients with negative RT-PCR test. The decreased number of lymphocytes, and the increased levels of CRP, LDH, d-dimer, and fibrinogen levels are associated with SARS-CoV 2 related pneumonia. This may be useful as an additional diagnostic tool in patients with double negative RT-PCR assay and with highly suspected clinic and chest CT features for COVID-19 to isolate patients in a pandemic period.","Orlacchio, Antonio; Gasparrini, Fulvio; Roma, Silvia; Ravà, Matteo Santangelo; Salvatori, Eva; Morosetti, Daniele; Cossu, Elsa; Legramante, Jacopo Maria; Paganelli, Carla; Bernardini, Sergio; Minieri, Marilena",Medicine (Baltimore),186,5

The economic cost to the health system is significant. An ageing population is intensifying the urgency for action. However, poor oral health, particularly for those in residential aged care facilities, continues to be highly resistant to resolution. The overall aims of this realist review are to: (A) explore and synthesise evidence on oral health interventions for older people in residential aged care facilities, (B) produce a causal theory on how contextual factors and mechanisms interact to produce outcomes, and (C) produce guidelines/policies to inform high-quality oral health interventions to improve older people’s oral health in residential aged care facilities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The review is guided by the RAMESES publication standards for realist synthesis. Participants include older people in residential aged care facilities, the aged care workforce, carers and families. Interventions include oral healthcare, oral health education, policy interventions and oral health promotion. The five-step realist review process of Pawson et al will guide the review: clarification of scope and development of initial framework, systematic searches, study appraisal and data extraction, synthesising evidence, drawing conclusions, and dissemination, implementation and evaluation.

Serum samples from HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific antibodies. An online survey was used to collect demographic, clinical, and epidemiological data. Results: Of the 1893 HCWs included, 433 (22.9%) were found seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG. The cumulative prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection (antibodies production or past positive RT-PCR on nasal/throat swab) was 25.1% (475/1893).

This laboratory study quantifies the reduction in particulate matter aerosol concentrations produced by electrocautery and drilling when using mitigation strategies such as irrigation, respirator filtration and suction in a lab environment to prepare for future work under live OR conditions. METHODS: We combined one aerosol-generating procedure (monopolar cutting or coagulating diathermy or high-speed diamond- or steel-tipped drilling of cadaveric porcine tissue) with one or multiple mitigation strategies (instrument irrigation, plume suction and filtration using an FFP3 respirator filter) and using an optical particle counter to measure particulate matter aerosol size and concentrations. RESULTS: Significant aerosol concentrations were observed during all aerosol-generating procedures with concentrations exceeding 3 × 10(6) particles per 100 ml. Considerable reductions in concentrations were observed with mitigation. In drilling, suction, FFP3 filtration and wash alone respectively reduced aerosol by 19.3–31.6%, 65.1–70.8% and 97.2 to > 99.9%. The greatest reduction (97.38 to > 99.9%) was observed when combining irrigation and filtration. Coagulating diathermy reduced concentrations by 88.0–96.6% relative to cutting, but produced larger particles. Suction alone, and suction with filtration reduced aerosol concentration by 41.0–49.6% and 88.9–97.4% respectively. No tested mitigation strategies returned aerosol concentrations to baseline. CONCLUSION: Aerosol concentrations are significantly reduced through the combined use of filtration, suction and irrigation. Further research is required to characterise aerosol concentrations in the live OR and to find acceptable exposure limits, and in their absence, to find methods to further reduce exposure to theatre staff.","Schramm, Moritz W.

Because she had erythema and petechiae with a decreased platelet count, the dengue NS1 antigen and anti-dengue IgM/IgG test were performed, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention RT-PCR assay detected the dengue virus serotype 1 infection. Additionally, increased liver enzyme serum levels were found in the patient, who later developed hepatomegaly. Hence, the mechanism of hepatic pathology associated with SARS-CoV-2 and dengue coinfection needs further research.","Reyes-Ruiz, José Manuel; Campuzano-Vences, Rosa; Osuna-Ramos, Juan Fidel; De Jesús-González, Luis Adrián; Pérez-Méndez, María J.; González-González, Crescencio; Farfan-Morales, Carlos Noe; Rivas-Tovar, Leticia; Dávila-González, Eduardo; María del Ángel, Rosa; Gutiérrez-Garduño, Aarón P.; Villegas-del Ángel, Enrique; Zárate-Segura, Paola; Bastida-González, Fernando",Am J Trop Med Hyg,186,20

The fundamental view that underlies this new paradigm is that socioeconomic and political contexts in which people live have significant bearing upon their health and well-being. Unlike a wealth of research on socioeconomic determinants, few studies have focused on the role of political factors. Some of these studies examine the role of political determinants on health through their mediation with the labour environments and systems of welfare state. A few others study the relationship between polity regimes and population health more directly. However, none of them has a focus on women's health. This study explores the interactions, both direct and indirect, between democracy and women's health. In doing so, it identifies some of the main health vulnerabilities for women and explains, through a conceptual model, how democracy and respect for human rights interacts with women's health.","Safaei, Jalil",Mens Sana Monogr,186,28

SARS-CoV-2 infects cells following receptor-mediated endocytosis and priming by cellular proteases. Following uptake, SARS-CoV-2 replicates in autophagosome-like structures in the cytosol following its escape from endolysosomes. Accordingly, the greater endolysosome pathway including autophagosomes and the mTOR sensor may be targets for therapeutic interventions against SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 pathogenesis. Naturally existing compounds (phytochemicals) through their actions on endolysosomes and mTOR signaling pathways might provide therapeutic relief against COVID-19. Here, we discuss evidence that some natural compounds through actions on the greater endolysosome system can inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infectivity and thereby might be repurposed for use against COVID-19.","Khan, Nabab; Chen, Xuesong; Geiger, Jonathan D.",J Cell Signal,186,1

We sought to determine whether IgG, IgA and neutralizing antibody (nAb) to SARS‐CoV‐2 vary by ABO blood group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among eligible convalescent plasma donors, ABO blood group was determined via agglutination of reagent A1 and B cells, IgA and IgG were quantified using the Euroimmun anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 ELISA, and nAb titres were quantified using a microneutralization assay. Differences in titre distribution were examined by ABO blood group using non‐parametric Kruskal–Wallis tests. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) of high nAb titre (≥1:160) were estimated by blood group using multivariable modified Poisson regression models that adjusted for age, sex, hospitalization status and time since SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnosis. RESULTS: Of the 202 potential donors, 65 (32%) were blood group A, 39 (19%) were group B, 13 (6%) were group AB, and 85 (42%) were group O. Distribution of nAb titres significantly differed by ABO blood group, whereas there were no significant differences in anti‐spike IgA or anti‐spike IgG titres by ABO blood group. There were significantly more individuals with high nAb titre (≥1:160) among those with blood group B, compared with group O (aPR = 1·9 [95%CI = 1·1–3·3], P = 0·029). Fewer individuals had a high nAb titre among those with blood group A, compared with group B (aPR = 0·6 [95%CI = 0·4‐1·0], P = 0·053). CONCLUSION: Eligible CCP donors with blood group B may have relatively higher neutralizing antibody titres. Additional studies evaluating ABO blood groups and antibody titres that incorporate COVID‐19 severity are needed.","Bloch, Evan M.; Patel, Eshan U.; Marshall, Christi; Littlefield, Kirsten; Goel, Ruchika; Grossman, Brenda J.; Winters, Jeffrey L.; Shrestha, Ruchee; Burgess, Imani; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Shoham, Shmuel; Sullivan, David; Gehrie, Eric A.; Redd, Andrew D.; Quinn, Thomas C.; Casadevall, Arturo; Pekosz, Andrew; Tobian, Aaron A.

The patient had generalized lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, which are rare manifestations of indolent systemic mastocytosis. The chronic neglected pruritus and elevated tryptase levels along with histological findings were the main clues that have led us to the final diagnosis of indolent systemic mastocytosis. Later during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, the patient presented with symptoms that are common between coronavirus disease 2019 and mast cell activation syndrome.

Postmortem examination can aid in the ascertainment of causes of death. This manuscript describes the study protocol for the Pediatric Respiratory Etiology Surveillance Study (PRESS). OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to identify causes and etiologies associated with respiratory disease–related deaths among children (age 1-59 months) with respiratory illness admitted to the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH), the largest public hospital in Kenya, through postmortem examination coupled with innovative approaches to laboratory investigation. METHODS: We prospectively followed children hospitalized with respiratory illness until the end of clinical care or death. In case of death, parents or guardians were offered grief counseling, and postmortem examination was offered. Lung tissue specimens were collected using minimally invasive tissue sampling and conventional autopsy where other tissues were collected. Tissues were tested using histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and multipathogen molecular-based assays to identify pathogens. For each case, clinical and laboratory data were reviewed by a team of pathologists, clinicians, laboratorians, and epidemiologists to assign a cause of and etiology associated with death. RESULTS: We have enrolled pediatric cases of respiratory illness hospitalized at the KNH at the time of this submission; of those, 14.8% (140/945) died while in the hospital. Both analysis and interpretation of laboratory results and writing up of findings are expected in 2019-2020. CONCLUSIONS: Postmortem studies can help identify major pathogens contributing to respiratory-associated deaths in children. This information is needed to develop evidence-based prevention and treatment policies that target important causes of pediatric respiratory mortality and assist with the prioritization of local resources. Furthermore, PRESS can provide insights into the interpretation of results using multipathogen testing platforms in resource-limited settings.

METHODS: We reviewed the clinical documentation of six consecutive COVID-19 patients with primary spinal epidural abscess that we surgically managed over a 2-month period. These cases were analyzed for what concerns both the viral infection and the spinal abscess. RESULTS: The abscesses were primary in all cases indicating that no evident infective source was found. A primary abscess represents the rarest form of spinal epidural abscess, which is usually secondary to invasive procedures or spread from adjacent infective sites, such as spondylodiscitis, generally occurring in patients with diabetes, obesity, cancer, or other chronic diseases. In all cases, there was mild lymphopenia but the spinal abscess occurred regardless of the severity of the viral disease, immunologic state, or presence of bacteremia. Obesity was the only risk factor and was reported in two patients. All patients but one were hypertensive. The preferred localizations were cervical and thoracic, whereas classic abscess generally occur at the lumbar level. No patient had a history of pyogenic infection, even though previous asymptomatic bacterial contaminations were reported in three cases. CONCLUSION: We wonder about the concentration of this uncommon disease in such a short period. To our knowledge, cases of spinal epidural abscess in COVID-19 patients have not been reported to date. We hypothesize that, in our patients, the spinal infection could have depended on the coexistence of an initially asymptomatic bacterial contamination. The well-known COVID-19-related endotheliitis might have created the conditions for retrograde bacterial invasion to the correspondent spinal epidural space. Furthermore, spinal epidural abscess carries a significantly high morbidity and mortality. It is difficult to diagnose, especially in compromised COVID-19 patients but should be kept in mind as early diagnosis and treatment are crucial.","Talamonti, G.; Colistra, Davide; Crisà, Francesco; Cenzato, Marco; Giorgi, Pietro; D’Aliberti, Giuseppe",J Neurol,186,30

In HIV-1 the protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase enzymes are in a second reading frame relative to the structural group-specific antigen (gag), and their synthesis is dependent upon frameshifting. This ensures that a strictly regulated ratio of structural proteins and enzymes, which is critical for HIV-1 replication and viral infectivity, is maintained during protein synthesis. The frameshift element in HIV-1 RNA is an attractive target for the development of a new class of anti HIV-1 drugs. However, a number of examples are now emerging of human genes using −1 frameshifting, such as PEG10 and CCR5. In this study we have compared the HIV-1 and PEG10 frameshift elements and shown they have distinct functional characteristics. Frameshifting occurs at several points within each element. Moreover, frameshift modulators that were isolated by high-throughput screening of a library of 114,000 lead-like compounds behaved differently with the PEG10 frameshift element. The most effective compounds affecting the HIV-1 element enhanced frameshifting by 2.5-fold at 10 μM in two different frameshift reporter assay systems. HIV-1 protease:gag protein ratio was affected by a similar amount in a specific assay of virally-infected cultured cell, but the modulation of frameshifting of the first-iteration compounds was not sufficient to show significant effects on viral infectivity. Importantly, two compounds did not affect frameshifting with the human PEG10 element, while one modestly inhibited rather than enhanced frameshifting at the human element. These studies indicate that frameshift elements have unique characteristics that may allow targeting of HIV-1 and of other viruses specifically for development of antiviral therapeutic molecules without effect on human genes like PEG10 that use the same generic mechanism.","Cardno, Tony S.; Shimaki, Yosuke; Sleebs, Brad E.; Lackovic, Kurt; Parisot, John P.; Moss, Rebecca M.; Crowe-McAuliffe, Caillan; Mathew, Suneeth F.; Edgar, Christina D.; Kleffmann, Torsten; Tate, Warren P.",PLoS One,186,23

METHODS: In this case control study, 159 women with a single pregnancy and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and randomly selected 332 healthy pregnant women with similar gestational ages were included. COVID-19 patients were classified as mild, moderate, and severe. Vitamin D deficiency was defined as 25-hydroxycholecalciferol <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), and 25-OH D vitamin <10 ng/mL was defined as severe vitamin D deficiency, also 25-OH D vitamin level between 20-29 ng/mL (525-725 nmol/L) was defined as vitamin D insufficiency. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels of the pregnant women in the COVID-19 group (12.46) were lower than the control group (18.76). 25-OH D vitamin levels of those in the mild COVID-19 category (13.69) were significantly higher than those in the moderate/severe category (9.06). In terms of taking vitamin D supplementation, there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. However, it was observed that all of those who had severe COVID-19 were the patients who did not take vitamin D supplementation. CONCLUSION: The vitamin D levels are low in pregnant women with COVID-19. Also, there is a significant difference regarding to vitamin D level and COVID-19 severity in pregnant women. Maintenance of adequate vitamin D level can be useful as an approach for the prevention of an aggressive course of the inflammation induced by this novel coronavirus in pregnant women.","Sinaci, Selcan; Ocal, Doga Fatma; Yucel Yetiskin, Didem Fatma; Uyan Hendem, Derya; Buyuk, Gul Nihal; Goncu Ayhan, Sule; Tanacan, Atakan; Ozgu-Erdinc, A.

This study took place in an area of Stockholm, Sweden with high indications of socioeconomic disadvantage, a large part of the population with foreign background, as well as higher levels of poor health than the county average. It investigated staff perceptions of pathways from situations of low control, potentially leading to health inequities, affecting families enrolled in an early childhood home visiting programme during the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 23 child health care nurses and parental advisors working in a home visiting programme. The data was analysed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. RESULTS: The analysis resulted in five pathways on two explanatory levels, affecting parents’ health and parenting capacity and children’s health and well-being, potentially damaging health and leading to health inequities. The first four pathways related to control at the personal explanatory level: Families facing instability and insecurity; Caring for children in crowded and poor housing conditions; Experiencing restricted access to resources; and Parenting with limited social support. The fifth pathway, Living in a segregated society, covered the collective experience of lack of control on community level. The Covid-19 pandemic was observed to negatively affect all pathways and thus potentially aggravate health inequities for this population. The pandemic has also limited the delivery of home visits to the families which creates further barriers in families’ access to resources and increases isolation for parents with already limited social support. CONCLUSIONS: The diversity of pathways connected to health inequities presented in this study highlights the importance of considering this variety of influences when designing interventions for socioeconomically disadvantaged areas. The additional negative consequences of Covid-19 indicate the need for sustainable preventive early childhood interventions for families in such areas. The study also emphasizes the need for further research as well as policy action on possible long-term effects of changing behaviours during the Covid-19 period on child health and health equity.

This study analyzed the performance and correlation of two quantitative anti-S1 assays in oligo-/asymptomatic individuals from a population-based cohort. METHODS: In total, 362 plasma samples (108 with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR]-positive pharyngeal swabs, 111 negative controls, and 143 with positive serology without confirmation by RT-PCR) were tested with quantitative assays (Euroimmun Anti-SARS-CoV-2 QuantiVac enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EI-S1-IgG-quant]) and Roche Elecsys(®) Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S [Ro-RBD-Ig-quant]), which were compared with each other and confirmatory tests, including wild-type virus micro-neutralization (NT) and GenScript(®)cPass™. Square roots R of coefficients of determination were calculated for continuous variables and non-parametric tests were used for paired comparisons. RESULTS: Quantitative anti-S1 serology correlated well with each other (true positives, 96%; true negatives, 97%). Antibody titers decreased over time (< 30 to > 240 days after initial positive RT-PCR). Agreement with GenScript-cPass was 96%/99% for true positives and true negatives, respectively, for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and 93%/97% for EI-S1-IgG-quant. Ro-RBD-Ig-quant allowed distinct separation between positives and negatives, and less non-specific reactivity versus EI-S1-IgG-quant. Raw values (95% CI) ≥ 28.7 U/mL (22.6–36.4) for Ro-RBD-Ig-quant and ≥ 49.8 U/mL (43.4–57.1) for EI-S1-IgG-quant predicted NT > 1:5 in 95% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest both quantitative anti-S1 assays (EI-S1-IgG-quant and Ro-RBD-Ig-quant) may replace direct neutralization assays in quantitative measurement of immune protection against SARS-CoV-2 in certain circumstances. However, although the mean antibody titers for both assays tended to decrease over time, a higher proportion of Ro-RBD-Ig-quant values remained positive after 240 days.

The simulative study investigated the nucleotide sequence of closely related strains of respiratory syndrome viruses, codon-by-codon with maximum likelihood analysis, z selection, and the divergence time. The simulated results, dN/dS > 1 signify that an entire substitution model tends towards the hypothesis's positive evolution. The effect of transition/transversion proportion, Z-test of selection, and the evolution associated with these respiratory syndromes, are also analyzed. Z-test of selection for neutral and positive evolution indicates lower to positive values of dN-dS (0.012, 0.019) due to multiple substitutions in a short span. Modified Nei-Gojobori (P) statistical technique results also favor multiple substitutions with the transition/transversion rate from 1 to 7. The divergence time analysis also supports the result of dN/dS and imparts substantiating proof of evolution.

Therefore, prevention to be infected through social distancing and isolation is the most effective way. However, all the other physical and mental illnesses continue to exist, if possible even more burdened by the emergency situation and social distancing. The COVID-19 pandemic, especially in many low- and middle-income countries, has caused a deeper gap in seeking psychiatric help. In this scenario, telepsychiatry could play a decisive role in implementing clinical care for frail patients and ensuring continuous mental care. Therefore, we felt the urge to write this article to express our hope that the old health care system at this time of crisis, as we know it, can offer the chance to implement pervasive care technologies that perfectly fit current psychiatric needs.","Diwan, Mufaddal Najmuddin; Ali Awan, Hashir; Aamir, Alifiya; de Filippis, Renato; Ullah, Irfan",J Nerv Ment Dis,186,26

More and more reports show that the spread of COVID-19 involves infected individuals first passing through a pre-symptomatic infectious stage in addition to the incubation period and that many of the infectious individuals are asymptomatic. In this study, we design and use a mathematical model to primarily address the question of who are the main drivers of COVID-19 - the symptomatic infectious or the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious in the states of Florida, Arizona, New York, Wisconsin and the entire United States. We emphasize the benefit of lockdown by showing that for all four states, earlier and later lockdown dates decrease the number of cumulative deaths. This benefit of lockdown is also evidenced by the decrease in the infectious cases for Arizona and the entire US when lockdown is implemented earlier. When comparing the influence of the symptomatic infectious versus the presympomatic/asymptomatic infectious, it is shown that, in general, the larger contribution comes from the latter group. This is seen from several perspectives (1) in terms of daily cases, (2) in terms of daily cases when the influence of one group is targeted over the other by setting the effective contact rate(s) for the non-targeted group to zero, and (3) in terms of cumulative cases and deaths for the US and Arizona when the influence of one group is targeted over the other by setting the effective contact rate(s) for the non-targeted group to zero. The consequences of the difference in the contributions of the two infectious groups is simulated in terms of testing and these simulations show that an increase in testing and isolating for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious. For example, for the entire US, a 50% increase in testing for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group results in a 35% decrease in deaths as opposed to a lower 6% decrease in deaths when a 50% increase in testing rate for the symptomatic infectious is implemented. We also see that if the testing for infectious symptomatic is kept at the baseline value and the testing for the presymptomatic and asymptomatic is increased from 0.2 to 0.25, then the control reproduction number falls well below 1. On the other hand, to get even close to such a result when keeping the presymptomatic and asymptomatic at baseline fitted values, the symptomatic infectious testing rate must be increased considerably more - from 0.25 to 1.7. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (the most recent epicenter) and we find that such a strategy requires a significant number of deaths and as such is questionable in terms of success. We conclude with a brief summary of our results and some implications regarding COVID-19 control and mitigation strategies.","Scott, S.; Cook, K.; Barley, K.",,186,16

Ligation of 1,2,4-triazoles to the 1,2,3-triazole core was performed through Cu(I)-catalyzed cycloaddition of 1,2,4-triazole-based alkyne side chain 7 and/or 8 with several un/functionalized alkyl- and/or aryl-substituted azides 9–15 to afford the desired 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles 16–27, using both classical and microwave methods. After their spectroscopic characterization (infrared, (1)H, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance, and elemental analyses), an anticancer screening was carried out against some cancer cell lines including human colon carcinoma (Caco-2 and HCT116), human cervical carcinoma (HeLa), and human breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7). The outcomes of this exploration revealed that compounds 17, 22, and 25 had a significant anticancer activity against MCF-7 and Caco-2 cancer cell lines with IC(50) values of 0.31 and 4.98 μM, respectively, in relation to the standard reference drug, doxorubicin. Enzyme-docking examination was executed onto cyclin-dependent kinase 2; a promising aim for cancer medication. Synthesized compounds acquiring highest potency showcased superior interactions with the active site residue of the target protein and exhibited minimum binding energy. Finally, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to confirm the outcomes of the molecular docking and the experimental findings. The chemical reactivity descriptors such as softness (δ), global hardness (η), electronegativity (χ), and electrophilicity were calculated from the levels of the predicted frontier molecular orbitals and their energy gap. The DFT results and the molecular docking calculation results explained the activity of the most expectedly active compounds 17, 22, and 25.","Al Sheikh Ali, Adeeb; Khan, Daoud; Naqvi, Arshi; Al-blewi, Fawzia Faleh; Rezki, Nadjet; Aouad, Mohamed Reda; Hagar, Mohamed",ACS Omega,186,26

Off-target emetic effects associated with non-selective PDE4 inhibitors has prompted the development of selective PDE4 isozyme inhibitors for treating neuropsychiatric conditions. Herein, we examined the effect of a selective PDE4B inhibitor A33 (0–1.0 mg/kg) on alcohol drinking in both female and male mice from two genetically distinct C57BL/6 substrains. Under two different binge-drinking procedures, A33 pretreatment reduced alcohol intake in male and female mice of both substrains. In both drinking studies, there was no evidence for carry-over effects the next day; however, we did observe some sign of tolerance to A33’s effect on alcohol intake upon repeated, intermittent, treatment (5 injections of 1.0 mg/kg, every other day). Pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg of A33 augmented sucrose intake by C57BL/6NJ, but not C57BL/6J, mice. In mice with a prior history of A33 pretreatment during alcohol-drinking, A33 (1.0 mg/kg) did not alter spontaneous locomotor activity or basal motor coordination, nor did it alter alcohol’s effects on motor activity, coordination or sedation. In a distinct cohort of alcohol-naïve mice, acute pretreatment with 1.0 mg/kg of A33 did not alter motor performance on a rotarod and reduced sensitivity to the acute intoxicating effects of alcohol. These data provide the first evidence that selective PDE4B inhibition is an effective strategy for reducing excessive alcohol intake in murine models of binge drinking, with minimal off-target effects. Despite reducing sensitivity to acute alcohol intoxication, PDE4B inhibition reduces binge alcohol drinking, without influencing behavioral sensitivity to alcohol in alcohol-experienced mice. Furthermore, A33 is equally effective in males and females and exerts a quantitatively similar reduction in alcohol intake in mice with a genetic predisposition for high versus moderate alcohol preference. Such findings further support the safety and potential clinical utility of targeting PDE4 for treating AUD.","Jimenez Chavez, C.

Consensus guidelines continue to recommend oncologic resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy in these patients. We hypothesize that there is significant variability in compliance with this recommendation. METHODS: The National Cancer Database was queried from 2006 to 2015 for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by oncologic resection with a pCR (ypT0N0). Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to generate risk and reliability-adjusted rates of adjuvant chemotherapy utilization in patients with pCR at each hospital. RESULTS: In total, 2421 pCR patients were identified. Five-year overall survival was improved in pCR patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with those who did not (92 vs. 85%, p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis indicated that improvement in overall survival remained associated with adjuvant chemotherapy (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.44–0.82, p < 0.01). The mean adjuvant chemotherapy utilization rate among hospitals was 32%. There was an upward trend in use over the past decade, but two-thirds still do not receive the recommended therapy. High chemotherapy utilizer hospitals were more likely to be academic centers (54.9 vs. 45.9%, p < 0.01) when compared with low chemotherapy utilizers. CONCLUSION: Adjuvant chemotherapy is associated with improved survival in rectal cancer patients with pCR following neoadjuvant chemoradiation and oncologic resection. However, utilization among centers in the USA was only 32% with significant variability across centers. National efforts are needed to standardize treatment patterns according to national guidelines.","Morris, Mackenzie C.; Winer, Leah K.; Lee, Tiffany C.; Shah, Shimul A.; Rafferty, Janice F.; Paquette, Ian M.",J Gastrointest Surg,186,20

We investigated the presence of short-lived relative cross-protection conferred by specific prior viral infections against subsequent febrile respiratory illness (FRI). METHODS: Men enlisted in basic military training between December 2009 and December 2014 were recruited, with the first FRI as the study entry point. ResPlex II assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect viral pathogens in nasal wash samples, and survival analyses were performed to determine whether infection with particular viruses conferred short-lived relative cross-protection against FRI. RESULTS: Prior infection with adenovirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], .14–.44) or influenza virus (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, .38–.73) conferred relative protection against subsequent FRI episode. Results were statistically significant even after adjustment for the interval between enlistment and FRI (P < .001). Adenovirus-positive participants with FRI episodes tended to be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus/rhinovirus, and influenza virus (P = .062–.093), while men with influenza virus–positive FRI episodes tended be protected against subsequent infection with adenovirus (P = .044) and influenza virus (P = .081).

The majority of countries have relied on the former measures, followed by a ramping up of their testing and tracing capabilities. We present here the cases of South Korea, Italy, Canada and the United States, as a look back to lessons that can be drawn for controlling the pandemic, specifically through the means of testing and tracing. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data in each of the four countries, we first show that their combination of social-distancing and testing/tracing to date have had a significant impact on the evolution of their first wave of pandemic curves. We then consider the hypothetical scenario where the only NPI measures implemented past the first pandemic wave, consisted of isolating individuals due to repeated, country-scale testing and contact tracing, as a mean of lifting social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We give estimates on the average isolation rates needed to occur in each country. We find that testing and tracing each individual of a country, on average, every 4.5 days (South Korea), 5.7 days (Canada), 6 days (Italy) and 3.5 days (US), would have been sufficient to mitigate their second pandemic waves. We further show that to control infection resurgence during their second wave (Fall 2020), the countries would have needed higher rates, and we give explicit estimates for these new rates. We also considered a situation in Canada to see how a frequent large-scale asymptomatic testing and contact tracing can be used in combination with vaccination rollout to reduce the infection in the population. This offers an alternative approach towards preventing and controlling an outbreak when vaccine supply is limited, while testing capacity has been increasingly enhanced.","Humphrey, Lia; Thommes, Edward W.; Fields, Roie; Coudeville, Laurent; Hakim, Naseem; Chit, Ayman; Wu, Jianhong; Cojocaru, Monica G.",Infect Dis Model,186,16

Although the virus is not pandemic among humans, it poses a great threat to public health due to its zoonotic origin. Thus, both preventative and therapeutic countermeasures are urgently needed. In this study, we discovered a panel of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against MERS-CoV, which mapped to a wide range of regions on the spike (S) protein of the virus. In addition to mAbs with neutralizing epitopes located on the receptor-binding domain, one mAb, 5F9, which binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit, showed efficient neutralizing activity against the wild-type MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 0.2 μg/mL. We concluded that a novel neutralizing epitope for MERS-CoV also resides on the NTD of the S protein, indicating that the NTD might be important during the viral infection process.

It is unclear whether better access to coronavirus testing and more consistent use of testing could substantially reduce transmission. OBJECTIVE: To describe coronavirus testing in persons with new onset of febrile illness and analyze whether there are changes over time and differences by race and ethnicity. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the COVID-19 Citizen Science Study, launched in March 2020, which recruited participants via press release, word-of-mouth, and partner organizations. Participants completed daily surveys about COVID-19 symptoms and weekly surveys about coronavirus testing. All adults (aged at least 18 years) with a smartphone were eligible to join. For this analysis, US participants with new onset of febrile illness from April 2020 to October 2020 were included. Data analysis was performed from November 2020 to March 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Receipt of a coronavirus test result within 7 days of febrile illness onset. RESULTS: Of the 2679 participants included in this analysis, the mean (SD) age was 46.3 (13.4) years, 1983 were female (74%), 2017 were college educated (75%), and a total of 3865 distinct new febrile illness episodes were reported (300 episodes [7.8%] from Hispanic participants, 71 episodes [1.8%] from Black participants, and 3494 episodes [90.4%] from not Black, not Hispanic participants) between April 2 and October 23, 2020. In weekly surveys delivered during the 14 days after fever onset, 12% overall (753 participants) indicated receipt of a test result. Using serial survey responses and parametric time-to-event modeling, it was estimated that by 7 days after onset of febrile illness, a total of 20.5% (95% CI, 19.1%-22.0%) had received a test result. This proportion increased from 9.8% (95% CI, 7.5%-12.0%) early in the epidemic to 24.1% (95% CI, 21.5%-26.7%) at the end of July, but testing rates did not substantially improve since then, increasing to 25.9% (95% CI; 21.6%-30.3%) in late October at the start of the winter surge. Black participants reported receiving a test result about half as often as others (7% [7 of 103] of survey responses vs 12% [53 of 461] for Hispanic vs 13% [693 of 5516] for not Black, not Hispanic; P = .03). This association was not statistically significant in adjusted time-to-event models (hazard ratio = 0.59 vs not Black, not Hispanic participants; 95% CI, 0.26-1.34).

SARS‐CoV‐2 spreads very efficiently within mink farms once introduced, by direct and indirect contact, high within‐farm animal density increases the chance for transmission. Between‐farm spread is likely to occur once SARS‐CoV‐2 is introduced, short distance between SARS‐CoV‐2 positive farms is a risk factor. As of 29 January 2021, SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has been reported in 400 mink farms in eight countries in the European Union. In most cases, the likely introduction of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection into farms was infected humans. Human health can be at risk by mink‐related variant viruses, which can establish circulation in the community, but so far these have not shown to be more transmissible or causing more severe impact compared with other circulating SARS‐CoV‐2. Concerning animal health risk posed by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection the animal species that may be included in monitoring plans are American mink, ferrets, cats, raccoon dogs, white‐tailed deer and Rhinolophidae bats. All mink farms should be considered at risk of infection; therefore, the monitoring objective should be early detection. This includes passive monitoring (in place in the whole territory of all countries where animals susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 are bred) but also active monitoring by regular testing. First, frequent testing of farm personnel and all people in contact with the animals is recommended. Furthermore randomly selected animals (dead or sick animals should be included) should be tested using reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), ideally at weekly intervals (i.e. design prevalence approximately 5% in each epidemiological unit, to be assessed case by case). Suspected animals (dead or with clinical signs and a minimum five animals) should be tested for confirmation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection.

The project digiDEM Bayern will set up a prospective dementia registry to collect long-term data of people with dementia and their caregivers in Bavaria (Germany) supported by more than 300 research partners. Objective The objective of this article is to outline an information technology (IT) architecture for the integration of a registry and comprehensive participant management in a dementia study. Measures to ensure high data quality, study governance, along with data privacy, and security are to be included in the architecture. Methods The architecture was developed based on an iterative, stakeholder-oriented process. The development was inspired by the Twin Peaks Model that focuses on the codevelopment of requirements and architecture. We gradually moved from a general to a detailed understanding of both the requirements and design through a series of iterations. The experience learned from the pilot phase was integrated into a further iterative process of continuous improvement of the architecture. Results The infrastructure provides a standardized workflow to support the electronic data collection and trace each participant's study process. Therefore, the implementation consists of three systems: (1) electronic data capture system for Web-based or offline app-based data collection; (2) participant management system for the administration of the identity data of participants and research partners as well as of the overall study governance process; and (3) videoconferencing software for conducting interviews online. First experiences in the pilot phase have proven the feasibility of the framework. Conclusion This article outlines an IT architecture to integrate a registry and participant management in a dementia research project.

Preventing the spread of such diseases prioritizes the development of sensing devices that can rapidly, selectively, and reliably detect pathogens at minimal cost. Paper-based analytical devices (PADs) are promising tools that satisfy those criteria. Numerous paper-based biosensors have been established that rival conventional pathogen detection methods. Among them, colorimetric strategies are promising since results can be interpreted by eye, and are simple to operate, which is advantageous for point-of-care testing (POCT). Particularly, the application of nanomaterials on paper-based biosensors has become important as these materials are capable of converting signals from pathogens through unique mechanisms to yield an amplified colorimetric readout. To highlight the research progress on using nanomaterials in colorimetric paper-based biosensor for pathogen detection, we discuss the sensing mechanisms of how they work, structural and analytical characteristics of the devices, and representative recent applications. Current challenges and future directions of using PADs and nanomaterial-mediated strategies are also discussed.","Nguyen, Quynh Huong; Kim, Moon Il",Trends Analyt Chem,186,26

Ward-based i.e. point of care (POC) testing providing rapid results may alter the clinical management pathway. METHODS: FilmArray® RP polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were placed in three in-patient and out-patient medical areas. Patients presenting with influenza-like illness /upper respiratory tract infection +/− lower RTI were recruited between January–July 2015. FilmArray® POC testing occurred on even days of the month (intervention) or routine, laboratory-based RP PCR testing +/− atypical serology on odd days (control). The primary outcome was length of hospital stay. The secondary outcomes were impact on the use of antimicrobials, readmissions, all-cause mortality, length of ward stay and turn-around time (TAT) (time to result from admission). RESULTS: Of 606 eligible patients, 545 (89.9%) were included; 211 in the control arm and 334 in the intervention arm. 20% of control arm patients and 24% of intervention arm patients had an RP detected. POC testing was not associated with the primary outcome measure, length of stay, but reduced the TAT from 39.5 h to 19.0 h, p < 0.001. Only the prescribing decision differed between study arms, p < 0.001. When antivirals were given, the intervention was associated with a reduction in the median time to the first dose of 36 h and allowed appropriate treatment of mycoplasma infection. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between respiratory PCR POC testing and length of stay or most of the secondary outcomes except the antimicrobial prescribing decision. This was probably due to a delay in initiating FilmArray® testing. Despite this, POC testing allowed time-critical antivirals to be given significantly faster, appropriate mycoplasma treatment and results were available considerably faster than routine, laboratory-based testing. Ward-staff of all grades performed POC testing without difficulty suggesting potential use across many divergent healthcare settings. Further studies evaluating the implementation of rapid respiratory PCR POC testing and the effect on length of stay and antimicrobial use are required.

Recently, one of these drugs, Ivermectin, was reported as an inhibitor of the nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins in vitro, soon becoming the target of an international prospecting work (not yet published), with patients tested for COVID-19. However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of the biological components involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps in understanding how these relationships exist in the deactivation of viral infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-1 integrase gene were analyzed for their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the presence of two distinct groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as different degrees of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can be extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, SARS-CoV-2 and the functionality of the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be further decreased.","FÃ©lix, Pierre TeodÃ³sio",bioRxiv,186,16

Material and methods: Study of qualitative approach, of phenomenological design, where 80 obstetric interns from the different regions of Peru participated, who are also representatives of their hospital headquarters. An in-depth interview was applied where the perception of hospital practices was addressed according to: i) current problems and ii) solution proposals. Results: Midwifery interns have been removed from hospital practices, mainly due to the absence of personal protective equipment and health insurance, financially affecting those who must continue to make rent and food payments; Likewise, a large part of the universities have not offered proposals for solutions to the delay in internships, raising concerns about delays in administrative procedures, even more so for students from non-licensed universities. Among the proposals, those who are close to graduating suggest being exempted from the months when there were no activities, so as not to delay future processes such as tuition and rural service; likewise, suspend payment for these months and strengthen knowledge through the discussion of clinical cases, which could be virtual.

There is a number of differences between the sexes known to contribute to different immune responses and severity of the disease, one being the effect of estrogen via estrogen receptor signalling. We wondered if estrogen might also affect the SARS-CoV2 more directly, perhaps by binding to the surface glycoprotein (S protein), thus possibly reducing its infectivity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: To assess whether there is a possibility for estrogen binding on the SARS-CoV2 S protein, we used BLAST and HHpred to compare protein sequences of S protein and human estrogen receptor β, while 3D structures of a potential estrogen binding site and an active site of estrogen receptor β were visualized and compared using PyMOL. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: By comparing the sequence of SARS-CoV2 S protein with the human estrogen receptor β, we identified a potential estrogen binding site on S protein and further determined that it also shares notable similarities with the active site of ER β when observed in 3D structure of their respective proteins. As a control, SARS-CoV2 S protein was compared with the human androgen receptor, and no such similarities were found. The potential estrogen binding site is part of coronavirus S2 superfamily domain, which is involved in host-virus membrane fusion during infection and appears to be conserved throughout the Coronaviridae family. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: This preliminary communication shows that SARS-CoV2 S protein features a potential estrogen binding site. Hopefully, this will prompt a more comprehensive study on the possibilities of estrogen binding on the S protein and the effect this might confer on the virus infectivity.","Tomasović, Ante; Stanzer, Damir; Krešimir Svetec, Ivan; Svetec Miklenić, Marina",Food Technol Biotechnol,186,1

In total, 161 caregivers of children with ADHD were recruited in this study. The caregivers completed an online questionnaire to provide data regarding their intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19, concerns about the effectiveness and safety of vaccines, unfavorable family attitudes toward vaccines, and children’s medication use for ADHD and comorbid psychopathology. The factors related to caregiver intentions to vaccinate their child were examined using linear regression analysis. The results indicated that 25.5% of caregivers were hesitant to vaccinate their children with ADHD, and 11.8% refused to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. The caregivers’ concerns about the safety of vaccines and children’s regular use of medication for ADHD were negatively associated with caregiver intentions to vaccinate, whereas the children’s comorbid conduct or oppositional defiant problems were positively associated with the caregiver intentions to vaccinate. An intervention that enhances caregiver intentions to vaccinate their children with ADHD against COVID-19 by addressing the related factors found in this study is warranted.","Tsai, Ching-Shu; Hsiao, Ray C.; Chen, Yu-Min; Yen, Cheng-Fang",Vaccines (Basel),186,1

Decreased moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and increased sedentary time may be exacerbating pandemic-related symptoms of anxiety and depression, but existing studies exploring these associations are almost entirely cross-sectional. METHODS: Reported data from 2018 and Summer 2020 were used to create change categories based on compliance with MVPA guidelines and relative sedentary time. Participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) in Summer 2020. Associations among changes in MVPA and sedentary time (separately and jointly) with psychological distress (total PHQ-4 score) were examined with ordinal logistic regression and associations with depressive or anxiety symptoms were examined with logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 2,240 participants (65% women, mean age 57.5 years), 67% increased sedentary time and 21% became inactive between the two time points. After multivariate adjustment, participants who became (OR = 1.71, 95% CI: 1.05–2.78) or remained inactive (OR = 2.07, 1.34–3.22) were more likely to experience depressive symptoms compared to those who remained active. Participants who increased sedentary time were also more likely to experience depressive symptoms compared to those who maintained sedentary time (OR = 1.78, 1.13–2.81). Jointly, those who increased sedentary time while remaining (OR = 3.67, 1.83–7.38) or becoming inactive (OR = 3.02, 1.44–6.34) were much more likely to have depressive symptoms compared to the joint referent (remained active/maintained sedentary time). Associations with anxiety symptoms were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the value of promoting MVPA and limiting sedentary time during stressful events associated with psychological distress, like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rees-Punia, Erika; Newton, Christina C.; Westmaas, J.

Bats have been recognized as one of the most important reservoirs for emerging viruses and the transmission of a coronavirus that originated in bats to humans via intermediate hosts was responsible for the high-impact emerging zoonosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)(2–10). Here we provide virological, epidemiological, evolutionary and experimental evidence that a novel HKU2-related bat coronavirus, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), is the aetiological agent that was responsible for a large-scale outbreak of fatal disease in pigs in China that has caused the death of 24,693 piglets across four farms. Notably, the outbreak began in Guangdong province in the vicinity of the origin of the SARS pandemic. Furthermore, we identified SADS-related CoVs with 96–98% sequence identity in 9.8% (58 out of 591) of anal swabs collected from bats in Guangdong province during 2013–2016, predominantly in horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) that are known reservoirs of SARS-related CoVs. We found that there were striking similarities between the SADS and SARS outbreaks in geographical, temporal, ecological and aetiological settings. This study highlights the importance of identifying coronavirus diversity and distribution in bats to mitigate future outbreaks that could threaten livestock, public health and economic growth.","Zhou, Peng; Fan, Hang; Lan, Tian; Yang, Xing-Lou; Shi, Wei-Feng; Zhang, Wei; Zhu, Yan; Zhang, Ya-Wei; Xie, Qing-Mei; Mani, Shailendra; Zheng, Xiao-Shuang; Li, Bei; Li, Jin-Man; Guo, Hua; Pei, Guang-Qian; An, Xiao-Ping; Chen, Jun-Wei; Zhou, Ling; Mai, Kai-Jie; Wu, Zi-Xian; Li, Di; Anderson, Danielle E.; Zhang, Li-Biao; Li, Shi-Yue; Mi, Zhi-Qiang; He, Tong-Tong; Cong, Feng; Guo, Peng-Ju; Huang, Ren; Luo, Yun; Liu, Xiang-Ling; Chen, Jing; Huang, Yong; Sun, Qiang; Zhang, Xiang-Li-Lan; Wang, Yuan-Yuan; Xing, Shao-Zhen; Chen, Yan-Shan; Sun, Yuan; Li, Juan; Daszak, Peter; Wang, Lin-Fa; Shi, Zheng-Li; Tong, Yi-Gang; Ma, Jing-Yun",Nature,186,20

Both receptor binding and membrane fusion activities are mediated by the virus spike glycoprotein(5–7). As with other class-I membrane-fusion proteins, the spike protein is post-translationally cleaved, in this case by furin, into the S1 and S2 components that remain associated after cleavage(8–10). Fusion activation after receptor binding is proposed to involve the exposure of a second proteolytic site (S2′), cleavage of which is required for the release of the fusion peptide(11,12). Here we analyse the binding of ACE2 to the furin-cleaved form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using cryo-electron microscopy. We classify ten different molecular species, including the unbound, closed spike trimer, the fully open ACE2-bound trimer and dissociated monomeric S1 bound to ACE2. The ten structures describe ACE2-binding events that destabilize the spike trimer, progressively opening up, and out, the individual S1 components. The opening process reduces S1 contacts and unshields the trimeric S2 core, priming the protein for fusion activation and dissociation of ACE2-bound S1 monomers. The structures also reveal refolding of an S1 subdomain after ACE2 binding that disrupts interactions with S2, which involves Asp614(13–15) and leads to the destabilization of the structure of S2 proximal to the secondary (S2′) cleavage site.","Benton, Donald J.; Wrobel, Antoni G.; Xu, Pengqi; Roustan, Chloë; Martin, Stephen R.; Rosenthal, Peter B.; Skehel, John J.; Gamblin, Steven J.",Nature,186,21

SOVA ambassadors are adolescents and young adults (AYA) asked to write monthly blog posts and comments on others’ posts on topics surrounding mental health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the feasibility and acceptability of peer blogging for a moderated mental health intervention website and explore whether bloggers—AYA who self-report symptoms of depression and anxiety—experience potential benefits. METHODS: AYA aged 14 to 26 years with a self-reported history of depression or anxiety were recruited to the SOVA Peer Ambassador Program. Participants were asked to write one blog post a month and comment at least four times a month on other blog posts, for which they were compensated for up to US $15 monthly. Outcome variables measured at baseline and 3 months after intervention included website usability and feasibility, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, mental health treatment history, cybercoping, personal blogging style, self-esteem, loneliness, mental health stigma, social support, and positive youth development characteristics. Open-ended questions were asked about their blogging acceptability and usability. RESULTS: Of 66 AYA showing interest and completing onboarding, 71% (47/66) wrote at least one blog post, with an average of 3 posts per person. A sample of 51% (34/66) of participants completed a 3-month survey for the full analysis. Almost all 34 participants were satisfied with the experience of blogging (32/34, 94%) and rated the website usability as good (80.1, SD 14.9).

We report herein that the interferon (IFN) stimulated exoribonuclease gene of 20 KD (ISG20) inhibits HBV replication through degradation of HBV RNA. ISG20 expression was observed at basal level and was highly upregulated upon IFN treatment in hepatocytes, and knock down of ISG20 resulted in elevation of HBV replication and attenuation of IFN-mediated antiviral effect. The sequence element conferring the susceptibility of HBV RNA to ISG20-mediated RNA degradation was mapped at the HBV RNA terminal redundant region containing epsilon (ε) stem-loop. Furthermore, ISG20-induced HBV RNA degradation relies on its ribonuclease activity, as the enzymatic inactive form ISG20(D94G) was unable to promote HBV RNA decay. Interestingly, ISG20(D94G) retained antiviral activity against HBV DNA replication by preventing pgRNA encapsidation, resulting from a consequence of ISG20-ε interaction. This interaction was further characterized by in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and ISG20 was able to bind HBV ε directly in absence of any other cellular proteins, indicating a direct ε RNA binding capability of ISG20; however, cofactor(s) may be required for ISG20 to efficiently degrade ε. In addition, the lower stem portion of ε is the major ISG20 binding site, and the removal of 4 base pairs from the bottom portion of ε abrogated the sensitivity of HBV RNA to ISG20, suggesting that the specificity of ISG20-ε interaction relies on both RNA structure and sequence. Furthermore, the C-terminal Exonuclease III (ExoIII) domain of ISG20 was determined to be responsible for interacting with ε, as the deletion of ExoIII abolished in vitro ISG20-ε binding and intracellular HBV RNA degradation. Taken together, our study sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of IFN-mediated HBV inhibition and the antiviral mechanism of ISG20 in general.","Liu, Yuanjie; Nie, Hui; Mao, Richeng; Mitra, Bidisha; Cai, Dawei; Yan, Ran; Guo, Ju-Tao; Block, Timothy M.; Mechti, Nadir; Guo, Haitao",PLoS Pathog,186,16

However, achievement of lung concentrations predicted to have in vivo antiviral efficacy might not be possible with the currently proposed oral dosing regimens. Further, high cumulative doses of HCQ raise concerns of systemic toxicity, including cardiotoxicity. Here, we describe a preclinical study to investigate the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of a novel formulation of liposomal HCQ administered by intratracheal (IT) instillation in Sprague‐Dawley rats.
