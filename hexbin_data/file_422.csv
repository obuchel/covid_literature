3726,3726,3726,"Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: An Overview of Pathophysiology, Models and Acute Injury Mechanisms",10.140222,5.045703,2019-03-22,"Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a life changing neurological condition with substantial socioeconomic implications for patients and their care-givers. Recent advances in medical management of SCI has significantly improved diagnosis, stabilization, survival rate and well-being of SCI patients. However, there has been small progress on treatment options for improving the neurological outcomes of SCI patients. This incremental success mainly reflects the complexity of SCI pathophysiology and the diverse biochemical and physiological changes that occur in the injured spinal cord. Therefore, in the past few decades, considerable efforts have been made by SCI researchers to elucidate the pathophysiology of SCI and unravel the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tissue degeneration and repair in the injured spinal cord. To this end, a number of preclinical animal and injury models have been developed to more closely recapitulate the primary and secondary injury processes of SCI. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of SCI. We will also discuss the neurological outcomes of human SCI and the available experimental model systems that have been employed to identify SCI mechanisms and develop therapeutic strategies for this condition.","Alizadeh, Arsalan; Dyck, Scott Matthew; Karimi-Abdolrezaee, Soheila",Front Neurol,422,1
4357,4357,4357,Pioneering Experience of Uniportal Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery for Anterior Release of Severe Thoracic Scoliosis,10.287006,4.6486692,2020-01-21,"The optimal way to treat severe thoracic scoliosis remains controversial. Compared with conventional procedures, the uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UniVATS) rises in popularity in thoracic surgery because of less pain and faster recovery. This retrospective study aimed to apply UniVATS to treat severe thoracic scoliosis. Between October 2013 and March 2018, eight scoliotic patients with extremely large Cobb angle and profoundly limited flexibility underwent UniVATS for anterior release, followed by posterior instrumentation and fusion. The mean age at the time of surgery was 14.8 ± 2.4 years and the mean follow-up was 2.2 ± 1.3 years. The average levels of anterior thoracic discectomy and posterior fusion were 3.6 ± 0.7 and 11.5 ± 1.2, respectively. The mean coronal and sagittal correction rates were 70 ± 19% and 71 ± 23%, respectively. UniVATS contributed to minor access trauma (3-cm incision) with minimal blood loss, shorter operation time (75 ± 13 mins), less requirement of stay in the intensive care unit (0.3 ± 0.5 day) or chest tube placement (0.3 ± 0.7 day), speedier and narcotic-free recovery, and earlier ambulation within one day. This is the first study to assess the safety and efficacy of UniVATS in the treatment of severely stiff thoracic scoliosis, providing comparable surgical outcomes, less pain, faster recovery and superior cosmetic results without significant complications.","Hsu, Cheng-Min; Wu, Kuan-Wen; Lin, Mong-Wei; Kuo, Ken N.; Chang, Jia-Feng; Wang, Ting-Ming",Sci Rep,422,31
4754,4754,4754,Bacterial survival in evaporating deposited droplets on a teflon-coated surface,10.153437,5.154832,2006-10-20,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) are exposed to infectious diseases throughout the course of their work. The concerns of pregnant HCWs are considerable because certain otherwise mild infections may affect fetal development. We studied 424 pregnant HCWs at the University Hospital Frankfurt between March 2007 and July 2011. Serological tests were carried out for varicella zoster virus (VZV), measles, mumps, rubella (MMR), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and parvovirus B19. Our overall seroprevalence data with regard to VZV, MMR, CMV and parvovirus B 19 corresponded to the general population. However, physicians demonstrated lower seroprevalence towards the two non-vaccine-preventable diseases (CMV: 37.5% [KI 27.4–48.5]; parvovirus B19: 69.3% [KI 58.6–78.7]) compared with nurses (CMV: 53.4% [KI 46.1–60.6], parvovirus B19: 75.1% [68.4–81.1]). It was striking that, only one in five of the study population showed IgG antibodies against all of the six pregnant-relevant viral diseases tested, of the physicians as few as one in six. A routine exclusion from the workplace due to non-immunity would mean that it would not be possible to employ the majority of pregnant staff in healthcare and childcare.","Wicker, S.; Friedrichs, I.; Rabenau, H.F.",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,422,1

CD66a, CD66b, CD66c and CD66d mAb binding to neutrophils triggers an activation signal that regulates the adhesive activity of CD11/CD18, resulting in an increase in neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Molecular modeling of CEACAM1 using IgG and CD4 as models has been performed, and three peptides from the N‐terminal domain were found to increase neutrophil adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cell monolayers. The peptides were 14 amino acids in length and were predicted to be present at loops and turns between β‐sheets. To better understand the amino acid sequences critical for this biological activity, in the present study we examined the other neutrophil CEACAMs and the highly homologous CEACAM, CEA. Molecular modeling of the N‐terminal domains of human CEACAM8, ‐6, ‐3 and CEA was performed. Twenty peptides, each 14 amino acids in length, that were homologous to the previously reported peptides from the N‐domains of CEACAM1, were synthesized and tested for their ability to alter neutrophil adhesion. Only one new peptide, from the N‐domain of CEA, was found to increase neutrophil adhesion, and this peptide differed from the corresponding CEACAM1 peptide by only a single conservative amino acid substitution. Importantly, minor amino acid differences between active and inactive homologous peptides suggest regions of these peptides that are critical for biological activity. The data suggest that the regions SMPF of peptide CD66a‐1, QLFG of peptide CD66a‐2 and NRQIV of peptide CD66a‐3 are critical for the activities of these peptides, and for the native CEACAMs.","Skubitz, K.M.; Campbell, K.D.; Skubitz, A.

We investigated the effect of intubation in trauma patients with a GCS 6–8, with the hypothesis that intubation would increase mortality and length of stay. METHODS: We studied adult patients with GCS 6–8 from the 2016 National Trauma Data Bank. Intubated and non-intubated patients were compared using inverse probability weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) to control for injury severity and patient characteristics. Outcomes were mortality, intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS), and total LOS. Stratified analysis was performed to investigate the effect in patients with and without head injuries. RESULTS: Among 6676 patients with a GCS between 6 and 84,078 were intubated within 1 h of arrival to the emergency department. The overall mortality rate was 15.1%. IPWRA revealed an increase in mortality associated with intubation (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.03, 1.06). The results were similar in patients with head injuries (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02, 1.06) and without (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03, 1.10). Among the 5,742 patients admitted to the ICU, intubation was associated with a 14% increase in ICU LOS (95% CI 8–20%; 5.5 vs. 4.8 days; p < 0.001). The overall length of stay was 27% longer (95% CI 19.8–34.3%) among intubated patients (mean 7.7 vs 6.0 days; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among patients with GCS of 6 to 8, intubation on arrival was associated with an increase in mortality and with longer ICU and overall length of stay. The use of a strict threshold GCS to mandate intubation should be revisited.","Hatchimonji, Justin S.; Dumas, Ryan P.; Kaufman, Elinore J.; Scantling, Dane; Stoecker, Jordan B.; Holena, Daniel N.",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,422,1

Severe cases can lead to ventilatory failure. Incomplete phrenic nerve injuries in other populations has been shown to respond to diaphragmatic stimulation. We therefore proposed an early assessment for incomplete denervation by laparoscopic direct stimulation of the diaphragm and placement of a diaphragmatic pacing system to enhance diaphragm function. CASE PRESENTATION: A 3 year-old girl presented with AFM with clinically and electrodiagnostically severe involvement of all four limbs and muscles of respiration. Direct stimulation of the diaphragm demonstrated contraction and a diaphragmatic stimulator was placed at 3 weeks post presentation. The patient was immediately able to tolerate short bouts of reduced ventilation settings. Electromyography via the pacing wires demonstrated intact motor units consistent with partial denervation/reinnervation in the left hemidiaphragm, and no motor units in the right hemidiaphragm. At three months, she tolerated 6 h of pacing on pressure support setting. At 5 months she demonstrated larger tidal volumes with active pacing than without. DISCUSSION: In our experience, AFM patients who require chronic ventilator support are rarely able to be weaned. Despite clinical and surface electrodiagnostic evidence of complete phrenic nerve involvement, the patient’s diaphragm responded to direct stimulation. The patient preferred pacing over non-pacing times and showed improved ventilatory ability with pacing as opposed to without, though remains ventilator-dependent. These findings support augmentation of diaphragm function and possible enhanced recovery of spontaneous function.","Edmiston, Travis L.; Elrick, Mathew J.; Kovler, Mark L.; Jelin, Eric B.; Onders, Raymond P.; Sadowsky, Cristina L.",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,422,31

An online survey of self-reported burnout symptoms and meaning in work was conducted to assess the prevalence of burnout and characteristics of meaning in work among spinal cord injury professionals. OBJECTIVES: To assess symptoms of professional burnout and meaning in work among a broad-ranging cohort of spinal cord injury clinicians and researchers. SETTING: A group of international spinal cord injury professionals. METHODS: An online survey was developed using commonly assessed metrics of burnout and meaning in work based upon prior literature. RESULTS: A majority of survey respondents reported feeling exhaustion (60.1%), while fewer reported feelings of burnout (41.1%) or work-life imbalance (31.9%). Many respondents found support in personal relationship from friends and family and reported using various strategies to deal with work stress, including exercise, meditation, and engaging in personally meaningful activities outside of work. CONCLUSIONS: Exhaustion is a prevalent issue for many spinal cord injury professionals and burnout appears to be a significant issue for a subset of responders, yet despite potential workplace stressors, spinal cord injury professionals reported high meaningfulness of work, positive impact from colleagues, and satisfaction with intellectual stimulation at work.","Slocum, Chloe; Stillman, Michael; Capron, Maclain; Alexander, Sterling; Hultling, Claes",Spinal Cord Ser Cases,422,1

The receptor of IL-22, however, is preferentially detected on peripheral tissue epithelial cells. IL-22 functions as a unique messenger from immune system to tissue epithelial cells and to regulate homeostasis of epithelia. IL-22 is able to directly enhance antimicrobial defense mechanisms in epithelial cells and to facilitate epithelial barrier repair and wound healing process. It, therefore, possesses an irreplaceable role in host defense against certain pathogens that specifically invade epithelial cells. In addition, IL-22 can help to preserve the integrity and homeostasis of various epithelial organs during infection or inflammation. The importance of its tissue-protective function is manifested in many inflammatory situations such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and hepatitis. On the other hand, as a cytokine, IL-22 is capable of induction of proinflammatory responses, especially in synergy with other cytokines. Consequently, IL-22 contributes to pathogenesis of certain inflammatory diseases for example psoriasis.","Wang, Xiaoting; Ouyang, Wenjun",Cytokine Frontiers,422,1

Intestinal immune mechanisms must be studied directly and incorporated into models based on the observations made using intestinal cells and not just systemic cells. Numerous reports in the literature compare and contrast mucosal and systemic responses; however, despite their tissue-specific variations, the different tissues do interact. The procedures used to isolate cells from gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) are traumatic or include enzyme digestion. A technique should be selected that is efficient yet gentle enough to provide viable and functional cells. Moreover, the cells contaminating leukocyte preparations can affect the functional assays. This necessitates that positive controls are put through the procedure or even added to intestinal pieces before isolation. If these cells demonstrate a positive response following this handling, then one is more confident of negative results observed in the isolated intestinal cells.","ERNST, P.B.; BIENENSTOCK, J.; DYCK, N.; BEFUS, A.D.; LEE, T.D.G.",Cell Separation,422,19

Interferon β (IFN-β) is a single protein species and is molecularly related to IFN-α subtypes, although it is antigenically distinct from them. IFN omega (IFN-ω) is antigenically distinct from IFN-α and IFN-β but is molecularly related to both. The genes of three IFN subtypes are tandemly arranged on the short arm of chromosome 9. They are transiently expressed following induction by various exogenous stimuli, including viruses. They are synthesized from their respective mRNAs for relatively short periods following gene activation and are secreted to act, via specific cell surface receptors, on other cells. IFN-α subtypes are secreted proteins and as such are transcribed from mRNAs as precursor proteins, pre-IFN-α, containing N-terminal signal polypeptides of 23 hydrophobic amino acids (aa) mainly. Pre-IFN-β contains 187 aa, of which 21 comprise the N-terminal signal polypeptide and 166 comprise the mature IFN-β protein. IFN-ω contains 195 aa—the N-terminal 23 comprising the signal sequence and the remaining 172, the mature IFN-ω protein. At the C-terminus, the aa sequence of IFN-ω is six residues longer than that of IFN-α or IFN-β proteins. IFN-α, as a mixture of subtypes, and IFN-ω may be produced together following viral infection of null lymphocytes or monocytes/macrophages. The biological activities of IFNs are mostly dependent upon protein synthesis with selective subsets of proteins mediating individual activities. IFNs can also stimulate indirect antiviral and antitumor mechanisms, depending upon cellular differentiation and the induction of cytotoxic activity.","Meager, Anthony",Cytokines,422,19

Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S.E) has emerged as one of the most important food-borne pathogens. However, major studies still focus on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Here, we reported that AvrA, a S. Enteritidis effector, inhibited autophagy to promote bacterial survival in the host. We found that AvrA regulates the conversion of LC3 I into LC3 II and the enrichment of lysosomes. Beclin-1, a key molecular regulator of autophagy, was decreased after AvrA expressed strain colonization. In S.E-AvrA(−)-infected cells, we found the increases of protein levels of p-JNK and p-c-Jun and the transcription level of AP-1. AvrA-reduction of Beclin-1 protein expression is through the JNK pathway. The JNK inhibitor abolished the AvrA-reduced Beclin-1 protein expression. Moreover, we identified that the AvrA mutation C186A abolished its regulation of Beclin-1 expression. In addition AvrA protein was found interacted with Beclin-1. In organoids and infected mice, we explored the physiologically related effects and mechanism of AvrA in reducing Beclin-1 through the JNK pathway, thus attenuating autophagic responses. This finding not only indicates an important role of S. Enteritidis effector in reducing host protein as a strategy to suppress autophagy, but also suggests manipulating autophagy as a new strategy to treat infectious diseases.","Jiao, Yang; Zhang, Yong-guo; Lin, Zhijie; Lu, Rong; Xia, Yinglin; Meng, Chuang; Pan, Zhimin; Xu, Xiulong; Jiao, Xinan; Sun, Jun",Front Immunol,422,1

Operative, angioembolic, and nonoperative strategies are management options, although the association between management strategy and outcomes is unknown. This study endeavored to define the epidemiology, management strategy, and outcomes after penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery presenting to trauma centers nationwide. METHODS: Patients with veterbral artery injuries were identified from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) (2016–2017) using ICD-10-CM codes. Only those with penetrating mechanisms of injury were included in the study. Transferred patients were excluded. Study groups were defined by management strategy (Operative management, OM; angioembolization, AE; and nonoperative management, NOM). Patient demographics, injury characteristics, and outcomes were compared between groups using univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis with logistic regression was used to examine independent risk factors for mortality and stroke. RESULTS: Penetrating injuries to the vertebral artery were rare (n = 476, < 1% of NTDB patient population). Median age was 28 [IQR 21–37] years and 81% (n = 385) of patients were male. Interpersonal violence was the most common injury intent (n = 374, 79%). Most patients were managed with NOM (n = 409, 86%), with AE and OM utilized less frequently (8% and 6%, respectively). Stab wounds were the most frequent mechanism of injury among patients managed with OM (62%), while gunshot wounds were most common among patients managed with NOM (84%) or AE (79%). Multivariate analysis of risk factors for stroke revealed only associated carotid artery injury (OR 4.236, 95% CI 1.284–13.970, p = 0.018) and AE (OR 6.342, 95% CI 1.417–28.399, p = 0.016) were independent predictors. Independent risk factors for mortality were advanced age (OR 1.026, 95% CI 1.001–1.052, p = 0.044); elevated ISS (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.008–1.052, p = 0.006); and associated traumatic brain injury (OR 3.020, 95% CI 1.333–6.843, p = 0.008). Higher ED GCS was independently associated with reduced mortality (OR 0.788, 95% CI 0.731–0.849, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Vertebral artery injuries after penetrating mechanisms are infrequent in the United States. Patients with these injuries tend to be young adult men who were injured by gunshot wounds as a result of interpersonal violence. The majority of these injuries were managed nonoperatively, with operative intervention required most commonly for patients injured by stab wounds. Risk factors for both stroke and mortality were principally due to patient factors and associated injuries. Increased risk of stroke among patients managed with angioembolization will need to be further investigated with future study to determine if this risk is imparted from the management strategy itself or from underlying injury characteristics.","Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Cowan, Shaun; Strickland, Matt; Lewis, Meghan; Clark, Damon H.; Inaba, Kenji",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,422,1

There is limited data on the use of ultrasound in anesthesiology, which provides clinicians and researchers opportunity to study its use during the perioperative period.","Tran, Timothy T.; Hlaing, Maung; Krause, Martin",Curr Anesthesiol Rep,422,1

However, most current models do not consider the impact of the inflammatory response on the later stages of bone repair. Indeed, as initiator of the healing process, this early phase can alter the regenerative outcome: if the inflammatory response is too strongly down- or upregulated, the fracture can result in a non-union. This review covers the fundamental information on fracture healing, in silico modeling and experimental validation. It starts with a description of the biology of fracture healing, paying particular attention to the inflammatory phase and its cellular and subcellular components. We then discuss the current state-of-the-art regarding in silico models of the immune response in different tissues as well as the bone regeneration process at the later stages of fracture healing. Combining the aforementioned biological and computational state-of-the-art, continuous, discrete and hybrid modeling technologies are discussed in light of their suitability to capture adequately the multiscale course of the inflammatory phase and its overall role in the healing outcome. Both in the establishment of models as in their validation step, experimental data is required. Hence, this review provides an overview of the different in vitro and in vivo set-ups that can be used to quantify cell- and tissue-scale properties and provide necessary input for model credibility assessment. In conclusion, this review aims to provide hands-on guidance for scientists interested in building in silico models as an additional tool to investigate the critical role of the inflammatory phase in bone regeneration.","Lafuente-Gracia, Laura; Borgiani, Edoardo; Nasello, Gabriele; Geris, Liesbet",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,422,21

Over the past 70 years, tremendous progress has been made in solid organ transplantation, particularly in T-cell-targeted immunosuppression and organ allocation systems. However, humoral alloimmune responses remain a major challenge to progress. Patients with preexisting antibodies to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) are at significant disadvantages in regard to receiving a well-matched organ, moreover, those who develop anti-HLA antibodies after transplantation face a significant foreshortening of renal allograft survival. Historical therapies to desensitize patients prior to transplantation or to treat posttransplant AMR have had limited effectiveness, likely because they do not significantly reduce antibody levels, as plasma cells, the source of antibody production, remain largely unaffected. Herein, we will discuss the significance of plasma cells in transplantation, aspects of their biology as potential therapeutic targets, clinical challenges in developing strategies to target plasma cells in transplantation, and lastly, novel approaches that have potential to advance the field.","Rossi, Amy P; Alloway, Rita R; Hildeman, David; Woodle, E Steve",Immunological reviews,422,1

However, current methods for viral detection in wastewater are severely lacking in terms of scaling up for high throughput. In the present study, we employed an automated magnetic-bead-based concentration approach for viral detection in sewage that can effectively be scaled up for processing 24 samples in a single 40-min run. The method compared favorably to conventionally used methods for viral wastewater concentrations with higher recovery efficiencies from input sample volumes as low as 10 ml and can enable the processing of over 100 wastewater samples in a day. The sensitivity of the high-throughput protocol was shown to detect 1 asymptomatic individual in a building of 415 residents. Using the high-throughput pipeline, samples from the influent stream of the primary wastewater treatment plant of San Diego County (serving 2.3 million residents) were processed for a period of 13 weeks. Wastewater estimates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral genome copies in raw untreated wastewater correlated strongly with clinically reported cases by the county, and when used alongside past reported case numbers and temporal information in an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model enabled prediction of new reported cases up to 3 weeks in advance. Taken together, the results show that the high-throughput surveillance could greatly ameliorate comprehensive community prevalence assessments by providing robust, rapid estimates.IMPORTANCE Wastewater monitoring has a lot of potential for revealing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreaks before they happen because the virus is found in the wastewater before people have clinical symptoms. However, application of wastewater-based surveillance has been limited by long processing times specifically at the concentration step. Here we introduce a much faster method of processing the samples and show its robustness by demonstrating direct comparisons with existing methods and showing that we can predict cases in San Diego by a week with excellent accuracy, and 3 weeks with fair accuracy, using city sewage. The automated viral concentration method will greatly alleviate the major bottleneck in wastewater processing by reducing the turnaround time during epidemics.","Karthikeyan, Smruthi; Ronquillo, Nancy; Belda-Ferre, Pedro; Alvarado, Destiny; Javidi, Tara; Longhurst, Christopher A; Knight, Rob",mSystems,422,1

The aim of the study was to compare the outcome of open and laparoscopic appendectomies during a transition period. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective cohort study with prospectively collected data. All patients who underwent an operation for suspected appendicitis at the Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital in Stockholm between 2006 and 2010 were included in the study. RESULTS 1745 children were included in this study, of whom 1010 had a laparoscopic intervention. There were no significant differences in the rate of postoperative abscesses, wound infections, readmissions or reoperations between the two groups. The median operating time was longer for laparoscopic appendectomy than for open appendectomy, 51 vs. 37minutes (p<0.05). The postoperative length of stay was similar in the two groups. A simple comparison between the groups suggested that laparoscopic appendectomy had a shorter median postoperative length of stay, 43 vs. 57hours (p<0.05). However, there was a trend in time for a shorter postoperative length of stay, and a trend for more of the procedures to be performed laparoscopically over time so on regression analysis, the apparent decrease in length of stay with laparoscopy could be ascribed to the general trend toward decreased length of stay over time, with no specific additional effect of laparoscopy. CONCLUSIONS Our data show no difference in outcome between open and laparoscopic surgery for acute appendicitis in children in regard of complications. The initial assumption that the patients treated with laparoscopic surgery had a shorter postoperative stay was not confirmed with linear regression, which showed that the assumed difference was due only to a trend toward shorter postoperative length of stay over time, regardless of the surgical intervention.","Svensson, Jan F; Patkova, Barbora; Almström, Markus; Eaton, Simon; Wester, Tomas",Journal of pediatric surgery,422,1

METHODS We performed a retrospective review of our interventional database for consecutive patients who underwent treatment for acute ischemic stroke with the Baby Trevo device between February and December 2014. RESULTS Of 134 patients treated during the study period, 8 underwent treatment with the Baby Trevo for distal occlusions. Their mean age was 51±20 years, 5 (62.5%) were male, mean baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 19±5. The mean interval between the time the patient was last-known normal to groin puncture was 527±285 min, and the overall procedural length was 110±26 min. Intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator was used in 5 (62.5%) cases. The device was used for a total of 10 branches: five middle cerebral artery (four superior M3 and one inferior M3), three anterior cerebral arteries (two pericallosal and one callosomarginal), and two posterior cerebral arteries (one P2 and one P3) occlusions. All patients achieved complete recanalization of the artery targeted by the Baby Trevo (arterial occlusive lesion 3). Good capillary reperfusion (TICI 2b-3) was noted in 6 (75%) cases. One pass was performed in 7 vessels and 2 passes in three branches. Vasospasm was noted in 5 (62.5%) of the vessels and fully responded to intra-arterial vasodilator infusion. Follow-up MRI revealed no infarct within the territory vascularized by the artery targeted by the Baby Trevo in 4 cases, partial infarct in 5, and complete infarct in 1. Two patients had parenchymal hematomas (one PH1 and one PH2). No vessel perforations, dissections, or subarachnoid hemorrhage were noted. CONCLUSIONS Our initial data suggest that treatment of distal cerebrovascular occlusions with the Trevo XP 3×20 mm Retriever is feasible. Although this device emerges as a promising technology for small and tortuous distal intracranial vessels, larger studies are still necessary to establish its safety and clinical benefit.","Haussen, Diogo C; Lima, Andrey; Nogueira, Raul G",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,422,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS A comparative analysis of the treatment of 72 patients with allergic rhinitis, divided into groups: I (main, n=21), which included immunocompromised patients who received sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy with antipollin and inhaled immunotherapy with cycloferon (every other day, a course of 10 procedures, the total dose of Cycloferon per course is 1250 mg); II (comparison, n=22) - immunocompromised patients who received monotherapy with antipollinum and III (control, n=29) - patients with allergic rhinitis without signs of immunocompromise, who also received antipollinum. The effectiveness of therapy was assessed by the quality of life (RQLQ questionnaire), the severity of nasal symptoms (the patient's self-observation diary) and the need for drugs after a course of intranasal immunotherapy. RESULTS The inclusion of cycloferon in the treatment of immunocompromised patients with allergic rhinitis increased its effectiveness - the severity of nasal symptoms decreased: in terms of sneezing, a decrease of 53.5 times versus 1.82 - in the control, «nasal congestion» - 6.3 times versus 2.6 - in the control, «itching in the nose» - 4.9 and 4.2 times, respectively (p<0.05). The changes had a positive effect on the total indicator of the quality of life of patients - an increase of 6.2 times (by 83.7%) (p>0.05) and significantly reduced the need for cromones (18 times, versus 10.3 - in the group comparison), inhaled corticosteroids (10.4 times versus 8 times in the comparison group, and in decongestans - 8.1 times versus 6.1 - in the comparison group (p>0.05)). CONCLUSIONS The combined use of local immunotherapy with cycloferon and sublingual allergen-specific immunotherapy with antipollinum in immunocompromised patients with allergic rhinitis is the first-line method of choice that statistically significantly changes the quality of life of patients.","Tataurschikova, N S",Vestnik otorinolaringologii,422,24

However, studies on visualization and whole-brain quantification of vasculature with cellular resolution are limited. Here, we explored the structure of vasculature at the whole-brain level using the newly developed CLARITY technique. Adult male C57BL/6J mice undergoing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and Tie2-RFP transgenic mice were used. Whole mouse brains were extracted for CLARITY processing. Immunostaining was performed to label vessels. Customized MATLAB code was used for image processing and quantification. Three-dimensional images were visualized using the Vaa3D software. Our results showed that whole mouse brain became transparent using the CLARITY method. Three-dimensional imaging and visualization of vasculature were achieved at the whole-brain level with a 1-μm voxel resolution. The quantitative results showed that the fractional vascular volume was 0.018 ± 0.004 mm3 per mm3, the normalized vascular length was 0.44 ± 0.04 m per mm3, and the mean diameter of the microvessels was 4.25 ± 0.08 μm. Furthermore, a decrease in the fractional vascular volume and a decrease in the normalized vascular length were found in the penumbra of ischemic mice compared to controls (p < 0.05). In conclusion, CLARITY provides a novel approach for mapping vasculature in the whole mouse brain at cellular resolution. CLARITY-optimized algorithms facilitate the assessment of structural change in vasculature after brain injury.","Zhang, Lin-Yuan; Lin, Pan; Pan, Jiaji; Ma, Yuanyuan; Wei, Zhenyu; Jiang, Lu; Wang, Liping; Song, Yaying; Wang, Yongting; Zhang, Zhijun; Jin, Kunlin; Wang, Qian; Yang, Guo-Yuan",Aging and disease,422,20

Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy has been associated with de novo and worsening GERD following surgery. For this reason, patients who suffer from GERD and are considering bariatric surgery are often counseled to undergo gastric bypass. Given this practice, we sought to determine acid reduction medication (ARM) utilization in bariatric surgical patients who undergo one of these procedures prior to surgery and at 1 year following surgery. METHODS A retrospective review of prospectively maintained data on patients to undergo gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy between November 2012 and December 2014 was conducted after IRB approval. ARM utilization and Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Health-Related Quality of Life (GERD-HRQL) scores [range 0 (no symptoms)-50 (severe GERD)] were compared prior to surgery and at 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS 334 patients underwent an eligible procedure in the study interval. 147 patients (44 %) had data on both preoperative and 1 year postoperative ARM use (93 gastric bypass and 54 sleeve gastrectomy). ARM utilization prior to surgery in gastric bypass patients did not reach statistical significance when compared to sleeve gastrectomy (40.9 vs. 26 %, p = 0.07). GERD-HRQL scores were greater prior to surgery in gastric bypass patients (GERD-HRQL 8.2 vs. 1.9; p < 0.01). At 12 months postoperatively, sleeve gastrectomy patients had a significantly higher rate of overall ARM use (48.1 vs. 16.1 %, p < 0.01), new ARM use (35 vs. 7.3 %, p < 0.01), and persistent ARM use (78.6 vs. 21.9 %, p < 0.01) when compared to gastric bypass patients. GERD-HRQL scores were similar overall at 12 months postoperatively (4.4 bypass vs. 4.8 sleeve; p = 0.72). CONCLUSION Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is associated with a significantly increased likelihood that acid reduction medications will be necessary for GERD symptom control 12 months postoperatively when compared to gastric bypass.","Barr, Alex C; Frelich, Matthew J; Bosler, Matthew E; Goldblatt, Matthew I; Gould, Jon C",Surgical endoscopy,422,24

A successful cannulation outcome when an AVF or arteriovenous graft (AVG) is used for the first time can be influenced by many factors, including access maturity, staff skill, and patient factors. This study examined AVF/AVG outcomes at initiation of HD across two major metropolitan public hospitals. METHODS Electronic medical records were reviewed to collect data retrospectively for a cohort of all newly commencing ESRD HD starts during 2018 to identify cannulation outcomes in the first 6 weeks. RESULTS Of the 117 patients included, AVG use was low (5%). Twenty-four percent of patients required a surgical intervention to salvage a poorly functioning AVF prior to commencing HD. About 32.5% of the cohort had an uneventful start with all successful cannulations. For the remainder of the cohort the number of treatments with unsuccessful cannulation ranged from 1 to 4 or more. About 36% required a surgical intervention for a poorly functioning AVF after commencing HD. Commencing HD with a CVC is associated with a lower likelihood of subsequent successful cannulation (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Even in experienced centres, a subset of patients experienced complicated cannulation in the first 6 weeks of HD. Several areas of improvement could be considered for these patients; timely referral for access creation, post-operative surveillance to ensure AVF maturation inclusive of duplex ultrasonography, gentle induction using small gauge needles and low blood flows, and consideration of a single needle HD initiation pathway.","Hill, Kathleen; Xu, Qunyan; Jaensch, Ashleigh; Esterman, Adrian; Le Leu, Richard; Childs, Jessie; Juneja, Rajiv; Jesudason, Shilpanjali",The journal of vascular access,422,31

We examined adverse events (AE) following vaccination with 4vHPV from 11 years of post-marketing data, focusing on a period of enhanced surveillance and adverse events of special interest (AESI). METHODS AE following 4vHPV doses administered between April 2007 and December 2017 reported to Australia's national regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, were examined; reports collected during enhanced surveillance in 2013 and 2014 were analyzed separately. Age and sex-specific rates, using denominator data from the national HPV vaccination register, were determined. Pre-specified AESI were identified using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) Preferred Terms and examined in detail. FINDINGS Following nine million doses of 4vHPV vaccine administered in Australia, 4551 AE reports were identified. The crude reporting rate was 39.8 per 100 000 doses in the funded cohorts, excluding the enhanced surveillance period. The reported rate of syncope in 12 to 13-year-old males and females was 29.6 per 100 000 doses during enhanced surveillance and 7.1 per 100 000 doses during the remaining study period; rates of syncope were higher in younger compared to older adolescents. The rate of anaphylaxis (0.32 per 100 000 doses) was consistent with published rates. Other AESI including autoimmune disease, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, primary ovarian insufficiency, Guillain-Barré syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and venous thromboembolism, were reported at low rates and analysis did not reveal unexpected patterns that would suggest causal association. INTERPRETATION AESI, apart from syncope, were reported rarely. The higher rate of syncope among younger adolescents highlights the need for management protocols to prevent syncope-related injury. Analysis of this large, longitudinal dataset in a country with high vaccine uptake, including a period of enhanced surveillance, affirms the safety profile of 4vHPV.","Phillips, Anastasia; Hickie, Megan; Totterdell, James; Brotherton, Julia; Dey, Aditi; Hill, Richard; Snelling, Tom; Macartney, Kristine",Vaccine,422,33

While MGC after ESD for differentiated-type (D-) EGC was well understood, little is known about MGC occurring after ESD for undifferentiated-type (UD-) EGC, because ESD had not been indicated. We evaluated the incidence and treatment outcomes of MGC after ESD of UD-EGC. METHODS This study is a post hoc analysis of JCOG1009/1010, a multicenter trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ESD for UD-EGC. The patients who underwent curative ESD of index solitary UD-EGC were analyzed. Surveillance endoscopy was performed biannually for the first 3 years and thereafter annually. We assessed the time to MGC occurrence after ESD, lesion characteristics, and treatment outcomes of MGC. Time to MGC occurrence was estimated by cumulative incidence function, with death and total gastrectomy as competing risks. RESULTS A total of 198 patients were included in this study. During a median follow-up period of 5.8 years, 4 patients (2%) developed MGC. Median time to MGC occurrence was 4.5 years (range: 3.1-5.4). Five-year cumulative incidence of MGC was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.2-3.3%). Two MGCs were histologically D-EGC, and the remaining two were UD-EGC. The median tumor size of MGCs was 1.0 cm (range: 0.7-1.7), and the depth of invasion (M/SM1/SM2) was 2/1/1, respectively. Three patients achieved curative resection with repeated ESD. CONCLUSIONS MGC does not occur commonly after curative ESD of UD-EGC, and repeated ESD could contribute to stomach preservation.","Abe, Seiichiro; Takizawa, Kohei; Oda, Ichiro; Mizusawa, Junki; Kadota, Tomohiro; Ono, Hiroyuki; Hasuike, Noriaki; Yano, Tomonori; Yamamoto, Yoshinobu; Horiuchi, Yusuke; Nagata, Shinji; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Terashima, Masanori; Muto, Manabu",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,422,31

We examined the relationship between early changes (both increases and decreases) in pulse rate, and the impact of these changes on subsequent cardiovascular outcome events in both the placebo and sibutramine groups. SUBJECTS/METHODS 9804 males and females, aged ⩾55 years, with a body mass index of 27-45 kg m(-)(2) were included in this current subanalysis of the SCOUT trial. Subjects were required to have a history of cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, to assess cardiovascular outcomes. The primary outcome event (POE) was a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, resuscitated cardiac arrest or cardiovascular death. Time-to-event analyses of the POE were performed using Cox regression models. RESULTS During the initial 6-week sibutramine treatment period, the induced pulse rate increase was related to weight change (1.9±7.7 beats per minute (bpm) with weight increase; 1.4±7.3 bpm, 0-5 kg weight loss; 0.6±7.4 bpm, ⩾5 kg weight loss). Throughout the subsequent treatment period, those continuing on sibutramine showed a consistently higher mean pulse rate than the placebo group. There was no difference in POE rates with either an increase or decrease in pulse rate over the lead-in period, or during lead-in baseline to 12 months post randomization. There was also no relationship between pulse rate at lead-in baseline and subsequent cardiovascular events in subjects with or without a cardiac arrhythmia. CONCLUSION Baseline pulse rate and changes in pulse rate may not be an important modifier nor a clinically useful predictor of outcome in an individual elderly cardiovascular obese subject exposed to weight management.","Seimon, R V; Espinoza, D; Finer, N; James, W P T; Legler, U F; Coutinho, W; Sharma, A M; Van Gaal, L; Maggioni, A P; Sweeting, A; Torp-Pedersen, C; Gebski, V; Caterson, I D",International journal of obesity,422,1

This study reports the identification and complete genome characterization of two novel parvoviruses, porcine bocavirus 3 (PBoV3) and porcine bocavirus 4 (PBoV4), from various porcine tissues/samples, displaying marked intra- and inter-host genetic diversity, with recombination events. Bocaviruses were detected by PCR among 16.5 % (55/333) of porcine samples (lymph nodes, serum, nasopharyngeal and faecal samples) from healthy, sick or deceased pigs from farms and a slaughterhouse in Hong Kong. As marked nucleotide polymorphisms were observed in the partial VP1 sequences, complete VP1 genes from one nasopharyngeal and three faecal specimens were cloned and sequenced, which suggested the presence of two different bocaviruses and demonstrated significant intra- and inter-host genetic diversity. Complete genome sequences revealed the presence of two bocaviruses, PBoV3 and PBoV4, in a faecal and nasopharyngeal specimen, respectively, with two genotypes, PBoV4-1 and PBoV4-2, in the latter. Their genomes encoded three ORFs, characteristic of bocaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that they were distantly related to other bocaviruses, forming a distinct cluster within the genus. Recombination analysis showed possible recombination events among VP1 sequences of PBoV4 strains from a faecal specimen, with two breakpoints identified (with a 68 and 71 bp region), suggesting that different strains/variants within the same host could have arisen from recombination. This is the first report describing marked sequence diversity and the co-existence of two viruses of the family Parvoviridae within the same host, which may have originated from and, in turn, facilitated recombination.","Lau, Susanna K P; Woo, Patrick C Y; Yip, Cyril C Y; Li, Kenneth S M; Fu, Clara T Y; Huang, Yi; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",The Journal of general virology,422,29

The primary dysmenorrhea is quite frequent in young women and remains with a good prognosis, even though it is associated with low quality of life. The secondary forms of dysmenorrhea are associated with endometriosis and adenomyosis and may represent the key symptom. The diagnosis is suspected on the basis of the clinical history and the physical examination and can be confirmed by ultrasound, which is very useful to exclude some secondary causes of dysmenorrhea, such as endometriosis and adenomyosis.

Therefore, variable disease phenotype may exist between animals that develop severe disease or die and those that are asymptomatic or survive after infection with these isolates. There may also be variability amongst animals within each of these subsets. Such potential variability may confound the use of time-point sacrifice experiments to investigate pathogenesis of this subset of virus strains, as uniformity in disease outcome is a fundamental assumption for time-course sacrifice experiments. In the current study, we examined the disease phenotype, neuropathology, neural infection and glial cell activity in moribund/dead and surviving Swiss white (CD-1) mice after intraperitoneal infection with various Australian flaviviruses, including West Nile virus (WNV) strains of intermediate virulence (WNVNSW2011 and WNVNSW2012), and highly virulent Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV) isolates. We identified notable intragroup variation in the end-point disease in mice infected with either WNVNSW strain, but to a lesser extent in mice infected with MVEV strains. The variable outcomes associated with WNVNSW infection suggest that pathogenesis investigations using time-point sacrifice of WNVNSW-infected mice may not be the best approach, as the assumption of uniformity in outcomes is violated. Our study has therefore highlighted a previously unacknowledged challenge to investigating pathogenesis of virus isolates of intermediate virulence. We have also set a precedent for routine examination of the disease phenotype in moribund/dead and surviving mice during survival challenge experiments.","Suen, Willy W; Prow, Natalie A; Setoh, Yin X; Hall, Roy A; Bielefeldt-Ohmann, Helle",The Journal of general virology,422,5

To fill in this gap, this paper adopts DMSP/OLS nighttime light data to measure the level of economic development and the improved data envelopment analysis model to measure INEF, establishing an index system to quantify EGE. Then we propose the panel threshold-mediating (PTM) model that combines the panel threshold model and the mediating effect model. On these bases, considering INEF as a mediator, we use this novel PTM model to empirically test the nonlinear relationship between economic development and EGE in 283 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2018. The results indicate that (1) while economic development can improve EGE, its positive impact on EGE differs with different INEF thresholds. A higher INEF threshold indicates a stronger positive effect of economic development on EGE. (2) For the entire sample, the mediating effect of INEF between economic development and EGE is not significant. However, after applying the PTM model, we found that the mediating effect of INEF was concealed by the sample population. (3) When INEF is lower than 0.2381, its complete mediating effect is verified. When INEF is higher than 0.2381, its mediating effect is not significant. On the contrary, economic development directly improves EGE. (4) Industrial agglomeration, the scale of government expenditure, residents' education level, degree of opening up, and transport infrastructure are all conducive to EGE. These findings can help cities at different INEF levels to achieve coordinated development of economy and EGE.","Wang, Song; Wang, Jiexin; Fan, Fei",Environmental science and pollution research international,422,5

ROSE is often performed by cytopathologists who have limited availability and may be costlier than alternatives. Several recent studies examined the use of alternative evaluators (AEs) for ROSE. A summary of this information could help inform guidelines regarding the use of AEs. The objective was to assess the accuracy of AEs compared to cytopathologists in assessing the adequacy of specimens during ROSE. STUDY DESIGN This was a systematic review and meta-analysis. Reporting and study quality were assessed using the STARD guidelines and QUADAS-2. All steps were performed independently by two evaluators. Summary estimates were obtained using the hierarchal method in Stata v14. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Higgins' I2 statistic. RESULTS The systematic review identified 13 studies that were included in the meta-analysis. Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for AEs were 97% (95% CI: 92-99%) and 83% (95% CI: 68-92%). There was wide variation in accuracy statistics between studies (I2 = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS AEs sometimes have accuracy that is close to cytopathologists. However, there is wide variability between studies, so it is not possible to provide a broad guideline regarding the use of AEs.","Pearson, Lauren; Factor, Rachel E; White, Sandra K; Walker, Brandon S; Layfield, Lester J; Schmidt, Robert L",Acta cytologica,422,16

METHODS From January 2000 to October 2009, 497 hips in 270 cases of ONFH induced by steroids were studied. A questionnaire was administered when the patients were admitted; the questions concerned the underlying disease, duration of steroid usage, total dosage of steroid, incubation period (time interval between commencement of steroid therapy and onset of pain), severity of pain, location of initial complaint, primary diagnosis, time lag from onset of pain to final diagnosis and physical signs when admitted. The correlations between pain and Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stage, bone marrow edema (BME) and lesion size were analyzed. RESULTS The median of time between commencing steroid medication and developing ONFH for the 269 cases was 18 months (range, 2-384 months). 78.82% cases presented with pain within three years of steroid initiation, only 10.41% patients first complained of pain six or more years after commencing steroid therapy.

CONCLUSION Most patients with ONFH induced by steroids complained of pain within 3 years of commencing steroid therapy. Pain was associated with lesion size, collapse and BME. Atypical location of pain, failure to perform a physical examination and MRI findings were the main causes of misdiagnoses.","Zhao, Feng-chao; Li, Zi-rong; Guo, Kai-jin",Orthopaedic surgery,422,17

Vitamin D influences in vitro gene expression and cancer cell growth. We sought to determine whether oral vitamin D induces beneficial gene expression effects in human rectal epithelium and identify biomarkers of response. METHODS Blood and rectal mucosa was sampled from 191 human subjects and mucosa gene expression (HT12) correlated with plasma vitamin D (25-OHD) to identify differentially expressed genes. Fifty subjects were then administered 3200IU/day oral vitamin D3 and matched blood/mucosa resampled after 12 weeks. Transcriptomic changes (HT12/RNAseq) after supplementation were tested against the prioritised genes for gene-set and GO-process enrichment. To identify blood biomarkers of mucosal response, we derived receiver-operator curves and C-statistic (AUC) and tested biomarker reproducibility in an independent Supplementation Trial (BEST-D). RESULTS Six hundred twenty-nine genes were associated with 25-OHD level (P < 0.01), highlighting 453 GO-term processes (FDR<0.05). In the whole intervention cohort, vitamin D supplementation enriched the prioritised mucosal gene-set (upregulated gene-set P < 1.0E-07; downregulated gene-set P < 2.6E-05) and corresponding GO terms (P = 2.90E-02), highlighting gene expression patterns consistent with anti-tumour effects. However, only 9 individual participants (18%) showed a significant response (NM gene-set enrichment P < 0.001) to supplementation. Expression changes in HIPK2 and PPP1CC expression served as blood biomarkers of mucosal transcriptomic response (AUC=0.84 [95%CI 0.66-1.00]) and replicated in BEST-D trial subjects (HIPK2 AUC=0.83 [95%CI 0.77-0.89]; PPP1CC AUC=0.91 [95%CI 0.86-0.95]). CONCLUSIONS Higher plasma 25-OHD correlates with rectal mucosa gene expression patterns consistent with anti-tumour effects, and this beneficial signature is induced by short-term vitamin D supplementation. Heterogenous gene expression responses to vitamin D may limit the ability of randomised trials to identify beneficial effects of supplementation on CRC risk. However, in the current study blood expression changes in HIPK2 and PPP1CC identify those participants with significant anti-tumour transcriptomic responses to supplementation in the rectum. These data provide compelling rationale for a trial of vitamin D and CRC prevention using easily assayed blood gene expression signatures as intermediate biomarkers of response.","Vaughan-Shaw, P G; Grimes, G; Blackmur, J P; Timofeeva, M; Walker, M; Ooi, L Y; Svinti, Victoria; Donnelly, Kevin; Din, F V N; Farrington, S M; Dunlop, M G",BMC medicine,422,19

Therefore, a reduction in VAT is considered an important target of obesity therapy. We evaluated whether reducing VAT mass by surgical removal of the omentum improves insulin sensitivity and metabolic function in obese patients. METHODS We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial to determine whether reducing VAT by omentectomy in 22 obese subjects increased their improvement following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery in hepatic and skeletal muscle sensitivity to insulin study 1. Improvement was assessed by using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique. We also performed a 3-month, longitudinal, single-arm study to determine whether laparoscopic omentectomy alone, in 7 obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), improved insulin sensitivity study 2. Improvement was assessed by using the Frequently Sampled Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test. RESULTS The greater omentum, which weighed 0.82 kg (95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.97), was removed from subjects who had omentectomy in both studies. In study 1, there was an approximate 2-fold increase in muscle insulin sensitivity (relative increase in glucose disposal during insulin infusion) and a 4-fold increase in hepatic insulin sensitivity 12 months after RYGB alone and RYGB plus omentectomy, compared with baseline values (P<.001). There were no significant differences between groups (P>.87) or group x time interactions (P>.36). In study 2, surgery had no effect on insulin sensitivity (P=.844) or use of diabetes medications.

The present study was conducted to compare the outcome of treatment with RFA alone and RFA with alcohol as ablative technique in patients with small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), who were not candidates for surgery. Methods Fifty patients with chronic liver disease and concurrent HCC were enrolled in this prospective study. The patients were treated with either RFA alone (n=25) or RFA combined with alcohol (n=25). Patient outcome was evaluated, and the tumour recurrence and survival of the patients were assessed in the two groups. Results The survival rates at six months in patients who completed at least six months of follow up were 84 and 80 per cent in patients treated with RFA alone and combination therapy, respectively. During the follow up period, 11 and four patients treated with RFA alone showed local and distant intrahepatic tumour recurrence, respectively. All local recurrences were at one to 18 months of the follow up period. The distant recurrences occurred at 6-36 months of the follow up period.

However, most previous telesonography systems have been designed for performing only abdominal and obstetrical exams. In this paper, we describe the development and assessment of a musculoskeletal (MSK) telesonography system. METHODS We developed a 4-degrees-of-freedom (DOF) robot to manipulate an ultrasound probe. The robot was remotely controlled by a radiologist operating a joystick at the master site. The telesonography system was used to scan participants' forearms, and all participants were conventionally scanned for comparison. Participants and radiologists were surveyed regarding their experience. Images from both scanning methods were independently assessed by an MSK radiologist. RESULTS All ten ultrasound exams were successfully performed using our developed MSK telesonography system, with no significant delay in movement. The duration (mean ± standard deviation) of telerobotic and conventional exams was 4.6 ± 0.9 and 1.4 ± 0.5 min, respectively (p = 0.039). An MSK radiologist rated quality of real-time ultrasound images transmitted over an internet connection as ""very good"" for all telesonography exams, and participants rated communication with the radiologist as ""very good"" or ""good"" for all exams. Visualisation of anatomic structures was similar between telerobotic and conventional methods, with no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSIONS The MSK telesonography system developed in this study is feasible for performing soft tissue ultrasound exams. The advancement of this system may allow MSK ultrasound exams to be performed over long distances, increasing access to ultrasound for patients in rural and remote communities.","Obaid, Mohammed; Zhang, Qianwei; Adams, Scott J; Fotouhi, Reza; Obaid, Haron",European radiology experimental,422,27

Age disparities in observed cases could be explained by children having lower susceptibility to infection, lower propensity to show clinical symptoms or both. We evaluate these possibilities by fitting an age-structured mathematical model to epidemic data from China, Italy, Japan, Singapore, Canada and South Korea. We estimate that susceptibility to infection in individuals under 20 years of age is approximately half that of adults aged over 20 years, and that clinical symptoms manifest in 21% (95% credible interval: 12-31%) of infections in 10- to 19-year-olds, rising to 69% (57-82%) of infections in people aged over 70 years. Accordingly, we find that interventions aimed at children might have a relatively small impact on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, particularly if the transmissibility of subclinical infections is low. Our age-specific clinical fraction and susceptibility estimates have implications for the expected global burden of COVID-19, as a result of demographic differences across settings. In countries with younger population structures-such as many low-income countries-the expected per capita incidence of clinical cases would be lower than in countries with older population structures, although it is likely that comorbidities in low-income countries will also influence disease severity. Without effective control measures, regions with relatively older populations could see disproportionally more cases of COVID-19, particularly in the later stages of an unmitigated epidemic.","Davies, Nicholas G; Klepac, Petra; Liu, Yang; Prem, Kiesha; Jit, Mark; Eggo, Rosalind M",Nature medicine,422,1

COVID-19 is not a nudge; it is a tidal wave. Engaging with and understanding complexity science allows us to examine the internal rules of our health care system and recognize our own role as agents that can systematically and deliberately disrupt the status quo. The intertwined and interdependent complex relationships that exist in health care between persons, business, academia, and government buffer the system from rapid and drastic change. COVID-19, however, swiftly disrupted many of the rules keeping the system in its previous state. Some would describe this sudden and dramatic systems change as a Black Swan. This column will examine the role of the Black Swan, as it relates to this pandemic. The Black Swan is a term coined in the 2nd century by Roman poet Juvenal's description of something being rara avis in terries nigroque simillima cygno, Latin for ""a bird as rare as the black swan"" (Taleb, 2007, p. xxxi). At this time, reference to a black swan was meant as a statement of impossibility, because all historical records of swans had been white. In 1697, Dutch explorers discovered black swans living in the wild in Western Australia (Taleb, 2007, p. xxi), and the black swan became a metaphor for events that come as a surprise, have major implications, and can often be understood only with the benefit of hindsight. This theory of the black swan was further articulated by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his books Fooled by Randomness (Taleb, 2001) and The Black Swan (Taleb, 2007).

Air pollution is one crucial example. Established evidence from other respiratory viruses and emerging evidence for COVID-19 specifically indicates that air pollution alters respiratory defense mechanisms leading to worsened infection severity. Air pollution also contributes to comorbidities that are known to worsen outcomes among those infected with COVID-19, and air pollution may also enhance infection transmission due to its impact on more frequent coughing. Yet despite the massive disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are reasons for optimism: broad societal lockdowns have shown us a glimpse of what a future with strong air pollution measures could yield. Thus, the urgency to combat air pollution is not diminished, but instead heightened in the context of the pandemic.","Brauer, Michael; Casadei, Barbara; Harrington, Robert A; Kovacs, Richard; Sliwa, Karen",Circulation,422,1

METHODS A systematic review of the literature was undertaken that identified 9 studies comparing the effect of different cell design on 30-day outcome in patients undergoing CAS. Random-effects models were applied to calculate pooled outcome data for mortality and cerebrovascular morbidity. Results are reported as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS The 9 studies included 8018 patients who underwent 8028 CAS procedures (4018 open-cell stents, 4010 closed-cell stents). Six studies were retrospective in design, one was a registry, and only two studies prospectively compared the effect of different cell designs. Nearly half of the patients (3452, 43.1%) were symptomatic, with no significant difference between the closed- and open-cell stent groups (p=0.93). During the first month after the procedure, there were no significant differences in mortality (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.24, p=0.21), transient ischemic attacks (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30, p=0.74), or strokes (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.66, p=0.37). CONCLUSION This meta-analysis showed that 30-day cerebrovascular complications after CAS were not significantly different for the open-cell group in comparison to the closed-cell group. Future prospective clinical trials comparing different free cell areas and other stent design properties are still needed to further investigate whether stent design plays a significant role in the results of carotid stenting.","Kouvelos, George N; Patelis, Nikolaos; Antoniou, George A; Lazaris, Andreas; Matsagkas, Miltiadis I",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,422,27

We assessed the impact of health system interventions to improve outcomes for adults with type 2 diabetes in LMICs. METHODS AND FINDINGS We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, African Index Medicus, LILACS, and Global Index Medicus from inception of each database through February 24, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of health system interventions targeting adults with type 2 diabetes in LMICs. Eligible studies reported at least 1 of the following outcomes: glycemic change, mortality, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness. We conducted a meta-analysis for the glycemic outcome of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). GRADE and Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care methods were used to assess risk of bias for the glycemic outcome and to prepare a summary of findings table. Of the 12,921 references identified in searches, we included 39 studies in the narrative review of which 19 were cluster RCTs and 20 were individual RCTs. The greatest number of studies were conducted in the East Asia and Pacific region (n = 20) followed by South Asia (n = 7). There were 21,080 total participants enrolled across included studies and 10,060 total participants in the meta-analysis of HbA1c when accounting for the design effect of cluster RCTs. Non-glycemic outcomes of mortality, health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness had sparse data availability that precluded quantitative pooling. In the meta-analysis of HbA1c from 35 of the included studies, the mean difference was -0.46% (95% CI -0.60% to -0.31%, I2 87.8%, p < 0.001) overall, -0.37% (95% CI -0.64% to -0.10%, I2 60.0%, n = 7, p = 0.020) in multicomponent clinic-based interventions, -0.87% (-1.20% to -0.53%, I2 91.0%, n = 13, p < 0.001) in pharmacist task-sharing studies, and -0.27% (-0.50% to -0.04%, I2 64.1%, n = 7, p = 0.010) in trials of diabetes education or support alone. Other types of interventions had few included studies. Eight studies were at low risk of bias for the summary assessment of glycemic control, 15 studies were at unclear risk, and 16 studies were at high risk. The certainty of evidence for glycemic control by subgroup was moderate for multicomponent clinic-based interventions but was low or very low for other intervention types. Limitations include the lack of consensus definitions for health system interventions, differences in the quality of underlying studies, and sparse data availability for non-glycemic outcomes. CONCLUSIONS In this meta-analysis, we found that health system interventions for type 2 diabetes may be effective in improving glycemic control in LMICs, but few studies are available from rural areas or low- or lower-middle-income countries. Multicomponent clinic-based interventions had the strongest evidence for glycemic benefit among intervention types. Further research is needed to assess non-glycemic outcomes and to study implementation in rural and low-income settings.","Flood, David; Hane, Jessica; Dunn, Matthew; Brown, Sarah Jane; Wagenaar, Bradley H; Rogers, Elizabeth A; Heisler, Michele; Rohloff, Peter; Chopra, Vineet",PLoS medicine,422,16

To illuminate the landscape of IAV cellular restriction, we generated and integrated global genetic loss-of-function screens with transcriptomics and proteomics data. Our multi-omics analysis revealed a subset of both IFN-dependent and independent cellular defence mechanisms that inhibit IAV replication. Amongst these, the autophagy regulator TBC1 domain family member 5 (TBC1D5), which binds Rab7 to enable fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, was found to control IAV replication in vitro and in vivo and to promote lysosomal targeting of IAV M2 protein. Notably, IAV M2 was observed to abrogate TBC1D5-Rab7 binding through a physical interaction with TBC1D5 via its cytoplasmic tail. Our results provide evidence for the molecular mechanism utilised by IAV M2 protein to escape lysosomal degradation and traffic to the cell membrane, where it supports IAV budding and growth.","Martin-Sancho, Laura; Tripathi, Shashank; Rodriguez-Frandsen, Ariel; Pache, Lars; Sanchez-Aparicio, Maite; McGregor, Michael J; Haas, Kelsey M; Swaney, Danielle L; Nguyen, Thong T; Mamede, João I; Churas, Christopher; Pratt, Dexter; Rosenthal, Sara B; Riva, Laura; Nguyen, Courtney; Beltran-Raygoza, Nish; Soonthornvacharin, Stephen; Wang, Guojun; Jimenez-Morales, David; De Jesus, Paul D; Moulton, Hong M; Stein, David A; Chang, Max W; Benner, Chris; Ideker, Trey; Albrecht, Randy A; Hultquist, Judd F; Krogan, Nevan J; García-Sastre, Adolfo; Chanda, Sumit K",Nature microbiology,422,17

In this study, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was exposed to an ultraviolet (UV) fluorescence lamp in simulated aging and degradation experiments. Ultraviolet degradation mechanisms were investigated on the surface after sunlight and UV lamp exposure. The plastic surfaces' molecular and surface degradation results were compared with their Fourier Transform Infrared-Attenuated Total Reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectra. By growing the length of exposure time increased stages of degradation were observed. After UV lamp and sunlight exposure, changing degradation levels were also determined with spectroscopic evaluations and the results were compared. LDPE was selected since it has a simple structure and a number of branched polymer structures that facilitate easily disruption of the chemical bond. Breaks in the polymer chain were easily seen in the plastics at the end of degradation and a fragile structure was formed throughout the polymer chain after accelerating UV light aging. The FTIR spectrum clarified the changed and fractured molecular bond structures of UV-exposed polyethylene. The change in the molecular structure of the plastic caused small changes in its color and small variations in this color change were detected by recording the Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrum. The Philips UV lamp's light intensity and the wavelength spectrum range were measured.

To understand the degree of natural variation in protease active sites, we systematically evaluated simple active site features from all serine, cysteine and threonine proteases of independent lineage. This convergent evolutionary analysis revealed several interrelated and previously unrecognized relationships. The reactive rotamer of the nucleophile determines which neighboring amide can be used in the local oxyanion hole. Each rotamer-oxyanion hole combination limits the location of the moiety facilitating proton transfer and, combined together, fixes the stereochemistry of catalysis. All proteases that use an acyl-enzyme mechanism naturally divide into two classes according to which face of the peptide substrate is attacked during catalysis. We show that each class is subject to unique structural constraints that have governed the convergent evolution of enzyme structure. Using this framework, we show that the γ-methyl of Thr causes an intrinsic steric clash that precludes its use as the nucleophile in the traditional catalytic triad. This constraint is released upon autoproteolysis and we propose a molecular basis for the increased enzymatic efficiency introduced by the γ-methyl of Thr. Finally, we identify several classes of natural products whose mode of action is sensitive to the division according to the face of attack identified here. This analysis of protease structure and function unifies 50 y of biocatalysis research, providing a framework for the continued study of enzyme evolution and the development of inhibitors with increased selectivity.","Buller, Andrew R; Townsend, Craig A",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,422,1

In the search for alternatives to β-lactams, we have investigated a series of compounds designed to generate transition state analogue structures upon reaction with DD-peptidases. The compounds contain a combination of a peptidoglycan-mimetic specificity handle and a warhead capable of delivering a tetrahedral anion to the enzyme active site. The latter includes a boronic acid, two alcohols, an aldehyde, and a trifluoroketone. The compounds were tested against two low-molecular mass class C DD-peptidases. As expected from previous observations, the boronic acid was a potent inhibitor, but rather unexpectedly from precedent, the trifluoroketone [D-α-aminopimelyl(1,1,1-trifluoro-3-amino)butan-2-one] was also very effective. Taking into account competing hydration, we found the trifluoroketone was the strongest inhibitor of the Actinomadura R39 DD-peptidase, with a subnanomolar (free ketone) inhibition constant. A crystal structure of the complex between the trifluoroketone and the R39 enzyme showed that a tetrahedral adduct had indeed formed with the active site serine nucleophile. The trifluoroketone moiety, therefore, should be considered along with boronic acids and phosphonates as a warhead that can be incorporated into new and effective DD-peptidase inhibitors and therefore, perhaps, antibiotics.","Dzhekieva, Liudmila; Adediran, S A; Herman, Raphael; Kerff, Frédéric; Duez, Colette; Charlier, Paulette; Sauvage, Eric; Pratt, R F",Biochemistry,422,33

RESULTS In this review, we summarize clinical case of using remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19, analyzed the final treatment results, and judged whether the drug was effective for the treatment of COVID-19. Also, attention was paid to the side effects of the drug. CONCLUSIONS According to the clinical results, it was found that remdesivir was effective in the treatment of COVID-19. The drug has side effects, but the symptoms were mild and disappeared immediately after discontinuation of medication.","Hong, Y-N; Xu, J; Sasa, G B K; Zhou, K-X; Ding, X-F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,422,24

Most studies have focused on anterior circulation strokes; therefore, little is known regarding the optimal anesthesia type for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes. Objective To compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia (GA) in patients presenting with vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective, matched, case-control study of consecutive vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes treated with endovascular therapy at 2 academic institutions. The study took place between September 2005 and September 2015 at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and between September 2010 and September 2015 at the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Patients requiring emergent intubation prior to endovascular therapy were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into (1) MAC and (2) elective intubation for the procedure (elective GA). Patients who converted from MAC to GA during the procedure were included in the MAC group. The 2 groups were matched for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the 2 groups as measured by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days. Results A total of 215 patients underwent endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes during the study period. Thirty-nine patients were excluded owing to emergent pre-endovascular therapy intubation. Sixty-three patients had MAC (36%) and 113 patients had GA (64%). The conversion rate from MAC to GA was 13% (n = 8). After matching, 61 pairs of patients (n = 122) underwent primary analysis. The 2 groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years) in the MAC group vs 67 years (interquartile range, 55.5-78.5 years) in the GA group (P = .83). Fifty-four percent of the patients in the MAC group were men vs 41% in the GA group (P = .44). When compared with the elective GA group, patients who underwent the procedure with MAC had similar rates of successful reperfusion, good clinical outcomes, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality. The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P = .19). Conclusions and Relevance In endovascular therapy for acute posterior circulation stroke, MAC is feasible and appears to be as safe and effective as GA. Future clinical trials are warranted to confirm our findings.","Jadhav, Ashutosh P; Bouslama, Mehdi; Aghaebrahim, Amin; Rebello, Leticia C; Starr, Matthew T; Haussen, Diogo C; Ranginani, Manasa; Whalin, Matthew K; Jovin, Tudor G; Nogueira, Raul G",JAMA neurology,422,1

OBJECTIVE.— To report the histopathologic description of a series of chilblainlike lesions appearing in the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 epidemic. DESIGN.— The study included 13 patients with cutaneous acral lesions resembling chilblains occurring in the setting of suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection with available skin biopsy. RESULTS.— Two main histopathologic patterns were observed: a chilblainlike histopathologic pattern (10 of 13 cases; 77%) and a thrombotic vasculopathy pattern (3 of 13 cases; 23%). The chilblainlike histopathologic pattern featured a superficial and deep perivascular infiltrate of lymphocytes of varying intensity. This infiltrate was sometimes peri-eccrine and alterations of eccrine glands were present in most cases. Vacuolar alteration of the basal layer of the epidermis was found in a majority of patients. Lichenoid interface dermatitis was rarely present. The thrombotic vasculopathy pattern featured an absent or mild inflammatory infiltrate, multiple intraluminal fibrin thrombi, and ischemic epidermal necrosis. In both patterns, no true vasculitis was observed. No patient tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by polymerase chain reaction, possibly because these lesions may represent late cutaneous manifestations of the disease or are associated with an early effective immune response. CONCLUSIONS.— The relationship of chilblainlike lesions to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 requires further investigations. Histopathologic features mimic chilblains, chilblain lupus, and, less frequently, a thrombotic vasculopathy. Response to viral infection might trigger diverse mechanisms leading to the 2 histopathologic patterns described.","Sohier, Pierre; Matar, Stéphanie; Meritet, Jean-François; Laurent-Roussel, Sara; Dupin, Nicolas; Aractingi, Selim",Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,422,1

Previously we found that 22 miRNAs appeared to predict total- and partial-body irradiation (TBI and PBI, respectively) patterns and were suggestive of the percentage of the body exposed in a baboon model. Motivated by these results, we performed a similar analysis on the transcriptional level (mRNAs) using whole genome microarrays. From 17 irradiated baboons, blood samples were taken before, and at 1, 2, 7, 28 and 75-106 days postirradiation to an equivalent TBI dose of 2.5 or 5 Gy applied either to the total body or to different parts of the body such as the upper body (UBE) or left hemibody (LHB). We compared quantile normalized log2-transformed gene expression values with three exposure pattern comparisons, namely TBI vs. PBI, TBI vs. LHB and UBE vs. LHB using Kruskal-Wallis and logistic regression analysis for receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) calculation. We found several hundred significantly (P < 0.05) and ≥2-fold deregulated mRNAs per exposure pattern comparison with a peak of 163-860 mRNAs at day 28. Lower numbers on day 2 (60 mRNAs) and day 7 (91-162 mRNAs) were observed, with the lowest number of deregulated mRNAs at day 75-106 (22-58 mRNAs). The 14 most promising mRNAs (e.g., LTF, DEFA3, OLFM4) appeared 10.1-46.2-fold upregulated and the exposure groups were completely or almost completely discriminated (ROC between 0.8-1.0). Several of the mRNA gene expression changes were significantly associated with the percentage of the body exposed. The numbers of overlapping genes used for diagnosis on consecutive days postirradiation were mostly 0 or less than 10. Bioinformatic analysis confirmed that at each time point different biological processes predominated. Our results suggest mRNA changes over time may be used to retrospectively determine radiation exposure patterns as partial or total body. mRNA gene expression changes likely could be applied over a longer time frame (2-75 days postirradiation) than miRNA, but due to the transient gene expression changes a different set of candidate mRNAs appears to be required at each day after irradiation.","Ostheim, P; Haupt, J; Schüle, S; Herodin, F; Valente, M; Drouet, M; Majewski, M; Port, M; Abend, M",Radiation research,422,1

Case 1 description: A 63-year-old woman was hospitalized for conscious disturbance, right hemiparesis, and total aphasia. Computed tomography of the head showed no abnormal findings. Computed tomography angiography showed ATAAD and bilateral common carotid artery occlusion. Surgery was not indicated for ATAAD because of a poor prognosis of ischemic stroke. However, carotid artery stenting of the left common carotid artery occlusion was successfully performed, and her neurological findings improved. The patient underwent hemiarch replacement for ATAAD on the day after carotid artery stenting. Her final modified Rankin Scale was 1. Case 2 Description: A 57-year-old woman was hospitalized for mild left hemiparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging showed right watershed infarction and right common carotid artery occlusion. Computed tomography angiography showed ATAAD. After hospitalization, conscious disturbance appeared and left hemiparesis worsened. Ischemic stroke indicated a poor prognosis for revascularization by surgery for ATAAD. Thus, carotid artery stenting of the right common carotid artery occlusion was performed. The patient's neurological findings improved and she underwent hemiarch replacement for ATAAD at 19 days after carotid artery stenting. Her final modified Rankin Scale was 1. CONCLUSIONS In the present cases, although ischemic stroke was serious and precluded surgical indication for ATAAD, carotid artery stenting before surgery for ATAAD resulted in good clinical outcomes. Performing carotid artery stenting before surgery for ATAAD is challenging but achievable, and is a valid treatment option depending on the individual cases.","Funakoshi, Yusuke; Imamura, Hirotoshi; Tokunaga, So; Murakami, Yasutaka; Tani, Shoichi; Adachi, Hidemitsu; Ohara, Nobuyuki; Kono, Tomoyuki; Fukumitsu, Ryu; Sunohara, Tadashi; Omura, Yoshihiro; Matsui, Yuichi; Sasaki, Natsuhi; Fujiwara, Satoru; Fukuda, Tatsumaru; Akiyama, Ryo; Horiuchi, Kazufumi; Yoshida, Kazufumi; Kajiura, Shinji; Shigeyasu, Masashi; Koyama, Tadaaki; Sakai, Nobuyuki","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",422,27

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA LS has generally been associated with lower rates of postoperative complications than OS. However, evidence mainly comes from small studies that failed to adjust for the confounding effects of the underlying indication or clinical condition that may have favored the use of one technique over the other. METHODS A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing splenectomy in 2008 and 2009 using data from the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (n = 1781). Retrieved data included 30-day mortality and morbidity (cardiac, respiratory, central nervous system, renal, wound, sepsis, venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding outcomes), demographics, indication, and preoperative risk factors. We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the adjusted effect of the splenectomy technique on outcomes. RESULTS A total of 874 (49.1%) cases had LS and 907 (50.9%) had OS. After adjusting for all potential confounders including the indication and preoperative risk factors, LS was associated with decreased 30-day mortality [OR (odds ratio): 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18-0.84] and postoperative respiratory occurrences (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.76), wound occurrences (OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.11-0.79), and sepsis (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.26-0.89) when compared with OS. Patients who underwent LS also had a significantly shorter total length of hospital stay and were less likely to receive intraoperative transfusions compared with patients who underwent OS. CONCLUSIONS LS is associated with more favorable postoperative outcomes than OS, irrespective of the indication for splenectomy or the patient's clinical status.","Musallam, Khaled M; Khalife, Mohamed; Sfeir, Pierre M; Faraj, Walid; Safadi, Bassem; Abi Saad, George S; Abiad, Firass; Hallal, Ali; Alwan, Melhim Bou; Peyvandi, Flora; Jamali, Faek R",Annals of surgery,422,1

It is unknown how severe visual losses need to be before changes in auditory abilities occur, or whether the relationship between severity of visual loss and changes in auditory abilities is proportional and systematic. Here we show that greater severity of visual loss is associated with increased auditory judgments of distance and room size. On average participants with severe visual losses perceived sounds to be twice as far away, and rooms to be three times larger, than sighted controls. Distance estimates for sighted controls were most accurate for closer sounds and least accurate for farther sounds. As the severity of visual impairment increased, accuracy decreased for closer sounds and increased for farther sounds. However, it is for closer sounds that accurate judgments are needed to guide rapid motor responses to auditory events, e.g. planning a safe path through a busy street to avoid collisions with other people, and falls. Interestingly, greater visual impairment severity was associated with more accurate room size estimates. The results support a new hypothesis that crossmodal calibration of audition by vision depends on the severity of visual loss.","Kolarik, Andrew J; Raman, Rajiv; Moore, Brian C J; Cirstea, Silvia; Gopalakrishnan, Sarika; Pardhan, Shahina",Scientific reports,422,1

METHODS The data were drawn from the 2017 Survey of Living Conditions and Welfare Needs of Korean Older Persons, a nationally representative survey. Digital technology use was measured by the number of digital functions that respondents perform with their electronic devices. Social interactions were measured by the frequencies of face-to-face and remote connections with friends or neighbors. Relationships were estimated with multiple regression analyses. RESULTS Digital technology use was inversely associated with depressive symptoms even after adjusting for covariates including cognitive function. Both remote and face-to-face connections with friends or neighbors were associated with fewer depressive symptoms. An interaction between digital technology use and remote contact also was detected: the effect of digital technology use on depressive symptoms was more beneficial for older adults with infrequent remote contact with friends or neighbors than for those with frequent remote contact. CONCLUSION Findings suggest that digital technology use can reduce depressive symptoms of older adults, especially those who have fewer social interactions. Educating older adults to increase their digital literacy level and use of remote interactions may improve their psychological wellbeing, perhaps even during times of a viral pandemic.","Lee, Min-Ah; Ferraro, Kenneth F; Kim, Giyeon",Aging & mental health,422,19

But there is little information about the relationship between ATP2B1 gene and atherosclerosis in the intracranial arteries. We hereby investigated the association of common variants in ATP2B1 gene with LAS in asymptomatic Chinese hypertension patients. METHODS The stenosis of intracranial and extracranial arteries were evaluated in 899 subjects through computerized tomography angiography from the aortic arch to the skull base. A total of 11 ATP2B1 common variants were genotyped. Multivariate logistic regression was carried out in a dominant model with confounding factors adjusted. RESULTS rs17249754-A (OR = 0.43, p = 0.0002) and rs1401982-G (OR = 0.47, p = 0.0007) were associated with decreased susceptibility of concurrent extra and intracranial stenosis even after Bonferroni correction. These two minor alleles were also significantly associated with less stenotic arteries and moderate-to-severe stenosis. CONCLUSION rs17249754 and rs1401982 were associated with asymptomatic LAS in stroke-free Chinese hypertension patients and might benefit early recognition of LAS patients in clinical practice.","An, Dewei; Zhang, Jin; Tang, Xiaofeng; Gao, Pingjin; Li, Yan; Wang, Yan; Zhu, Dingliang",Clinical and experimental hypertension,422,1

To date, few studies have investigated the changes of systemic oxygenation and t-Hb signal strength during hemodialysis (HD). This study aimed to (1) monitor rSO2 and t-Hb signal strength in the brain, liver, and lower-limb muscle during HD and (2) clarify the differences in rSO2 and t-Hb signal strength in each compartment. Fifty-three patients receiving 4-h HD were included and divided into three groups according to the compartments in which tissue oxygenation was measured as follows: brain (n = 44), liver (n = 42), and lower-limb muscle (n = 40). The rSO2 and t-Hb signal strength was monitored using an INVOS 5100c (Covidien Japan, Tokyo, Japan). The rSO2 levels were significantly lower in the brain than in the liver from HD initiation to the end (HD initiation: rSO2 in the brain and liver, 46.5 ± 1.3 and 52.4 ± 1.7%, respectively, p = 0.031). Furthermore, compared to the t-Hb signal strength ratio [value at t (min) during HD/initial value before HD] in the brain during HD, there were significant increases in the liver and lower-limb muscle, respectively. In conclusion, deterioration of cerebral oxygenation was remarkable compared to the hepatic oxygenation in HD patients. Our results, which revealed significant differences among the t-Hb signal strength ratios in the brain, liver, and lower-limb muscle during HD, might reflect the non-uniform body-fluid reduction within systemic tissues induced by ultrafiltration.","Ookawara, Susumu; Ito, Kiyonori; Ueda, Yuichiro; Miyazawa, Haruhisa; Hayasaka, Hideyuki; Kofuji, Masaya; Uchida, Takayuki; Ishii, Hiroki; Shindo, Mitsutoshi; Kitano, Taisuke; Aomatsu, Akinori; Hirai, Keiji; Kaku, Yoshio; Hoshino, Taro; Tabei, Kaoru; Morishita, Yoshiyuki",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,422,1

Complete genome sequence of all twelve APMV serotypes has been published recently. In recent years, APMV-1 has attracted the virologists for its oncolytic activity and its use as a vaccine vector for both animals and humans. The recombinant APMV-based vaccine offers a pertinent choice for the construction of live attenuated vaccine due to its minimum recombination frequency, modular nature of transcription and lack of DNA phase during its replication. Although insufficient data are available regarding other APMV serotypes, our understanding about the APMV biology is expanding rapidly because of the availability of modern molecular biology tools and high-throughput complete genome sequencing.","Gogoi, P; Ganar, K; Kumar, S",Transboundary and emerging diseases,422,1

METHODS Using a single arm prospective cohort study design, men with prostate cancer were recruited from two regional public hospitals in Australia for a 6-month program that provided information and decision support, exercise and nutrition management, specialised clinical support, and practical support through localised and central care coordination. Carers of the men were also invited to the program. Data were collected from multiple sources to evaluate: 1) recruitment capability and participant characteristics; 2) appropriateness and feasibility of delivering the specific intervention components using an electronic care management tool; and 3) suitability of data collection procedures and proposed outcome measures. RESULTS Of the 105 eligible men, 51 (consent rate 49%) participated in the program. Of the 31 carers nominated by the men, 13 consented (consent rate 42%).

METHODS This cohort study measured SED (activPAL) and MVPA (GT3X) in each trimester of pregnancy. Univariate associations of demographic, socioeconomic, and pregnancy health-related factors with SED or MVPA were calculated. Associations with P < .10 were included in stepwise linear regression models to determine independent predictors in each trimester. RESULTS Pregnant women (n = 127) were age 31.0 (4.9) years and 78% white. In regression models across trimesters, fewer children ≤ age 5 in the household (P < .04) and primarily sitting job activity (P < .008) were related to higher SED and use of assisted reproductive technology (P < .05) was associated with higher MVPA. In at least one trimester, younger age was related to higher SED (P = .014); no history of pregnancy loss (P < .04), being married (P = .003), employed (P < .004, full time or student), white race (P = .006), and higher education (P = .010) were associated with higher MVPA. CONCLUSIONS Predictors of SED in pregnancy were more consistent, and differed from predictors of MVPA. These findings may help identify women at risk of high SED or low MVPA, though future research in larger samples is needed.","Jones, Melissa A; Whitaker, Kara; Wallace, McKenzie; Barone Gibbs, Bethany",Journal of physical activity & health,422,19

In Grade III, the use of stapled haemorrhoidopexy progressively decreased from 30% to 35% (between 2000 and 2007) to 5% of the cases. Meanwhile, commencing from 2006 the use of Doppler-guided haemorrhoid artery ligation (DGHAL) with mucopexy increased progressively from 6% to 24%. Over the years, the percentage of MM haemorrhoidectomy remained consistent at between 65% and 70% of the cases. CONCLUSION Relevant changes in the surgical choice of haemorrhoid treatment have occurred in Italy over the last 17 years. MM haemorrhoidectomy remains the most frequently performed procedure for Grade III haemorrhoids. Stapled haemorrhoidopexy has become much less popular in contrast to DGHAL with mucopexy which is being performed much more frequently.","Altomare, D F; Picciariello, A; Pecorella, G; Milito, G; Naldini, G; Amato, A; Ratto, C; Perinotti, R",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,422,17

In this context, fludioxonil-contaminated wastewater was treated in an upflow immobilized cell bioreactor, resulting in chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency even higher than 80%, whereas the electrical conductivity (EC) of the effluent was gradually increased. Organic-F was mineralized by 94.0 ± 5.2%, which was in accordance with the high fludioxonil removal efficiency (95.4 ± 4.0%). In addition, effluent total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN) concentration reduced significantly during bioprocessing. A strong relationship among COD removal, TKN/total nitrogen removal, and effluent EC increase (p < 0.01) was identified. Despite the adequate aeration provided, effluent nitrite and nitrate concentrations were negligible. Illumina sequencing revealed a reduction in the relative abundances of Betaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, and Firmicutes and an increase in the proportion of Alphaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria. A shift in bacterial communities occurred during fludioxonil treatment, resulting in the significant increase of the relative abundances of Empedobacter, Sphingopyxis, and Rhodopseudomonas (from 0.67 ± 0.13% at the start-up to 34.34 ± 1.60% at the end of biotreatment). In conclusion, the immobilized cell bioreactor permitted the proliferation of specialized activated sludge microbiota with an active role in the depuration of postharvest fungicides.","Mavriou, Zografina; Alexandropoulou, Ioanna; Melidis, Paraschos; Karpouzas, Dimitrios G; Ntougias, Spyridon",Environmental science and pollution research international,422,16

Institutional social distancing requirements have resulted in many neurosurgical programs utilizing video conferencing for educational activities. However, it is unclear how or if these practices should continue after the pandemic. The objective of this study was to characterize virtual education in neurosurgery and understand how it should be utilized after COVID-19. METHODS A 24-question, 3-part online survey was administered anonymously to all 117 US neurosurgical residency programs from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Questions pertained to the current use of virtual conferencing, preferences over traditional conferences, and future inclinations. The Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree) was used. Comparisons were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05. RESULTS One-hundred eight responses were recorded. Overall, 38 respondents (35.2%) were attendings and 70 (64.8%) were trainees. Forty-one respondents (38.0%) indicated attending 5-6 conferences per week and 70 (64.8%) attend national virtual conferences. When considering different conference types, there was no overall preference (scores < 3) for virtual conferences over traditional conferences. In regard to future use, respondents strongly agreed that they would continue the practice at some capacity after the pandemic (median score 5). Overall, respondents agreed that virtual conferences would partially replace traditional conferences (median score 4), whereas they strongly disagreed with the complete replacement of traditional conferences (median score 1). The most common choices for the partial replacement of tradition conferences were case conferences (59/108, 55%) and board preparation (64/108, 59%). Lastly, there was a significant difference in scores for continued use of virtual conferencing in those who attend nationally sponsored conferences (median score 5, n = 70) and those who do not (median score 4, n = 38; U = 1762.50, z = 2.97, r = 0.29, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Virtual conferences will likely remain an integral part of neurosurgical education after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. Across the country, residents and faculty report a preference for continued use of virtual conferencing, especially virtual case conferences and board preparation. Some traditional conferences may even be replaced with virtual conferences, in particular those that are more didactic. Furthermore, nationally sponsored virtual conferences have a positive effect on the preferences for continued use of virtual conferences.","Lazaro, Tyler; Srinivasan, Visish M; Rahman, Maryam; Asthagiri, Ashok; Barkhoudarian, Garni; Chambless, Lola B; Kan, Peter; Rao, Ganesh; Nahed, Brian V; Patel, Akash J",Neurosurgical focus,422,31

Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) induced post-ablation is critical for tumour survival and progression. A combination therapy of thermal ablation and polymer conjugated Hsp90 chemotherapy was designed and evaluated for complete tumour eradication of HCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS A thermo-responsive, elastin-like polypeptide (ELP)-based tri-block biopolymer was developed and conjugated with a potent Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin (GA). The anti-cancer efficacy of conjugates was evaluated in HCC cell cultures with and without hyperthermia (43 °C). The conjugates were also administered twice weekly in a murine HCC model as a single treatment or in combination with single electrocautery as the ablation method. RESULTS ELP-GA conjugates displayed enhanced cytotoxicity in vitro and effective heat shock inhibition under hyperthermia. The conjugates alone significantly slowed the tumour growth without systemic toxicity. Four doses of thermo-responsive ELP-GA conjugates with concomitant simple electrocautery accomplished significant Hsp90 inhibition and sustained tumour suppression. CONCLUSION Hsp90 inhibition plays a key role in preventing the recurrence of HCC, and the combination of ablation with targeted therapy holds great potential to improve prognosis and survival of HCC patients.","Chen, Yizhe; Youn, Pilju; Pysher, Theodore J; Scaife, Courtney L; Furgeson, Darin Y","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",422,31

It is sometimes difficult to monitor both frontal lobes due to anatomical or space compromises. However, it remains unclear whether the use of only one lateral or medial probe can provide adequate bilateral monitoring. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy of using a single lateral or medial probe to detect substantial desaturations on both sides. DESIGN A prospective observational study. SETTING Tertiary university teaching hospital. PATIENTS Seventeen adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery monitored with three near-infrared spectroscopy probes (two lateral and one medial) using an INVOS 5100C monitor. INTERVENTIONS The value of rcSO2 was recorded up to 19 times during each procedure. Substantial desaturation was defined as an absolute rcSO2 value of 50% or less or a decrease of more than 20% compared with baseline values on spontaneous ventilation with 21% oxygen. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The level of agreement between the three pairs of probes using the Bland-Altman method for repeated measures, and the grade of concordant and discordant results between the three pairs of probes by means of contingency tables and the κ coefficient. RESULTS We obtained 244 records per probe. Greater agreement was observed between the two lateral probes (mean ± SD of the differences between recordings was -0.9 ± 5.5); mean difference between left and medial, and right and medial probes was 2.4 ± 7.3 and 3.3 ± 6.7, respectively. The rate of discordant results between the two lateral probes was 5.7%, κ coefficient of 0.6 with 95% confidence interval (95% CI 0.4 to 0.8), and between the left and medial, and right and medial of 8.2 and 7.4%, with κ coefficients of 0.57 (95% CI 0.38 to 0.76) and 0.5 (95% CI 0.29 to 0.71), respectively. CONCLUSION In cardiac surgery patients in whom there is difficulty in accommodating two rcSO2 probes, a single lateral probe can effectively measure bilateral rcSO2 in specific scenarios.","de la Matta, Manuel; Domínguez, Alejandro",European journal of anaesthesiology,422,26

In the current study, the gene designs for V and F1, two well-studied virulent factors serving as main targets for vaccine development, were altered to explore additional options in hopes of improving the protective immunity of DNA vaccines expressing these two antigens. Compared to the wild type V gene DNA vaccines, the use of codon optimized V gene sequences was effective in improving the antigen expression, titers of anti-V antibody responses, and survival against a mucosal lethal challenge. For the F1 DNA vaccine, removal of the N-terminal hydrophobic region was able to improve protective immunity. However, adding a mammalian signal peptide sequence to F1 actually led to reduced protection despite it inducing slightly higher anti-F1 antibody responses. The F1 gene can be fused with a gene coding for YscF, a newly confirmed partial protective antigen for Y. pestis, to produce DNA vaccines that express fused F1 and YscF antigens. One design, in particular, that had YscF fused to the downstream sequence of F1, produced better protection than separate F1 or YscF DNA vaccines, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these two antigens. Findings from the above studies indicated that there are multiple approaches to optimize the protective immunity for plague DNA vaccines. Most importantly, proper antigen engineering to produce optimal antigen gene inserts in DNA vaccines can clearly play a major role in the future designs of a wide range of DNA vaccines.","Wang, Shixia; Mboudjeka, Innocent; Goguen, Jon D; Lu, Shan",Vaccine,422,16

PATIENTS We retrospectively reviewed the data of 26 children who underwent mini-URS-LL for obstructive stones in proximal ureter between January 2016 and August 2018. The effectiveness of the mini-URS-LL was assessed based on the feasibility, reliability, and success of the technique. RESULTS Mean age was 3 ± 1.3 years, and 11 (42.3%) patients were ≤2 years old, remaining 15 (57.7%) were aged 3-5 years. Mean stone size was 9.11 ± 3.02 mm. A stone-free status was obtained at the end of 31 ureteroscopic procedure in 24 (92.3%) patients. The mean age was found significantly higher in patients who had the procedure without pre-stenting than the others who did (P = .027). No perioperative complication was experienced.

Application of behavior change techniques (BCTs) and persuasive system design (PSD) principles in eHealth development may contribute to the design of technologies that positively influence behavior and motivation to support the sustainable health behavior change needed. OBJECTIVE This review aimed to identify BCTs and PSD principles applied in eHealth interventions to support weight loss and weight loss maintenance, as well as techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation and adherence for long-term weight loss maintenance. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, Ovid MEDLINE (including PubMed), EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, and AMED, from January 1, 2007 to June 30, 2018. Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology was applied. Publications on eHealth interventions were included if focusing on weight loss or weight loss maintenance, in combination with motivation or adherence and behavior change. RESULTS The search identified 317 publications, of which 45 met the inclusion criteria. Of the 45 publications, 11 (24%) focused on weight loss maintenance, and 34 (76%) focused on weight loss. Mobile phones were the most frequently used technology (28/45, 62%). Frequently used wearables were activity trackers (14/45, 31%), as well as other monitoring technologies such as wireless or digital scales (8/45, 18%). All included publications were anchored in behavior change theories. Feedback and monitoring and goals and planning were core behavior change technique clusters applied in the majority of included publications. Social support and associations through prompts and cues to support and maintain new habits were more frequently used in weight loss maintenance than weight loss interventions. In both types of interventions, frequently applied persuasive principles were self-monitoring, goal setting, and feedback. Tailoring, reminders, personalization, and rewards were additional principles frequently applied in weight loss maintenance interventions. Results did not reveal an ideal combination of techniques or principles to stimulate motivation, adherence, and weight loss maintenance. However, the most frequently mentioned individual techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation were, personalization, simulation, praise, and feedback, whereas associations were frequently mentioned to stimulate adherence. eHealth interventions that found significant effects for weight loss maintenance all applied self-monitoring, feedback, goal setting, and shaping knowledge, combined with a human social support component to support healthy behaviors. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, this is the first review examining key BCTs and PSD principles applied in weight loss maintenance interventions compared with those of weight loss interventions. This review identified several techniques and principles applied to stimulate motivation and adherence. Future research should aim to examine which eHealth design combinations can be the most effective in support of long-term behavior change and weight loss maintenance.","Asbjørnsen, Rikke Aune; Smedsrød, Mirjam Lien; Solberg Nes, Lise; Wentzel, Jobke; Varsi, Cecilie; Hjelmesæth, Jøran; van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia Ewc",Journal of medical Internet research,422,11

To counteract this, involving patients in shared clinical decision making has proven to be of great value. Likewise, involving patients and other stakeholders as researchers is gaining ground. Patient and public involvement (PPI) in research entails many benefits, for example, by bringing further insight from those with lived experiences of being ill. There are various challenges associated with involving some older patients, for example frailty, cognitive impairment and other chronic illnesses. To the best of our knowledge, there are only a few examples of initiatives involving older patients beyond research participation. The feasibility of involving frail older patients during an ongoing care transition from hospital to primary health care remains unknown. To investigate the feasibility of including older frail patients, their relatives and health care professionals (HCPs) as co-researchers, we established a study with increasingly demanding levels of patient involvement to identify relevant outcome measures for future transitional care research. METHODS The study was a pragmatic, qualitative feasibility study. The involved individuals were frail older patients, their relatives and HCPs. Patients and their relatives were interviewed, while the interviewer made reflective notes. A thematic analysis was made. Relatives and HCPs discussed the themes to identify relevant outcome measures and potentially co-create new patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for use in future transitional care studies. The feasibility was evaluated according to six involvement steps. The level of involvement was evaluated using the five-levelled Health Canada Public Involvement Continuum (HCPIC). RESULTS In total, eight patients, five relatives and three HCPs were involved in the study. Patients were involved in discussing care transitions (HCPIC level 3), while some relatives were engaged (HCPIC level 4) in forming PROMs. The partnership level of involvement (HCPIC level 5) was not reached. The thematic analysis and the subsequent theme discussion successfully formed PROMs. The key PROMs were related to care, transparency and the relatives' roles in the transitional care process. CONCLUSIONS When applying a pragmatic involvement approach, frail older patients can be successfully involved in identifying relevant transitional care outcome measures; however, involving these patients as fellow researchers seems infeasible. To maintain involvement, supportive relatives are essential. Useful experiences for future research involvement of this vulnerable group were reported, arguing that patient participation has the potential to become inherent in future geriatric research.","Hansen, Troels Kjærskov; Jensen, Annesofie Lunde; Damsgaard, Else Marie; Rubak, Tone Maria Mørck; Jensen, Mikkel Erik Juul; Gregersen, Merete",Research involvement and engagement,422,1

Robotic assistance appears advantageous for this procedure, but literature regarding robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy is limited. OBJECTIVE The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and effectiveness of robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy in the largest consecutive series of patients to date. DESIGN This study is a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of prospectively collected data. SETTINGS The study was conducted in a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS All of the patients undergoing robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy for rectal prolapse syndromes between 2010 and 2015 were evaluated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Preoperative and postoperative (mesh and nonmesh) morbidity and functional outcome were analyzed. The actuarial recurrence rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS A total of 258 patients underwent robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy (mean ± SD follow-up = 23.5 ± 21.8 mo; range, 0.2 - 65.1 mo). There were no conversions and only 5 intraoperative complications (1.9%). Mortality (0.4%) and major (1.9%) and minor (<30 d) early morbidity (7.0%) were acceptably low. Only 1 (1.3%) mesh-related complication (asymptomatic vaginal mesh erosion) was observed. A significant improvement in obstructed defecation (78.6%) and fecal incontinence (63.7%) were achieved for patients (both p < 0.0005). At final follow-up, a new onset of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation was induced or worsened in 3.9% and 0.4%. The actuarial 5-year external rectal prolapse and internal rectal prolapse recurrence rates were 12.9% and 10.4%. LIMITATIONS This was a retrospective study including patients with minimal follow-up. No validated scores were used to assess function. The study was monocentric, and there was no control group. CONCLUSIONS Robot-assisted ventral mesh rectopexy is a safe and effective technique to treat rectal prolapse syndromes, providing an acceptable recurrence rate and good symptomatic relief with minimal morbidity.

However, periprocedural bleeding events, of which up to 50% are related to the access site, remain an important complication of PCI and are associated with higher costs, prolonged hospital stays, and increased mortality. Several randomized trials have demonstrated that PCI performed via radial artery (RA) access is associated with a reduction in bleeding events, and perhaps a reduction in mortality compared with femoral artery (FA) access. As a result, current practice guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society recommend that RA be the default strategy for PCI in patients presenting with ACS. The recently published Safety and Efficacy of Femoral Access vs. Radial Access in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (SAFARI-STEMI) trial challenges the benefits of a default RA approach in a contemporary setting where additional bleeding-reduction strategies (i.e., avoidance of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, routine use of bivalirudin for procedural anticoagulation, and vascular closure devices) were employed. In order to better understand the evidence that has shaped the current recommendations, we present a review of the background studies and major randomized trials comparing RA with FA in patients presenting with ACS.","Marbach, Jeffrey A; Alhassani, Saad; Wells, George; Le May, Michel",Herz,422,2

However, a direct comparison of the lipidomic profile of influenza virus and rhinovirus infections is lacking. In this study, we first compared the lipid profile of influenza virus and rhinovirus infection in a bronchial epithelial cell line. Most lipid features were downregulated for both influenza virus and rhinovirus, especially for the sphingomyelin features. Pathway analysis showed that sphingolipid metabolism was the most perturbed pathway. Functional study showed that bacterial sphingomyelinase suppressed influenza virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replication, but promoted rhinovirus replication. These findings suggest that sphingomyelin pathway can be a potential target for antiviral therapy, but should be carefully evaluated as it has opposite effects on different respiratory viruses. Furthermore, the differential effect of sphingomyelinase on rhinovirus and influenza virus may explain the interference between rhinovirus and influenza virus infection.","Dissanayake, Thrimendra Kaushika; Yan, Bingpeng; Ng, Anthony Chin-Ki; Zhao, Hanjun; Chan, Gabriella; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Sze, Kong-Hung; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang",The Journal of general virology,422,1

It is therefore distressing that there is major disagreement about the optimal serum level for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and appropriate supplement dose. The UK Scientific Advisory Committee for Nutrition has set the lowest level for defining sufficiency (10 ng/ml or 25 nmol/L) of any national advisory body or scientific society and consequently recommends supplementation with 10 micrograms (400 IU) per day. We have searched for published evidence to support this but not found it. There is considerable evidence to support the higher level for sufficiency (20 ng/ml or 50 nmol/L) recommended by the European Food Safety Authority and the American Institute of Medicine and hence greater supplementation (20 micrograms or 800 IU per day).

METHODS The nasopharyngeal secretions of 530 children with radiographically confirmed CAP were tested using the Luminex x TAG respiratory virus panel fast assay. Real-time polymerase chain reaction for the autolysin-A (LytA) and wzg (cpsA) genes of S. pneumoniae was performed on the RSV- and RV-positive samples. RESULTS Sixty-five of the 126 RSV-positive children (51.6%) were colonized with S. pneumoniae. Mean bacterial load was significantly higher in the patients with alveolar involvement (4.54±1.47 log10 DNA copies/mL vs. 3.75±1.62 log10 DNA copies/mL; P=0.04). Serotypes 5 and 19A were almost exclusively identified in the children with RSV and alveolar CAP, although the difference was statistically significant only for serotype 19A (P=0.03). Eighty-three of the 134 RV-positive children (61.9%) were colonized with S. pneumoniae and again mean bacterial load was significantly higher in the patients with alveolar involvement (4.21±1.37 log10 DNA copies/mL vs. 3.41±1.47 log10 DNA copies/mL; P=0.03). Serotypes 1, 5 and 19A were more frequently identified in the children with RV and alveolar CAP, although the difference was statistically significant only for serotype 5 (P=0.04). CONCLUSIONS In children with alveolar CAP and RSV or RV infection, the determination of nasopharyngeal pneumococcal bacterial load and identification of the serotypes can contribute to the diagnosis of mixed lung infection.","Esposito, Susanna; Zampiero, Alberto; Terranova, Leonardo; Ierardi, Valentina; Ascolese, Beatrice; Daleno, Cristina; Prada, Elisabetta; Pelucchi, Claudio; Principi, Nicola",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,422,16

Of the 371 samples examined, 9.4% (35/371) were positive for RVA. The RVA detection rates increased from 5.9% in 2004 and 8.5% in 2011 to 13.8% in 2012. A total of 23 positive samples were analyzed for RVA G and P genotypes. The dominant G-P combination was G9P[13] found in 60.9% of positive samples. The other combinations were G9P[7] (8.7%), G4P[13] (8.7%), G11P[13] (4.3%), and G11P[7] (4.3%). Sequence analysis of partial VP7 genes of selected strains revealed that the G4 strains were closely related to one another (95%) and, to a lesser extent, to human (82 to 84%) and porcine (84 to 86%) G4 strains. The G11 strains detected shared identical VP7 gene sequences (100%) and were closely related to human (85 to 86%) and other porcine (83%) G11 strains. The G9 strains identified were closely related to one another and to human and other porcine strains (96 to 97%, 89 to 91%, and 89 to 91% nucleotide identities, respectively). The VP4 gene analysis revealed that P[7] strains were closely related to each other and to P[7] strains isolated from porcine, bovine, and panda samples (91 to 99%, 92 to 99% and 92 to 99%, respectively). The P[13] strains showed a higher diversity among themselves and with other porcine P[13] strains, ranging from 83% to 99% and from 82 to 97%, respectively.

METHODS The ""Co-Pilot Project,"" which operates under its parent non-profit organization, Razom, organized multiple trips for American physicians to Ukraine. Activities included consulting in clinic, assisting with neurosurgical operations, and providing didactic lectures. Further efforts have included coordinating training opportunities for Ukrainian surgeons. We retrospectively reviewed all operations performed by Ukrainian ""partner"" physicians alongside American ""co-pilot"" physicians across Ukraine since August 2016. RESULTS Teams of Ukrainian and American physicians operated on 78 patients (24 children and 54 adults) for a total of 84 procedures in five different cities (Kyiv, Lutsk, Lviv, Odesa, and Stryi) of Ukraine. Operations were classified into the following categories: adult brain tumors (39), adult spine tumors (1), epilepsy (9), pain (2), pediatric brain tumors (11), vascular/endovascular (10), and miscellaneous (12). Four illustrative cases are described in detail. Of the patients with brain tumors, 43.5% (20/46) had giant tumors and gross total resection (GTR) or near total resection (NTR) was achieved in 78.3% (36/46). CONCLUSIONS Profound disparities in neurosurgical care exist globally which has led to the formation of collaborative relationships between physicians from various countries.

The use of viscous solutions allows a reduction in repeated injections, snare resections and procedural time. The aim was to describe the outcome of EMR of large LSTs performed at the time of index colonoscopy, using ORISE gel (Boston Scientific). METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed retrieving patients who underwent EMR of large colonic LSTs at the time of index colonoscopy. EMR was performed after dynamic injection of ORISE gel to create a submucosal cushion. Procedural parameters, together with pathological and endoscopic outcomes, were analyzed. RESULTS Five patients [three males, median age 65 (45-70) years] were included. Median LST size was 35 mm (25-40). Median procedure time was 8 min (range 3-13). En bloc resection was achieved in one out of five cases; four out of five were planned as piecemeal resections. A median of 10 mL (10-20) of viscous solution was injected. R0 resection was achieved in the single case who underwent en bloc EMR, whereas it was not assessable in the case of piecemeal resections. One self-limiting bleeding was observed. CONCLUSION The use of ORISE gel allows a well-tolerated and rapid performance of EMR of large colonic LSTs even at the time of index colonoscopy. In our opinion, in these specific situations, the use of viscous solutions is advisable and also affordable.","Lisotti, Andrea; Marocchi, Gianmarco; Calì, Anna; Fusaroli, Pietro",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,422,1

A Systematic Review.,10.042026,4.785936,2019,"PURPOSE To calculate a modified heat capacity (mHC) of small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in vivo during radio frequency ablation (RFA) and to determine if mHC correlates with tumour vascularity, adjacent vessels or local recurrence. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study was IRB approved and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Before formal RFA, ambient HCC temperature and temperature 1 min after heating at constant wattage were measured in 29 patients. From temperature change and wattage, individual mHCs (joules required to increase tumour temperature by 1° Celsius) were calculated. Pre-RFA, three-phase computerised tomography (CT) scans were reviewed blindly for hepatic arteries, hepatic veins and portal veins abutting or within 3 mm of tumour edge from which twelve vascular parameters were quantified. Tumour enhancement (homogeneous or heterogeneous on arterial phase) was also assessed. Multiple regression was used to correlate mHC with vascular parameters and tumour enhancement. Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the relationship of mHC to local recurrence. RESULTS There was significant correlation of mHC with lesion enhancement (P = 0.0018), length of hepatic arteries (P < 0.0001) and total hepatic vein volume in contact with tumour (P = 0.016). No correlation was found with any non-abutting vessel or portal vein parameter. The chance of local recurrence increased with increasing mHC. CONCLUSION Because the modified heat capacity of small HCCs in our study population correlated with HCC enhancement, abutting hepatic arteries, the volume of abutting hepatic veins and local recurrence, it may be an indicator of the heat sink effect (HSE) and supports the HSE as a risk factor for local recurrence.","Sheiman, Robert G; Mullan, Charles; Ahmed, Muneeb","International journal of hyperthermia : the official journal of European Society for Hyperthermic Oncology, North American Hyperthermia Group",422,31

This group, along with those with pre-existing heart and lung disease and diabetes, have accounted for 80% of hospitalizations and an even higher percentage of COVID-19 related deaths in the USA. West Virginia, the only state in the USA located completely within Appalachia, has a higher percentage of elderly than all but two states in the nation. Rural seniors are hesitant to use hospital emergency departments and attend routine care visits for fear of exposure to the virus. Restricted cell phone and internet service may limit effective technological outreach to more isolated rural older adults. More information is needed to develop effective, safe, and acceptable approaches to care for rural, isolated older adults. METHODS Telephone interviews were conducted with 124 community-dwelling residents in four counties in rural Appalachia between 1 and 22 April 2020. Participants were aged 75 years or older. Descriptive statistics were calculated and Fisher's Exact Test was used to examine for associations among variables. RESULTS Participants consisted of 86 (69.4%) women and 38 (30.6%) men with an average age of 82.5 years. Telephone contact was the preferred method of contact among all but four participants (96.8%). Seventeen calls (13.7%) resulted in some form of intervention, including arranging for emergent home repairs, treatment of severe hypertension, scheduling urgent laboratory testing, arranging for terminal care, treating acute conditions, and providing durable medical equipment. The 17 participants requiring intervention were significantly more likely to be aged 85 years or older (p=0.004), and report two or more chronic conditions (p<0.001). Those describing themselves as 'lonely' were significantly more likely to live alone (p=0.009) and describe themselves as 'anxious' or 'depressed' (p<0.001). CONCLUSION A telephone call appears to be the most effective means of communication with patients in these rural Appalachian counties. Patients aged 85 years or older and those living alone should be given highest priority for regular outreach by healthcare providers. In this population, systematically calling rural elderly patients during the COVID-19 epidemic and its aftermath represents an effective strategy for providers who care for elderly rural patients.","Walker, Robert B; Grome, Michael; Rollyson, William; Baus, Adam D",Rural and remote health,422,1
97051,97051,97051,Diagnosis and management of lymphoma in a green iguana (Iguana iguana).,10.199582,4.773014,2011,"BACKGROUND We aimed to investigate the physiological mechanism and spatial distribution of increased physiological dead-space, an early marker of ARDS mortality, in the initial stages of ARDS. We hypothesized that: increased dead-space results from spatial redistribution of pulmonary perfusion, not ventilation; such redistribution is not related to thromboembolism (i.e., areas with perfusion=0 and infinite ventilation-perfusion ratio, V ˙ / Q ˙ ), but rather to moderate shifts of perfusion increasing V ˙ / Q ˙ in non-dependent regions. METHODS Five healthy anesthetized sheep received protective ventilation for 20h while endotoxin was continuously infused. Maps of voxel-level lung ventilation, perfusion, V ˙ / Q ˙ , CO2 partial pressures, and alveolar dead-space fraction were estimated from positron emission tomography at baseline and 20h. RESULTS Alveolar dead-space fraction increased during the 20h (+0.05, p=0.031), mainly in non-dependent regions (+0.03, p=0.031). This was mediated by perfusion redistribution away from non-dependent regions (-5.9%, p=0.031), while spatial distribution of ventilation did not change, resulting in increased V ˙ / Q ˙ in non-dependent regions. The increased alveolar dead-space derived mostly from areas with intermediate V ˙ / Q ˙ (0.5≤ V ˙ / Q ˙ ≤10), not areas of nearly ""complete"" dead-space ( V ˙ / Q ˙ >10). CONCLUSIONS In this early ARDS model, increases in alveolar dead-space occur within 20h due to regional redistribution of perfusion and not ventilation. This moderate redistribution suggests changes in the interplay between active and passive perfusion redistribution mechanisms (including hypoxic vasoconstriction and gravitational effects), not the appearance of thromboembolism. Hence, the association between mortality and increased dead-space possibly arises from the former, reflecting gas-exchange inefficiency due to perfusion heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity results from injury and exhaustion of compensatory mechanisms for perfusion redistribution.","Beda, Alessandro; Winkler, Tilo; Wellman, Tyler J; De Prost, Nicolas; Tucci, Mauro; Vidal Melo, Marcos F",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,422,22

In February 2013, a kidney recipient with no reported exposures to potentially rabid animals died from rabies 18 months after transplantation. OBJECTIVES To investigate whether organ transplantation was the source of rabies virus exposure in the kidney recipient, and to evaluate for and prevent rabies in other transplant recipients from the same donor. DESIGN Organ donor and all transplant recipient medical records were reviewed. Laboratory tests to detect rabies virus-specific binding antibodies, rabies virus neutralizing antibodies, and rabies virus antigens were conducted on available specimens, including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues from the donor and the recipients. Viral ribonucleic acid was extracted from tissues and amplified for nucleoprotein gene sequencing for phylogenetic comparisons. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Determination of whether the donor died from undiagnosed rabies and whether other organ recipients developed rabies. RESULTS In retrospect, the donor's clinical presentation (which began with vomiting and upper extremity paresthesias and progressed to fever, seizures, dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, and brain death) was consistent with rabies. Rabies virus antigen was detected in archived autopsy brain tissue collected from the donor. The rabies viruses infecting the donor and the deceased kidney recipient were consistent with the raccoon rabies virus variant and were more than 99.9% identical across the entire N gene (1349/1350 nucleotides), thus confirming organ transplantation as the route of transmission. The 3 other organ recipients remained asymptomatic, with rabies virus neutralizing antibodies detected in their serum after completion of postexposure prophylaxis (range, 0.3-40.8 IU/mL). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Unlike the 2 previous clusters of rabies virus transmission through solid organ transplantation, there was a long incubation period in the recipient who developed rabies, and survival of 3 other recipients without pretransplant rabies vaccination. Rabies should be considered in patients with acute progressive encephalitis of unexplained etiology, especially for potential organ donors. A standard evaluation of potential donors who meet screening criteria for infectious encephalitis should be considered, and risks and benefits for recipients of organs from these donors should be evaluated.","Vora, Neil M; Basavaraju, Sridhar V; Feldman, Katherine A; Paddock, Christopher D; Orciari, Lillian; Gitterman, Steven; Griese, Stephanie; Wallace, Ryan M; Said, Maria; Blau, Dianna M; Selvaggi, Gennaro; Velasco-Villa, Andres; Ritter, Jana; Yager, Pamela; Kresch, Agnes; Niezgoda, Mike; Blanton, Jesse; Stosor, Valentina; Falta, Edward M; Lyon, G Marshall; Zembower, Teresa; Kuzmina, Natalia; Rohatgi, Prashant K; Recuenco, Sergio; Zaki, Sherif; Damon, Inger; Franka, Richard; Kuehnert, Matthew J",JAMA,422,17

RESULTS 171 responses were received (68% female, mean age 45, IQR = 36,51). Preferences for methods of meeting needs varied depending on the domain of need as well as participants' demographic and stroke-related characteristics. Face-to-face contact with a healthcare professional was a popular means of meeting needs, but methods outside of a traditional healthcare setting such as a succinct list of tips or peer support were widely acceptable and sometimes preferred. CONCLUSION This work provides the impetus for developing alternative methods of meeting young stroke survivors' needs, many of which are not resource-intensive nor require an appointment with a healthcare professional.","Keating, Jessica; Borschmann, Karen; Johns, Hannah; Churilov, Leonid; Bernhardt, Julie",Neurology,422,9

Disparities in adoption rates are also reported in older adult subgroups. The variability in adoption may be because PHRs are not designed to meet older adult users. OBJECTIVE We analyzed PHR evaluation studies to examine the characteristics and perspectives of older adult study participants to identify their self-reported needs. METHOD We searched Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Embase for PHR evaluation studies that involved older adult participants. RESULTS 1017 abstracts were identified, and 179 publications went through full text review. 10 publications met inclusion criteria. These publications described studies conducted in 3 countries, and evaluated 7 PHRs. Homogeneity was found in the study populations and participant opinions of the systems. DISCUSSION Many PHR evaluations do not include diverse older adult participants. This may lead to consistency in outcomes, but it also may create gaps in identifying user needs. Additional studies, specifically targeting diverse older adult participants, are needed to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the opinions of older adults on PHRs and how these systems could benefit older adult healthcare consumers. CONCLUSION The body of research shows that older adults are highly satisfied using PHRs. These outcomes may be generalizable because most PHR evaluation studies do not include diverse older adult participants. This lack of participant diversity may be contributing to the disparities observed in PHR adoption rates.","Kneale, Laura; Demiris, George",Journal of innovation in health informatics,422,7

However, meteorology causes concentration variations in addition to emission rate changes. Conventional positive matrix factorization (PMF) loses information from the data due to these dilution variations. By incorporating the ventilation coefficient, dispersion normalized PMF (DN-PMF) reduces the dilution effects. DN-PMF was applied to hourly speciated particulate composition data from a field campaign that included the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. DN-PMF sharpened the morning coal combustion and rush hour traffic peaks and lowered the daytime soil, aged sea salt, and waste incinerator contributions that better reflect the actual emissions. These results identified significant changes in source contributions after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. During this pandemic, secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) became the predominant PM2.5 source representing 50.5% of the mean mass. Fireworks and residential burning (32.0%), primary coal combustion emissions (13.3%), primary traffic emissions (2.1%), soil and aged sea salt (1.2%) and incinerator (0.9%) represent the other contributors. Traffic decreased dramatically (70%) compared to other sources. Soil and aged sea salt also decreased by 68%, likely from decreased traffic.","Dai, Qili; Liu, Baoshuang; Bi, Xiaohui; Wu, Jianhui; Liang, Danni; Zhang, Yufen; Feng, Yinchang; Hopke, Philip K",Environmental science & technology,422,20

A Self-Controlled Study Ex Vivo.,10.516379,4.805916,2019,"BACKGROUND Inherited cutis laxa, or inelastic, sagging skin is a genetic condition of premature and generalized connective tissue aging, affecting various elastic components of the extracellular matrix. Several cutis laxa syndromes are inborn errors of metabolism and lead to severe neurological symptoms. PATIENT AND METHODS In a patient with cutis laxa, a choreoathetoid movement disorder, dysmorphic features and intellectual disability we performed exome sequencing to elucidate the underlying genetic defect. We identified the amino acid substitution R275W in phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type IIα, caused by a homozygous missense mutation in the PI4K2A gene. We used lipidomics, complexome profiling and functional studies to measure phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate synthesis in the patient and evaluated PI4K2A deficient mice to define a novel metabolic disorder. RESULTS The R275W residue, located on the surface of the protein, is involved in forming electrostatic interactions with the membrane. The catalytic activity of PI4K2A in patient fibroblasts was severely reduced and lipid mass spectrometry showed that particular acyl-chain pools of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 were decreased. CONCLUSIONS Phosphoinositide lipids play a major role in intracellular signalling and trafficking and regulate the balance between proliferation and apoptosis. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases such as PI4K2A mediate the first step in the main metabolic pathway that generates PI4P, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 . Although neurologic involvement is common, cutis laxa has not been reported previously in metabolic defects affecting signalling. Here we describe a patient with a complex neurological phenotype, premature aging and a mutation in PI4K2A, illustrating the importance of this enzyme in the generation of inositol lipids with particular acylation characteristics.

However, these SNPs explain only 25% of the overall genetic variance and suggest a role of rare variants in BD vulnerability. Here, we combined high-throughput genotyping data and whole-exome sequencing in cohorts of individuals with BD as well as in multiplex families with a high density of affected individuals in order to determine the contribution of both common and rare variants to BD genetic vulnerability. Using polygenic risk scores (PRS), we showed a strong contribution of common polymorphisms previously associated with BD and schizophrenia (SZ) and noticed that those specifically associated with SZ contributed more in familial forms of BD than in non-familial ones. The analysis of rare damaging variants shared by affected individuals in multiplex families with BD revealed a single interaction network enriched in neuronal and developmental biological pathways, as well as in the regulation of gene expression. We identified four genes with a higher mutation rate in individuals with BD than in the general population and showed that mutations in two of them were associated with specific clinical manifestations. In addition, we showed a significant negative correlation between PRS and the number of rare damaging variants specifically in unaffected individuals of multiplex families. Altogether, our results suggest that common and rare genetic variants both contribute to the familial aggregation of BD and this genetic architecture may explain the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations in multiplex families.","Courtois, Elisa; Schmid, Mark; Wajsbrot, Orly; Barau, Caroline; Le Corvoisier, Philippe; Aouizerate, Bruno; Bellivier, Frank; Belzeaux, Raoul; Dubertret, Caroline; Kahn, Jean-Pierre; Leboyer, Marion; Olie, Emilie; Passerieux, Christine; Polosan, Mircea; Etain, Bruno; Jamain, Stéphane",Translational psychiatry,422,31

Methods The electromyographic response of the upper and lower leg muscles (M. rectus femoris; M. vastus medialis; M. semitendinosus; M. biceps femoris; M. gastrocnemius lateralis) of 15 male patients were measured after an isolated mechanical stimulus of the capsuloligamentous structures during an arthroscopic intervention using a customized intraoperative setup. Target parameters were the short (SLR; <30 milliseconds) and medium latency responses (MLR; >30 milliseconds) after the mechanically-induced trigger. Results The ACL, PCL, LM, and MM displayed high interindividual reproducibility of >76%. The MM was the only structure indicating both an SLR and MLR for all muscles. Although signals could be detected, there was no reproducibility in electromyographic signal activation for the HFP. The most rapid MLR was observed for the PM (quadriceps: 37 milliseconds). Conclusions Each stimulated structure displayed an individual MLR response, which allowed us to create neuromapping combining the anatomical and quantitative representations of the individual muscular activation patterns after isolated mechanical stimulation of the capsuloligamentous knee joint structures, corroborating our hypothesis.

The importance attached by parents, adolescents, providers and the media to having greater knowledge about HPV and its association with cervical cancer was identified. The relevance of good communication among healthcare professions and the community to enable adequate sharing of information regarding the risks and benefits of the vaccines was recognized. The inclusion of the vaccine in health insurance plans made access easier. The media must be involved as facilitators in vaccination programs.

Drawing on work as calling theory (WCT; Duffy, Dik, Douglass, England, & Velez, 2018) as a framework, our results first revealed that, consistent with previous research, perceiving a calling is an important antecedent to living a calling. However, in our sample of 129 U.S. teachers, results further showed that the relationship between perceiving a calling and living a calling is stronger for those with a mentor in their profession. We additionally extend WCT by examining both positive and potentially negative outcomes associated with living a calling, focusing on stress-related outcomes. Our findings revealed that, in addition to reporting higher levels of job satisfaction and work engagement, those who were living their calling experienced lower rates of stress-related absenteeism and reported fewer somatic complaints than those who did not believe they were living their calling.

We investigated the effect of parental migration on the health of left behind-children and adolescents in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS For this systematic review and meta-analysis we searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PsychINFO, Global Index Medicus, Scopus, and Popline from inception to April 27, 2017, without language restrictions, for observational studies investigating the effects of parental migration on nutrition, mental health, unintentional injuries, infectious disease, substance use, unprotected sex, early pregnancy, and abuse in left-behind children (aged 0-19 years) in LMICs. We excluded studies in which less than 50% of participants were aged 0-19 years, the mean or median age of participants was more than 19 years, fewer than 50% of parents had migrated for more than 6 months, or the mean or median duration of migration was less than 6 months. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted summary estimates from published reports independently. The main outcomes were risk and prevalence of health outcomes, including nutrition (stunting, wasting, underweight, overweight and obesity, low birthweight, and anaemia), mental health (depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, conduct disorders, self-harm, and suicide), unintentional injuries, substance use, abuse, and infectious disease. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RRs) and standardised mean differences (SMDs) using random-effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064871. FINDINGS Our search identified 10 284 records, of which 111 studies were included for analysis, including a total of 264 967 children (n=106 167 left-behind children and adolescents; n=158 800 children and adolescents of non-migrant parents). 91 studies were done in China and focused on effects of internal labour migration. Compared with children of non-migrants, left-behind children had increased risk of depression and higher depression scores (RR 1·52 [95% CI 1·27-1·82]; SMD 0·16 [0·10-0·21]), anxiety (RR 1·85 [1·36-2·53]; SMD 0·18 [0·11-0·26]), suicidal ideation (RR 1·70 [1·28-2·26]), conduct disorder (SMD 0·16 [0·04-0·28]), substance use (RR 1·24 [1·00-1·52]), wasting (RR 1·13 [1·02-1·24]) and stunting (RR 1·12 [1·00-1·26]). No differences were identified between left-behind children and children of non-migrants for other nutrition outcomes, unintentional injury, abuse, or diarrhoea. No studies reported outcomes for other infectious diseases, self-harm, unprotected sex, or early pregnancy. Study quality varied across the included studies, with 43% of studies at high or unclear risk of bias across five or more domains.

The reduced pain and superior cosmetic appearance it affords make it attractive to many patients. For this study, we focused on SILS, analyzing the outcomes of transumbilical single-incision laparoscopic liver resection (SILLR) achieved at our institution between January 2010 and February 2013. PATIENTS AND METHODS Pre- and postoperative data from 17 patients subjected to transumbilical SILLR for various hepatic lesions (8 hemangiomas, 2 hepatocellular carcinomas, 2 metastases, 2 calculi of left intrahepatic duct, and 3 adenomas) were assessed. Altogether, eight wedge resections, seven left lateral lobectomies, a combination wedge resection/left lateral lobectomy, and a proximal left hemihepatectomy segmentectomy were performed, as well as four simultaneous laparoscopic cholecystectomies. In each instance, three ports were installed through an umbilical incision. Once vessels and bleeding were controlled, the lesion(s) were resected with 5-mm margins of normal liver. Resected tissues were then bagged and withdrawn through the umbilical incision. The follow-up period lasted for a minimum of 6 months. RESULTS All 17 patients were successfully treated through a single umbilical incision. The procedures required 55 to 185 minutes to complete, with blood loss of 30 to 830 mL. Subjects regained bowel activity 0.8 to 2.3 days postoperatively and were discharged after 3 to 10 days. There were few complications (23.5%), limited to pleural effusion, wound infection, and incisional hernia. CONCLUSIONS Transumbilical SILLR is challenging to perform through conventional laparoscopic instrumentation. The risk of bleeding and technical difficulties is high for lesions of the posterosuperior hepatic segment. Surgical candidates should be carefully selected to optimize the benefits of this technique.","Wu, Shuodong; Yu, Xiao-Peng; Tian, Yu; Siwo, Ernest Amos; Li, Yongnan; Yu, Hong; Yao, Dianbo; Lv, Chao",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,422,11

Thus, it is hypothesized that TNF-α blockers can prevent either COVID-19 incidence or its serious symptoms. TNF-α blockers are prescribed to treat various autoimmune disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and seronegative spondyloarthropathies (SpA). Therefore, the objective of this work was to examine this hypothesis that TNF-α blockers can prevent COVID-19 incidence in patients with RA or SpA. Methods A case-control study was conducted through interviews based on a structured questionnaire to investigate the frequency of COVID-19 incidence in 254 eligible patients with RA or SpA about whom 45% were under treatment with one type of TNF-α blockers including infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept at least for 3 months during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interviews were carried out twice, at the beginning and the end of the study (June-December 2020). Patients with COVID-19 during the study or before that were considered as cases. The control group was patients without COVID-19 experience. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and logistic regression was used to determine the relationships between COVID-19 incidence and independent variables. Results A small percentage of patients treated with TNF-α blockers (5.22%, 6/115) experienced COVID-19, while a large percentage of patients with COVID-19 did not receive TNF-α blockers (27.34%, 38/139). According to odds ratio, adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept decreased significantly the risk of developing COVID-19 up to 96.8, 95, and 80.3% (p < 0.05), respectively. Therefore, TNF-α blockers could probably decrease the chances of the COVID-19 incidence in patients with RA or SpA. Conclusions A direct and positive correlation between the use of TNF-α blockers and a reduction in the incidence of COVID-19 could suggest the prophylactic role of these drugs in preventing COVID-19 in patients with RA and SpA.","Salesi, Mansour; Shojaie, Behrokh; Farajzadegan, Ziba; Salesi, Naghmeh; Mohammadi, Erfan",Rheumatology and therapy,422,32

CLINICAL PRESENTATION A 48-year-old man presented with a 6-week history of progressive headache, nausea, and ataxia. Bilateral intracranial vertebral artery occlusions and a left posterior inferior cerebellar artery stroke were diagnosed, and the patient began warfarin therapy. Despite these measures, the patient developed dense lower cranial neuropathies, including severe dysarthria, decreased left-sided hearing acuity, and left facial droop. He presented at this point for endovascular evaluation. The patient underwent successful revascularization with intravascular Wingspan stents (Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) in a delayed fashion (approximately 6 weeks after his initial stroke presentation). His neurological syndrome stabilized and began to improve slowly. CONCLUSION Patients with arterial occlusion should be evaluated acutely for potential revascularization. In the posterior circulation, clinical progression may supplant physiological imaging in the assessment of hemodynamic collapse. A subpopulation of patients will present with progressive deficits distinct from extracranial manifestations of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; these patients should be considered for delayed revascularization.","Ogilvy, Christopher S; Khalessi, Alexander A; Hauck, Erik F; Shannon, Larry R; Hopkins, L Nelson; Levy, Elad I; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Neurosurgery,422,1

The evolving nature of viral transmission makes it difficult to predict the potential impact on the health system and the readiness of healthcare managers and professional staff in responding to system transformation and consequential impacts. This is compounded by sudden increased demands in the types of work required. Guidance for implementing targeted strategies for health systems and services should include evidence that considers the feasibility, appropriateness, meaningfulness and effectiveness of healthcare practices at both the system and organization level. This is consistent with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) model of evidence synthesis and translation. Evidence-based decision-making is a core management competency for health service leadership and the mechanism for improving the quality of management decisions, and hence better service delivery, effectiveness and efficiency. Human resources are the most important asset in crisis management. Health managers must create responsive surge capacity by quantifying existent human and material resources and the shortfall needs required to meet anticipated additional demand. We believe a multifaceted approach is the key to developing systemic surge capacity within the heath sector when faced with the management of crises such as pandemics. We explore and discuss the desirability of strategies based on the JBI model of evidence synthesis and implementation with a view to encouraging the creation of registries and follow-up systems. We believe this will encourage the effective use of human resources including the upskilling in how future crises may be addressed.","Khalil, Hanan; Liang, Zhanming; Karimi, Leila; Ferrier, J Adamm; Leggat, Sandra G",International journal of evidence-based healthcare,422,27

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of non-operative management of umbilical hernias on cost, work absenteeism, and resource utilization. METHODS The Truven Health Database, consisting of 279 employers and over 3000 hospitals, was reviewed for all umbilical hernia patients, aged 18-64 who were enrolled in health plans for 12 months prior to surgery and 12 months after surgery. Patients were excluded if they had a recurrence or had been offered a ""no surgery"" approach within 1 year of the index date. The remaining patients were separated into surgery (open or laparoscopic repair) or no surgery (NS). Post-cost analysis at 90 and 365 days and estimated days off from work were reviewed for each group. RESULTS The non-surgery cohort had a higher proportion of females and comorbidity index. Adjusted analysis showed significantly higher 90 and 365 costs for the surgery group (p < 0.0001), though the cost difference did decrease over time. NS group had significantly higher estimated days of health-care utilization at both the 90 (1.99 vs. 3.58 p < 0.0001) and 365 (8.69 vs. 11.04 p < 0.0001) day post-index mark. A subgroup analysis demonstrated laparoscopic repair had higher costs compared to open primarily due to higher index procedure costs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Though the financial costs were found to be higher in the surgery group, the majority of these were due to the surgery itself. Significantly higher days of health-care utilization and estimated days off work were experienced in the NS group. It is our belief that early operative intervention will lead to decreased costs and resource utilization.","Strosberg, David S; Pittman, Matthew; Mikami, Dean",Surgical endoscopy,422,5

We planned a prospective observational cohort study to test the hypothesis that objective neuromuscular monitoring can help us in avoiding the use of anticholinesterases for reversal. Methods The patients posted for surgery of <2 h duration were included in the study. The cohort of patients was formed on the basis of those who were exposed to objective neuromuscular monitoring of recovery (train-of-four [TOF] ratio of 0.9 or more; exposed group) and the patients who were not exposed to objective neuromuscular monitoring (non-exposed group) acting as a control. Using objective neuromuscular monitoring, the time required for recovery from muscle relaxation when neostigmine was not given for reversal was noted and it was then compared with that of the control group. Results A total of 190 patients were enrolled over a period of 3 years. With the use of TOF ratio of 0.9 for extubation, patients safely recovered from neuromuscular blockade, without using neostigmine, with no difference in the mean recovery time (14.48 ± 1.138 min) as compared to the control group (12.14 ± 1.067 min, P = 0.139). There was no incidence of reintubation in post-operative period. Conclusion With objective neuromuscular monitoring, we can ensure complete recovery from the neuromuscular blockade while avoiding the use of anticholinesterases.","Goyal, Shilpa; Kothari, Nikhil; Chaudhary, Deepak; Verma, Shilpi; Bihani, Pooja; Rodha, Mahaveer Singh",Indian journal of anaesthesia,422,16

PARTICIPANTS Self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data for 825 students from 2 universities. RESULTS A total of 49.7% of the participants held misconception(s) concerning H1N1 transmission. Less than 30% washed their hands >10 times/d; 72.3% did not reduce the frequency of touching their mouths, noses, and eyes; only 9.3% would wear face masks if they had influenza-like symptoms. However, 45% worried that one/one's family would contract H1N1, 10.7% were panicking/feeling depressed/feeling emotionally disturbed as a result of H1N1, and 14.9% were fearful about the WHO's H1N1 pandemic announcement. Almost all cognitive variables of this study were significantly associated with mental distress caused by fear of H1N1 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.29-3.81), but very few were associated with adoption of preventive measures (OR = 0.65-1.90). CONCLUSIONS Preventive measures are warranted to alleviate distress in the population studied via health education and promotion.","Gu, Jing; Zhong, Ying; Hao, Yuantao; Zhou, Daming; Tsui, Hiyi; Hao, Chun; Gao, Qi; Ling, Wenhua; Lau, Joseph Tak Fai",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,422,31

Adult, obese (body mass index ≥35 kg/m2 ), and elderly patients (aged >65 years) were included. Propofol infusion was started at 2000 mg/h until loss of consciousness and then guided by target BIS values (40-60). Measurements of propofol plasma concentration were performed using gas chromatography. A PKPD model was developed using NONMEM. The data set contained 423 propofol concentrations and 483 897 BIS values from 60 patients (20-92 years, 42-136 kg). A 3-compartment model was used to describe the plasma concentrations of propofol. An allometric model using lean body weight calculated by the Janmahasatian formula was found to describe the data better than total body weight for all clearance parameters, V1 and V2. An age effect was found on Q2, Q3, V1, and V3. With respect to the PD model, the use of a 2-compartment model significantly improved the model fit. Age and total body weight were included as covariates in the final pharmacodynamic model. We propose a PKPD model for propofol anesthesia with acceptable performance accuracy in a heterogeneous group of adult, elderly, and obese patients. A new method to predict propofol induction dose is presented. This method and the possibility to directly change target BIS values in opposition to the assumed target effect-site concentration constitutes certain advantages to the clinical practice.","Araújo, Ana Maria; Machado, Humberto; de Pinho, Paula Guedes; Soares-da-Silva, Patrício; Falcão, Amílcar",Journal of clinical pharmacology,422,16

With the rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the healthcare field the future care of our patients will depend on the decisions we make now. Demographic healthcare inequalities continue to persist worldwide and the impact of medical biases on different patient groups is still being uncovered by the research community. At a time when clinical AI systems are scaled up in response to the Covid19 pandemic, the role of AI in exacerbating health disparities must be critically reviewed. For AI to account for the past and build a better future, we must first unpack the present and create a new baseline on which to develop these tools. The means by which we move forwards will determine whether we project existing inequity into the future, or whether we reflect on what we hold to be true and challenge ourselves to be better.

The literature on the effects of feedback from WIST during work or work-related activities has not been previously summarised. This review examines the effectiveness of feedback on upper body kinematics during work or work-related activities, along with the wearability and a quantification of the kinematics of the related device. Methods: The Cinahl, Cochrane, Embase, Medline, Scopus, Sportdiscus and Google Scholar databases were searched, including reports from January 2005 to July 2021. The included studies were summarised descriptively and the evidence was assessed. Results: Fourteen included studies demonstrated a 'limited' level of evidence supporting posture and/or movement behaviour improvements using WIST feedback, with no improvements in pain. One study assessed wearability and another two investigated comfort. Studies used tri-axial accelerometers or IMU integration (n = 5 studies). Visual and/or vibrotactile feedback was mostly used. Most studies had a risk of bias, lacked detail for methodological reproducibility and displayed inconsistent reporting of sensor technology, with validation provided only in one study. Thus, we have proposed a minimum 'Technology and Design Checklist' for reporting. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that WIST may improve posture, though not pain; however, the quality of the studies limits the strength of this conclusion. Wearability evaluations are needed for the translation of WIST outcomes. Minimum reporting standards for WIST should be followed to ensure methodological reproducibility.","Lee, Roger; James, Carole; Edwards, Suzi; Skinner, Geoff; Young, Jodi L; Snodgrass, Suzanne J",Sensors,422,17

Yet, despite being armed with the required information and guidance for self-management, self-care and adherence to foot self-care recommendations and compliance to medication among patients with diabetic foot ulcer and diabetic lower extremity amputations remain low and suboptimal. This study reveals in-depth account of nine such patients' beliefs and perceptions around their illness, their self-care, and their health-seeking behaviours. Patients living with diabetic lower extremity amputation displayed profound lack of knowledge of self-care of diabetes and foot and passive health-related behaviours. The overarching sense that ""when nothing happens, nobody is afraid,"" points to a lack of motivation in taking charge of one's own health, whether this is with reference to treatment or care adherence, following recommended self-care advice, or seeking timely treatment. The Health Beliefs Model provides the theoretical framework for probing into the factors for the participants' suboptimal self-care and passive health-seeking behaviours. Two themes emerged from data analysis: profound knowledge deficit and passive health-related behaviours. The beliefs and perceptions around self-care and health-seeking behaviours for patients with lower extremity amputation are interpreted as the ""ignorant self"" with passive health-seeking behaviours. Patients with diabetes and diabetic foot diseases may benefit from personalized education, motivational interviewing, and family support.","Zhu, Xiaoli; Lee, Mary; Chew, Evelyn Al; Goh, Ling Jia; Dong, Lijuan; Bartlam, Bernadette",International wound journal,422,26

In this study, we compared the perioperative outcomes and complications of LA on large (≥ 6 cm) and (< 6 cm) adrenal tumors. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all clinical data of patients who underwent unilateral transperitoneal LA in our institution between April 2000 and June 2019. Patients were classified by tumor size into 2 groups. Patients in group 1 had tumor size < 6 cm (n = 408) and patient in group 2 had tumor size ≥ 6 cm (n = 48). Demographic data, perioperative outcomes, complications, and pathologic reports were compared between groups. RESULTS Patients in group 2 were significant older (p = 0.04), thinner (p = 0.001) and had lower incident of hypertension (p = 0.001), with a significantly higher median operative time (75 vs 120 min), estimated blood loss (20 vs 100 ml), transfusion rate (0 vs 20.8%), conversion rate (0.25 vs 14.6%) and length of postoperative stays ( 4 vs 5.5 days) than in group 2 (all p < 0.001). Group 2 patients also had significantly higher frequency of intraoperative complication (4.7 vs 31.3%; adjust Odds Ratio [OR] = 9.67 (95% CI 4.22-22.17), p-value < 0.001) and postoperative complication (5.4 vs 31.3%; adjust OR = 5.67 (95% CI 2.48-12.97), p-value < 0.001). Only eight (1.8%) major complications occurred in this study. The most common pathology in group 2 patient was pheochromocytoma and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic transperitoneal adrenalectomy in large adrenal tumor ≥ 6 cm is feasible but associated with significantly worse intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, and recovery. However, most of the complications were minor and could be managed conservatively. Careful patient selection with the expert surgeon in adrenal surgery is the key factor for successful laparoscopic surgery in a large adrenal tumor.

However, interruption of inflammatory cytokine activation failed to attenuate ARDS, suggesting that other therapies are required to treat this illness and improve survival. Etoposide (ET), a cytotoxic agent, and prednisolone (PSL), a corticosteroid with strong anti-inflammatory activity, have been used to treat other disease involving similar cytokine-activated macrophages and hemophagocytic activity. However, they have not been previously tested as ARDS therapeutics alone or in combination. In the present study, we used a fatal ARDS mouse model induced via administration of α-galactosylceramide and lipopolysaccharide, which resulted in the development of severe lung injury with hypercytokinemia and hemophagocytosis, all of which were observed in ARDS patients infected with highly pathogenic respiratory viruses. The ET and PSL combination therapy, but not ET or PSL alone, reduced the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells including macrophages, natural killer T cells, and neutrophils, and significantly improved the survival rate in this model. Furthermore, whereas ET alone improved lung edema, it did not increase the survival rate, indicating the necessity of PSL in the treatment of ARDS. Surprisingly, combination therapy did not reduce the production of cytokines and chemokines in the lungs, demonstrating that inflammatory cells, rather than hypercytokinemia, are the direct target of these compounds and primary cause of ARDS-related death. Thus, combination therapy with ET and PSL that targets inflammatory cells has the potential to attenuate fatal ARDS.","Aoyagi, Tetsuji; Sato, Yukio; Toyama, Masahiko; Oshima, Kengo; Kawakami, Kazuyoshi; Kaku, Mistuo",Shock,422,19

No studies of medical devices and software assess the impact on patient safety of the FDA's current regulatory safeguards and new legislative changes to those standards. Our analysis quantifies the impact of software problems in regulated medical devices and indicates that current regulations are necessary but not sufficient for ensuring patient safety by identifying and eliminating dangerous defects in software currently on the market. New legislative changes will further deregulate health IT, reducing safeguards that facilitate the reporting and timely recall of flawed medical software that could harm patients. CONTEXT Medical software has become an increasingly critical component of health care, yet the regulatory landscape for digital health is inconsistent and controversial. To understand which policies might best protect patients, we examined the impact of the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) regulatory safeguards on software-related technologies in recent years and the implications for newly passed legislative changes in regulatory policy. METHODS Using FDA databases, we identified all medical devices that were recalled from 2011 through 2015 primarily because of software defects. We counted all software-related recalls for each FDA risk category and evaluated each high-risk and moderate-risk recall of electronic medical records to determine the manufacturer, device classification, submission type, number of units, and product details. FINDINGS A total of 627 software devices (1.4 million units) were subject to recalls, with 12 of these devices (190,596 units) subject to the highest-risk recalls. Eleven of the devices recalled as high risk had entered the market through the FDA review process that does not require evidence of safety or effectiveness, and one device was completely exempt from regulatory review. The largest high-risk recall categories were anesthesiology and general hospital, with one each in cardiovascular and neurology. Five electronic medical record systems (9,347 units) were recalled for software defects classified as posing a moderate risk to patient safety. CONCLUSIONS Software problems in medical devices are not rare and have the potential to negatively influence medical care. Premarket regulation has not captured all the software issues that could harm patients, evidenced by the potentially large number of patients exposed to software products later subject to high-risk and moderate-risk recalls. Provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act that became law in late 2016 will reduce safeguards further. Absent stronger regulations and implementation to create robust risk assessment and adverse event reporting, physicians and their patients are likely to be at risk from medical errors caused by software-related problems in medical devices.","Ronquillo, Jay G; Zuckerman, Diana M",The Milbank quarterly,422,33

PURPOSE To determine whether contrast agent injection rate affects the degree of BPE in women undergoing breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 85 patients included in our prospective study randomly received 0.1 mmol/kg gadoteridol at a rate of 3 mL/s (group A; n = 46) or 2 mL/s (group B; n = 39). Breast MRI was performed at 3T using a standard protocol including postcontrast axial 3D GRE T1-weighted sequences. Two expert breast radiologists, blinded to clinical and radiological information, independently quantified BPE on early postcontrast subtracted images, assigning a score of 1-4. Mean comparison and regression analysis were performed to assess the influence of injection rate on BPE. RESULTS Groups were homogeneous in terms of age and final BI-RADS score. The mean BPE score was significantly lower among patients in group A (mean of two readers: 1.36 vs. 1.90; P < 0.01) with 70%-72% of patients assigned a BPE score of 1, compared with 36%-38% of patients in group B. Lower BPE scores were noted with the higher flow rate in subgroup analyses of both pre- and postmenopausal women, although the effect was more evident in premenopausal women. Regression analysis confirmed that the likelihood of a BPE 1 score was significantly increased with a higher flow rate (P < 0.01). The inter-reader agreement was excellent (0.83). CONCLUSION A higher contrast agent injection flow rate (3 mL/s) during breast MRI significantly reduces the degree of BPE, potentially allowing improved diagnostic accuracy by reducing false-positive and false-negative findings.","Marzocca, Flaminia; Moffa, Giuliana; Landi, Valerio Nispi; Panzironi, Giovanna; Kirchin, Miles A; Pediconi, Federica; Galati, Francesca",Acta radiologica,422,7

We qualitatively reviewed and quantitatively summarized the available literature on procedural and clinical outcomes after stereotactic navigated ablation of malignant liver tumors. Methods A systematic literature search was performed on procedural and clinical outcomes when using stereotactic or robotic navigation for laparoscopic or percutaneous thermal ablation. The online databases Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched. Endpoints included targeting accuracy, procedural efficiency, and treatment efficacy outcomes. Meta-analysis including subgroup analyses was performed. Results Thirty-four studies (two randomized controlled trials, three prospective cohort studies, 29 case series) were qualitatively analyzed, and 22 studies were included for meta-analysis. Weighted average lateral targeting error was 3.7 mm (CI 3.2, 4.2), with all four comparative studies showing enhanced targeting accuracy compared to free-hand targeting. Weighted average overall complications, major complications, and mortality were 11.4% (6.7, 16.1), 3.4% (2.1, 5.1), and 0.8% (0.5, 1.3). Pooled estimates of primary technique efficacy were 94% (89, 97) if assessed at 1-6 weeks and 90% (87, 93) if assessed at 6-12 weeks post ablation, with remaining between-study heterogeneity. Primary technique efficacy was significantly enhanced in stereotactic vs. free-hand targeting, with odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 (1.2, 3.2) (n = 6 studies). Conclusions Advances in stereotactic navigation technologies allow highly precise and safe tumor targeting, leading to enhanced primary treatment efficacy.

Our results revealed that FA pre-treatment for 24 hours can reverse cell loss of H2 O2 -induced ARPE-19 cells via the promotion of cell proliferation and prevention of apoptosis, as evidenced by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labelling (TUNEL) assay, respectively. Moreover, the addition of FA (5 mM) can decrease Bax and cleaved caspase-3 protein expression, but increase Bcl-2 protein expression in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, H2 O2 -induced oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells was significantly alleviated by FA, illustrated by reduced levels of ROS and MDA. In addition, the attenuated antioxidant enzymes activities of (SOD, CAT and GPX) and GSH level were reversed almost to the normal base level by the pre-addition of FA for 24 hours. In all assays, FA itself did not exert any effect on the change of the above parameters. These novel findings indicated that FA effectively protected human ARPE-19 cells from H2 O2 -induced oxidative damage through its pro-proliferation, anti-apoptosis and antioxidant activity, suggesting that FA has a therapeutic potential in the prevention and treatment of AMD.","Xie, Kunpeng; Jin, Bo; Zhu, Haiyan; Zhou, Pengyi; Du, Liping; Jin, Xuemin",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,422,1

The tertiary organization of the E2 ectodomain is mainly composed of domains I-III, followed by the stem (ST) region and transmembrane (TM) domain. The ST region is critical for reorganizing the envelope glycoproteins during the membrane fusion process. While this region is relatively flexible, the physicochemical properties of its amino acid residues are conserved. Whether and how this physicochemical conservation is required for HCV infection is still unclear. The last residue of the E2 ST region evolved to be either an arginine or lysine among different HCV strains, suggesting that the residues confer different functions during HCV infection. To address this possibility, we constructed an R719K point mutant in the JFH-1 strain (genotype 2a) in the context of the cell-culture derived HCV (HCVcc) system. Compared with wild-type (wt) HCV, the R719K mutant exhibited decreased growth, and its extracellular and intracellular infectivity were also significantly decreased at 48 and 72 h post-electroporation. Correspondingly, less RNA and HCV core protein was observed in the supernatant for the R719K mutant, as well as less efficient RNA replication and protein expression. These findings indicate that the 719th residue of arginine on E2 is critical to promote HCV replication and infection. The data provide new clues for the biochemical function of E2, which is required for efficient HCV assembly and infection.","Qin, Zhao-ling; Ju, He-peng; Wang, Wen-bo; Ren, Hao; Guan, Mo; Zhao, Ping; Qi, Zhong-tian",Virus research,422,26

CGN rats were administrated with AS-IV at 10 mg·kg-1 ·d-1 (ASL) and 20 mg·kg-1 ·d-1 (ASH). Twenty four hour proteinuria, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and serum creatinine (SCr) were detected. Hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining were performed to evaluate the kidney lesion. Transmission electron microscope and GFP-RFP-LC3 transfection assay were used to monitor the effect of AS-IV on autophagy. IL-6 and IL-1β were detected. The expression of CyclinD1, PI3K/AKT/AS160 pathway and autophagy related proteins were detected by Western Blot. The results demonstrated that AS-IV improved kidney function, ameliorated kidney lesion, and diminished inflammatory in CGN rats. Further, both in vivo and vitro study demonstrated that AS-IV inhibited the proliferation of mesangial cells. AS-IV further displayed a remarkable effect on inhibiting the activation of PI3K/AKT/AS160 pathway and improved the activation of autophagy in vivo and vitro. These results suggested that AS-IV is a potential therapeutic agent for CGN and merits further investigation.","Lu, Ruirui; Chen, Junqi; Liu, Bihao; Lin, Hua; Bai, Lixia; Zhang, Peichun; Chen, Dandan; Li, Honglian; Li, Jicheng; Pang, Yu; Zhou, Yuan; Zhou, Jiuyao; Wu, Junbiao",Phytotherapy research : PTR,422,5

Previously, no attempt had been made to discover which EEG characteristics cause discrepancies between BIS and Entropy. We compared BIS and Entropy values, and analysed the changes in the raw EEG signal during surgical anaesthesia with sevoflurane. METHODS In this prospective, open-label study, 65 patients receiving general anaesthesia with sevoflurane were enrolled. BIS, Entropy and multichannel digital EEG were recorded. Concurrent BIS and State Entropy (SE) values were selected. Whenever BIS and SE values showed ≥10-unit disagreement for ≥60 s, the raw EEG signal was analysed both in time and frequency domain. RESULTS A ≥10-unit disagreement ≥60 s was detected 428 times in 51 patients. These 428 episodes accounted for 5158 (11%) out of 45 918 analysed index pairs. During EEG burst suppression, SE was higher than BIS in 35 out of 49 episodes. During delta-theta dominance, BIS was higher than SE in 141 out of 157 episodes. During alpha or beta activity, SE was higher than BIS in all 49 episodes. During electrocautery, both BIS and SE changed, sometimes in the opposite direction, but returned to baseline values after electrocautery. Electromyography caused index disagreement four times (BIS > SE). CONCLUSIONS Certain specific EEG patterns, and artifacts, are associated with discrepancies between BIS and SE. Time and frequency domain analyses of the original EEG improve the interpretation of studies involving BIS, Entropy and other EEG-based indices.

We prove that irradiation of aqueous suspensions of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-coated silver nanoplates (PVPAgNP) or PVPAgNP in HeLa cells with red or NIR lasers causes a sizeable photothermal effect, which in cells can be visualized with the temperature sensing fluorophore Rhodamine B (RhB) using spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscopy or fluorescence lifetime imaging. Upon red-light irradiation of cells that were incubated with both, RhB and PVPAgNP at concentrations with no adverse effects on cell viability, a substantial heat release is detected. Initiation of cell death by photothermal effect is observed by positive signals of fluorescent markers for early and late apoptosis. Surprisingly, a new nanomaterial-assisted cell killing mode is operating when PVPAgNP-loaded HeLa cells are excited with moderate powers of fs-pulsed NIR light. Small roundish areas are generated with bright and fast (<1 ns) decaying emission, which expand fast and destroy the whole cell in seconds. This characteristic emission is assigned to efficient optical breakdown initiation around the strongly absorbing PVPAgNP leading to plasma formation that spreads fast through the cell.","Rivas Aiello, María Belén; Azcárate, Julio C; Zelaya, Eugenia; David Gara, Pedro; Bosio, Gabriela N; Gensch, Thomas; Mártire, Daniel O",Biomaterials science,422,1

COVID-19 has caused sudden closures or radical modifications of these services, and is resulting in prolonged self-isolation. The aim of this study was to explore the effects of COVID-19 related social care and support service changes and closures on the lives of PLWD and unpaid carers. METHOD PLWD and unpaid carers were interviewed via telephone in April 2020. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Demographic characteristics including household Index of Multiple Deprivation score and weekly hours of social support service usage before and since the COVID-19 outbreak were also collected. Paired samples t-tests was used to compare the mean of weekly hours of social support service usage before and since the outbreak. RESULTS 50 semi-structured interviews were conducted with unpaid carers (n = 42) and PLWD (n = 8). There was a significant reduction in social support service usage since the outbreak. Thematic analysis identified three overarching themes: (1) Loss of control; (2) Uncertainty; (3) Adapting and having to adapt to the new normal. Carers and PLWD were greatly affected by the sudden removal of social support services, and concerned about when services would re-open. Carers were worried about whether the person they cared for would still be able to re-join social support services. CONCLUSIONS PLWD and carers need to receive specific practical and psychological support during the pandemic to support their well-being, which is severely affected by public health restrictions.","Giebel, Clarissa; Cannon, Jacqueline; Hanna, Kerry; Butchard, Sarah; Eley, Ruth; Gaughan, Anna; Komuravelli, Aravind; Shenton, Justine; Callaghan, Steve; Tetlow, Hilary; Limbert, Stan; Whittington, Rosie; Rogers, Carol; Rajagopal, Manoj; Ward, Kym; Shaw, Lisa; Corcoran, Rhiannon; Bennett, Kate; Gabbay, Mark",Aging & mental health,422,1

There are several types of bioprinters, especially inkjet-based bioprinter, which can be used not only as a printer for arranging cells but also as a precision cell-dispensing device with controlled cell numbers similar to a fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS). Precise cell dispensers are expected to be useful in the fields of drug discovery and single-cell analysis. However, there are enduring concerns about the impacts of cell dispensers on cell integrity, particularly on sensitive cells, such as stem cells. In response to the concerns stated above, we developed a stress-free and media-direct-dispensing inkjet bioprinter. In the present study, in addition to conventional viability assessments, we evaluated the gene expression using RNA-seq to investigate whether the developed bioprinter influenced cell integrity in mouse embryonic stem cells. We evaluated the developed bioprinter based on three dispensing methods: manual operation using a micropipette, FACS and the developed inkjet bioprinter. According to the results, the developed inkjet bioprinter exhibited cell-friendly dispensing performance, which was similar to the manual dispensing operation, based not only on cell viability but also on gene expression levels.","Yumoto, Masayuki; Hemmi, Natsuko; Sato, Naoki; Kawashima, Yudai; Arikawa, Koji; Ide, Keigo; Hosokawa, Masahito; Seo, Manabu; Takeyama, Haruko",Scientific reports,422,1

Interestingly, several other molecules are reported to trigger stress-specific defense responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. In this study, we investigated the effect of 14 elicitors against diverse but pivotal types of abiotic (drought) and biotic (the chewing insect Ascia monuste, the hemibiotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae DC 3000 and the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria alternata) stresses on broccoli and Arabidopsis. Among the main findings, broccoli pre-treated with SA and chitosan showed the highest drought stress recovery in a dose-dependent manner. Several molecules led to increased drought tolerance over a period of three weeks. The enhanced drought tolerance after triggering the SA pathway was associated with stomata control. Moreover, methyl jasmonate (MeJA) reduced A. monuste insect development and plant damage, but unexpectedly, other elicitors increased both parameters. GUS reporter assays indicated expression of the SA-dependent PR1 gene in plants treated with nine elicitors, whereas the JA-dependent LOX2 gene was only expressed upon MeJA treatment. Overall, elicitors capable of tackling drought and biotrophic pathogens mainly triggered the SA pathway, but adversely also induced systemic susceptibility to chewing insects. These findings provide directions for potential future in-depth characterization and utilization of elicitors and induced resistance in plant protection.","Venegas-Molina, Jhon; Proietti, Silvia; Pollier, Jacob; Orozco-Freire, Wilson; Ramirez-Villacis, Darío; Leon-Reyes, Antonio",Scientific reports,422,1

However, its role as a biological vector has been scarcely studied in the livestock context. In this study, a 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing analysis was used to determine bacterial diversity in salivary glands and gut of R. microplus from two contrasting livestock agroecosystems in Antioquia, Colombia. Both the culture-independent approach (CI) and the culture-dependent (CD) approach were complementarily adopted in this study. A total of 341 unique OTUs were assigned, the richness showed to be higher in the Northern than in the Middle Magdalena region, and a high diversity was found at the phylum and genus levels in the samples obtained. With the CI approach, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the most common phylum of bacteria regardless of the organ, or geographic origin of the specimens analyzed. While the relative abundance of bacteria at a phylum level with the CD approach varied between analyzed samples, the data obtained suggest that a high diversity of species of bacteria occurs in R. microplus from both livestock agroecosystems. Bacterial genera such as Anaplasma, Coxiella, and Ehrlichia, recognized for their implications in tick-borne diseases, were also detected, together with endosymbionts such as Lysinibacillus, previously reported as a potential tool for biological control. This information is useful to deepen the knowledge about microbial diversity regarding the relations between endosymbionts and pathogens and could facilitate the future development of epidemiological surveillance in livestock systems.","Segura, Juan A; Isaza, Juan P; Botero, Luz E; Alzate, Juan F; Gutiérrez, Lina A",PloS one,422,1

OBJECTIVE This systematic literature review and meta-regression sought to analyse the evolution of in-game demands in AFL matches from 2005 to 2017, focusing on the relationship between volume and intensity. METHODS A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted. Included studies examined the physical demands of AFL matches utilising global positioning system (GPS) technology. Meta-regression analysed the shift in reported volume (total distance and total match time) and intensity (metres per minute [m.min-1], sprint duration and acceleration) metrics for overall changes, across quarters and positional groups (forwards, nomadics and defenders) from 2005 to 2017 inclusive and for each year between 2005 and 2007, 2007 and 2010, 2010 and 2012, and 2012 and 2015/2017 breakpoints. RESULTS Distance (p = 0.094), m.min-1 (p = 0.494), match time (p = 0.591), time over 18 km·h-1 (p = 0.271), and number of accelerations greater than 4 km·h-1 (p = 0.498) and 10 km·h-1 (p = 0.335) in 1 s did not change from 2005 to 2017. From 2005 to 2007 volume decreased (- 6.10 min of match time; p = 0.010) and intensity increased (6.8 m.min-1 increase; p = 0.023). Volume and intensity increased from 2007 to 2010, evidenced by increases in total distance (302 m; p = 0.039), time over 18 km·h-1 (0.31 min; p = 0.005), and number of accelerations greater than 4 km·h-1 (41.1; p = 0.004) and 10 km·h-1 (3.6; p = 0.005) in 1 s. From 2010 to 2012, intensity decreased, evidenced by reductions in metres per minute (- 4.3; p = 0.022), time over 18 km·h-1 (- 0.93 min; p < 0.001), and number of accelerations greater than 4 km·h-1 (- 104.4; p < 0.001) and 10 km·h-1 (- 8.3; p < 0.001) in 1 s, whilst volume stabilised with no changes in distance (p = 0.068) and match time (p = 0.443). From 2012 to 2015/2017 volume remained stable and intensity increased with time over 18 km·h-1 (0.27 min; p = 0.008) and number of accelerations greater than 4 km·h-1 (31.6; p = 0.016) in 1 s increasing. CONCLUSIONS Changes in volume and intensity of AFL match demands are defined by discrete periods from 2007 to 2010 and 2010 to 2012. The interaction of rule and interpretation changes and coaching strategies play a major role in these evolutionary changes. In turn, modified game styles impact player game demands, training, and selection priorities. Standardisation and uniformity of GPS data reporting is recommended due to inconsistencies in the literature.","Janetzki, Samuel J; Bourdon, Pitre C; Norton, Kevin I; Lane, Jackson C; Bellenger, Clint R",Sports medicine - open,422,17

Long-term exposure to morphine may induce physical dependence, manifested as somatic withdrawal symptoms such as diarrhea, body weight loss, jumping and headshaking, when drug is deprived. Though morphine dependence and withdrawal have been extensively studied, their molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, the physical dependence on morphine was developed in mice by an intermittent, escalating procedure of morphine injections, and was measured by the body weight loss and the behavioral signs (jumping and headshaking). We found that the mice with chronic morphine administration experienced dramatic body weight loss, compared with the saline-treated controls. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal led to more body weight loss, compared with spontaneous withdrawal. Naloxone-precipitated withdrawal mice showed significantly aggravated morphine-withdrawal symptoms (including jumping and heading shaking), compared with spontaneous withdrawal mice. MAPK pathway activities in the frontal association cortex (FrA), accumbens nucleus (Acb) and caudate putamen (CPu) were examined to probe into molecular mechanism for morphine dependence and withdrawal. Compared with saline-treated mice, morphine-dependent mice and spontaneous withdrawal mice, naloxone-precipitated withdrawal mice showed a significantly increased ERK phosphorylation in FrA and Acb, but not in CPu. However, the activities of other protein kinases in the MAPK pathway, including p38 and JNK, showed no changes in FrA, Acb and CPu of the mice during the chronic morphine dependence and withdrawal phases. These results suggest that the ERK phosphorylation in FrA and Acb may be associated with naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome.","Li, Tao; Hou, Ying; Cao, Wei; Yan, Chun-Xia; Chen, Teng; Li, Sheng-Bing",Neuroscience letters,422,1

However, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of this emerging virus. In this manuscript, we collected relevant articles and reviewed the characteristics about SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS We performed an online search on PubMed and Web of Science with the keywords COVID-19, 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV-2, and summarized the epidemiology, virology, clinical features and treatments of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS We retrieved 157 published papers about SARS-CoV-2 from January, 2020 to April, 2020. We found that SARS-CoV-2 was a kind of virus with low mortality rate and high infectivity. This virus can enter human cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in alveoli and activate immune response in human body. SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified as asymptomatic, mild, common, severe, and critical. We summarized antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2, such as remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine and favipiravir. Because the vaccine of SARS-CoV-2 is developing, more clinical studies are needed to verify the safety and efficacy of these treatments. CONCLUSIONS SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has caused a global pandemic.

Antimicrobial therapy is often unsuccessful because P. aeruginosa can develop multi-drug resistance; thus, immunotherapy and vaccine can be a rational alternative. Flagella and type IV pili have been identified as important virulence factors in the colonization and pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa in burn wound infections. Immunogenicity and efficacy of mixed recombinant full-length type b flagellin (r-b-flagellin) and recombinant PilA (r-PilA) as candidate vaccines were assessed by measuring humoral and cellular responses, using an experimental burned mouse model. Primary immunization with ""r-b-flagellin+r-PilA"" followed by two booster shots was sufficient to generate a robust humoral response, which was predominantly a Th2 response consisting mainly of subtype IgG1 and low levels of IgG2a. Analysis of the cytokine response among immunized mice showed an increased production of IL-4, INF-γ and IL-17 by splenocytes upon stimulation by ""r-b-flagellin+r-PilA"". Opsonophagocytosis assays confirmed the enhanced killing of bacteria by anti ""r-b-flagellin+r-PilA"" immune sera. These antibodies were also able to reduce bacterial load in the site of original infection into the liver and spleen of challenged mice. The reduction of systemic bacterial spread resulted in an increased survival rate of challenged immunized mice. In conclusion, immunization with ""r-b-flagellin+r-PilA"" proteins provides a better protective response against P. aeruginosa infection in the burn mouse model.","Korpi, Fatemeh; Hashemi, Farhad B; Irajian, Gholamreza; Fatemi, Mohammad Javad; Laghaei, Parisa; Behrouz, Bahador",Immunology letters,422,11

EVA71 infection induces the conformational activation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the subsequent formation of oligomers of Bax in mitochondria. Inhibitors that block caspase-8 activation cannot inhibit apoptosis induced by EVA71 infection. Importantly, cells with Bax but not Bak or caspase-8 knockdown show resistance to apoptosis induced by EVA71 infection. Mitochondria isolated from EVA71-infected cells display clear Bax-binding ability and the subsequent release of cytochrome c.

The automatic generation of medical image diagnostic reports can assist doctors to reduce their workload and improve diagnosis efficiency. It is of great significance to introduce image caption algorithm into medical image processing. Existing approaches attempt to generate medical image diagnostic reports using image caption algorithms but without taking the accuracy of pathological information in generated diagnostic reports into account. METHODS To solve the mentioned problem, we propose a Semantic Fusion Network (SFNet) including a lesion area detection model and a diagnostic generation model. The lesion area detection model can extract visual and pathological information from medical image, and the diagnostic report generation model can learn to fuse the two kinds of information to generate reports. Thus, the pathological information in the generated diagnostic reports can be more accurate. RESULTS Experimental results have verified the performance of our model (Accuracy increases 1.2% on the Ultrasound Image Dataset and 2.4% on the Open-i X-ray Image Dataset), compared with the model only using visual feature to generate diagnostic reports. CONCLUSIONS This work utilizes computer algorithms to generate the more accurate diagnostic reports for medical images automatically, which expands the application of computer-aided diagnosis and promotes the implementation of deep learning in the medical image analysis field.","Zeng, Xianhua; Wen, Li; Xu, Yang; Ji, Conghui",Computer methods and programs in biomedicine,422,1

By 24 March 2020, over 440,000 cases and almost 20,000 deaths had been reported worldwide. In response to the fast-growing epidemic, which began in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Hubei, China imposed strict social distancing in Wuhan on 23 January 2020 followed closely by similar measures in other provinces. These interventions have impacted economic productivity in China, and the ability of the Chinese economy to resume without restarting the epidemic was not clear. Methods: Using daily reported cases from mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, we estimated transmissibility over time and compared it to daily within-city movement, as a proxy for economic activity. Results: Initially, within-city movement and transmission were very strongly correlated in the five mainland provinces most affected by the epidemic and Beijing. However, that correlation decreased rapidly after the initial sharp fall in transmissibility. In general, towards the end of the study period, the correlation was no longer apparent, despite substantial increases in within-city movement. A similar analysis for Hong Kong shows that intermediate levels of local activity were maintained while avoiding a large outbreak. At the very end of the study period, when China began to experience the re-introduction of a small number of cases from Europe and the United States, there is an apparent up-tick in transmission. Conclusions: Although these results do not preclude future substantial increases in incidence, they suggest that after very intense social distancing (which resulted in containment), China successfully exited its lockdown to some degree. Elsewhere, movement data are being used as proxies for economic activity to assess the impact of interventions. The results presented here illustrate how the eventual decorrelation between transmission and movement is likely a key feature of successful COVID-19 exit strategies.","Ainslie, Kylie E C; Walters, Caroline E; Fu, Han; Bhatia, Sangeeta; Wang, Haowei; Xi, Xiaoyue; Baguelin, Marc; Bhatt, Samir; Boonyasiri, Adhiratha; Boyd, Olivia; Cattarino, Lorenzo; Ciavarella, Constanze; Cucunuba, Zulma; Cuomo-Dannenburg, Gina; Dighe, Amy; Dorigatti, Ilaria; van Elsland, Sabine L; FitzJohn, Rich; Gaythorpe, Katy; Ghani, Azra C; Green, Will; Hamlet, Arran; Hinsley, Wes; Imai, Natsuko; Jorgensen, David; Knock, Edward; Laydon, Daniel; Nedjati-Gilani, Gemma; Okell, Lucy C; Siveroni, Igor; Thompson, Hayley A; Unwin, H Juliette T; Verity, Robert; Vollmer, Michaela; Walker, Patrick G T; Wang, Yuanrong; Watson, Oliver J; Whittaker, Charles; Winskill, Peter; Donnelly, Christl A; Ferguson, Neil M; Riley, Steven",Wellcome open research,422,5

METHODS This prospective study included 40 consecutive patients (35 men; mean age 65.4±9.3 years) who underwent subintimal angioplasty alone (n=14) or with stenting (n=26) of CTOs in the femoropopliteal segment. A Spider protection filter was used to capture any possible macro- or microemboli generated during balloon inflation/stenting. Arterial outflow was angiographically checked during each consecutive procedural step. All filters were examined on site for macroscopic material, while the first 20 filters underwent further histopathological qualitative and semiquantitative analysis using a 0+ to 3+ score. RESULTS There was no angiographically or clinically evident distal embolization. Macroscopic particulate debris was not detected in any filter. Histopathology confirmed the absence of macroemboli but revealed microembolic material (diameter <100 μm) in all filters (20/20). The mean number of particles detected was 9.4±4.5 (range 5-17). Histopathological findings included fibrin conglomerates (20/20), trapped erythrocytes (19/20), inflammatory cells (16/20), calcification minerals (6/20), extracellular matrix (6/20), cholesterol clefts (6/20), and endothelial cells (6/20). Captured material was classified as fresh and old thrombus in 7/20 and 4/20 cases, respectively. Semiquantitative analysis demonstrated that the collected microparticles consisted primarily of fibrin conglomerates (median score 2+), trapped erythrocytes (median score 1+), and inflammatory cells (median score 1+). CONCLUSION Macroscopically evident emboli were not detected following subintimal angioplasty or stenting of femoropopliteal CTOs. Microscopic debris was present in all filters. The clinical significance of the phenomenon remains to be determined.","Spiliopoulos, Stavros; Theodosiadou, Vasiliki; Koukounas, Vasilios; Katsanos, Konstantinos; Diamantopoulos, Athanasios; Kitrou, Panagiotis; Ravazoula, Panagiota; Siablis, Dimitris; Karnabatidis, Dimitris",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,422,1

The association of the virus spread from the market is supported by the close relation of genome sequences of environmental surface samples with virus samples from earliest patients by phylogenetic analysis. Objectives To have an insight into the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences reported from India for better understanding on their epidemiology and virulence. Methods Genome sequences of Indian isolates of SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed to understand their phylogeny and divergence with respect to other isolates reported from other countries. Amino acid sequences of individual open reading frames (ORFs) from SARS-CoV-2 Indian isolates were aligned with sequences of isolates reported from other countries to identify the mutations occurred in Indian isolates. Results Our analysis suggests that Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates are closely related to isolates reported from other parts of the world. Most ORFs are highly conserved; mutations were also detected in some ORFs. We found that most isolates reported from India have key mutations at 614th position of the S protein and 84th position of the ORF 8, which has been reported to be associated with high virulence and high transmission rate. Conclusion An attempt was made to understand the SARS-CoV-2 virus reported from India. SARS-CoV-2 reported from India was closely similar to other SARS-CoV-2 reported from other parts of the world, which suggests that vaccines and other therapeutic methods generated from other countries might work well in India. In addition, available sequence data suggest that majority of Indian isolates are capable of high transmission and virulence.","Devendran, Ragunathan; Kumar, Manish; Chakraborty, Supriya",Indian journal of public health,422,31

Patients undergoing TAVI between January 2012 and November 2017 in the Nationwide Readmission Database were identified. Trends in cause-specific readmissions were assessed using Poisson regression. Thirty-day TAVI cost burden (cost of index TAVI hospitalization plus total 30-day readmissions cost) was adjusted to 2017 U.S. dollars and trended over year from 2012 to 2017. Overall, 47,255 TAVI were included and 30-day readmissions declined from 20% to 12% (p<0.0001). Most common causes of readmission (heart failure, infection/sepsis, gastrointestinal causes, and respiratory) declined as well, except arrhythmia/heart block which increased (1.0% to 1.4%, p<0.0001). Cost of TAVI hospitalization ($52,024 to $44,110, p<0.0001) and 30-day cost burden ($54,122 to $45,252, p<0.0001) declined. While costs of an average readmission did not change ($9,734 to $10,068, p=0.06), cost burden of readmissions (per every TAVI performed) declined ($4,061 to $1,883, p<0.0001), including reductions in each of the top 5 causes except arrhythmia/heart block ($171 to $263, p=0.04). Index TAVI hospitalizations complicated by acute kidney injury, length of stay ≥5 days, low hospital procedural volume, and skilled nursing facility discharge were associated with increased odds of 30-day readmissions. In conclusion, the costs of index hospitalizations and 30-day cost burden for TAVI in the U.S. significantly declined from 2012-2017. However, readmissions due to arrhythmia/heart block and their associated costs increased. Continued strategies to prevent readmissions, especially those for conduction disturbances, are crucial in the efforts to optimize outcomes and costs with the ongoing expansion of TAVI.","Arora, Sameer; Hendrickson, Michael J; Strassle, Paula D; Qamar, Arman; Pandey, Ambarish; Kolte, Dhaval; Sitammagari, Kranthi; Cavender, Matthew A; Fonarow, Gregg C; Bhatt, Deepak L; Vavalle, John P",The American journal of cardiology,422,28

Corrected minute ventilation (V̇Ecorr ) is a simple surrogate of dead space, but, despite its increasing use, its association with mortality has not been proven. The aim of our study was to assess the association between V̇Ecorr and hospital mortality. We also compared the strength of this association with that of estimated VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. METHODS We performed a retrospective study with prospectively collected data. We evaluated 187 consecutive mechanically ventilated subjects with ARDS caused by novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The association between V̇Ecorr and hospital mortality was assessed in multivariable logistic models. The same was done for estimated VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. RESULTS Mean ± SD V̇Ecorr was 11.8 ± 3.3 L/min in survivors and 14.5 ± 3.9 L/min in nonsurvivors (P < .001) and was independently associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.15, P = .01). The strength of association of V̇Ecorr with mortality was similar to that of VD/VT and ventilatory ratio. CONCLUSIONS V̇Ecorr was independently associated with hospital mortality in subjects with ARDS caused by COVID-19. V̇Ecorr could be used at the patient's bedside for outcome prediction and severity stratification, due to the simplicity of its calculation. These findings need to be confirmed in subjects with ARDS without viral pneumonia and when lung-protective mechanical ventilation is not rigorously applied.","Fusina, Federica; Albani, Filippo; Bertelli, Michele; Cavallo, Erika; Crisci, Serena; Caserta, Rosalba; Nguyen, Maia; Grazioli, Michele; Schivalocchi, Valeria; Rosano, Antonio; Natalini, Giuseppe",Respiratory care,422,33

However, it remains unclear how Aβ causes synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss. We hypothesize that one mechanism of Aβ-induced synaptic injury is related to the cleavage of amyloid β precursor protein (APP) at position D664 by caspases that release the putatively cytotoxic C31 peptide. In organotypic slice cultures derived from mice with a knock-in mutation in the APP gene (APP D664A) to inhibit caspase cleavage, Aβ-induced synaptic injury is markedly reduced in two models of Aβ toxicity. Loss of dendritic spines is also attenuated in mice treated with caspase inhibitors. Importantly, the time-dependent dendritic spine loss is correlated with localized activation of caspase-3 but is absent in APP D664A cultures. We propose that the APP cytosolic domain plays an essential role in Aβ-induced synaptic damage in the injury pathway mediated by localized caspase activation.","Park, Goonho; Nhan, Hoang S; Tyan, Sheue-Houy; Kawakatsu, Yusuke; Zhang, Carolyn; Navarro, Mario; Koo, Edward H",Cell reports,422,7

The primary aim of our study was to determine whether BIS values recorded at loss and return of consciousness (LOC and ROC, respectively) differ between patients with unilateral frontal brain tumours and control patients. Secondary goals were to compare propofol requirements for LOC and to determine whether there were significant inter-hemispheric differences between BIS values in tumour and control patients. METHODS We enrolled 20 patients with a frontal brain tumour and 20 control patients. Bilateral BIS measurements were done during induction of propofol anaesthesia, during recovery of consciousness, and during a second induction of anaesthesia. The isolated-forearm test was used to determine the moments of LOC1, ROC, and LOC2. Arterial blood samples were obtained every 4 min for determination of measured propofol concentrations. RESULTS The median BIS values recorded at LOC1, ROC, and LOC2 did not differ between the groups. There were no significant inter-hemispheric differences in BIS in tumour and control patients. The median [inter-quartile range (IQR)] total propofol doses at LOC1 were 82 (75-92) and 78 (68-91) mg in tumour and control patients, respectively. The median (IQR) measured plasma propofol concentrations at LOC1 were 12 (9-14) and 13 (11-15) µg ml(-1) in the tumour and control groups, respectively. CONCLUSIONS The presence of a frontal brain tumour did not affect ipsilateral BIS values, and so need not influence the placement of unilateral BIS electrodes if BIS monitoring is used to titrate propofol anaesthesia.","Sahinovic, M M; Beese, U; Heeremans, E H; Kalmar, A; van Amsterdam, K; Steenbakkers, R J H M; Kuiper, H; Spanjersberg, R; Groen, R J M; Struys, M M R F; Absalom, A R",British journal of anaesthesia,422,31

This review aims to synthesize all available data for key populations and present the data through an accessible, updatable user-friendly graphic interface. The outputs of this systematic review will serve as a resource for decision-makers, providing government stakeholders and donors with the tools to make evidence-based decisions for national planning. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review of data published or made available between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2019, that captures the burden of HIV, both prevalence and incidence estimates, HIV prevention and treatment cascades, key population size estimates, experienced violence, consistent condom use, and engagement with healthcare systems for female sex workers, men who have sex with men, people who use drugs, transgender people, and incarcerated populations.

This is well established for other coronaviruses. In order to understand why some patients develop such symptoms and others do not, we address herein the infectability of the central nervous system (CNS). Reports that the ACE2 receptor - critical for virus entry into lung cells - is found in different neurons supports this expectation. We employ a human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived BrainSphere model, which we used earlier for Zika, Dengue, HIV and John Cunningham virus infection studies. We detected the expression of the ACE2 receptor but not TMPRSS2 in the model. Incubating the BrainSpheres for 6 hours with SARS-CoV-2 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 led to the infection of a fraction of neural cells with replication of the virus evident 72 hours later. Virus particles were found in the neuronal cell body extending into apparent neurite structures. PCR measurements corroborated the replication of the virus, suggesting at least a tenfold increase in virus copies per total RNA. Leveraging state-of-the-art 3D organotypic cell culture, which has been shown to allow both virus infection and (developmental) neurotoxicity but is at the same time simple enough to be transferred and used in a BSL-3 environment, we demonstrate, for the first time, the potential critically important neurotropism of SARS-CoV-2.","Bullen, C Korin; Hogberg, Helena T; Bahadirli-Talbott, Asli; Bishai, William R; Hartung, Thomas; Keuthan, Casey; Looney, Monika M; Pekosz, Andrew; Romero, July C; Sillé, Fenna C M; Um, Peter; Smirnova, Lena",ALTEX,422,17

Mountain biking events present additional challenges with remote venues and isolated courses, for which on-site medical care is often provided, for both injury and illness occurring during races. National health data may not represent these unique events, and specific data on incidence of injury and illness in mountain biking events are essential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to review the available injury and illness literature, reporting methods and risk factors in cross-country mountain biking. METHODS Search engines PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), Scopus, PEDro and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched, and a grey literature search was performed. Narrative analyses of the types, severity and area of injuries and illness type and severity were performed as pooling of data was impossible due to insufficient high-quality studies with the same injury and illness definitions. RESULTS Seven studies comprising 28,021 participants were included for analysis. Four to 71% of participants sustained an injury in a cross-country mountain bike event. Injuries to the skin were the most common, followed by bony injuries and concussion. Five to 47% of cyclists reported the onset of gastrointestinal symptoms post-event. The prevalence of illness during events ranged from 0.5 to 23.0%. CONCLUSION The injury and illness definitions were varied and prevented clear comparisons between studies. Injury and illness present a concern in cross-country marathon mountain biking and should be investigated further to provide the true burden of these during race events.

Here, we evaluate the safety and feasibility of single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy as treatment for a right-sided aldosterone-producing adenoma. CASE PRESENTATION A 39-year-old Japanese woman presented with hypertension and hypokalemia. Abdominal computed tomography and an endocrinological workup revealed a 19mm right adrenal tumor with primary aldosteronism. Our patient was informed of the details of the surgical procedure and our efforts to reduce the number of incisions needed - ideally, to a single incision - when removing her adrenal gland. A single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy was attempted. A multichannel port was inserted through a 2.5cm umbilical incision. A 5mm flexible laparoscope, articulating laparoscopic dissector and tissue sealing device were the primary tools used in the operation. The right liver lobe was evaluated using a percutaneous instrument, providing good visualization of the operative field surrounding her right adrenal gland. The single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy was successfully completed without any intraoperative complications. The operating time was 76 minutes, and her blood loss was 5mL. Oral intake was resumed on the first postoperative day, and the length of her hospital stay was three days. Her postoperative course was uneventful with no morbidity within one month of follow-up, and our patient had excellent cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS Single-port laparoscopic adrenalectomy is a safe and feasible procedure for patients with a right-sided adrenal tumor when performed by a surgeon experienced in laparoscopic and adrenal surgery. However, more surgical experience using this technique is required to confirm our initial impressions.","Sasaki, Akira; Baba, Shigeaki; Obuchi, Toru; Umemura, Akira; Mizuno, Masaru; Wakabayashi, Go",Journal of medical case reports,422,17

AIM To quantify the risk of CRC in first-degree (FDR), second-degree (SDR) and first cousin (FC) relatives of individuals with CRC, stratified by subsite in the colorectum and age at diagnosis. METHODS Colorectal cancers diagnosed between 1980 and 2010 were identified from the Utah Cancer Registry and linked to pedigrees from the Utah Population Database. Age and gender-matched CRC-free controls were selected to form the comparison group for determining CRC risk in relatives using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS Of the 18,208 index patients diagnosed with CRC, 6584 (36.2%) were located in the proximal colon, 5986 (32.9%) in the distal colon and 5638 (31%) in the rectum. The elevated risk of CRC in relatives was similar in analysis stratified for CRC colorectal subsites in the index cases. FDR had similarly elevated risk of all site CRC, whether the index patient had cancer in the proximal colon [hazards ratio (HR): 1.85; 95% CI: 1.70-2.02], distal colon (HR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.73-2.08) or rectum (HR: 1.83; 95% CI: 1.66-2.02) compared to relatives of controls. This risk was consistently greater for FDR when cases developed CRC below the age of 60 years. CONCLUSIONS Relatives of CRC patients have a similarly elevated risk of CRC regardless of colonic tumour subsite in the index patient, and it is greatest for relatives of younger age index cases.","Samadder, N J; Smith, K R; Mineau, G P; Pimentel, R; Wong, J; Boucher, K; Pappas, L; Singh, H; Ahnen, D; Burt, R W; Curtin, K",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,422,23

However, findings across studies are widely disparate, making it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Since clinicians need accurate evidence to treat COVID-19, this manuscript systematically analyzed the published and ongoing studies evaluating the pharmacological interventions for COVID-19. AREAS COVERED A systematic search of observational studies and Clinical Trials on the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 was performed by using various databases from inception to December 02, 2020. EXPERT OPINION A total of 460 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 37 were research studies, 386 were ongoing trials and 37 were completed trials. Anti-virals, steroids, anti-malarial, plasma exchange and monoclonal antibodies were the most common treatment modalities used alone or in combination in these studies. However, tocilizumab, plasma exchange and steroids have shown significant improvements in patient's clinical and radiological status. Tocilizumab reported minimum hospital stay of 2 days along with maximum recovery and patient`s stability rate. Existing literature demonstrate promising results of tocilizumab, plasma exchange and steroids among COVID-19 patients. Nevertheless, these studies are accompanied by several methodological disparities which should be considered while interpreting the results.","Bokharee, Nida; Khan, Yusra Habib; Khokhar, Aisha; Mallhi, Tauqeer Hussain; Alotaibi, Nasser Hadal; Rasheed, Maria",Expert review of anti-infective therapy,422,31

These workers are mostly middle-aged women and racial/ethnic minorities who typically earn low wages. Despite being integral to patient care, these workers are often neglected by the medical community and society at large; thus, developing a health care system capable of addressing the COVID-19 crisis and future pandemics requires a better understanding of the experiences of home health care workers. Objective To understand the experiences of home health care workers caring for patients in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants From March to April 2020, a qualitative study with 1-to-1 semistructured interviews of 33 home health care workers in New York City was conducted in partnership with the 1199SEIU Home Care Industry Education Fund, a benefit fund of the 1199 Service Employees International Union United Healthcare Workers East, the largest health care union in the US. Purposeful sampling was used to identify and recruit home health care workers. Main Outcomes and Measures Audio-recorded interviews were professionally transcribed and analyzed using grounded theory. Major themes and subthemes were identified. Results In total, 33 home health care workers employed by 24 unique home care agencies across the 5 boroughs of New York City participated. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 47.6 (14.0) years, 32 (97%) were women, 21 (64%) were Black participants, and 6 (18%) were Hispanic participants. Five major themes emerged: home health care workers (1) were on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic but felt invisible; (2) reported a heightened risk for virus transmission; (3) received varying amounts of information, supplies, and training from their home care agencies; (4) relied on nonagency alternatives for support, including information and supplies; and (5) were forced to make difficult trade-offs in their work and personal lives. Conclusions and Relevance In this qualitative analysis, home health care workers reported providing frontline essential care, often at personal risk, during the COVID-19 pandemic. They experienced challenges that exacerbated the inequities they face as a marginalized workforce. Interventions and policies to better support these frontline health care professionals are urgently needed.","Sterling, Madeline R; Tseng, Emily; Poon, Anthony; Cho, Jacklyn; Avgar, Ariel C; Kern, Lisa M; Ankuda, Claire K; Dell, Nicola",JAMA internal medicine,422,1

Large PPSTs or those located high at the skull base often require mandibulotomy or an infratemporal fossa approach, baring considerable morbidity. METHODS The novel minimally invasive approach described, utilizes endoscopic equipment introduced transcervically for circumferential separation of the tumor from the neurovascular structures of the skull base. After the tumor is separated, it is removed en bloc, via transoral robotic surgery (TORS). RESULTS The technique provides improved visualization and safe vascular control with minimum tumor stress, preventing the need of blunt/blind finger dissections, and allowing complete tumor removal while minimizing tumor spillage, nerve injury, and blood loss, maintaining excellent cosmetic and functional results. CONCLUSION This approach could be utilized for the removal of large benign PPSTs, or small PPSTs located high at the skull base. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of early ischemia as a possible factor influencing the risk for sICH after IVT+MT versus direct MT. METHODS An explorative analysis of the BEYOND-SWIFT (Bernese-European Registry for Ischemic Stroke Patients Treated Outside Current Guidelines With Neurothrombectomy Devices Using the SOLITAIRE FR With the Intention for Thrombectomy) multicenter cohort was performed. We hypothesized that the sICH risk between IVT+MT versus direct MT differs across the strata of Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Scores (ASPECTS). For this purpose, all patients with ICA, M1, and M2 vessel occlusions and available noncontrast computed tomography or diffusion-weighed imaging ASPECTS (n=2002) were analyzed. We used logistic regression analysis in subgroups, as well as interaction terms, to address the risk of sICH in IVT+MT versus direct MT patients across the ASPECTS strata. RESULTS In 2002 patients (median age, 73.7 years; 50.7% women; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 16), the overall rate of sICH was 6.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-7.7%). Risk of sICH differed across ASPECTS groups (9-10: 6.3%; 6-8: 5.6% and ≤5 9.8%; P=0.042). With decreasing ASPECTS, the risks of sICH in the IVT+MT versus the direct MT group increased from adjusted odds ratio of 0.61 ([95% CI, 0.24-1.60] ASPECTS 9-10), to 1.72 ([95% CI, 0.69-4.24] ASPECTS 6-8) and 6.31 ([95% CI, 1.87-21.29] ASPECTS ≤5), yielding a positive interaction term (1.91 [95% CI, 1.01-3.63]). Sensitivity analyses regarding diffusion-weighed imaging versus noncontrast computed tomography ASPECTS did not alter the primary observations. CONCLUSIONS The extent of early ischemia may influence relative risks of sICH in IVT+MT versus direct MT patients, with an excess sICH risk in IVT+MT patients with low ASPECTS. If confirmed in post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trial data, IVT may be administered more carefully in patients with low ASPECTS eligible for and with direct access to MT.","Kaesmacher, Johannes; Meinel, Thomas R; Nannoni, Stefania; Olivé-Gadea, Marta; Piechowiak, Eike I; Maegerlein, Christian; Goeldlin, Martina; Pierot, Laurent; Seiffge, David J; Mendes Pereira, Vitor; Heldner, Mirjam R; Grunder, Lorenz; Costalat, Vincent; Arnold, Marcel; Dobrocky, Tomas; Gralla, Jan; Mordasini, Pasquale; Fischer, Urs",Stroke,422,25

IL is classified as primary and secondary types. PATIENT CONCERNS A 3-month-old girl born at term from vaginal delivery with an APGAR score of 10/10 and birth weight of 4.310 g (>97° percentile) was admitted to our hospital because of increasing abdominal tenderness and diarrhea. At first examination, she presented an abdominal circumference of 60 cm, edema of the lower extremities and vulva, and facial dysmorphisms (hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, flat mid-face). DIAGNOSIS Once admitted, ultrasonography showed a large amount of ascites, while blood laboratory investigations revealed severe hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Lymphoscintigraphy with 99m-Tc-nanocolloid demonstrated abnormal leakage of the tracer in the abdomen as evidence of IL. To detect a possible secondary, exams were performed and demonstrated positive antibody titres for CMV-IgM and IgG in blood and CMV-DNA positivity in blood, urine, saliva, maternal milk, and gastric and duodenal biopsies. Genetic investigations identified the genomic variant c.472C>T of the CCBE1 gene, coding for a protein variant (p.Arg158Cys), in homozygosity. INTERVENTIONS Total parenteral nutrition was started and continued for a total of 18 days, then gradually bridged by enteral nutrition with a special formula. In addition, antiviral therapy for CMV infection was added first with intravenous ganciclovir for 14 days, resulting in the disappearance of blood viral load after 7 days of therapy and then with valganciclovir per os for another 30 days. OUTCOMES The clinical course of the child gradually improved. A few days after starting treatments, lower extremities and vulvar edema disappeared, and abdominal circumference gradually decreased to a stable value of 38 cm, without any ultrasonographic signs of ascites left. Moreover, serum albumin and IgG rose to normal values after 3 months (4.3 g/dL and 501 mg/dL, respectively). LESSONS This case suggests that in presence of IL both primary and secondary causes should be evaluated. On the other hand, genetic diagnosis is crucial not only for diagnosis but also for prognosis in HS. Life expectancy and quality could deeply vary among different gene mutations and protein variants of the same gene. Further studies and case reports are needed to better understand the clinical meaning of these genetic results and the role of CMV as trigger of IL.","Fattorusso, Antonella; Pieri, Elena Sofia; Dell'Isola, Giovanni Battista; Prontera, Paolo; Mencaroni, Elisabetta; Stangoni, Gabriela; Esposito, Susanna",Medicine,422,1

The aim of this study was to compare residual cuff diameters of pediatric tracheal tubes with pediatric airway dimensions. METHODS Cuff diameters of five different brands of locally marketed pediatric cuffed tracheal tubes with internal diameters of 3.0 - 7.0 mm were measured at a cuff pressure of 20 cmH2 O and compared with cuff diameters indicated by their manufacturers. The latter values were compared to tracheal dimensions using the Motoyama and Khine formulas for cuffed tracheal tube size selection. RESULTS There is considerable heterogeneity in cuff diameters among pediatric tracheal tube brands, except for two brands from different manufacturers (Halyard and Parker Medical) which were identically designed. Cuffs made from polyurethane revealed fewer differences (91-118%) between measured and manufacturer-indicated values for outer cuff diameters than did those made from polyvinylchloride (91-146%). Particularly in smaller sized tracheal tubes, cuffs did not reach 100% of the tracheal lateral diameter, while others were oversized in larger tracheal tubes, independent of the two formulas used for cuffed tracheal tube size selection. Cuff diameters indicated by the manufacturer corresponded to 86-188% of the median and 68-157% of the maximum mid-tracheal lateral diameter of the corresponding upper age range. CONCLUSION Our findings show that many of the cuff diameters of currently marketed tracheal tube brands lack an age-related anatomical rationale. A proposal for age-related anatomically based cuff diameters is provided for both recommendations for cuffed tracheal tube size selection in children.","Fischer, Martina; Grass, Beate; Kemper, Michael; Weiss, Markus; Dave, Mital H",Paediatric anaesthesia,422,1

Yet some studies have shown improvements in obesity-related metabolic comorbidities with more modest weight loss. By closely monitoring patients undergoing bariatric surgery, we aimed to determine the effects of weight loss on the metabolic syndrome and its components and determine the weight loss required for their resolution. METHODS We performed a prospective observational study of obese participants with metabolic syndrome (Adult Treatment Panel III criteria) who underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Participants were assessed for all criteria of the metabolic syndrome monthly for the first 9 months, then 3-monthly until 24 months. RESULTS There were 89 participants with adequate longitudinal data. Baseline body mass index was 42.4±6.2 kg m-2 with an average age was 48.2±10.7 years. There were 56 (63%) women. Resolution of the metabolic syndrome occurred in 60 of the 89 participants (67%) at 12 months and 60 of the 75 participants (80%) at 24 months. The mean weight loss when metabolic syndrome resolved was 10.9±7.7% total body weight loss (TBWL). The median weight loss at which prevalence of disease halved was 7.0% TBWL (17.5% excess weight loss (EWL)) for hypertriglyceridaemia; 11% TBWL (26.1-28% EWL) for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and hyperglycaemia; 20% TBWL (59.5% EWL) for hypertension and 29% TBWL (73.3% EWL) for waist circumference. The odds ratio for resolution of the metabolic syndrome with 10-12.5% TBWL was 2.09 (P=0.025), with increasing probability of resolution with more substantial weight loss. CONCLUSIONS In obese participants with metabolic syndrome, a weight loss target of 10-12.5% TBWL (25-30% EWL) is a reasonable initial goal associated with significant odds of having metabolic benefits. If minimal improvements are seen with this initial target, additional weight loss substantially increases the probability of resolution.","Ooi, G J; Doyle, L; Tie, T; Wentworth, J M; Laurie, C; Earnest, A; Cowley, M A; Sikaris, K; le Roux, C W; Burton, P R; O'Brien, P E; Brown, W A",International journal of obesity,422,19

The use of natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) is one of the most recent contributions to minimally invasive methods. The anus has been widely used in NOSE procedures. However, an open rectal stump carries the highest risk of contamination compared with other translumenal approaches to the peritoneal cavity. In this study, the feasibility of a novel NOSE method was tested in a porcine model. This technique combined abdominal and transanal approaches. The abdominal approach was used in rectal mobilization; this was followed by a transanal recto-rectal intussusception and pull-through (IPT). IPT was established in a stepwise fashion. First, the proximal margin of resection was attached to the shaft of the anvil of an end-to-end circular stapler with a ligature around the rectum. Second, this complex was pulled transanally to produce IPT. Once IPT was established, a second ligature was placed around the rectum, approximating the proximal and distal resection margins. The specimen was resected and extracted by making a full-thickness incision through 2 bowel walls distal to the previously placed ligatures. Anastomosis was achieved by applying the stapler. The technique was found to be feasible. A substantial length of bowel was resected in all experiments. Peritoneal samples, collected after transanal specimen extraction, did not demonstrate bacterial growth. Although more investigation is warranted, this procedure has the potential to limit surgical site infections by using aseptic bowel manipulation during colorectal resection and transanal specimen extraction.","Kvasha, Anton; Kvasha, Vladimir; Hadary, Amram; Willenz, Udi; Szvalb, Sergio; Waksman, Igor",Surgical innovation,422,31

However, the exact mechanism providing the benefits of UB remains unknown. Our hypothesis was that the benefits of UB are achieved mainly through reduction of upper airway dead space. METHODS Sixteen stable COPD patients requiring oxygen use at home were enrolled in this prospective study at a tertiary health care center. A nasal mask and a mouthpiece were used, each having a removable one-way valve to direct the breathing pattern. Four experimentally defined patterns of spontaneous breathing, NMB, mouth-in nose-out (MNB), nose-in nose-out (NNB), and mouth-in mouth-out (MMB), were compared. Each breathing pattern lasted 5 min followed by a 5-min rest period. A NICO device continuously monitored respiratory parameters. The functional anatomical dead space volume (VD) and expired VT values were determined. Breathing efficiency (BE) was calculated as alveolar VT divided by expired volume. RESULTS Functional anatomical VD was higher in bidirectional breathing (BB) (overall: 207.4 ± 7.9 mL; MMB: 232.5 ± 72.7 mL; NNB: 182.2 ± 75 mL) compared to UB (overall: 178.1 ± 87.2 mL; NMB: 176.9 ± 91.3 mL; MNB: 179.3 ± 83.2 mL) (P < .001). BE achieved with UB (overall: 76.2 ± 6.5%; NMB: 76.8 ± 6.8%; MNB: 75.6 ± 6.3%) was higher than that with BB (overall: 66.2 ± 0.09%; MMB: 64.3 ± 0.10%; NNB: 68.1 ± 0.08%) (P < .001). The difference in BE between UB and BB was more pronounced with small VT values (UB: 73.8 ± 0.08; BB: 49.4 ± 0.09) than with large VT values (UB: 77.3 ± 0.06; BB: 63.0 ± 0.07) (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that a reduction in functional anatomic VD may be the underlying mechanism for the benefits associated with UB in COPD patients.

We report 4 cases of delayed ipsilateral IPH following the technically successful treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms with the PED. MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical and imaging data from all patients undergoing aneurysm treatment with the PED at 2 institutions were analyzed to assess the incidence of delayed IPH after treatment with the PED. RESULTS A total of 66 patients (47 anterior circulation) with cerebral aneurysms underwent treatment with a PED between January 2008 and November 2010. Four patients experienced delayed periprocedural IPH, all after the treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms (8.5%, 4/47). The aneurysm size ranged from 5 to 21 mm. All IPHs occurred within the cerebral hemisphere, ipsilateral to the treated aneurysm, and were anatomically remote from the treated aneurysms. All procedures were uncomplicated, and patients emerged from general anesthesia at neurologic baseline. The hemorrhages became clinically evident between 1 and 6 days after the procedure. Two patients had unfavorable outcomes (mRS scores, 4 and 6). CONCLUSIONS Delayed IPH may occur after the treatment of anterior circulation aneurysms with flow diverters. This complication does not seem to be restricted to a specific aneurysm subtype and does not seem to be related to an intraprocedural complication or solely attributable to DAT.","Cruz, J P; Chow, M; O'Kelly, C; Marotta, B; Spears, J; Montanera, W; Fiorella, D; Marotta, T",AJNR.

The search encompassed articles published from January 2010 to May 2020, with no restriction of language or localization. RESULTS A total of 665 retrieved articles had the potential for inclusion. Of these, two answered the research question, which was to verify the smell and taste alterations in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. CONCLUSION The results found in this review demonstrated that there likely is an association between self-reported smell and taste dysfunctions and COVID-19 infection in such patients.","Gonçalves, Laura Faustino; Gonzáles, Ana Inês; Paiva, Karina Mary; Patatt, Fernanda Soares Aurélio; Stolz, Janaina Viana; Haas, Patrícia",Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira,422,33

A retrospective single-institution series of 410 cases.,10.357659,4.8800397,2013,"Regulated mRNA decay plays a vital role in determining both the level and quality of cellular gene expression. Viral RNAs must successfully evade this host RNA decay machinery to establish a productive infection. One way for RNA viruses to accomplish this is to target the cellular exoribonuclease XRN1, because this enzyme is accessible in the cytoplasm and plays a major role in mRNA decay. Members of the Flaviviridae use RNA structures in their 5'- or 3'-untranslated regions to stall and repress XRN1, effectively stabilizing viral RNAs while also causing significant dysregulation of host cell mRNA stability. Here, we use a series of biochemical assays to demonstrate that the 3'-terminal portion of the nucleocapsid (N) mRNA of Rift Valley fever virus, a phlebovirus of the Bunyaviridae family, also can effectively stall and repress XRN1. The region responsible for impeding XRN1 includes a G-rich portion that likely forms a G-quadruplex structure. The 3'-terminal portions of ambisense-derived transcripts of multiple arenaviruses also stalled XRN1. Therefore, we conclude that RNAs from two additional families of mammalian RNA viruses stall and repress XRN1. This observation. emphasizes the importance and commonality of this viral strategy to interfere with the 5'-to-3'-exoribonuclease component of the cytoplasmic RNA decay machinery.","Charley, Phillida A; Wilusz, Carol J; Wilusz, Jeffrey",The Journal of biological chemistry,422,1

However, it is imperative that instructors realize that the challenge is greater than simply converting paper-based assignments into a digital format. There has been very little research done examining the cognitive effects of writing on a smartphone, compared to writing on paper. The current study therefore sought to examine how recollection of content differed depending on the medium used for notetaking. A population of 138 Japanese university students of English-as-a-Foreign-Language (EFL) were asked to transcribe a short text, either by paper or by smartphone, and then quizzed on the content immediately afterwards. Students who wrote the text by hand were found to have significantly greater recollection of the content compared to those who had 'tapped' on smartphones. These results follow precursor research which indicated that Japanese students compose significantly slower on their phones in English (Lee, 2020b), and wrote significantly less in writing tasks (Lee, 2019, 2020a) than handwriting counterparts.","Lee, Bradford J",Acta psychologica,422,28

Despite their beneficial and ubiquitous use during surgery, delayed or partial recovery from NMBAs, referred to as residual neuromuscular block (rNMB), is a common clinical problem. While it is well accepted that the antagonist sugammadex, compared to neostigmine, can more rapidly reverse rocuronium-induced NMB regardless of depth of block, the occurrence of rNMB for routinely used combinations of NMBAs with sugammadex or neostigmine has not yet been quantified or evaluated systematically. REVIEW METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to quantify and compare the incidence of rNMB [defined as train-of-four ratio (TOFR) <0.9] in patients with moderate and deep neuromuscular block. Methods recommended by Cochrane Collaboration and PRISMA group were followed. RESULTS A total of 35 RCTs were identified, of which 20 contributed to the meta-analysis. For moderate block, rNMB incidence at 2 min after sugammadex administration was 19.2% (95% CI 0.0-57.8; 122 patients) and declined to 2.8% (95% CI 0.0-16.7; 93 patients) at 6 min post administration. For timepoints 10 to 60 min after administration, rNMB incidence ranged between 0.05% to 2.8%. In contrast, rNMB incidence at 2 min after neostigmine administration was 100% (95% CI 89.9-100; 182 patients) and was 82% (95% CI 71.4-91.2; 93 patients) at 6 min post administration. For timepoints 10 to 60 min after administration, rNMB incidence ranged between 14 and 32%. For deep block, rNMB incidence following sugammadex was essentially reduced to 1% at 15 min after administration. Residual NMB incidence following neostigmine remained at or above 95% for the first 60 min after administration. CONCLUSIONS Overall, based on evidence from 20 RCTs, our results suggest that the combination of rocuronium or vecuronium plus sugammadex is more effective and more rapid in reversing NMB compared with combinations of rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, or pancuronium plus neostigmine.","Raval, Amit D; Uyei, Jennifer; Karabis, Andreas; Bash, Lori D; Brull, Sorin J",Journal of clinical anesthesia,422,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study used five domestic pigs. Implants were inserted 9 weeks after tooth extraction. Each animal received six implants in the mandible, following a split-mouth design: one side was treated using a flapless technique using mini-incisions, while a flap was raised on the other. The animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after implant placement. Radiographic images were taken to analyze crestal bone loss, and samples were extracted for histopathological and bone-to-implant contact (BIC) analyses. RESULTS Significantly, greater crestal bone loss (P = 0.005) was obtained in the flap group compared with the flapless group. The flapless group presented significantly higher percentages of BIC (P < 0.05) at 3, 6 and 12 months compared with the conventional flap group. CONCLUSIONS Within the limitations of this experimental animal study, it may be concluded that the type of surgery (flap or flapless) affects peri-implant bone preservation and osseointegration of regular platform implants. Flapless surgery is associated with peri-implant crestal bone preservation. Flapless surgery in combination with submerged implants allows higher osseointegration values.","Pérez-Albacete Martínez, Carlos; Vlahović, Zoran; Šćepanović, Miodrag; Videnović, Goran; Barone, Antonio; Calvo-Guirado, José Luis",Clinical oral implants research,422,32

Objective To estimate the association between administration of corticosteroids compared with usual care or placebo and 28-day all-cause mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective meta-analysis that pooled data from 7 randomized clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids in 1703 critically ill patients with COVID-19. The trials were conducted in 12 countries from February 26, 2020, to June 9, 2020, and the date of final follow-up was July 6, 2020. Pooled data were aggregated from the individual trials, overall, and in predefined subgroups. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Inconsistency among trial results was assessed using the I2 statistic. The primary analysis was an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect meta-analysis of overall mortality, with the association between the intervention and mortality quantified using odds ratios (ORs). Random-effects meta-analyses also were conducted (with the Paule-Mandel estimate of heterogeneity and the Hartung-Knapp adjustment) and an inverse variance-weighted fixed-effect analysis using risk ratios. Exposures Patients had been randomized to receive systemic dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, or methylprednisolone (678 patients) or to receive usual care or placebo (1025 patients). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality at 28 days after randomization. A secondary outcome was investigator-defined serious adverse events. Results A total of 1703 patients (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 52-68 years]; 488 [29%] women) were included in the analysis. Risk of bias was assessed as ""low"" for 6 of the 7 mortality results and as ""some concerns"" in 1 trial because of the randomization method. Five trials reported mortality at 28 days, 1 trial at 21 days, and 1 trial at 30 days. There were 222 deaths among the 678 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 425 deaths among the 1025 patients randomized to usual care or placebo (summary OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.53-0.82]; P < .001 based on a fixed-effect meta-analysis). There was little inconsistency between the trial results (I2 = 15.6%; P = .31 for heterogeneity) and the summary OR was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.48-1.01; P = .053) based on the random-effects meta-analysis. The fixed-effect summary OR for the association with mortality was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.82; P < .001) for dexamethasone compared with usual care or placebo (3 trials, 1282 patients, and 527 deaths), the OR was 0.69 (95% CI, 0.43-1.12; P = .13) for hydrocortisone (3 trials, 374 patients, and 94 deaths), and the OR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.29-2.87; P = .87) for methylprednisolone (1 trial, 47 patients, and 26 deaths). Among the 6 trials that reported serious adverse events, 64 events occurred among 354 patients randomized to corticosteroids and 80 events occurred among 342 patients randomized to usual care or placebo. Conclusions and Relevance In this prospective meta-analysis of clinical trials of critically ill patients with COVID-19, administration of systemic corticosteroids, compared with usual care or placebo, was associated with lower 28-day all-cause mortality.","Sterne, Jonathan A C; Murthy, Srinivas; Diaz, Janet V; Slutsky, Arthur S; Villar, Jesús; Angus, Derek C; Annane, Djillali; Azevedo, Luciano Cesar Pontes; Berwanger, Otavio; Cavalcanti, Alexandre B; Dequin, Pierre-Francois; Du, Bin; Emberson, Jonathan; Fisher, David; Giraudeau, Bruno; Gordon, Anthony C; Granholm, Anders; Green, Cameron; Haynes, Richard; Heming, Nicholas; Higgins, Julian P T; Horby, Peter; Jüni, Peter; Landray, Martin J; Le Gouge, Amelie; Leclerc, Marie; Lim, Wei Shen; Machado, Flávia R; McArthur, Colin; Meziani, Ferhat; Møller, Morten Hylander; Perner, Anders; Petersen, Marie Warrer; Savovic, Jelena; Tomazini, Bruno; Veiga, Viviane C; Webb, Steve; Marshall, John C",JAMA,422,5

To address this problem, surgical instruments with articulated joints and multiple degrees of freedom have been developed. The articulations in currently available surgical instruments use mainly wire or link mechanisms. These mechanisms are generally robust and reliable, but the miniaturization of the mechanical parts required often results in problems with size, weight, durability, mechanical play, sterilization, and assembly costs. METHODS We thus introduced a compliant mechanism to a laparoscopic surgical instrument with multiple degrees of freedom at the tip. To show the feasibility of the concept, we developed a prototype with two degrees of freedom articulated surgical instruments that can perform the grasping and bending movements. The developed prototype is roughly the same size of the conventional laparoscopic instrument, within the diameter of 4 mm. The elastic parts were fabricated by Ni-Ti alloy and SK-85M, rigid parts ware fabricated by stainless steel, covered by 3D- printed ABS resin. The prototype was designed using iterative finite element method analysis, and has a minimal number of mechanical parts. RESULTS The prototype showed hysteresis in grasping movement presumably due to the friction; however, the prototype showed promising mechanical characteristics and was fully functional in two degrees of freedom. In addition, the prototype was capable to exert over 15 N grasping that is sufficient for the general laparoscopic procedure. The evaluation tests thus positively showed the concept of the proposed mechanism. CONCLUSION The prototype showed promising characteristics in the given mechanical evaluation experiments. Use of a compliant mechanism such as in our prototype may contribute to the advancement of surgical instruments in terms of simplicity, size, weight, dexterity, and affordability.","Arata, Jumpei; Kogiso, Shinya; Sakaguchi, Masamichi; Nakadate, Ryu; Oguri, Susumu; Uemura, Munenori; Byunghyun, Cho; Akahoshi, Tomohiko; Ikeda, Tetsuo; Hashizume, Makoto",International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,422,16

The pooled mortality in CAPA was 51.2% (95% CI:43.1-61.1, I2 =38%). The leave one out sensitivity analysis and influential case diagnostics revealed one outlier and its exclusion resulted in a mortality estimate of 54% (95% CI:45-62). Higher odds of mortality: 2.83 (95% CI:1.8-4.5) were seen in CAPA compared to controls. No significant difference in various subgroups according to the country of study, the continent of study, income category of country, quality of the included study was seen. None of the host risk factors, mycological test results, therapy for COVID-19 and antifungal therapy affected mortality. Thus, patients with CAPA have a high probability of mortality and early diagnosis with prompt therapy must be ensured to optimally manage these patients. However, more prospective studies with global and multi-centre coordination may help to address CAPA in a better way.","Singh, Shreya; Verma, Nipun; Kanaujia, Rimjhim; Chakrabarti, Arunaloke; Rudramurthy, Shivaprakash M",Mycoses,422,4

We investigated whether environmental nanoparticles (NPs) reach the AV axis and whether they are associated with ultrastructural cell damage. Here, we demonstrate the detection of the shape, size, and composition of NPs by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) in 10 subjects from Metropolitan Mexico City (MMC) with a mean age of 25.3 ± 5.9 and a 71-year-old subject without cardiac pathology. We found that in every case, Fe, Ti, Al, Hg, Cu, Bi, and/or Si spherical or acicular NPs with a mean size of 36 ± 17 nm were present in the AV axis in situ, freely and as conglomerates, within the mitochondria, sarcomeres, lysosomes, lipofuscin, and/or intercalated disks and gap junctions of Purkinje and transitional cells, telocytes, macrophages, endothelium, and adjacent atrial and ventricular fibers. Erythrocytes were found to transfer NPs to the endothelium. Purkinje fibers with increased lysosomal activity and totally disordered myofilaments and fragmented Z-disks exhibited NP conglomerates in association with gap junctions and intercalated disks. AV conduction axis pathology caused by environmental NPs is a plausible and modifiable risk factor for understanding common arrhythmias and reentrant tachycardia. Anthropogenic, industrial, e-waste, and indoor NPs reach pacemaker regions, thereby increasing potential mechanisms that disrupt the electrical impulse pathways of the heart. The cardiotoxic, oxidative, and abnormal electric performance effects of NPs in pacemaker locations warrant extensive research.

We aim to measure changes in health outcomes, including physical frailty status (SHARE-FI), clinical frailty status (CFS) and muscle mass, as a result of an optimised exercise and dietary intervention versus usual care in a primary care (PC) setting. The intervention has been derived from our systematic review and meta-analysis findings and optimised through patient and public involvement and multidisciplinary team input. Methods: This study is a multicentre randomised controlled parallel arm trial with a three month follow up. 210 eligible people aged 65 and over, no more than mildly frail, will be recruited in seven PC practices in Ireland and randomly assigned to 'intervention' or 'usual care'. Intervention participants will be provided a leaflet with strength exercises, protein dietary guidance and educational discussion. Baseline measurements will include demographics, health indicators, comorbidities, malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), frailty status (SHARE-FI, CFS) and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance). Primary outcome will be frailty status measured by SHARE-FI at three months. Secondary outcomes include CFS, muscle mass, in-patient hospitalisation, long term care admission, and subjective ease of intervention and difference to general health. Statistical analysis will be undertaken by an independent statistician. Discussion: The diversity of tested frailty interventions and lack of clear guidance may contribute to low implementation rates. The REFEREE trial focusses on an optimised intervention for a syndrome that poses growing individual and societal challenges.

However, the impact of shear stress on the capacity of EPCs in CAD patients has not been elucidated yet. The C-X-C chemokine receptor 7/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (CXCR7)/(ERK) pathways are identified to regulate EPCs function in CAD patients. Here, we hypothesize that shear stress upregulates the CXCR7/ERK pathways, which restore the EPCs function in CAD patients. METHODS The human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) were collected from healthy adults and CAD patients and then used for EPCs cultivation. The Lv-siRNA for human CXCR7 was transfected into induced EPCs isolated from the CAD patients. Meanwhile, the EPCs from CAD patients were subjected to shear stress generated by a biomimetic device. Next, the cell viability, migration, tube formation, and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, Transwell assay, Matrigel, and flow cytometry, respectively. Also, the CXCR7/ERK pathways in human EPCs were analyzed by Western blotting and qRT-PCR. RESULT Compared to the EPCs collected from normal adults, the CAD patient-derived EPCs showed reduced in vitro vasculogenic capacity. Also, the level of CXCR7 in CAD patient-derived EPCs was significantly reduced compared to the EPCs of healthy subjects. Meanwhile, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), which represents a CXCR7 downstream signaling pathway, had decreased phosphorylation level. The shear stress treatment augmented the CXCR7 expression and also elevated ERK phosphorylation, which is comparable to the up-regulation of CAD patient-derived EPCs function. Further, the small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated CXCR7 knockdown diminished the enhanced migration, adhesion, and tube formation capacity of shear stress treated CAD patient-derived EPCs. CONCLUSION Up-regulation of the CXCR7/ERK pathways by shear stress can be a promising new target in enhancing the vasculogenic ability of CAD patient-derived EPCs.","Zhou, Hua; Tu, Qiang; Zhang, Yan; Xie, Hua Qiang; Shuai, Qing Yun; Huang, Xiao Chuan; Fu, Jie; Cao, Zheng",BMC cardiovascular disorders,422,5

Endogenous pain inhibition is impaired in follicular phase of menstrual cycle. We tested the primary hypothesis that the women having surgery during their follicular phase have more acute pain and require higher opioids than those in the luteal phase, and secondarily we tested that women who have surgery during their follicular phase have more incisional pain at 3 month postoperatively. METHODS 127 adult females having laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized to have surgery during the luteal or follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Standardized anesthesia and pain management regimen was given to all patients. Pain and analgesic consumption were evaluated in post-anesthesia care unit and every 4h in the first 24h. Adverse effects were questioned every 4h. Time to oral intake and ambulation were recorded. Post-surgical pain, hospital anxiety, depression scale, SF-12 questionnaire were evaluated at 1 and 3 month visits. RESULTS There was no difference in acute pain scores and analgesic consumption through the 24h period, Visual Analog Scale at 24h was 1.5±1.5cm for follicular group 1.4±1.7cm for luteal group (p=0.57). Persistent postoperative pain was significantly more common one and at three month, with an incidence was 33% and 32% in the patients at follicular phase versus 16% and 12% at luteal phase, respectively. The Visual Analog Scale at one and at three month was 1.6±0.7cm and 1.8±0.8cm for follicular group and 2.7±1.3cm and 2.9±1.7cm in the luteal group (p=0.02), respectively. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to anxiety and depression, SF-12 scores at either time. Nausea was more common in follicular-phase group (p=0.01) and oral feeding time was shorter in follicular phase (5.9±0.9h) than in luteal phase (6.8±1.9h, p=0.02). CONCLUSIONS Although persistent postoperative pain was significantly more common one and three months after surgery the magnitude of the pain was low. Our results do not support scheduling operations to target particular phases of the menstrual cycle.","Sari, Sinem; Kozanhan, Betul; Egilmez, Ayse Ilksen; Soyder, Aykut; Aydin, Osman Nuri; Galimberti, Fabrizio; Sessler, Daniel; Turan, Alparslan",Revista brasileira de anestesiologia,422,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address this issue. DESIGN AND METHODS We searched for randomized trials and cohort studies that evaluated the association between resistance training and mortality and cardiovascular events. Two investigators screened the identified abstracts and full-texts independently and in duplicate. Cochrane tools were used to assess the risk of bias. We calculated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using random effect models. RESULTS From the 1430 studies identified, 11 (one randomized trial and 10 cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, totaling 370,256 participants with mean follow-up of 8.85 years. The meta-analysis showed that, compared with no exercise, resistance training was associated with 21% (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval (CI)), 0.79 (0.69-0.91)) and 40% (hazard ratio (95% CI), 0.60 (0.49-0.72)) lower all-cause mortality alone and when combined with aerobic exercise, respectively. Furthermore, resistance training had a borderline association with lower cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio (95% CI), 0.83 (0.67-1.03)). In addition, resistance training showed no significant association with cancer mortality. Risk of bias was low to intermediate in the included studies. One cohort study looked at the effect of resistance training on coronary heart disease events in men and found a 23% risk reduction (risk ratio, 0.77, CI: 0.61-0.98). CONCLUSION Resistance training is associated with lower mortality and appears to have an additive effect when combined with aerobic exercise. There are insufficient data to determine the potential beneficial effect of resistance training on non-fatal events or the effect of substituting aerobic exercise with resistance training.","Saeidifard, Farzane; Medina-Inojosa, Jose R; West, Colin P; Olson, Thomas P; Somers, Virend K; Bonikowske, Amanda R; Prokop, Larry J; Vinciguerra, Manlio; Lopez-Jimenez, Francisco",European journal of preventive cardiology,422,14

However, little is known regarding an early detection of patients at high risk of fatality. METHODS This retrospective cohort study recruited consecutive adult patients admitted between February 8 and February 29, 2020, to the three intensive care units (ICUs) in a designated hospital for treating COVID-19 in Wuhan. The detailed clinical information and laboratory results for each patient were obtained. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Potential predictors were analyzed for possible association with outcomes, and the predictive performance of indicators was assessed from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS A total of 121 critically ill patients were included in the study, and 28.9% (35/121) of them died in the hospital. The non-survivors were older and more likely to develop acute organ dysfunction, and had higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and quick SOFA (qSOFA) scores. Among the laboratory variables on admission, we identified 12 useful biomarkers for the prediction of in-hospital mortality, as suggested by area under the curve (AUC) above 0.80. The AUCs for three markers neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), thyroid hormones free triiodothyronine (FT3), and ferritin were 0.857, 0.863, and 0.827, respectively. The combination of two easily accessed variables NLR and ferritin had comparable AUC with SOFA score for the prediction of in-hospital mortality (0.901 vs. 0.955, P=0.085). CONCLUSIONS Acute organ dysfunction combined with older age is associated with fatal outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Circulating biomarkers could be used as powerful predictors for the in-hospital mortality.","Guo, Wei; Ran, Lin-Yu; Zhu, Ji-Hong; Ge, Qing-Gang; Du, Zhe; Wang, Fei-Long; Gao, Wei-Bo; Wang, Tian-Bing",World journal of emergency medicine,422,12

Elia Metchnikoff received the Nobel Prize in physiology and medicine for this discovery in 1908. Since its discovery almost 140 years before, phagocytosis remains the hot topic of research in immunology. The phagocytosis research has seen a great advancement since its first discovery. Functionally, phagocytosis is a simple immunological process required to engulf and remove pathogens, dead cells and tumor cells to maintain the immune homeostasis. However, mechanistically, it is a very complex process involving different mechanisms, induced and regulated by several pattern recognition receptors, soluble pattern recognition molecules, scavenger receptors (SRs) and opsonins. These mechanisms involve the formation of phagosomes, their maturation into phagolysosomes causing pathogen destruction or antigen synthesis to present them to major histocompatibility complex molecules for activating an adaptive immune response. Any defect in this mechanism may predispose the host to certain infections and inflammatory diseases (autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases) along with immunodeficiency. The article is designed to discuss its mechanistic complexity at each level, varying from phagocytosis induction to phagolysosome resolution.","Kumar, Vijay",International reviews of immunology,422,1

Blood group ABO glycoproteins can influence the binding of the virus to ACE2. The role of ABO blood system in the susceptibility to infection as well as in the clinical outcome of infected patients is still controversial and needs to be clarified. METHODS We conducted a retrospective study of 167 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 who underwent nasopharyngeal swab, and of a control group represented by 891 subjects negative for SARS-CoV-2, to assess the association between ABO and Rh blood system and occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical presentation, and outcome of disease. RESULTS In the cohort of patients positive for SARS-CoV-2, no statistically significant difference in the distribution of ABO blood types compared with controls was observed. Patients with blood type A had a higher risk of developing symptomatic disease (p = 0.002; odds ratio [OR = 3.592]; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.576-8.187) compared to patients with blood types B, AB, and O. Patients with blood types B (p = 0.021; OR = 0.293; 95%CI = 0.099-0.869) and O (p = 0.018; OR = 0.417; 95%CI = 0.199-0.871) showed a lower risk in comparison to the other groups. The clinical progression to mild/moderate and severe/critical disease and the mortality showed no association. Moreover, no relationship with Rh blood type was found. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support a role of ABO blood type in the development of symptomatic disease with a higher risk in subjects with blood type A and a protective effect of blood types B and O. Blood types do not seem, however, to play a role in susceptibility, progression to severe disease, and death.","Negro, Pierpaolo; Congedo, Maurizio; Zizza, Antonella; Guido, Marcello; Sacquegna, Gianfranco; Pulito, Giuseppe; Lobreglio, Giambattista",Transfusion medicine,422,16

However, whether the use of telemedicine (text messaging) for LT patients was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. METHODS We collected data (following consent from patients and parents) from 57 patients (33 male/24 female) with a median age of 47 (IQR: 9-91) months, whom we followed up with text messaging between September 2019 and September 2020, spanning the 6 months prior to COVID-19 and during this period. RESULTS In total, 723 text message mediated consultations occurred during this period, henceforth simply referred to as ""messages."" Three hundred and twenty-eight (45%) messages occurred during the 6 months up to the start of the pandemic. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of messages increased to 395 (55%). The three most common reasons of messaging were post-liver-LT follow-up messages (n = 215/723, 29.7%), consultations for drug use (n = 157/723, 21.7%), and medication prescriptions (n = 113/723, 15.6%). Protocol biopsy discussions (n = 33/723, 4.6%) and fever (n = 27/723, 3.7%) were among others (vaccination, rash, diarrhea, cough, fatigue, acne). During the COVID-19 outbreak, only post-LT follow-up messages increased significantly to 132/395 (33%) from 83/328 (25%) (p-value: .02). CONCLUSIONS We found that the pandemic resulted in an increase in the total number of text message mediated consultations and specifically for the use of post-LT follow-up.

Although PEDV was long believed to replicate in the intestinal epithelium by using aminopeptidase N as a receptor, the mechanisms of PEDV infection are not fully characterized. In this study, we found that PEDV infection of epithelial cells results in disruption of the tight junctional distribution of occludin to its intracellular location. Overexpression of occludin in target cells makes them more susceptible to PEDV infection, whereas ablation of occludin expression by use of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in target cells significantly reduces their susceptibility to virus infection. However, the results observed with occludin siRNA indicate that occludin is not required for virus attachment. We conclude that occludin plays an essential role in PEDV infection at the postbinding stages. Furthermore, we observed that macropinocytosis inhibitors blocked occludin internalization and virus entry, indicating that virus entry and occludin internalization are closely coupled. However, the macropinocytosis inhibitors could not impede virus replication once the virus had entered host cells. This suggests that occludin internalization by macropinocytosis or a macropinocytosis-like process is involved in the virus entry events. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy showed that PEDV was trapped at cellular junctional regions upon macropinocytosis inhibitor treatment, indicating that occludin may serve as a scaffold in the vicinity of virus entry. Collectively, these data show that occludin plays an essential role in PEDV infection during late entry events. Our observation may provide novel insights into PEDV infection and related pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Tight junctions are highly specialized membrane domains whose main function is to attach adjacent cells to each other, thereby forming intercellular seals. Here we investigate, for the first time, the role of the tight junction protein occludin in PEDV infection. We observed that PEDV infection induced the internalization of occludin. By using genetic modification methods, we demonstrate that occludin plays an essential role in PEDV infection. Moreover, PEDV entry and occludin internalization seem to be closely coupled. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of PEDV infection.","Luo, Xiaolei; Guo, Longjun; Zhang, Jian; Xu, Yunfei; Gu, Weihong; Feng, Li; Wang, Yue",Journal of virology,422,6

Among 144 fishers surveyed, 49% were aware of the nationwide ban. Shark fishers (24%) tended to be younger individuals who did not own a boat and perceived shark fishing to be prevalent. Compliant fishers were motivated by a fear of sharks and lack of capacity (equipment, knowledge), whereas food and income were cited as key motivations for non-compliance.

We find that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa endonuclease YbeY is required for rRNA processing and the bacterial virulence in a murine acute pneumonia model. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that knocking out the ybeY gene results in downregulation of oxidative stress response genes, including the catalase genes katA and katB Consistently, the ybeY mutant is more susceptible to H2O2 and neutrophil-mediated killing. Overexpression of katA restores the bacterial tolerance to H2O2 and neutrophil killing as well as virulence. We further find that the downregulation of the oxidative stress response genes is due to defective expression of the stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS. We demonstrate an autoregulatory mechanism of RpoS and find that ybeY mutation increases the level of a small RNA, ReaL, which directly represses the translation of rpoS through the 5' UTR of its mRNA and subsequently reduces the expression of the oxidative stress response genes. In vitro assays demonstrate direct degradation of ReaL by YbeY. Deletion of reaL or overexpression of rpoS in the ybeY mutant restores the bacterial tolerance to oxidative stress and the virulence. We also demonstrate that YbeZ binds to YbeY and is involved in the 16S rRNA processing and regulation of reaL and rpoS as well as the bacterial virulence. Overall, our results reveal pleiotropic roles of YbeY and the YbeY-mediated regulation of rpoS through ReaL.IMPORTANCE The increasing bacterial antibiotic resistance imposes a severe threat to human health. For the development of effective treatment and prevention strategies, it is critical to understand the mechanisms employed by bacteria to grow in the human body. Posttranscriptional regulation plays an important role in bacterial adaptation to environmental changes. RNases and small RNAs are key players in this regulation. In this study, we demonstrate critical roles of the RNase YbeY in the virulence of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa We further identify the small RNA ReaL as the direct target of YbeY and elucidate the YbeY-regulated pathway on the expression of bacterial virulence factors. Our results shed light on the complex regulatory network of P. aeruginosa and indicate that inference with the YbeY-mediated regulatory pathway might be a valid strategy for the development of a novel treatment strategy.","Xia, Yushan; Weng, Yuding; Xu, Congjuan; Wang, Dan; Pan, Xiaolei; Tian, Zhenyang; Xia, Bin; Li, Haozhou; Chen, Ronghao; Liu, Chang; Jin, Yongxin; Bai, Fang; Cheng, Zhihui; Kuipers, Oscar P; Wu, Weihui",mBio,422,1

The utility of SSDs has been well reviewed and they are viewed as a high tier assessment tool in environmental risk assessment and other disciplines. SSDs seek to improve upon probabilistic extrapolation of laboratory (and sometimes field) collected ecotoxicity data for environmental protection by modeling the diversity of multiple experimental results in the form of a single statistical distribution which reduces or eliminates the need for extrapolation with deterministic assessment factors. SSDs thus depend heavily on both statistical and biological knowledge. In this commentary we review recently published literature identifying areas of improvement based on fundamental statistical theory or application in environmental assessment contexts. We reveal that sound application of SSDs relies heavily upon a grasp of probability distributions, how asymmetric confidence intervals are derived for distributions common to SSDs, the influence of sample size on parameter estimation, and how these are collectively applied across the myriad of regulatory systems globally.

It provides healthcare professionals with evidence-based resources for: smoking cessation; fetal growth restriction; decreased fetal movements; maternal safe going-to-sleep position; and timing of birth for women with risk factors for stillbirth. AIMS To determine whether participants' reported knowledge and confidence in providing care designed to reduce stillbirth changed following completion of the module. To assess the module's suitability and acceptability, and participants' reported likelihood to change practice. MATERIALS AND METHODS In-built surveys undertaken pre- and post-eLearning module assessed participant knowledge and confidence, module suitability and acceptability, and likelihood of practice change using Likert items. Responses were dichotomised. Differences pre- and post-module were tested using McNemar's test and differences by profession were examined using descriptive statistics and Pearson's χ2 test. RESULTS Between 15 October 2019 and 2 November 2020, 5223 participants across Australia were included. Most were midwives (82.0%), followed by student midwives (4.6%) and obstetricians (3.3%). Reported knowledge and confidence improved in all areas (P < 0.001). Post-module 96.7-98.9% 'agreed' they had a sound level of knowledge and confidence across all elements of the SBB. Over 95% of participants agreed that the module was helpful and relevant, well organised, and easy to access and use. Eighty-eight percent reported they were likely to change some aspect of their clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS The SBB eLearning module is a valuable education program that is well-received and likely to result in improvements in practice.","Andrews, Christine; Meredith, Natasha; Seeho, Sean; Weller, Megan; Griffin, Alison; Ellwood, David; Middleton, Philippa; Jennings, Belinda; Flenady, Vicki",The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,422,8

Our aim was to assess the immediate effects of national lockdown orders due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on pediatric emergency room (ER) visits and respiratory tract infections in hospitals and nationwide in Finland. METHODS This register-based study used hospital patient information systems and the Finnish national infectious disease register. The participants were all patients visiting pediatric ER in 2 Finnish hospitals (Kuopio University Hospital, Mikkeli Central Hospital) covering 1/5th of the Finnish children population, 4 weeks before and 4 weeks after the start of the nationwide lockdown on March 16, 2020. Nationwide weekly numbers of influenza (A + B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children were assessed from the infectious disease register from 2015 to 2020. RESULTS A major decrease in the rate of daily median pediatric ER visits was detected in both hospitals in the study during the nationwide lockdown compared with the study period before the lockdown (Mikkeli, 19 vs. 7, P < 0.001; Kuopio, 9 vs. 2,5, P < 0.001). The influenza season was shorter (8 weeks from peak to no cases), and the weekly rate of new cases decreased faster compared with the previous 4 influenza seasons (previously 15-20 weeks from peak to no cases). A similar decrease was also seen in RSV cases. No pediatric cases of COVID-19 were found in participating hospitals during the study period. CONCLUSION These results strongly suggest that social distancing and other lockdown strategies are effective to slow down the spreading of common respiratory viral diseases and decreasing the need for hospitalization among children.","Kuitunen, Ilari; Artama, Miia; Mäkelä, Lotta; Backman, Katri; Heiskanen-Kosma, Tarja; Renko, Marjo",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,422,5

Significant impact of climate change is seen in the form of rise in temperature called as global warming. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the primary greenhouse gases (GHGs) mainly responsible for the global warming and climate change. These GHGs have drawn lot of attention due to their significant role in the global warming potential. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggested to stop global warming at 1.5oC above preindustrial levels as warming beyond this level might lead to heat extremes, alter insect and plant phenology (Phenological shifts) and more occurrence of vector borne diseases. Climate change is the topic of interest in all fields of life starting from social science and going to the applied science. Global climate cycles and world food production systems are under threat due to the recent climate extreme events. These events include heat waves and change in the rainfall patterns. Thus, risk reduction intervention in the form of mitigation and adaptation is required to minimize the impacts of climate change. Mitigation option includes understanding the present and future components of the climate system and interaction among them through coupled modeling system i.e. Global Circulation Model (GCM). Finally, global issue of climate change could be addressed by taking worldwide cooperation and action and adopting sustainable measures like use of alternative energy sources. The visible benefit on recovery of climate has been seen recently through global lockdown against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Ahmed, Mukhtar",The Science of the total environment,422,27

Evidence from several countries has shown that the prevalence of harmful alcohol use and alcohol-attributable hospitalisations and emergency department visits are higher in rural and remote communities than in urban centres. The extents of this rural-urban disparity in alcohol-related harm as well as the factors that mediate it are poorly understood. The objective of this scoping review is to synthesise the international research on the factors that influence the prevalence or risk of alcohol-related harm in rural and remote communities. This will help to clarify the conceptual landscape of rural and remote alcohol research and identify the gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This scoping review will access published literature through search strategies developed for Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL and Sociological Abstracts. There will be no date, country or language restrictions placed on the search. Title and abstract, followed by full-text screening, will be conducted by two independent reviewers to evaluate all identified articles against a set of prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data from selected articles will be extracted and compiled into a final manuscript that adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews checklist guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION The results of this review will be helpful in guiding future research on rural and remote alcohol use and alcohol-related harm, which will inform more effective, evidence-based public health strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm in rural and remote communities. The results will be disseminated via field-specific conference presentations and peer-reviewed publication.","Friesen, Erik Loewen; Kurdyak, Paul",BMJ open,422,16

Though various intubation devices have been demonstrated to perform well in oral endotracheal intubation, limited information is available concerning nasotracheal intubation (NTI) in patients with cervical spine immobilization. The present study compared the performance of the C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope with the McCoy laryngoscope for NTI in patients with simulated cervical spine injuries. METHODS This was a prospective, randomized, controlled, study done in a tertiary hospital. Ninety-five patients requiring NTI were included in data analysis: McCoy group (group M, n = 47) or C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope group (group C, n = 48). A Philadelphia neck collar was applied before anesthetic induction to immobilize the cervical spine. Single experienced anesthesiologist performed NTI. The primary outcome was duration of intubation divided by three steps: nose to oropharynx; oropharynx into glottic inlet; and glottic inlet to trachea. Secondary outcomes included glottic view as percentage of glottis opening (POGO) score and Cormack-Lehance (CL) grade, modified nasal intubation-difficulty scale (NIDS) rating, hemodynamic changes before and after intubation, and complications. RESULTS Total intubation duration was significantly shorter in group C (39.5 ± 11.4 s) compared to group M (48.1 ± 13.9 s). Group C required significantly less time for glottic visualization and endotracheal tube placement in the trachea. More patients in group C had CL grade I and higher POGO scores (P < 0.001, for both measures). No difficulty in NTI (modified NIDS = 0) was more in group C than group M. Hemodynamic changes and incidence of complications were comparable between groups. CONCLUSION The C-MAC D-Blade videolaryngoscope is an effective tool for NTI in a simulated difficult airway, which improves glottic visualization and shortens intubation time relative to those with McCoy laryngoscope.

Near-infrared spectroscopy is a noninvasive bedside technique used to monitor mixed regional oxygen saturation. We hypothesized that near-infrared spectroscopy could identify preterm infants at risk of mesenteric hypoperfusion associated with hemodynamically significant ductus arteriosus. METHODS This is a prospective observational study including consecutively admitted preterm infants with a gestational age <32 weeks. Mesenteric regional oxygenation was blindly monitored using an INVOS 5100 device. The presence of a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus was routinely confirmed by echocardiography/Doppler. Statistical analysis including Bland-Altman plots was performed to assess near-infrared spectroscopy intraobserver repeatability. RESULTS A total of 72 preterm infants were enrolled. The daily mean regional oxygen saturation for preterm infants was determined both in mesenteric and cerebral regions and plotted against time. We identified a differential temporary baseline. Hemodynamic significant ductus arteriosus was associated with lower blood pressures and lower regional splanchnic oxygenation. There was a significant relationship between reversal diastolic flow in the descending aorta and the regional oxygen saturation, which remained significant after controlling for ductal size and nil per os. CONCLUSIONS The simultaneous monitoring of splanchnic near-infrared spectroscopy and echocardiography could identify low mesenteric perfusion in the presence of hemodynamic ductus arteriosus.","Ledo, Ana; Aguar, Marta; Núñez-Ramiro, Antonio; Saénz, Pilar; Vento, Máximo",Neonatology,422,17

However, since 2000, different evidence has emerged regarding the efficacy of adjuvant chemoradiation, perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy, and postoperative chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric cancer. This review summarizes the background, current status, and future perspectives of adjuvant therapy for locally advanced gastric cancer. The Intergroup 0116 study was the first to show the significant overall survival benefits of adjuvant (chemoradiation) therapy for gastric cancer. The second study was the MAGIC trial, which showed the efficacy of perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Although the findings from the Intergroup 0116 study and the MAGIC trial were positive, recent studies, such as the ARTIST and EORTC 40954 studies, found no survival benefit for patients who had undergone D2 gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Regarding the adjuvant chemotherapy strategy, two pivotal phase III trials: the ACTS-GC and the CLASSIC, demonstrated the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy following D2 gastrectomy. However, more intensive chemotherapy is necessary to improve the survival rate. Several studies have analyzed the effectiveness of molecular-targeted therapy against metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction carcinoma. Further studies should focus on the survival benefit of more-intensive adjuvant therapy with D2 resection, or with concurrent molecular-targeted therapy.","Aoyama, Toru; Yoshikawa, Takaki",Surgery today,422,1

However, given the scarcity of data, the feasibility and safety of TAPP in strangulated hernia cases have not yet been determined. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated the data from a consecutive series of 33 patients who had undergone surgery for acute strangulated inguinal hernia associated with suspected visceral ischemic damage by either TAPP (TAPP group, n = 11) or conventional open hernioplasty via the anterior approach (anterior group, n = 22). RESULTS The TAPP group had a significant longer surgical duration than the anterior group (147 vs 84 min) and relatively less blood loss. Incision and enlargement of the hernial orifice, which enables easy reduction of the strangulated organ, was performed in the last 7 of 11 cases in the TAPP group. The morbidity was lower in the TAPP group, but the difference was not statistically significant (18% vs 23%). The TAPP group had a significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay than the anterior group (7 vs 10 days). CONCLUSION For surgeons with sufficient knowledge of the anatomy and expertise in reducing the strangulated organ, TAPP for strangulated inguinal hernia is at least comparable to open hernioplasty via the anterior approach in short-term outcomes.","Matsuda, Akihisa; Miyashita, Masao; Matsumoto, Satoshi; Sakurazawa, Nobuyuki; Kawano, Youichi; Kuriyama, Sho; Sekiguchi, Kumiko; Ando, Fumihiko; Matsutani, Takeshi; Uchida, Eiji",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,422,12

Longitudinal study with 12 months of follow-up (Analysis of Behaviors of Children During Growth [ABCD Growth Study]). Overall, 184 adolescents (age 15.6 ± 2.1) were classified according to sports participation: non-sport (control), low CRF sports, and high CRF sports. Metabolic outcomes were total cholesterol (TC) and its fractions, triacylglycerol (TG), glucose, insulin levels, and the insulin resistance index. Cardiovascular outcomes were arterial thickness (carotid and femoral [ultrasound]), blood pressure, and resting heart rate. Adolescents engaged in sports classified as high CRF demand presented a significant increase in HDL-c (1.2 mg/dL [95%CI: -0.5 to 3.0]) when compared to the non-sport group (-2.4 mg/dL [95%CI: -4.4 to -0.5]). Regular engagement in high CRF sports was significantly related to changes in TC (β = -0.027 [95%CI: -0.048 to -0.005]), HDL-c (β = 0.009 [95%CI: 0.001 to 0.019]), LDL-c (β = -0.032 [95%CI: -0.049 to -0.016]), and glucose (β = -0.017 [95%CI: -0.025 to -0.008]), while engagement in low CRF sports was related to changes in TG (β = -0.065 [95%CI: -0.112 to -0.019]). No significant relationships for cardiovascular parameters were observed in the low CRF group, but one significant relationship was found between high CRF sports and changes in SBP (β = -0.063 [95%CI: -0.117 to -0.009]). In conclusion, engagement in sports seems to be beneficial for improvements in metabolic and cardiovascular parameters in adolescents, mainly sports with higher CRF demand.","Cayres-Santos, Suziane Ungari; Urban, Jacqueline Bexiga; Barbosa, Maurício Fregonesi; Lemes, Italo Ribeiro; Kemper, Han C G; Fernandes, Romulo Araújo",American journal of human biology : the official journal of the Human Biology Council,422,1

Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) using the suprapubic approach for appendectomy, while keeping the advantages of SILS through an umbilical incision, leaves the visible abdomen without scars. Moreover, insertion of an additional port in patients with retrocecal or purulent or gangrenous acute appendicitis requiring intra-abdominal drainage is avoided. This report describes the initial experience with suprapubic SILS appendectomy. METHODS Between September 2009 and December 2010, patients with acute appendicitis admitted to the General Surgery and Emergency Unit of the authors' institution and who agreed to undergo SILS appendectomy through the suprapubic approach were included in a prospective study. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and surgical outcome were recorded. RESULTS A total of 20 patients (12 men and 8 women) with a mean age of 30 ± 3 years underwent suprapubic SILS appendectomy. The mean duration of the operation was 40 ± 7 min. Placement of a suction drain was necessary in four patients. The mean length of hospital stay was 2 ± 0.5 days. The operation was completed successfully in all patients, and conversion to either multiport or open surgery was not required. No intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred. In all patients, the appearance of the suprapubic wound was good at 7 days after surgery. CONCLUSION Suprapubic SILS appendectomy offers better, cosmetically appealing results than the standard umbilical access. In case of retrocecal or purulent or gangrenous acute appendicitis, the view provided via the suprapubic approach makes access to and dissection of the appendix easy, and it also enables exteriorization of a drain without adding new lateral incisions.","Vidal, Oscar; Ginestà, Cesar; Valentini, Mauro; Martí, Josep; Benarroch, Guerson; García-Valdecasas, Juan C",Surgical endoscopy,422,1

Common procedures.,10.171647,4.983671,2014,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES COVID-19 is highly infectious and the pandemic requires many adaptations to how we deliver medical care. Early in the pandemic, much of this focus was on hospital and emergency department care delivery models to ensure the safety of non-COVID-19 patients and health care workers. However, providing much needed outpatient assessments for COVID-19 patients during a pandemic is also fraught with challenges. From our review of the literature, best practices for a dedicated pandemic ambulatory outpatient clinic have not previously been described. We present a model for creating a dedicated ambulatory pandemic clinic at our institution for the acute care needs of COVID-19 patients. METHODS To address the current pandemic, the Mayo Acute Symptoms of COVID-19 Clinic was implemented on April 13, 2020, with the aims of providing a stand-alone location for COVID-19 patients to have acute outpatient evaluations as well as diagnostics. RESULTS Recognized challenges addressed included consideration of airflow recirculation patterns in standard medical office buildings, optimization of protocols to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE), limiting total exposure time during patient flow, and reducing surfaces and spaces that patients would physically contact. To this end, unique methods of patient scheduling, patient flow process, staff training, and PPE protocols were developed and are explained in detail in this article. CONCLUSION In the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as inevitably in future pandemics, outpatient medical facilities need to be prepared to care for nonhospitalized and nonemergent pandemic patients. We offer a practical approach that has been successful at our institution, with opportunity for local adaptation based on need and resources.","Kwon, Joshua; Hedges, Mary; Jackson, K Dawson; Keimig, Andrew; Francis, Dawn",Quality management in health care,422,16

Most epidemiological projections estimate that the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the infection will circulate in the next few years and raise enormous economic and social issues. COVID-19 has a dramatical impact on the health care systems and patient management, and is delaying or stopping breath research activities due to the risks of infection for the operators following contact with patients, potentially infected samples or contaminated equipment. In this scenario, we investigated whether virus inactivation procedures, based on a thermal treatment (60 °C for 1 hour) or storage of tubes at room temperature for 72 hours, could be used to implement the routine breath analysis workflow allowing to carry on this activity with an optimal level of safety during the pandemic. Tests were carried out using dry and humid gaseous samples containing about 100 representative chemicals found in exhaled breath and ambient air. Samples were collected into commercially available sorbent tubes, i.e. Tenax GR and a combination of Tenax TA, Carbograph 1TD and Carboxen 1003. Our results showed that all compounds were stable at room temperature up to 72 hours, whereas sample humidity was the key-factor affecting the stability of the compounds upon thermal treatment. Tenax GR-based sorbent tubes were less impacted by the thermal treatment, showing variations in the range 20-30% for most target analytes. A significant loss of aldehydes and sulphur compounds was observed using carbon molecular sieve-based tubes. In this case, a dry purge step before inactivation at 60 ° C significantly reduced the loss of the target analytes, whose variations were comparable to the method variability. Finally, a breath analysis workflow including a SARS-CoV-2 inactivation treatment is proposed.","Lomonaco, Tommaso; Salvo, Pietro; Ghimenti, Silvia; Biagini, Denise; Vivaldi, Federico; Bonini, Andrea; Fuoco, Roger; Di Francesco, Fabio",Journal of breath research,422,25

These viruses pose a significant threat to national security and safe and effective therapies are limited except in Argentina, where immune plasma is the standard of care for treating JUNV infection in cases of Argentine haemorrhagic fever. METHODS An in vitro screen of the Chemtura library identified several compounds with activity against Tacaribe virus (TCRV), a clade B arenavirus closely related to JUNV. Of these compounds, D746, a phenolic dibenzylsulfide, was further pursued for additional in vitro studies and evaluated in the AG129 mouse TCRV infection model. RESULTS D746 was found to act during an early to intermediate stage of the TCRV replication cycle and μM range activity was confirmed by virus yield reduction assays with both TCRV and JUNV. Although intraperitoneal twice daily treatment regimens were found to be highly effective when started 2 h prior to TCRV challenge in AG129 mice, post-exposure treatment initiated 3 days after infection was not efficacious. Interestingly, despite the pre-exposure treatment success, D746 did not reduce serum or tissue virus titres during the acute infection. Moreover, D746 elicited ascites fluid accumulation in mice during, as well as independent of, infection. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that D746 may be altering the host response to TCRV infection in AG129 mice in a way that limits pathogenesis and thereby protects mice from otherwise lethal infection in the absence of measurable reductions in viral burden.","Gowen, Brian B; Jung, Kie-Hoon; Sefing, Eric J; Wong, Min-Hui; Westover, Jonna B; Smee, Donald F",Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,422,31

We aimed to determine if prophylactic antibiotics could prevent post-ablation abscess in patients with a history of hepaticojejunostomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS This single-institution retrospective study identified 262 patients who underwent 307 percutaneous liver ablation sessions between January 2010 and August 2014. Twelve (4.6 %) patients with prior hepaticojejunostomy were included in this analysis. Ten (83> %) had received an aggressive prophylactic antibiotic regimen consisting of levofloxacin, metronidazole, neomycin, and erythromycin base. Two (16.6 %) had received other antibiotic regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed of 385 patients with 445 tumors measuring 3.0 cm or smaller treated with thermal ablation from 2000 through 2010. Two hundred fifty-six tumors in 222 patients were treated with RFA (mean [± SD] tumor size, 1.9 ± 0.5 cm), and 189 tumors in 163 patients were treated with cryoablation (mean tumor size, 2.3 ± 0.5 cm).

For biopsy-proven renal cell carcinoma, estimated local recurrence-free survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years after RFA were 100%, 98.1%, and 98.1%, respectively, compared with 97.3%, 90.6%, and 90.6%, respectively, after cryoablation (p = 0.09). Major complications occurred after 4.3% (10/232) of RFAs and 4.5% (8/176) of cryoablation procedures (p = 0.91). CONCLUSION RFA and cryoablation are both effective in the treatment of renal masses measuring 3 cm or smaller. Major complications with either procedure are infrequent.","Atwell, Thomas D; Schmit, Grant D; Boorjian, Stephen A; Mandrekar, Jay; Kurup, A Nicholas; Weisbrod, Adam J; Chow, George K; Leibovich, Bradley C; Callstrom, Matthew R; Patterson, David E; Lohse, Christine M; Thompson, R Houston",AJR.

However, few studies have focused on the leaves of Isatis indigotica. In this report, we isolated a series of four fractions (I-IV) from Folium isatidis and explored the antiviral activity of each tested extract. The extracts were active against a panel of RNA and DNA viruses in vitro, namely influenza A virus (IAV), coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus type 7 (Ad-7). Oral administration of 200 mg/kg/d of fraction III in mice exerted strong antiviral effects in viral replication, accompanied by prolonged survival rate, attenuated lung tissue damage as well as significant reductions in pulmonary virus titers and lung index. Our results provide the first biochemical evidence that Folium isatidis and its extracts could be used as potential antiviral agent in the postexposure prophylaxis for multiple viral infections.","Deng, You-Ping; Liu, Yuan-Yuan; Liu, Zhao; Li, Jin; Zhao, Ling-Min; Xiao, Hong; Ding, Xiao-Hua; Yang, Zhan-Qiu",The American journal of Chinese medicine,422,28

METHODS We searched PubMed and CENTRAL for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) (years 2000-2019, adult human subjects) of IV non-opioid analgesics (IV NSAIDs or IV Acetaminophen) used to treat acute pain after abdominal, hysterectomy, bunionectomy or orthopedic procedures. A Bayesian NMA was conducted in R to rank treatments based on the standardized mean differences in sum of pain intensity difference from baseline up to 24 h postoperatively (sum of pain intensity difference: SPID 24). The probability and the cumulative probability of rank for each treatment were calculated, and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) was applied to distinguish treatments on the basis of their outcomes such that higher SUCRA values indicate better outcomes. The study protocol was prospectively registered with by PROSPERO (CRD42019117360). RESULTS Out of 2313 screened studies, 27 studies with 36 comparative observations were included, producing a treatment network that included the four non-opioid IV pain medications of interest (MIV, ketorolac, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen). MIV was associated with the largest SPID 24 for all procedure categories and comparators. The SUCRA ranking table indicated that MIV had the highest probability for the most effective treatment for abdominal (89.5%), bunionectomy (100%), and hysterectomy (99.8%). MIV was associated with significantly less MME utilization versus all comparators for abdominal procedures, hysterectomy, and versus acetaminophen in orthopedic procedures. Elsewhere MME utilization outcomes for MIV were largely equivalent or nominally better than other comparators. Odds of ORADEs were significantly higher for all comparators vs MIV for orthopedic (gastrointestinal) and hysterectomy (respiratory). CONCLUSIONS MIV 30 mg may provide better pain reduction with similar or better safety compared to other approved IV non-opioid analgesics. Caution is warranted in interpreting these results as all comparisons involving MIV were indirect.","Carter, John A; Black, Libby K; Sharma, Dolly; Bhagnani, Tarun; Jahr, Jonathan S",BMC anesthesiology,422,24

In this study, a new ergonomic pistol handle concept, realized as a prototype, and two disposable ring handles were investigated according to ergonomic properties set by new European standards. METHODS In this study, 25 volunteers performed four practical tasks to evaluate the ergonomics of the handles used in standard operating procedures (e.g., measuring a suture and cutting to length, precise maneuvering and targeting, and dissection of a gallbladder). Moreover, 20 participants underwent electromyography (EMG) tests to measure the muscle strain they experienced while carrying out the basic functions (grasp, rotate, and maneuver) in the x, y, and z axes. The data measured included the number of errors, the time required for task completion, perception of pressure areas, and EMG data. The values for usability in the test were effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction. Surveys relating to the subjective rating were completed after each task for each of the three handles tested. RESULTS Each handle except the new prototype caused pressure areas and pain. Extreme differences in muscle strain could not be observed for any of the three handles. Experienced surgeons worked more quickly with the prototype when measuring and cutting a suture (approximately 20%) and during precise maneuvering and targeting (approximately 20%). On the other hand, they completed the dissection task faster with the handle manufactured by Ethicon. Fewer errors were made with the prototype in dissection of the gallbladder. In contrast to the handles available on the market, the prototype was always rated as positive by the volunteers in the subjective surveys. CONCLUSIONS None of the handles could fulfil all of the requirements with top scores. Each handle had its advantages and disadvantages. In contrast to the ring handles, the volunteers could fulfil most of the tasks more efficiently using the prototype handle without any remarkable pressure areas, cramps, or pain.","Büchel, D; Mårvik, R; Hallabrin, B; Matern, U",Surgical endoscopy,422,8

We evaluated the risk of COVID-19 among migrants from different areas of the world within the context of universal free access to medical care. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a population-based cohort analysis of the cumulative incidence of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 among adult residents of Alcorcon (Spain) in the first wave of the disease up to April 25, 2020. RESULTS The crude cumulative incidence among migrants (n = 20419) was higher than among Spaniards (n = 131599): 8.81 and 6.51 and per 1000 inhabitants, respectively (p < .001), but differed by region of origin. As per a negative binomial regression adjusted for age and sex, relative risk (RR) for COVID-19 for individuals from Europe, Asia, or North Africa was not significantly different from Spaniards. In contrast, a markedly increased risk was found in people from Sub-Saharan Africa (RR 3.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-9.41, p = .007), the Caribbean (RR 6.35, 95% CI 3.83-10.55, p < .001), and Latin America (RR 6.92, 95% CI 4.49-10.67, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS Migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America exhibited increased risk for COVID-19 as compared to Spaniards or migrants from Europe, North Africa, or Asia. Our data suggest ethnic background may play a role in risk for COVID-19. Migrants from some areas of the world may merit closer attention for both clinical and epidemiological reasons.","Guijarro, C; Pérez-Fernández, E; González-Piñeiro, B; Meléndez, V; Goyanes, M J; Renilla, M E; Casas, M L; Sastre, I; Velasco, M",Revista clinica espanola,422,16

DESCRIPTION Force transducers were developed, attached to a size 24 Physio ring, and implanted in the mitral annulus of an ovine animal. Ring suture forces were measured after implantation and for cardiac cycles reaching peak left ventricular pressures (LVP) of 100, 125, and 150 mm Hg. EVALUATION After implantation of the undersized ring to the flaccid annulus, the mean suture force was 2.0±0.6 N. During cyclic contraction, the anterior ring suture forces were greater than the posterior ring suture forces at peak LVPs of 100 mm Hg (4.9±2.0 N vs 2.1±1.1 N), 125 mm Hg (5.4±2.3 N vs 2.3±1.2 N), and 150 mm Hg (5.7±2.4 N vs 2.4±1.1 N). The largest force was 7.4 N at 150 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS The preliminary results demonstrate trends in annuloplasty suture forces and their variation with location and LVP. Future studies will significantly contribute to clinical knowledge by elucidating the mechanisms of ring dehiscence while improving annuloplasty ring design and surgical repair techniques.","Siefert, Andrew W; Pierce, Eric L; Lee, Madonna; Jensen, Morten Ø; Aoki, Chikashi; Takebayashi, Satoshi; Fernandez Esmerats, Joan; Gorman, Robert C; Gorman, Joseph H; Yoganathan, Ajit P",The Annals of thoracic surgery,422,24

Despite a downward trend performance of the Malaysian oil palm industry, particularly for the first half of 2020, the impact is less severe due to the encouraging palm oil export revenue through the National Economic Recovery Plan (PENJANA) which nurtures a notable increase in crude palm oil (CPO) price. In honouring the Malaysian pledge on forest conservation, land expansion for the oil palm cultivation remains stagnant over the years. The effort is now shifting towards enhancing the oil palm yield performance through new planting materials and good agricultural practices, coupled with systematic pest and disease management. Sustainability continues to be the key agenda of the oil palm industry, in moving forward to sustain the industry ecosystem. The industry is now open for innovative palm oil processes to comply with the dynamic and stringent food safety and quality standards and trade regulations. Owing to the distinction in food and feed applicability together with health prospects, translating the information into consumer-friendly language is becoming crucial for effective communication. Valorisation via the concept of 'waste to wealth' has compelled series of innovations in capitalising oil palm co-products for greener bioenergy and oleochemicals, and source of phytonutrients to generate higher earnings without having to heavily rely on palm oil trade as commodity.

We compared the impact of the Delta variant and non-Delta variant on the COVID-19 outcomes in patients from Yogyakarta and Central Java provinces, Indonesia. Methods: We ascertained 161 patients, 69 with the Delta variant and 92 with the non-Delta variant. The Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer was used to perform the whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2. Results: The mean age of patients with Delta and the non-Delta variant was 27.3 +/- 20.0 and 43.0 +/- 20.9 (p=3x10-6). The patients with Delta variant consisted of 23 males and 46 females, while the patients with the non-Delta variant involved 56 males and 36 females (p=0.001). The Ct value of the Delta variant (18.4 +/- 2.9) was significantly lower than the non-Delta variant (19.5 +/- 3.8) (p=0.043). There was no significant difference in the hospitalization and mortality of patients with Delta and non-Delta variants (p=0.80 and 0.29, respectively). None of the prognostic factors was associated with the hospitalization, except diabetes with an OR of 3.6 (95% CI=1.02-12.5; p=0.036). Moreover, the patients with the following factors have been associated with higher mortality rate than patients without the factors: age [≥]65 years, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease with the OR of 11 (95% CI=3.4-36; p=8x10-5), 27 (95% CI=6.1-118; p=1x10-5), 15.6 (95% CI=5.3-46; p=6x10-7), 12 (95% CI=4-35.3; p=1.2x10-5), and 6.8 (95% CI=2.1-22.1; p=0.003), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that age 65 years, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension were the strong prognostic factors for the mortality of COVID-19 patients with the OR of 3.6 (95% CI=0.58-21.9; p=0.028), 16.6 (95% CI=2.5-107.1; p=0.003), 5.5 (95% CI=1.3-23.7; p=0.021), and 5.8 (95% CI=1.02-32.8; p=0.047), respectively. Conclusions: We show that the patients infected by the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant have a lower Ct value than the patients infected by the non-Delta variant, implying that the Delta variant has a higher viral load, which might cause a more transmissible virus among humans. However, the Delta variant does not affect the COVID-19 outcomes in our patients. Our study also confirms the older age and comorbidity increase the mortality rate of COVID-19 patients.","Gunadi,; Hakim, M.

Because of threats to the domestic poultry industry and wild birds, screening for selected infectious agents has become routine since the early 1980s. One of the principal sources for Rio Grande wild turkeys (M. gallopavo intermedia) for translocation purposes was the Edwards Plateau of Texas (USA). Unfortunately, turkey abundance has declined in the southern Edwards Plateau since the late 1970s. Surprisingly few studies have addressed wild turkeys in this region, perhaps reflecting its status as the heart of Rio Grande turkey range. We surveyed 70 free-living Rio Grande wild turkeys from Bandera and Kerr counties, Texas, for evidence of exposure to Salmonella typhimurium, S. pullorum, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, M. meleagridis, M. synoviae, Chlamydophila psittaci, and the avian influenza, Newcastle disease, turkey corona, and reticuloendotheliosis viruses. Of these, 80% (56) were seropositive for both M. gallisepticum and M. synoviae on the serum plate antigen test. Ten of these individuals (14% of total) were positive for M. synoviae by hemagglutination inhibition testing. All other serologic tests were negative. Two adult females sampled in Kerr County, whose body mass was significantly less than that of other adult females trapped in the area, tested positive for reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) proviral DNA on polymerase chain reaction. Reticuloendotheliosis virus was isolated from one of these individuals. The pathogenesis, transmission, and/or population-level influences of M. gallisepticum, M. synoviae, and REV in Rio Grande wild turkeys deserves further study.","Peterson, Markus J; Aguirre, Raymond; Ferro, Pamela J; Jones, Dustin A; Lawyer, Tim A; Peterson, M Nils; Silvy, Nova J",Journal of wildlife diseases,422,19

Membrane permeability, as judged by influx of sodium ions, has previously been demonstrated to be an MHV E2 glycoprotein-mediated, cytopathic effect of MHV infection in L-2 cells. It is therefore likely that the selective effect of hygromycin B on viral protein synthesis is a reflection of an increased drug penetration into virus-infected cells. Using hygromycin B as a marker for MHV-induced cell membrane cytopathology, the effects of drug treatment on a persistent MHV infection in mouse LM-K fibroblasts were investigated. MHV persistence in LM-K cells, which normally involves a steady state infection of 0.1 to 1% of the cells in culture, was found to be cured by hygromycin B treatment, as measured by the elimination of infectious virus from the supernatant medium. Hygromycin B also resulted in the eradication of MHV-specific RNA from LM-K cells, arguing against the presence of a non-cytopathically or latently infected subpopulation of cells.","Macintyre, G; Wong, F; Anderson, R",The Journal of general virology,422,11

But there is more and more evidence that progenitors of a yet uncommitted stem cell population do not express this surrogate marker. The bone marrow and other sites of hematopoiesis consist also of fibroblast-like stromal cells, quiescent hematopoietic stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells. Depending on their stage of differentiation, CD34- stem cells cannot only generate hematopoietic progenitors, but also more specified mesenchymal precursors, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, myocytes, adipocyts, and others. The stromal cell compartment produces not only matrix proteins, such as collagens, fibronectin and others, but also the essential growth factors, which initiate and support the differentiation of primary quiescent, but eventually activated CD34- stem cells into CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors. In vivo studies have shown that long-term hematopoietic and mesenchymal reconstitution can be achieved with CD34- stem cell lines, isolated from various sources, although the frequency of CD34- stem cells seams to be quite low among the progenitor population. Some authors deny the reconstitution ability of CD34- cells. The majority of CD34- stem cells are quiescent fibroblast-like cells, which can be identified in the bone marrow biopsy as ""bone lining cells"". Some of those bone lining cells show protein synthesis and contain secretory vesicles. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is a surprising plasticity of the earliest stem cell population, consisting of cells with stromal cell function as well as hematopoietic and mesenchymal progenitors. The new insights into the biology of totipotent stem cells give us novel perspectives for cell- and gene therapy of various malignant and nonmalignant diseases and the possibility to replace defective organ functions with autologous CD34- stem cells.","Huss, R",Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,422,12

The MHV type 2 (MHV-2) strain of murine coronavirus differs from other strains in that it expresses an uncleaved spike and cannot induce cell-cell fusion at neutral pH values. We show here that while infection of the prototype MHV-A59 strain is not sensitive to pretreatment with lysosomotropic agents, MHV-2 replication is significantly inhibited by these agents. By use of an A59/MHV-2 chimeric virus, the susceptibility to lysosomotropic agents is mapped to the MHV-2 spike, suggesting a requirement of acidification of endosomes for MHV-2 spike-mediated entry. However, acidification is likely not a direct trigger for MHV-2 spike-mediated membrane fusion, as low-pH treatment is unable to overcome ammonium chloride inhibition, and it also cannot induce cell-cell fusion between MHV-2-infected cells. In contrast, trypsin treatment can both overcome ammonium chloride inhibition and promote cell-cell fusion. Inhibitors of the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L greatly reduce MHV-2 spike-mediated entry, while they have little effect on A59 entry, suggesting that there is a proteolytic step in MHV-2 entry. Finally, a recombinant virus expressing a cleaved MHV-2 spike has the ability to induce cell-cell fusion at neutral pH values and does not require low pH and endosomal cathepsins during infection. These studies demonstrate that endosomal proteolysis by cathepsins is necessary for MHV-2 spike-mediated entry; this is similar to the entry pathway recently described for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and indicates that coronaviruses may use multiple pathways for entry.","Qiu, Zhaozhu; Hingley, Susan T; Simmons, Graham; Yu, Christopher; Das Sarma, Jayasri; Bates, Paul; Weiss, Susan R",Journal of virology,422,28

The problems associated with post-translational modifications performed on recombinant proteins by P. pastoris are discussed, including the effects on bioactivity and function of these proteins, and some engineering strategies for minimizing unwanted glycosylations. We pay particular attention to the importance of optimizing the physicochemical environment for efficient and maximal recombinant protein production in bioreactors and the role of process control in optimizing protein production is reviewed. Finally, future aspects of the use of the P. pastoris expression system are discussed with regard to the production of complex membrane proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors, and the industrial and clinical importance of these proteins.","Macauley-Patrick, Sue; Fazenda, Mariana L; McNeil, Brian; Harvey, Linda M",Yeast,422,1

IPL at wavelengths range of 420 - 600nm with triple pulses was administered every two weeks for a total of 3 sessions. Assessment of acne severity and improvement of treatment was based on Global Acne Grading System (GAGS), scoring before and after treatment for each session and patient satisfaction's using a 5-item Likert scale range at the end of session three. RESULTS Of the 27 patients, 77.8% were female. Their ages group ranged from 18 to 35 years, and all patients had skin type III or IV. There were 14 mild acne patients and 13 moderate ones. There was a statistically significant improvement in mean acne severity score from 18.1± 4.3 at baseline to 14.3 ± 4.6 after two weeks post-IPL and 12.3 ± 4.9 after four weeks post-IPL. The result on satisfaction level of patients showed 'satisfied' in 3 patients, ""very satisfied"" in 5 patients; and, half of the patients (11) answered ""fair"" at the end of the study. Most patients tolerated well the procedure, and only 5 patients developed either post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or skin hyperpigmentation. CONCLUSION The IPL of wavelength of 400-600nm offers effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment of mild to moderate acne lesions in Malaysians with skin types III-IV. The majority of subjects had a fair score on treatment satisfaction. It is recommended that reasonable expectations for clinical results be addressed with patients before hands to prevent over-expectation.","Adibah, H I; Chin, S C; Ng, L T; Simerdip, K; Sarabdeep, S; Saruveish, M; Hatah, E",The Medical journal of Malaysia,422,1

Due to the hand's complex structures located in a small area, surgeons must evaluate constantly the balance of inadequate surgery against functional and cosmetic aspects. Thus, a multidisciplinary approach is recommended for a correct diagnosis and treatment design. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2006 and 2017, 354 consecutive patients with basal and squamous cell carcinomas, and melanoma of the hand were retrospectively analysed at the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at the University of Palermo, treatment was surgical for all of them; also radio- and chemotherapy were necessary based on the histological diagnosis. RESULTS The most common tumour was basal cell carcinoma (BCCs), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (SCCs). Melanoma was the most frequent lesion diagnosed in the digits. Radical excision was the main treatment of choice. In 29 cases (11 with SCC, 18 with melanoma) axillary lymphadenectomy was performed, because of lymph nodes metastases. In the follow up, the spread of cancer to distant organs caused the death in three cases. Recurrence rate was higher in case of infiltrative SCCs and BCCs. CONCLUSIONS The major references provide only limited information on malignant soft-tissue tumours of the hand. Our retrospective study aims to present the most commonly observed malignant soft-tissue tumours of the hand, analysing their causes, their objective and instrumental evaluation, and their treatments.","Tripoli, M; Franza, M; Cordova, A",Acta chirurgiae plasticae,422,20

Peptide 41-60 of Blg (Blg41-60) was described as a murine T-cell determinant and a murine, rat, and human immunoglobulin E (IgE) epitope. The aim of this study was the expression of Blg41-60 as a fusion protein in the food-grade bacterium Lactococcus lactis and the characterization of its immunogenicity in mice. We constructed a recombinant strain of L. lactis capable of inducible production and secretion of Blg41-60::Nuc, a fusion protein between Blg41-60 and the mature part of the staphylococcal nuclease (Nuc). The highest production yield of Blg41-60::Nuc (32.5 mg/liter) was reached 4 h after induction. At this time, up to 75% of Blg41-60::Nuc was secreted. When monoclonal antibodies specific for Blg41-60 were used, purified Blg41-60::Nuc and synthetic Blg41-60 exhibited very similar immunoreactivities. Subcutaneous coadministration of purified Blg41-60::Nuc and killed nonrecombinant L. lactis resulted in the induction of specific anti-Blg41-60 IgG2a and IgG1. The IgG1/IgG2a ratio and the lack of specific IgE suggest a Th1-type immune response, i.e., a nonallergic response. Similar administrations of the killed Blg41-60::Nuc-producing L. lactis strain did not elicit a specific immune response, whereas a transitory mucosal IgA-specific immune response was induced in mice after oral administration of the live Blg41-60::Nuc-producing L. lactis strain.","Chatel, Jean-Marc; Nouaille, Sebastien; Adel-Patient, Karine; Le Loir, Yves; Boe, Herman; Gruss, Alexandra; Wal, Jean-Michel; Langella, Philippe",Applied and environmental microbiology,422,24

However, it remained unclear how effectively measures reduced the spread of the virus. We examined how the effective-contact rate (ECR), the mean number of daily contacts for an infectious individual to transmit the virus, among European citizens evolved during this wave over the period with implemented measures, disregarding a priori information on governmental measures. METHODS: We developed a data-oriented approach that is based on an extended Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. Using the available data on the confirmed numbers of infections and hospitalizations, we first estimated the daily total number of infectious-, exposed- and susceptible individuals and subsequently estimated the ECR with an iterative Poisson regression model. We then compared change points in the daily ECRs to the moments of the governmental measures. RESULTS: The change points in the daily ECRs were found to align with the implementation of governmental interventions. At the end of the considered time-window, we found similar ECRs for Italy (0.29), Spain (0.24), and Germany (0.27), while the ECR in the Netherlands (0.34), Belgium (0.35) and the UK (0.37) were somewhat higher. The highest ECR was found for Sweden (0.45). CONCLUSIONS: There seemed to be an immediate effect of banning events and closing schools, typically among the first measures taken by the governments. The effect of additionally closing bars and restaurants seemed limited. For most countries a somewhat delayed effect of the full lockdown was observed, and the ECR after a full lockdown was not necessarily lower than an ECR after (only) a gathering ban.","Post, Richard A J; Regis, Marta; Zhan, Zhuozhao; van den Heuvel, Edwin R",BMC Public Health,422,20

Materials and Methods: A nationwide cohort of confirmed COVID-19 (n=8,070) between January 1, 2020, and May 30, 2020, and a 1:15 age-, sex-, and residence-matched cohort (n=121,050) were constructed. A nested case-control study to compare the proportion of patients with lung cancer between the COVID-19 cohort and the matched cohort. Results: The proportion of patients with lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort (0.5% [37/8,070]) than in the matched cohort (0.3% [325/121,050]) (p=0.002). The adjusted odds ratio [OR] of having lung cancer was significantly higher in the COVID-19 cohort than in the matched cohort (adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-2.10).

Research inclusive of women and those not using VHA care is critical to understanding mental health and suicide risk among justice-involved veterans. This study examined whether lifetime justice involvement was associated with symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, recent suicidal ideation, and lifetime suicide attempt. METHOD: We conducted a secondary analysis of 812 post-9/11 male and female veterans. The sample included veterans eligible and not eligible for VHA care. Participants were administered the PTSD Checklist for DSM-IV, the Patient Health Questionnaire-8, and the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Additional questions assessed justice involvement, military characteristics, demographics, and recent use of VHA mental health care. RESULTS: History of justice involvement was associated with more severe PTSD and depression symptoms as well as suicidal ideation and suicide attempt. Associations were maintained after adjusting for sex, combat exposure, service branch, recent use of VHA mental health care, and education. Sex-stratified exploratory analyses revealed consistent findings among males; justice involvement was associated with suicide attempt among females. Current probation or parole was particularly related to depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempt. CONCLUSIONS: Justice-involved veterans appear to be a vulnerable population experiencing heightened psychiatric symptoms and increased risk for recent suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempt. Programs within VHA and the community are important for connecting justice-involved veterans to mental health services and mitigating suicide risk.

The pandemic is expanding rapidly which makes the global availability and equitable access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines critical. Strategies put in place include the establishment of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) within which the COVAX facility aims to distribute 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2021, with procurement mechanisms already being established. At the same time, regulatory authorities have emergency use authorizations aimed at the rapid approval of safe and effective vaccines, with a push for harmonization in regulatory approaches being advocated. The Meeting was also apprised of other innovations being developed for vaccines including multi-array patches for easier vaccine application, increased heat stability for mitigating cold chain and storage challenges, the barcoding of primary packaging for enhancing vaccine traceability, and gathering data for decision-making. Over time, these innovations will facilitate the widespread availability and equitable access of vaccines including those addressing epidemics and pandemics.

Further analysis indicated that ORF6 provided potent in trans stimulation of the viral replication. Some viral variations, such as 5'UTR-C241T and ORF8-(T28144C) L84S mutation, also exhibit their different impact upon viral replication. Besides, the screening of clinically used drugs identified that several tyrosine kinase inhibitors and DNA-Top II inhibitors potently inhibit the replicon, as well as authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses.

Grissom. Return to high altitude after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019. High Alt Med Biol. 00:000-000, 2021.-With the increasing availability of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines and the eventual decline in the burden of the disease, it is anticipated that all forms of tourism, including travel to high altitude, will rebound in the near future. Given the physiologic challenges posed by hypobaric hypoxia at high altitude, it is useful to consider whether high-altitude travel will pose risks to those previously infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, particularly those with persistent symptoms after resolution of their infection. Although no studies have specifically examined this question as of yet, available data on the cardiopulmonary sequelae of COVID-19 provide some sense of the problems people may face at high altitude and who warrants evaluation before such endeavors. On average, most individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 have normal or near normal gas exchange, pulmonary function testing, cardiovascular function, and exercise capacity, although a subset of individuals have persistent functional deficits in some or all of these domains when examined up to 5 months after infection. Evaluation is warranted before planned high-altitude travel in individuals with persistent symptoms at least 2 weeks after a positive test or hospital discharge as well as in those who required care in an intensive care unit or suffered from myocarditis or arterial or venous thromboembolism. Depending on the results of this testing, planned high-altitude travel may need to be modified or even deferred pending resolution of the identified abnormalities. As more people travel to high altitude after the pandemic and further studies are conducted, additional data should become available to provide further guidance on these issues.","Luks, Andrew M; Grissom, Colin K",High altitude medicine &amp; biology (Online),422,1

Inhibition of the interaction between DC-SIGN and viral glycoproteins has the potential to generate broad spectrum antiviral agents. Here, we demonstrate that mannose-functionalized poly- l -lysine glycoconjugates efficiently inhibit the attachment of viral glycoproteins to DC-SIGN-presenting cells with picomolar affinity. Treatment of these cells leads to prolonged receptor internalization and inhibition of virus binding for up to 6 h. Furthermore, the polymers are fully bio-compatible and readily cleared by target cells.

Retirement, widowhood, and increased prevalence of chronic diseases in this age group lead to a decline in social relationships, which in turn has adverse consequences on health and well-being. The coronavirus COVID-19 crisis worsened this situation, raising interest for mobile telepresence robots (MTR) that would help create, maintain, and strengthen social relationships. MTR are tools equipped with a camera, monitor, microphone, and speaker, with a body on wheels that allows for remote-controlled and sometimes autonomous movement aiming to provide easy access to assistance and networking services. We conducted a narrative review of literature describing experimental studies of MTR involving elderly people over the last 20 years, including during the COVID-19 period. The aim of this review was to examine whether MTR use was beneficial for reducing loneliness and social isolation among older adults at home and in health and care institutions and to examine the current benefits and barriers to their use and implementation. We screened 1754 references and included 24 research papers focusing on the usability, acceptability, and effectiveness of MTR. News reports on MTR use during the COVID-19 period were also examined. A qualitative, multidimensional analysis methodology inspired by a health technology assessment model was used to identify facilitating and limiting factors and investigate if and how MTR could reduce social isolation in elderly people. Reviewed studies provide encouraging evidence that MTR have potential in this regard, as experiments report positive feedback on MTR design and core functionalities. However, our analysis also points to specific technical, ergonomic, and ethical challenges that remain to be solved, highlighting the need for further multidimensional research on the design and impact of MTR interventions for older adults and building on new insights gained during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Isabet, Baptiste; Pino, Maribel; Lewis, Manon; Benveniste, Samuel; Rigaud, Anne-Sophie",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),422,16

Emerging literature reveals that fear of acquiring COVID-19 has detrimental psychological ramifications. However, it seems likely that social distancing will have a further negative impact on well-being. The focus of this study was therefore to investigate whether changes in behaviour as a result of social distancing would predict changes in well-being. Participants (n = 95) rated their level of well-being as it was both during social distancing and retrospectively one month before beginning social distancing. Participants also indicated how much time they spent engaged in various activities both during social distancing and one month before social distancing and nominated how important each of these activities was for them. These measures employed scales created specifically for the present study. In addition, participants completed the Big Five Inventory-2 Extra-Short Form and the nine-item version of the Personal Optimism and Self-Efficacy Optimism Scale. We found that affectivity-both positive and negative-decreased with increased engagement in meaningful activities and that affectivity increased with increased activity in general.

Deprescribing has been promoted to reduce polypharmacy. It remains however unclear whether deprescribing during hospital stay can reduce the readmission risk. Objective We sought to determine whether deprescribing in geriatric inpatients was associated with a lower readmission risk at three months post-discharge. Method A case control study was performed, using data from a prospective, controlled study in geriatric inpatients. Deprescribing was defined as the percentage of discontinued preadmission medications and was assessed upon discharge. A logistic regression analysis was used to determine the odds ratio for deprescribing and the outcome of readmissions. An adjusted odds ratio was then estimated, taking into account age, sex, mortality, the number of preadmission medications and the Charlson Comorbidity Index. Results Data of 166 patients were analysed, of whom 61 had experienced at least one readmission. Adjusting for age, number of preadmission medications and mortality resulted in the most informative regression model, based on the lowest Akaike information criterion (adjusted odds ratio 0.981, 95% confidence interval 0.964 to 0.998).

In theory, this method substantially improves the false positive rate and positive predictive value as well. We also conducted a Monte Carlo simulation to verify this theory. Our simulation results show that our method significantly reduces the false negative rate. More accurate assessment can be made if the dilution effect or other practical factors are taken into consideration.

A previous study demonstrated a high sensitivity of a phocid, the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina), in discriminating time intervals. In the present study, we compared the harbour seal's timing abilities with the timing abilities of an otariid, the South African fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus). This comparison seemed essential as phocids and otariids differ in many respects and might, thus, also differ regarding their timing abilities. We determined time difference thresholds for sub- and suprasecond time intervals marked by a white circle on a black background displayed for a specific time interval on a monitor using a staircase method. Contrary to our expectation, the timing abilities of the fur seal and the harbour seal were comparable. Over a broad range of time intervals, 0.8-7 s in the fur seal and 0.8-30 s in the harbour seal, the difference thresholds followed Weber's law. In this range, both animals could discriminate time intervals differing only by 12 % and 14 % on average. Timing might, thus be a fundamental cue for pinnipeds in general to be used in various contexts, thereby complementing information provided by classical sensory systems. Future studies will help to clarify if timing is indeed involved in foraging decisions or the estimation of travel speed or distance.","Heinrich, Tamara; Ravignani, Andrea; Hanke, Frederike D",Anim. cogn,422,1

METHODS: In this retrospective IRB approved HIPPA compliant study, 51 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with abdominopelvic CT were included. Patients were stratified based on disease severity as outpatient (no hospital admission) and patients who were hospitalized. Subset of hospitalized patient required mechanical ventilation (MV). A radiologist blinded to the clinical outcome evaluated single axial slice on CT at L3 vertebral body for VAT(L3), SAT(L3), TAT(L3), and VAT/TAT(L3). These measures along with age, gender, and BMI were compared. A clinical model that included age, sex, and BMI was compared to clinical + CT model that also included VAT(L3) to discriminate hospitalized patients from outpatients. RESULTS: There were ten outpatients and 41 hospitalized patients. 11 hospitalized patients required MV. There were no significant differences in age and BMI between the hospitalized and outpatients (all p > 0.05). There was significantly higher VAT(L3) and VAT/TAT(L3) in hospitalized patients compared to the outpatients (all p < 0.05).

However, the effectiveness remains unclear. Here, we performed a randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy and safety of sequential MV in the treatment of tuberculosis with respiratory failure. METHODS: Forty-four tuberculosis patients diagnosed with respiratory failure were randomly divided into sequential MV group (n = 24) and conventional MV group (n = 20). Initially, the patients in both groups received invasive positive pressure ventilation. When the patients' conditions were relieved, the ventilation modality in sequential MV group was switched to oronasal face mask continuous positive airway pressure until weaning. RESULTS: After treatment, the patients in sequential MV group had similar respiratory rate, heart rate, oxygenation index, alveolo-arterial oxygen partial pressure difference (A-aDO(2)), blood pH, PaCO(2) to those in conventional MV group (all P value > 0.05). There was no significant difference in ventilation time and ICU stay between the two groups (P > 0.05), but sequential MV group significantly reduced the time of invasive ventilation (mean difference (MD): − 36.2 h, 95% confidence interval (CI) − 53.6, − 18.8 h, P < 0.001). Sequential MV group also reduced the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; relative risk (RR): 0.44, 95% CI 0.24, 0.83, P = 0.006) and atelectasis (RR:0.49, 95% CI 0.24,1.00, P = 0.040).

However, how and to what extent the daily involvement of trainees in clinical and surgical activities was compromised by the COVID-19 pandemic is currently unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted an electronic survey. An invitation was sent through the executive training administration of the Saudi Commission for Health Specialties (SCFHS) randomly to 400 residents and fellows over two weeks period from April 23, 2020 until May 6, 2020. Descriptive statistics were presented using counts and proportions (%). The comparison between the trainees among the socio-demographic and the characteristics of trainees toward the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on their training had been conducted using the Chi-square test. A p-value cut off point of 0.05 at 95% Confidence Interval (CI) used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Out of the 400 questionnaires distributed, 240 trainees responded, resulting in a response rate of 60%. The most frequently cited specialty was surgical (41.3%) and medical (38.3%). Approximately 43% of them had direct contact with patients with COVID-19, and 43.8% had enough training regarding the proper use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). There were seven responders (2.9%) who had been infected by the disease. Among them, 6 (2.5%) members of their family had also been infected. Approximately 84.6% reported a reduction in training activities due to the current pandemic.

Key conditions impacting on the CNS,10.152051,5.084135,2009-05-31,"Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination elicit potent immune responses. A number of studies have described immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, beyond antibody production, immune responses to COVID-19 vaccines remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we performed multimodal single-cell sequencing on peripheral blood of patients with acute COVID- 19 and healthy volunteers before and after receiving the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to compare the immune responses elicited by the virus and by this vaccine. Phenotypic and transcriptional profiling of immune cells, coupled with reconstruction of the B and T cell antigen receptor rearrangement of individual lymphocytes, enabled us to characterize and compare the host responses to the virus and to defined viral antigens. While both infection and vaccination induced robust innate and adaptive immune responses, our analysis revealed significant qualitative differences between the two types of immune challenges. In COVID-19 patients, immune responses were characterized by a highly augmented interferon response which was largely absent in vaccine recipients. Increased interferon signaling likely contributed to the observed dramatic upregulation of cytotoxic genes in the peripheral T cells and innate-like lymphocytes in patients but not in immunized subjects. Analysis of B and T cell receptor repertoires revealed that while the majority of clonal B and T cells in COVID-19 patients were effector cells, in vaccine recipients clonally expanded cells were primarily circulating memory cells. Importantly, the divergence in immune subsets engaged, the transcriptional differences in key immune populations, and the differences in maturation of adaptive immune cells revealed by our analysis have far-ranging implications for immunity to this novel pathogen.","Ivanova, E.

The results were communicated to the practitioner in charge as soon as they became available. Clinical and biological data were gathered and analyzed. FINDINGS: Results from the FilmArray Respiratory Panel do not appear to impact admission or antibiotic prescription, with the exception of a lower admission rate for children who tested positive for influenza B. Parameters that account for the clinical decisions evaluated are CRP level, white blood cell count, suspected or proven bacterial infection and, for adult patients only, signs of respiratory distress. Length of stay is also not significantly different between patients with a positive and a negative result.

Patient subgroups for which CS could be more beneficial also need appraisal. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of early CS in COVID-19 pneumonia patients admitted to the ICU on the occurrence of 60-day mortality, ICU-acquired-bloodstream infections(ICU-BSI), and hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia(HAP-VAP). METHODS: We included patients with COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to 11 ICUs belonging to the French OutcomeRea(TM) network from January to May 2020. We used survival models with ponderation with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). RESULTS: The study population comprised 303 patients having a median age of 61.6 (53–70) years of whom 78.8% were male and 58.6% had at least one comorbidity. The median SAPS II was 33 (25–44). Invasive mechanical ventilation was required in 34.8% of the patients. Sixty-six (21.8%) patients were in the Early-C subgroup. Overall, 60-day mortality was 29.4%. The risks of 60-day mortality ((IPTW)HR = 0.86;95% CI 0.54 to 1.35, p = 0.51), ICU-BSI and HAP-VAP were similar in the two groups. Importantly, early CS treatment was associated with a lower mortality rate in patients aged 60 years or more ((IPTW)HR, 0.53;95% CI, 0.3–0.93; p = 0.03). In contrast, CS was associated with an increased risk of death in patients younger than 60 years without inflammation on admission ((IPTW)HR = 5.01;95% CI, 1.05, 23.88; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: For patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, early CS treatment was not associated with patient survival. Interestingly, inflammation and age can significantly influence the effect of CS.","Dupuis, Claire; de Montmollin, Etienne; Buetti, Niccolò; Goldgran-Toledano, Dany; Reignier, Jean; Schwebel, Carole; Domitile, Julien; Neuville, Mathilde; Ursino, Moreno; Siami, Shidasp; Ruckly, Stéphane; Alberti, Corinne; Mourvillier, Bruno; Bailly, Sebastien; Laurent, Virginie; Gainnier, Marc; Souweine, Bertrand; Timsit, Jean-François",PLoS One,422,1

A change in the pattern of laboratory test results in COVID-19 patients over this time has not been reported or correlated with patient outcome. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of routine laboratory and SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results from 5,785 patients evaluated in a NYC hospital emergency department from March to June employing machine learning analysis. Results: A COVID-19 high-risk laboratory test result profile (COVID19-HRP), consisting of 21 routine blood tests, was identified to characterize the SARS-CoV-2 patients. Approximately half of the SARS-CoV-2 positive patients had the distinct COVID19-HRP that separated them from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients. SARS-CoV-2 patients with the COVID19-HRP had higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, determined by cycle-threshold values from the RT-PCR, and poorer clinical outcome compared to other positive patients without COVID19-HRP. Furthermore, the percentage of SARS-CoV-2 patients with the COVID19-HRP has significantly decreased from March/April to May/June. Notably, viral load in the SARS-CoV-2 patients declined and their laboratory profile became less distinguishable from SARS-CoV-2 negative patients in the later phase. Conclusions: Our study visualized the down-trending of the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 patients with the distinct COVID19-HRP. This analysis could become an important tool in COVID-19 population disease severity tracking and prediction. In addition, this analysis may play an important role in prioritizing high-risk patients, assisting in patient triaging and optimizing the usage of resources.","Yang, H.

Due to high transmission levels, many governments implemented social-distancing measures and confinement with different levels of required compliance to mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic. In several countries, these measures were effective, and it was possible to flatten the epidemic curve and control it. In others, this objective was not or has not been achieved. In far to many cities around the world rebounds of the epidemic are occurring or, in others, plateau-like states have appeared where high incidence rates remain constant for relatively long periods of time. Nonetheless, faced with the challenge of urgent social need to reactivate their economies, many countries have decided to lift mitigation measures at times of high incidence. In this paper, we use a mathematical model to characterize the impact of short duration transmission events within the confinement period previous but close to the epidemic peak. The model describes too, the possible consequences on the disease dynamics after mitigation measures are lifted. We use Mexico City as a case study. The results show that events of high mobility may produce either a later higher peak, a long plateau with relatively constant but high incidence or the same peak as in the original baseline epidemic curve, but with a post-peak interval of slower decay. Finally, we also show the importance of carefully timing the lifting of mitigation measures. If this occurs during a period of high incidence, then the disease transmission will rapidly increase, unless the effective contact rate keeps decreasing, which will be very difficult to achieve once the population is released.","Santana-Cibrian, M.; Acuna-Zegarra, M.

Then the generalization of the first-order differential system to epidemic models with more subpopulations is focused on by introducing the inter-subpopulations dynamics couplings and the control interventions information through the mentioned time-varying coefficient which drives the basic differential equation model. It is considered a relevant tool the control intervention of the infection along its transient to fight more efficiently against a potential initial exploding transmission. The study is based on the fact that the disease-free and endemic equilibrium points and their stability properties depend on the concrete parameterization while they admit a certain design monitoring by the choice of the control and treatment gains and the use of feedback information in the corresponding control interventions. Therefore, special attention is paid to the evolution transients of the infection curve, rather than to the equilibrium points, in terms of the time instants of its first relative maximum towards its previous inflection time instant. Such relevant time instants are evaluated via the calculation of an “ad hoc” Shannon’s entropy. Analytical and numerical examples are included in the study in order to evaluate the study and its conclusions.","De la Sen, Manuel; Nistal, Raul; Ibeas, Asier; Garrido, Aitor J.",Entropy (Basel),422,5
